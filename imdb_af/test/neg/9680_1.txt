I think Hollywood should seriously consider never again doing a "Biblical" movie if Noah's Ark is going to be the norm. Apart from the horrible, totally uninspiring of the entire cast (Voight and Steenburgen is undoubtedly the day the movie was closed), the timeline is completely rearranged. I also missed the section in Genesis about the pirate battle on the deck of the ark or the travel seller coming on his rowing boat. Hello? Everyone else was dead except for Noah and his family according to Scripture. God tapped wood and added plans to build the ark when Noah questioned how? I also don't remember anything about Noah's wife who kept him busy during the 40 days, or turned Noah through the glossy eyes and dazed all the time. The scripture writer obviously had very little knowledge of the book of Genesis, or just didn't act that his abomination of a story had totally mocked it.
