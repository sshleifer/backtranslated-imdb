With Al Jolson aware of his popularity and Warner Brothers' Jazz Singer, the highest gross movie of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would eliminate some vehicles for their own Jolson-esquire characters. But while the Jazz singer was a sensation to be his first party, the Matinee Idol misses the singing voice of his star (the now dark Johnnie Walker) and has to do only with his visual performances. <br /> <br /> The Matinee Idol was an early directorship for the famous Frank Capra. Capra's first few full features for Harry Langdon reveal a very exhilarating, over-styled style that made Langdon's already mediocre slapstick almost unshakable. A few pictures later and Capra learned to relieve a bit, with a fairly regular and decent camera work. However, he still shows no ability to shoot physical comedy. The longest comic routine - the stage show - looks like it's some good gags, but it's all cut into many different angles. There is no chance that the comedy will flow from the performances. Theoretically, a good deal of the jokes in the subtitles, but there are too many of these and none of them are particularly funny. <br /> <br /> Of course, Capra will eventually be in a fine dramatic and romantic decay director, and you can see him developing in this regard. He cuts the line, joins Walker and Bessie's love in the scene where she first gets up in his Don Wilson, stands up and neatly establishes the wordless relationship between them. Then there is a beautiful and soft look of the couple in their scene gathered at the masquerade, all reminiscent of the love shows in Capra's early 30's. <br /> <br /> Johnnie Walker, Columbia's answer to Al Jolson, is not an exceptional talent. His comic timing is good, but there's nothing to stick him out. Bessie Love on the other hand is also a very good actress, with a very expressive face. Kudos told her to get involved in the physical comedy and lose her dignity with the boys. There is also a good role for Lionel Belmore, the round and jolly character actor, who looks in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s. <br /> <br /> The Matinee Idol is one of the photos that has gained more than its fair share of attention, thanks to its director, who later made a handful of masterpieces. In and of course, this is a very uninteresting piece, and, like most of Capra's work before meeting Robert Riskin, a disappointment.
