The 80's were the best of times and the worst time for James Karin. He died in one of the best cult horror comedies with 'Return of the Living Dead' and a year later he performed on this piece .... bad movie. A follow-up of Hardbodies (but not really) has a group of pretty unpleasant characters trying to make a movie in Greece. Through design or sheer laziness, the line between the film and the "movie within a movie" is not only vague, but not quite from scene to scene (which would be confusing if I was just interested in anything in the movie. Grandma Candy: Nana, Fabiana Udenio, and many extras are topless, Brenda Bakke shows a few T & A's. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Just trailers for Hardstocks, American High School, Strike, Virgin Territory (come in a dual-function DVD with the first film for the masochistic)
