Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb's homosexual relationship - a facet of the thing that (mostly unfairly) has been ignored since their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But even in the treatment of this Swoon it is by far. Worse, it turns, combines, and straightens out the details of the thing that someone who knows a lot about it, while at the same time managing what confuses those who aren't familiar with it. While it's an interesting movie, Swoon stinks. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 - terrible.
