People seem to be attracted to show that pathetic lives that have no purpose are what-so-ever. For me, I pay my heartfelt attention to NBC for their serious efforts to make new television changes, to listen to free shows. They always look great success, like The Office. When I first started watching, it seemed to me that it would be possible to hit a smash hit. But after a few episodes, I really felt like going to church and donating every penny in my entire bank to pathetic people displayed in these low, poor and shameful areas. And the end where they see Earl and the brother in bed just seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life, like street bettors or people struggling to pay the rent and have no sense of what the real world of normal people in society are like. I always look disgusting when I see the filth where people live in this show. It's like Venice Beach in California, beautiful but so much hobos. Believe me I'm not a rich man, middle class, and not a clean freak, or a little messy, but it just seems to me that the show just can't look like all the gruesome, schmuck people out there what a bone. I just wish they would show a little more class, not all the dirt and weakness and trailers and just below the average life, it just seems crowded. For me, this show is nothing more than a showcase of what should not be in life, not to be. It also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have, as it is clear that these two do not have a gram of smarts. This is a schmuck u-mentary.
