This movie was so bad. It wasn't funny at all. Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. O man, bad, so bad. Thumbs off. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Some Kind of Wonderful, Soul Man, and probably one or two. Chris Kattan is at his worst as the high school consultant who is a talented dancer who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. He has a jealous friend who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer Chris eyes. I thought the acting was really bad. I like aloud comedies, it wasn't one. "Not another teen movie" was not funny, but it has much more funny scenes than absolutely awesome. "Scary Movie" is suuuper funny. I always laugh when I look at that, nice. This movie, not funny.
