Perhaps here in Sydney we are all on the side, and as a result we get floats like this s-eek! -Elives in classic theaters. This hilarious all-tar drama was released here in 1980. I was greeted with the session I attended. In fact, the audience was so in the ridiculous fiance on the screen, it played like a Rocky Horror session. Within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real disaster: the tug-of-the-scene scene where you could see the buckets of water rushed from the deposits. afterwards it was every patron of himself and the theater was eagerly listening and cheering for bad acting and oo-waah reactions. The gunfire in the hold between the crates is especially idiotic and also allows drunken viewers with friends in changed states to contribute properly. I call these movies with Michael Caine his holiday home movies, as I always think he agrees to do so because he saw a house he wants and doesn't want to spend his savings. Like Jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it is called.
