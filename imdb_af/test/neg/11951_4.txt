Well, I must admit when I saw the trailer for this movie, I looked forward to it. I'm generally a fan of light romantic comedies and of the trailer, that's the impression I got from this movie. However, I waited most of the movie and waited for the comedy to start. Although there were some entertaining scenes, the prospect of the movie was generally quite depressed. <br /> <br /> I also found it hard to fall in love with any of the characters, as they were all a bit underdeveloped, the time the director could have used the characters using an unnecessary overuse of Opera, to explore, the film felt dragged and slow. <br /> <br /> Although, though there are a few screens, the trailer is becoming very misleading and I would just suggest that you look at it if there is nothing else tickling your fiction. <br /> <br /> Not great, and as I said before; Pale.
