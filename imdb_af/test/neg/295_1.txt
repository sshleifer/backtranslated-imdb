OK, suggest that every state in the US, no, every country has exactly the same trees and leaves grow. Imagine, too, that a monkey walker camp has so far had a beautiful tarmac'd, which you had to do through the first half of the approach through the river. Imagine a world where you have to wear a full biohazard suit to collect a slide, then just drop it in a ziploc bag and transfer it in your pocket without any precaution as soon as you get back to the office . A world where two-nine-year-old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining. This is the world in which this movie is introduced. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is one of the most clich√©-ravaged pieces wiped out. It was my accident to testify for many years. <br /> <br /> I liked it. :)
