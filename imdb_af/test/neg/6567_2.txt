While Star Trek was mostly boring with the Motion Picture, Star Trek The Final Frontier is really bad. In this terrible successor, the crew left the beach when they received an emergency signal from the Federation that kidnapped Earth ambassadors, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon homeland) by an apostate volcano bent to reach its star ship . venture into the big barrier. There he hopes to find God. With the help of mysticism and bad writing, he convinced many of the senior officers of the Company to betray Kirk and keep the ship. They reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they meet a divine alien. This one is so bad, it's hard to figure out where to start. In essence, a good idea is never really developed. The plot goes nowhere instead of where no one has gone before. It's almost like the authors have no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes do not have the tension of Kahn's anger, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is old. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's seat, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock and McCoy, but don't give the other enough to do. In addition, while Shatner is usually guilty of overworking in previous movies and television spots, he's just bad in this one. Now, Kirk is reckless, a practical joker, and stupid. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, "Drive Your Boat" in a round of campfire. Anyway, it's the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I had to give it three out of ten instead of five.
