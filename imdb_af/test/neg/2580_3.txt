The Patriot (nothing to do with the Mel Gibson movie of the same name) came out. Steven Seagal still has it in his movies saving the environment. What's good. But it doesn't make for good action. <br /> <br /> When the plot (?) of this movie finally kicked, I saw the turn? Seagal's anti-warfare, caring for mother-nature attitude is not very subtle. For a movie originally debuted in the cinema, it is much like a TV movie shot in spite of the wonderful shots of the country by Dean Semler, the photographer of Dances with Wolves. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does like a fighting scene in the whole movie and it's totally boring. As an action movie, if a drama stinks it fails, as an environmental message it is obvious. Avoid as Ebola crossed with pest.
