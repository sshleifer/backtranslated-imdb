Ruggero Deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. But director Umberto Lenzi, usually recognized as a Deodato coach, directed the thief man 3 years earlier in 1972. Is this a worthy start for the genre? Well .... not really ..... <br /> <br /> A photographer accidentally makes a man in self-defense and, while retreating into the jungles of an Asian country, is caught by An indigenous tribe who keeps him in prison forces him into slavery, and eventually assumes him if he marries the chief's daughter. Throughout the film I never felt it was a horror movie. It was more reminiscent of a drama, like a MAN CALLED HORSE, which I liked better. Ivan Rassimov is pretty good as the photographer, but it is Ms Me Lai as the chief's daughter who is unforgettable and wonderful. I've always been a Ms Lai fan since her awesome performance in JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and she never gets credit for her actors, as she hardly speaks in her movies. She is still very talented and charming. A lot of actual animal disorder is the one thing about the DOPRIVIER that can make it a horror movie, but even that doesn't do well. <br /> <br /> THE MAN OF THE DEATRIVER is good to see for those who want to see what the cannibal subgenre started, but as an entry into the genre, it easily becomes through Deodato's entries and even Lenzi's own later entries were obscured. Recommended only for finalists and Ms Me Lai fans.
