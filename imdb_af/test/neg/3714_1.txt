On this site I often paralyzed the Americans because they do not know how to write comedy, BUT, while they have never produced the quality of "Fawlty Towers", "Blackadder" or "The Fall and Rise or Reginald Perrin" not, they never did anything bad to my knowledge: the nadir of British comedy. <br /> <br /> On my Richter scale of comic horror, it's just behind the truly irreparable 'Are You Served' 'as the worst comedy show in the English language, with bad plays, annoying characters and humor that I got out of date before leaving primary school. Unfortunately, it was again part of a great series of shows, along with 'Dad's Army', 'It's Not Half Hot Mum' and 'Allo, Allo' which relied on ridiculous situations and well-known catches to keep audiences "amused". <br /> <br /> Michael Crawford later proved that he was a talented artist, but I'd rather be sentenced to a month to watch Rhoda than to endure a single episode of this drift. I'm ashamed to be British.
