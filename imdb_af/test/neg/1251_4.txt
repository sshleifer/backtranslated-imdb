Stu Ungar is considered by many to be the greatest poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary self-destructive force of nature - small in stature, but a great heart for the game. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a kind of Hallmark movie about the dangers of gambling. Certainly, he wins, he loses, he blows everything on sex, drugs and more gambling we get, but where's the right play - where is it that made him the biggest card player of all time. <br /> <br /> Far too flat, and frankly sowing in places, it gets a four because we learn something about Stu the man, but Stu the card player, nada. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot and presented to a point this is the perfect example of how not to make a movie about cards: frankly, ESPN's coverage of the world series is more visible than that. <br /> <br /> A waste of a great chance.
