When I first watched this movie, I thought it would be rallying, because it knew my favorite actor of all time. He gave a good performance, although it was pretty obvious, he didn't need more than half a finger to make the roll work. He's the only good thing about it, unless you're in explosions and American dreamwork class hero waste (which I'm not). <br /> <br /> I don't get it. How can this movie get away with the fact that it is so close? That little bit with the little boy being saved, I mean, come on! You can't tell me he would have been saved without the firefighter wearing any glasses (I know for a fact that it was black and you can't see more than a few feet) and no breathing equipment (he would choke after 2 minutes!). This movie was just bad, okay? Why Robert? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ???? !!!! <br /> <br /> Sorry if this is your favorite movie.
