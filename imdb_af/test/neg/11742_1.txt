Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece shot for the shot, including some modern facets: a hiker and nudity of Anne Heche. Unless you have a strong desire for Mrs. To see Heche naked, there is absolutely NO reason to see this movie instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and Van Sant fails to realize that the original landfill is more frightening to hide the nudity and gore. Ask Janet Leigh about that one. The acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects are much less impressive.
