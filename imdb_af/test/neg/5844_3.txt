A good example of the differences between American and foreign cinema can be seen in a movie I watched recently on television. Indecent Submission. <br /> <br /> Our two lead actors, David and Diane Murphy, are played Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. . I am not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they did not do well, but why we have to care so much about keeping these two together was outside me. Love, Love, Playfulness, Attractiveness ?? since I knew Robert Redford would eventually turn up, it was clear from the start that the good part, the meat of the movie, the scenes between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson can't have any emotion for the movie at all. He apparently held back, busy with his diminishing hairline. <br /> <br /> OK, so fast forward. What idiots these two (Diane and David) are thinking, they can recover the $ 50,000 they owe through gambling. No acting faux fits there, just terribly bad, lazy, unforgivable writing. Of course they lose all their money. Surprised? I know I wasn't. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the movie) ?? a romantic, perhaps emotionally naked man, an updated Gatsby. A very good role and although not a big, good actor, next to the two, Redford looks like Olivier. He immediately fell in love with Diane and we felt the viewers for one time. That's how to love a woman! Not David's way, trading gum mouth to mouth with Diane on a slimy pier. (Did I see it right?) As Gage, Redford wears a suit and ties in every scene. Yes, it is meant to give the seemingly brain-like hearing that here is a rich man, but he also looks good, and at this point the brain appreciates the dead public! Other wardrobe symbolism includes David's newly-formed shirts at the end of the film, which means it should be worn after a long while wearing a lost wrinkled shirt. <br /> <br /> And what about California garden festivals depicted in Hollywood movies? All of them suddenly appear Brits, complete with dresses, three-piece suits for men, hats (HATS!) And of course the parasol. Yes, Diane, her transformation to Richman's fianc√©, now completed, is at the auction, which turns a parasol. Although she insisted that she could not be bought, she eventually conceded to the sexual tension. Here's where the film branched into pure Americana. I mean, of course, David and Diane will come along, my question is: WHY? Diane was bored with David, why didn't she drive the Robert Redford wave? And I mean for a good long time? How can she so easily pull out of the sexual-romantic dream of this sexy older man so easily, just because Woody Harrelson brings his descending hairline to the garden party, puts himself down and sees Demi Moore in the eyes. It's just not how it goes. He was so weak. <br /> <br /> But we must have our happy ending. We must swallow the moral lesson. We are not sophisticated enough to have it different. Director Lyn tried to make a fatal attraction for the juvie set, the young'uns. <br /> <br /> In addition to garden parties in which there is a SUV, T-shirt or baseball cap in sight, such films also feature a reliable public transport system that links far-reaching California cities and municipalities. How else does the return to the middle class or working class symbolize?
