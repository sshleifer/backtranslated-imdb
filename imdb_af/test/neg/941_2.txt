Inside, terrible farce basically about a young man who refuses to adhere to or better uses non-conformity to achieve his goals-his parents foolishly thinking he attends college. The truth is, this junk was rejected by every school he applied for. After watching this junk, you'll see why. <br /> <br /> What a ridiculous name-South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to find out the initials of this school of nonsense. The problem with these types of movies is that the non-conformist eventually becomes the accepted mode. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the world of reality and call this movie what it really is - excessive manipulative junk!
