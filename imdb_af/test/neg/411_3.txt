An EXTREMELY fast, exciting, interesting, detail rich book. It's a great shame that the movie doesn't have any of these features. Not only was Tom Hanks' soft ways portraying Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name changed to key characters, major deviations from the original story line, and a poor Irish / Italian accent from Carmalengo. Played by Ewan Mcgregor, who made the worst book to film EVER. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of A & D's book, I had great expectations for a more cute, where to book, detailed movie, where it started and ended just as the book did - I wanted more <br /> <br /> All the movie really done, pushed me in the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> What was impressive was the ... sorry! I couldn't even finish the sentence without laughing. <br /> <br /> In short - Vittoria was the tokenhottie, a very second to Audrey Tatou and there were some very nice Alfa Romeos. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading the book to understand that if Ron Howard has to make another book, I'll be happy to save Â£ 6.40 for a KFC singer meal and a few chicken wings - much more entertaining and much more satisfying!
