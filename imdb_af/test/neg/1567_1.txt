G & M started a strange couple in the man over the house and started entertaining the nation in their own sitcom. <br /> <br /> What was the typical small-scale charm of the couple's chemistry on the small screen, G & M's big screen transfer was as frightening as the genome's Morcombe and Wise, and many fine TV shows. <br /> <br /> Independent. Unsatisfactory and with a sick Yootha Joyce who died before the film was released.
