If you watch this movie and then listen to the comment, it is clear that Michael Radford does not understand this play. The first notion that he does not fully understand the work is that he is struggling to put the film into seventeenth-century Venice. What actually sounds strange, yes, the misunderstanding of the movie would mean that it was trying to make it as accurate as possible. But everyone who studied Shakespeare knows that while placing most of his plays in exotic residents, culture and values ​​are always contemporary England. It doesn't hurt the movie, but it shows a lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> Where Radford kills the movie, it's so serious. He sucks every joke out of the writing, and leaves the whole production flat. Every gram of passion is beaten out of the characters. Even Shylock's "Do Not Bleed" speech is a gentle, uncomfortable ranting of a choleric that seems to be doing and doing what he does because he is supposed to. The lovers are solemn and far too limited. (Joseph Fiennes is delivering the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in a barely audible whisper). Gratiano (to be promised at one point) is more sober and collected as Bassiano (who promises to act), Jessica is reluctant to leave her dad and spend her life with Lorenzo pouting. <br /> <br /> In the commentary for the mere and dilapidated court zone, the director agrees that an audience laughed at Portia's "a pound of flesh, no more, no less". that it should exhaust voltage. "The Venice Dealer" is a comedy and Radford cartoon in the notion that the most absurd and hysterical parts of the story are anything but the most challenging drama. <br /> <br /> The film has no understandable focus, but it cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes. The characters are forced into high drama veils, so they come out as Ibsen characters who read Victorian poetry. And the comic end, where all the good guys are happy, is drowned in a dignified despair that feels that they find stiff-top peace with the impending death, rather than reconciling with lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio leave the film that keeps their hats like aristocratic mourners. <br /> <br /> The film is poorly done because of the creative forces that do not understand the writing. It is strict where it should be hysterical. It is reserved where it must be passionate. This is Michael Radford where it should be William Shakespeare.
