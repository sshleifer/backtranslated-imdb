No spoiler needed to prevent you from doing so ... bizarre movie. Canada becomes part of the US. OK. So, I think I'm unusual, but I expected something from the implications of Canada to join the US. Dumb as well. Continue with this movie and you are on the cloud of coocoo land. The opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the movie you will trust me. Slings and Arrows and Due South must be the most imaginative series ever. But in this case, Paul Gross, I am so sorry to say, had no idea of ​​making a cohesive film and wasted many talented actors in the process. A real disappointment.
