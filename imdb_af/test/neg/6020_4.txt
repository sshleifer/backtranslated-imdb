STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Danny (Mel Raido) is a lonely factory worker trying to get through with his work and being a good father to his two daughters after a rough divorce from their mother (Maxine Peake.) But after a departure with said girls present at a Working Men's Club, he used a trip to their dance class to take a look at Louis (Colin Salmon) and his gang of hard men who practice in the boxing gym / generous section and train himself in a tighter, more assertive person. Earlier, he took Louis's philosophies to his heart and joined him as a nightclub man when the 80's disco hit. But if Associate Sparky (Scott Williams) is trying to sideline drug trafficking, everything becomes pearl-shaped. <br /> <br /> As Robert De Niro once said in the movie A Bronx Tale, "There is no greater tragedy than wasted talent." The Clubbed writer had a good idea and a talent to make it into some kind of movie ... but without the ability to put it all in some coherent movie. <br /> <br /> As a hummingbird, some of the filming conditions (especially a scene at the end outside the Ring O 'Bells pub in Moseley!) were very easy and fun to watch ... but the noise watching cinematography is really a downer on things. Some really bad actors, for example, main actress Raido, with an intense accent all over the place, and a hammy script with some misfiring dialogue, are bigger problems for the movie. More established actors such as Peake and even Telly's favorite Neil Morressey are in the background of very small supporting parts, while the disastrous Raido and Ronnie Fox's lame rogue takes the middle stage. Williams impresses a poor man's Sick Boy from Trainspotting, and apparently leaves Salmon and Shaun Parkes the only artists left with integrity of the whole thing, as excessive blood-splitting violence (which is a common trend for Briton flicks!) Take over. Actually a missed opportunity. **
