"Book II" is not a movie, it is a sermon. This deceptive, sickly, and almost unbearably boring burnout probably works as religious propaganda, but has no entertainment value outside of a few bites of George Burns. Louanne plays a little girl asked by God to set up an advertising campaign that will make people believe again. No really, that's the story. It is a charged cargo of old cobblers that have too many self-justifying, 'explanatory' religious waffles, but hardly any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything even closer to magic or charm. "Miracle On 34th Street" it's not. Suzanne Pleshette takes a bit of life in this quirky pool of fast-paced concrete, but the pudding-headed script and junk performance of the annoying Louanne quickly sends this one to the fiery depths of your know-how.
