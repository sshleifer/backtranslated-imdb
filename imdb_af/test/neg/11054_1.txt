Jeff Leroy wanted to make Scientology, such a horror movie around a cult similar to him built. The trick is that instead of old L. Ron Hubbard as the cult leader, there is an age-old space monster that changes its followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty living college student investigating the occult. His landlord is an attractive blonde trying to clean up his life with the help of the cult. It doesn't take him long to find out that she's one thing: his blood. "The Screaming" was shot very cheaply on video and I'm just ugly. The space monster (which resembles a giant winged cat that looks equally slim and without skin) is alternately a clay-style miniature and a large-scale animatronic puppet, both of which look terrible. The acting and writing are both terrible and the director doesn't even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing. Avoid this non-scary, pitiful little excuse.
