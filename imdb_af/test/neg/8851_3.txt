I saw this movie because every review I read was one of the scariest films of the new millennium. I really don't understand what all the hype is about. For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughable ("What if something strange is going on?" ... what ????). The acting didn't shake off my socks either. It could have been because the script had hardly given the actors to work with .... the characters were purely two-dimensional for me and I had no whore at all about them. Another thing is that the movie is very boring. Extremely. Sure, there are a few "jolts" here and there, but for the film's 112-minute length it certainly didn't use it's time wise. Most of the movies contain characters that talk about things that have almost nothing to do with the plot. What was the point? <br /> <br /> To download it, the movie doesn't make sense. Yes, I believe I understand the intentions of the ghosts, but how it fits the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me. Also, much of the movie is played in small vignettes that sometimes make the story difficult to follow. And don't even get me to the end. What exactly happened there? <br /> <br /> I can give Kurosawa credit for making really scary images throughout the movie. There are many creepy shots of ghosts and other disturbing images. If they reflected more on the images and worked out on them, it would have made the movie much stronger. But they didn't, and instead expanded more to social commentary, which was interesting, but portrayed in an extremely boring way. Yes, it's a message movie. Good, fun. I just get the message out of my review here: find a better way to spend your free time than to watch it.
