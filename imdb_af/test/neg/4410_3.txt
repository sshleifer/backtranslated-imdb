** May Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> A happy South Islander is run by other (Caucasian) natives after befriending visiting scientists, Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. The ungrateful scientists dig him up and find that he has taken the form of a humanoid tree. He comes to life and goes on a rampage and certainly enough, that the fifty boogyman, the A-bomb, is blamed for this aberration. To declare that this particular sample runs as it has a stick, a ** is unnecessary. Suffice it to say that the butter throws, like the movie itself, throws its enemies into a handy mercury sand and gives the main characters one more thing to make silly comments. Paul Blaisdell created the tree suit and it is hardly his best job. Over the years, this movie has been widely commented on as "To Hell It Can Go!" Personally, I think it's the best walking movie I've ever seen.
