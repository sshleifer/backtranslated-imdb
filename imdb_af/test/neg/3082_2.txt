"Committed", as planned in Heather Graham to save her husband / marriage, and then to be defeated in a psychiatric ward, to do so: what a clever, clever use of words. <br /> <br /> One of those meaningless philosophical films wants to be, in which narration is a series of oh-wise observations that hold poetry (90s chic club poetry, better known as "chit-chic poetry"). Oh, it's so-your-ne-sais-quoi ... Written / directed (or "authorized") by a woman (Lisa Krueger, whoever you are the hell), this is a senseless, luller-directed path movie full of New Age spiritualistic nonsense and characters intended to be interesting but only seen before or just plain boring. The Latinos in this movie, as part of the poor urban minority, are typically glorified in all their mystically-obsessed primitivism as a "spiritually better" nation, which is the "highlight" of this film's political correctness. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is lifeless, and stop just as if occasionally good throwing members appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). On the other hand, we have Casey Affleck, which is one of the very best examples of why nepotism is the same as the first degree killings as a crime. I rarely saw a more apathetic "actor"; A skinny, ugly moron that goes dormant through his lines, almost as if he has spoken to them in a half-awake quasi-dream, plus the weak voice, one of the weakest male voices I've heard in my life . (He has to go to the Tobey Maguire Lethargy School of Acting.) To throw this idiot into something, speaks volumes about any movie, ie about any director or producer. That's why Lisa Krueger is a talented waste of space. We also had the moron that starred in the MST3K spoofed "Werewolf"; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. Look at his ridiculous accent and the silly speech.
