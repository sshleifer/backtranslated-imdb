Wow! This is the movie that must be shown on TV at Two in the morning at Cinemax for all the indifferent. (Lord knows they will probably not be boring to watch this movie). Terrorist action, the killer is quite far from scary, I have seen carnivals who were more scarce. Much of the unnecessary 'skin' in this movie, pseudo-porn screens, which is just over one million in a million, a gawdy soap opera script that really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for any genre he tried. create with this movie. I could see a group of teenagers with their parents' video cameras doing better work than that. I don't think there is a part of me that can recommend this movie to anyone.
