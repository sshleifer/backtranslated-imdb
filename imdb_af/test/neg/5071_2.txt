I would like to write a little summary of this movie's plot, but ... there is simply no one! If you just look at the plot keywords for this title, you know the entire content of the movie very well: sex, breasts, exploitation, female frontal nudity and women's prison! 80 minutes pure sleaze and nothing more. "Flight of the island women" (an alternative title not even listed here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial woman-in-prison classic, but it has the brutality of one. WIP flicks are meant to mix graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex. Director Erwin Dietrich can certainly not compete with field specialists such as Jess Franco or Joe D'Amato, and he had to hold on to making regular softcore flakes. The only aspect that looks like cult theater is the agreement with the tyrant president with Fidel Castro and the group rape of a (minor) girl by soldiers. However, the girls are wonderful, and the Ibiza filming station looks very captivating.
