OK we have 4 city electricians who find a mini-nuke reactor, plug it in and fall into a parallel universe in a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spinning queen. They managed to hit some of her families to take over the earth, but unfortunately she's the only one left? If so, why didn't the rest of mankind come together and seek her. Also, what happened to the army could not be helped a few billion plus ammunition and why hiding in a basement when many more defensive places had to be available. Not even a spade on city workers, but how did it know what a mini-nuke reactor looks like and how would they re-open the gorge if they didn't have one in the parallel universe? Sorry, but there was nothing nice about the movie
