I'm in two thoughts about VOLGENDE, Christopher Nolan's film command. Part of me admire it for the cost of 6,000 dollars to make, but part of my hate it because it's too artificial. In many ways, I remind myself of the cult movie PI, a film I didn't like, and I can't get my head around the center of a man who wants to follow writers. Isn't it more logical for someone who wants to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard? <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I think NEXT gives filmmakers hope that just because they made no $ 6,000 budget that costs more than two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and more than five hundred members will comment on it but you have to wonder if this movie would be considered as good if it wasn't made by the director of MEMENTO?
