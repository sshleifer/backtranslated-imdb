A CBS radio show entitled "We the People" helps to find a US home for Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (such as Karl Braun), a skilled surgeon and swimming hustler. He comes with the beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (like Leni), who studies to become a nurse. Moving to a small, dusty Midwestern town. They are welcomed at the station by John Wayne (like John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as 'Nunk' Atterbury), a veterinarian. Mrs. Gurie is unhappy in the dustbin, and wants to leave. Immediately. But the prospect of romance with Mr. Wayne could change her mind ... <br /> <br /> God answers the many prayers of the citizens for rain, but it may not be enough to save the farm. The whole town is advised to move to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and run. Coburn receives an invitation to work at a top clinic. And, Gurie learns her fianc√©, presumably dead, will come to claim her as his wife. She feels compelled to accept; but he has a dark secret ... This movie doesn't flutter Wayne, who looks like his element. To help with Gurie, who is promoted as another Garbo. They have a cute scene in Wayne's car ("Jalopy, an Italian car"). <br /> <br /> **** Triangles West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
