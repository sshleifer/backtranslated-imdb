Hm. Where do I start? I usually ignore what the IMDb rating has if you watch a movie, because I think I may have it anyway or whatever and I should at least give it a chance, but this time I wish I was paying attention. <br /> <br /> I know some people like it, and I'm not trying to say they shouldn't. It was semi-amusing at some parties. But if you're like me and you don't like watching cats crawling in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, random fast-moving cloud scenes, dogs that still bark in cages for 20 minutes, faces while people are talking, you may want to avoid movie. The actors were either positive wood or over the top, and the film quality was terrible, vague and granular and fatter and not artistic at all. And I know we were supposed to think Carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun that shot innocent people with this strange religious psychosis, but ... well, she didn't really convince me. In fact, I finally averted much of her crazy character. And what was there with the souls in space? I understand it's a fantasy movie, but come on. <br /> <br /> I'll say, the angel at the end was freaking creepy. It was the creepiest thing in the whole movie, WAY more creepy than the Darth Maul lava face demon. I gave them props for that scene, it was good. But not good enough to actually see the movie. And the opening credits were great, but don't be deceived! I'd rather have used the money in those credits to make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Bah. I wish I didn't buy it for even the $ 2 I paid for it, but I could have bought a sweetie. : /
