Two popular actors are featured, such as De Niro and Murphy who play a police and an actor. Although they share the most screen time together, they do not reach their expected performances like movies like Analyze It, Meet the Parents, Dr. Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The movie is interesting but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy that's pretty disappointing. It especially feels that De Niro is not keen on Showtime. It's a pity he really shows his feelings, that's what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea was cleverly used, it could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed by a sequel such as any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I don't think there will be a sequel to this, and at least De Niro and Murpy have to throw again. ** from *****
