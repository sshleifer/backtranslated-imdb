Crack and atmosphere this movie has, but unfortunately the pressure I just watched. Raymond Massey grants Sherlock Holmes, almost comedian in the early scenes in his bathrobe, which he enters into a creepy home of dr. Rylott (Lyn Harding) to investigate. What wasn't clear to me was why Rylott would have wanted his death. If in the case of Helen (Angela Baddeley), he didn't want her to walk away to get married, he would have achieved the same thing by sending her. <br /> <br /> Other curiosity is also abundant. . After an early wedding date with Helen, the fiance is no longer heard for the rest of the photo. The presence of a group of cigars at the time of Violet Stoner's death simply presents a deviation, and being an interesting killing instrument, a poisonous snake, is diluted by the fact that it is not a cobra, musical versions of the Indole Stewart have a competent portrait of dr. Watson, Holmes's aide, but he gets used to a bit when Nigel Bruce is your cup of tea. Like Rylott, Lyn Harding is a sufficient threat, a feature that would be well used as Holmes' nemesis Professor Moriarty in two later films - 1935's The Triumph or Sherlock Holmes and 1937's Murder at the Baskervilles. <br /> <br /> With repeated choppiness and an unstable camera, it's amazing that the story line is no longer disrupted than it is. Its integrity is generally maintained, even if you stretch the gaps to fill. I think it would be my main complaint to the movie, as some of the jets in the picture are a real pain in the aspen.
