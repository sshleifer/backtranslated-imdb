When I first saw the trailer, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the directors' other works were pretty good, but I have to say I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman who lives with a widowed father and two his two sons. They move into a well-guarded community, but everything is not as it seems; some kind of twin peaks. The woman starts to see or not see things. During the first line I had a hypothesis and thought, "It can't be the whole reason?" Well, the end lived, or better off, and gave us what I felt was a really bad final act. The sound mix and quality are excellent. Seen it in a THX Certified Theater, and was impressed by the sound, and just the sound. The picture misses dust.
