I watched this movie at a party, we were very surprised at the end, it ended up slightly poor. although the whole movie is not too wonderful, I expected something slightly better. This movie is purely trash, but I suggest you watch it if you find cheap horror movies with a poor writing pretty funny. Personally, I loved the ad, it was my overall highlight, the fighting tones were basically a shot of a knife, some shadows in a window, fake blood. I have to say the grandma costume was quite scary. This movie is a mixture of joy to kill, kill blood and boggy creek 2, except this movie has slightly better camera wok and color treatment compared to camp blood.
