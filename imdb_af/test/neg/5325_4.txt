Unfortunately, Koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a proper adaptation of his work. Whispers follows the original book very carefully, apparently until the production company runs out of money. All the sets in the first half of the movie have been carefully recreated from the book - something missing in many other Koontz films. Despite his other (many) apostates, I continued to look in anticipation of a wonderful scenery. Wrong. By the time the detectives appear at the crackhead's apartment (in the book), the movie is out of money, and one of the most exciting scenes from the book has been destroyed. Where the book featured Greek discovery, a search and a chase by the guys apartment, the movie offers the back seat of the car. <br /> <br /> Let's see it - Koontz writes in mind without budget because imagination is free. If a Koontz novel is ever made in a decent movie, no one will see it, because they are so many, many, often dropped. This is why Dean Koontz's Frankenstein is now Frankenstein. If you have slaughtered your work so many times, you will come out early if it looks again!
