I love his martial arts style, it's fast, close and so fast, but it seems his movies are becoming more crime-based lifestyle quality and less meaningful ... I thought he was out to bring a deeper message. . At least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda. This one has some good redeeming features of the character, but the rest was so far. I was very disappointed. Those martial arts also suffer. I hope to see a more devoted Segal in his future films. This movie also lacks the story line, there are too many gaps so the mind is lost. Too many things are cryptic without a solution.
