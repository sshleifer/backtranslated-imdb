Director Fabio Barreto has a strange Academy Nominea for his last movie O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna Barreto made one of the worst movies of All Time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think about how poor Brazilian fishermen speak perfect English? In the movie they do it. There is no script. It's just a very long video clip with beautiful places and lots of sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
