I know that Jesse Franco is responsible for a wide variety of movies, and I'm mainly for his horror movies, just as common as they are sometimes. I think it was a morbid curiosity that brought me to this, and I wasn't even curious enough to finish it. Perhaps it got better to the end, but unless you're in lesbian sex scenes (of which there are plenty), you might be able to succeed. So what exactly can you say about a movie that contains a woman sitting in a bowl on the kitchen counter (while standing up)? Just never mind what it used to be, you probably won't want to know. If it's interesting to you, then this is your problem, but then you may just like this movie. I myself am not prudent, I saw many disgusting movies in my day, but at least they were well done, and it is not. Sometimes too much is just too much. Bleah.
