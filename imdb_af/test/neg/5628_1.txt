Known as the British movie so bad that it had to be given away for free with a newspaper, the quality of this sub-Children's Film Foundation "thriller" can be guessed by the abnormal number of 10/10 votes it gets and the large number of rave reviews of posters with no message history and no other reviews on their name. The ordinary people know what that means, the believer can be knocked. If they dive into the waters of this one, they won't last long before they drag them down. Technically indifferent to the boom in the shot or the crew's reflection, it only goes on forever in a forgetful sub-DAVINCI CODE at $ 5 a day. The end is just insulting, but don't worry. It's not like you get that far!
