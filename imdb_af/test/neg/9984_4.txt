Although his plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword and sandal epics such as 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (The style of movies was out of favor in the late seventies). On the contrary, it looks more like a cross between a soft core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, do the abridged 150 minute version. I've never seen the full 210-minute version, but looking at the descriptions of this page looks closer to a cross between a hard core porn and a video source. <br /> <br /> As one would expect from a movie produced by the "Penthouse" publisher, there are many naked flesh to care for, and the film contains loving catalogs of Caligula's sexual perversions. including his turbulent relationship with his sister Drusilla. What may be unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely related to the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as a female show and clear homoerotic overtones for many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence, as if Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass are trying to kill two taboos with one stone. (It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazil film must be called 'Brass', and the screenwriter of such a gory must be called 'Gore'). Characters are killed or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways, and there is a beautiful scene of homosexual rape. <br /> <br /> The Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were probably known for their broken lifestyles, so the film's concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. However, I wonder if such a concentration is needed to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both the fall of the Roman Empire and Gladiator are, during the reign of Commodus, an emperor, as cruel and debauched as Caligula. In no case did the filmmakers have to turn their movie into a mix of 'Up Pompeii', 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and both of these films are artistically much better than 'Caligula'. <Br /> <br /> The play in the movie is not very bad, with some exceptions like the horrible wood Teresa Ann Savoy and Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes an appropriate insane Caligula. (Suitable, this is in the context of this film. The actual Caligula was undoubtedly both cruel and eccentric, but historians debated whether he was actually sick). The big secret is exactly why so many leading British actors had agreed to participate in such a trashy production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only Lady of the British Empire with a past as a pornstar), it was probably associated with her rather unfortunate tendency to alternate between pride and sleepiness, but heaven alone knows what Peter O 'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing it. In contrast to other well-known stage actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always look at home at the theater, but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of Nerva, a decent and honorable Senator of the old school . Unfortunately, in the context of this film, any attempt at dignity is as extreme as a pearl on a dunghill. <br /> <br /> In his ambition for this film, Guccione clearly managed to become a cult class of decadence. (Whether Brass and Vidal had the same ambition for the film is open to the question). However, the film does not succeed at any other level, either as an art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship. Even seen as erotic it is two-way. 10/04
