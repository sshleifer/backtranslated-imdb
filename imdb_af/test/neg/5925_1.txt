An example of all the worst gay stereotypes, all in one movie. <br /> <br /> And Charles, why are you talking in that strange pseudo British / high-brown accent, and insist that the child also speak? Did anyone else notice that all the soundtrack music is exactly the same? You need to keep the good old Hollywood campsites that you are so good at! The Mama The II, The Sequence !! I don't see the value of time and money on a project like this; there are so many REAL life gay youth stories to be told and we should see it, not this garbage. Sheesh, wasting time. A scandalous example of gay theater.
