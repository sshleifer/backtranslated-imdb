There were so many classic movies made where the top people were out-and-out and yet they were made to look good. I never bought in those things. The "screwball comedies" were full of those things and so were many of the Fred Astaire movies. <br /> <br /> Here Barbara Stanwyck plays a well-known "country" magazine writer who has been publishing for years. , and feels that she must stay to retain her persona (and her work). She even lies to a guy to marry, another subject that has always been portrayed in classic films. <br /> <br /> She is a New York City woman who claims to be a good cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. Of course she knows nothing and the lies go so fast you lose. I think everything is supposed to be funny because lessons are finally learned and true love dominates. Etc. Please keep the barf bag. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is NOT funny. Stanwyck was much better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, the bag goes again.
