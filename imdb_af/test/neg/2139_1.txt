I'm not sure what the director and editor thought when editing this poor apology for a movie, but everything they thought didn't help this movie, but it just hurt it and it hurt the movie . The acting is not the problem, it is the terrible editing, scenes will end for no apparent reason, while being cut in the middle of an action series or people in the middle of the sentence. I'm not sure what the story was, but it didn't really matter, because what I saw was pretty uninteresting. Just bad everywhere, great "jaws" rip-off and not a good one at that. However, the MST version was funny. 7 for that, no one for the movie itself.
