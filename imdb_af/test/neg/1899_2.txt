What a frustrating movie. A small southern village overflows with possibilities to investigate the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden under quiet surfaces, like anyone who has read anything from Carson McCullers. It does nothing about it. Instead, the authors set up pikes, cheap hot fuzzies and banal melodramas. The thing looks like a TV made for television, and is without specific distinction, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are many highly skilled and attractive actors in this role, and everyone is trying to gamble to do the best and do what they can with it. Well, there's no other word for it. A tragic waste of talent, especially those of the great Stockard Channing.
