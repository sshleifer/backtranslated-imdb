For me, this movie is just a very lame teenage party with all the usual clicks and boring stereotype characters (Nerds, Jocks, Popular girls, Sleezy guys, etc.), but with an underlying anti-drug / drink theme. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this movie, keep an eye on all the references to responsibility and really keep it (dunno how different to get it). I think the only thing that made this movie cool would be if they were playing TV, it was on fire. It or DVD is exploding ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10,000 - See Animal House earlier.
