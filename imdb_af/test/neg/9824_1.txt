We've chosen this tough VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory photos. Knowing that it was an instant messenger, a failure as a rental, I thought it would be worth seeing, based on M-I's reputation. Sorry! Nine years ago, the Liberal Agenda was a great goal to get hold of the founding fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the founders of many American classrooms, including New Jersey. whose extinction of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth in the NJ school board and their oppressive act. A small part of this was the head of the alleged Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson link, ignoring the awkward DNA findings that failed to support the wacky left's agenda. Do not worry! They got James Ellis, a writer of dubious reputation, to put it in a book, and Columbia University concluded the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer. <br /> <br /> With Jefferson in Paris, the Liberal Agenda kicks off in the opening scene in which James Earl Jones claims he is Jefferson's son. The turn simply goes back to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person accepts the lie, the Hemmings allegation will be an insignificant detail in the greater case of Jefferson's long and essential diplomatic mission to Paris (as well as to the Netherlands where he ensures important financial support for America when we were kids nation without funds). <br /> <br /> Apart from the Liberal Spin work, there is nothing else of interest in this deadly and badly-faded movie. Some of the other history is indeed accurate --- adding credibility to catching the lie --- but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a means of insomnia. <br /> <br /> Please do not ask me why liberals have let down the founders, because I don't waste time explaining the actions of such people. Don't ask them too; they usually respond to such questions with the same answer: "STOP!"
