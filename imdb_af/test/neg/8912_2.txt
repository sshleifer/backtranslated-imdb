Oh another Seagal movie. In less than a few months come to populate the video store shelves. Bad as Submerged? No, but it doesn't say much. Like perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to quit, but goes for one last job just to be double crossed by his boss. He lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him break out and seek refunds. <br /> <It is good to see that Seagal does not eventually play an agent, policeman or what he usually plays. We're actually getting a US place in Las Vegas. Then an Eastern European territory as usual. There is also no wire-fu. Here, Fauntleroy is not a good job. <br /> <br /> However, most of the action and fighting scenes with Stevie have clearly doubled. Statements from other movies, lack of realism and logic in even the smallest situation. Seagal and Treech make such a team-inspiring (unintended) one minute. Soak the rest. <br /> <br /> Several notable faces come to slumber. Sleep Kevin Tighe is a long way from his days of distress. Nick Mancuso turns to sleepwalking to take a check. No more rappers. Well? At this stage, the action scenes and limits are more predictable and are more commonly reclaimed than ever. It's an old scene that Seagal has to come out or hang out. He had to come out a while ago.
