It may be the worst remake Hollywood ever made, and it says something. I will take it further and say that this movie is so amazing, sorry that it should be seen. I don't know if I'm even able to tackle all of the things that go with it, such as the fact that the deciding director drew names from a hat, or allowed Richard Gere's character to loop over. away from the shots (I'm sure people say, "It's just fiction, caring," would have no problem if it was a former al-Qaeda operation just wanting to return to its homeland) so I'll just my review is devoted to the utmost hilarity, which is mainly the scene where Bruce Willis tries his gun. <br /> <br /> In the original version, remember, the Jackal is practicing death on a pumpkin. The pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as "understatement." In this version, Willis sets a pumpkin target, but he doesn't use a sniper rifle. He uses a giant remote-controlled cannon that costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a large, striking minivan. (this guy likes a challenge). He reveals the gun by pulling a tar away, and Jack Black, who is there to observe, jumps around and says, "It's ROCKS! This thing ROCKS!" About 18 times (I think Willis didn't even have to dismantle it, he just picked it up, tar and everything, from the back of the bus, despite the fact that it probably weighs a few tons). The scene then turns into an Austin Powers movie, because Willis misses the pumpkin and takes a tree, then Swart ran through the mud with his pants down and eventually blew off Black's entire arm. The pumpkin falls to the ground, unharmed. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this movie for ONE non-ironic reason, it is for the Diane Venora character as a tough Russian captain who is romantically linked to Gere, despite the fact that he has a face rejection has. Hollywood feature. By the middle of the movie I really enjoyed this character, so it was a shame when she was to be killed. I'd like to see a movie about her. Unlike this, this heap of shit is only useful as an objective intelligence test. 10/03.
