Let's set aside the sophomoric humor we can find in racism, aside and honestly ... it's not funny. I was amazed at the fact that the two main stars would agree to do a film that was so offensive and so detrimental to racial relationships, and I did not refer to the obvious black / white commentary in the movie, but to the sharpening of other ethnicities, such as Betty White's characterization of hispanics. Should we just clear her up to do this movie as a sign of senility ... is she too old to discern comedy from stereotypical trash? Or is it the fault of the authors? How about the third assistant makeup person ??? No, the blame is with us to continue this kind of crap (in the guise of comedy), that Hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the skill to say enough is enough ... racism is real and it is not a laugh. We're all different, let's celebrate that diversity, don't make fun, and promote divisions.
