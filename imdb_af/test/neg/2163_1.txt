Cyber ​​Zone, as this DVD was sold in Oz, is about the worst B-grade junk I've seen. Except for a limited deadpan act of Singer, indicating that he knew how bad the movie would be, the other actors are waving about real-time line-up (Swanson and Quarry) or absurd imagery of classic movie scenes. Mathius Hues has made the most ham-fisted depiction of death since Jim Carrey's Mask. All these things with no real thread to make an effort to set a ghost through genre, period or any general vein is simply annoying. Don't even try to connect the dots to the plot. It's Blade Runner, thinly disguised with no content, actors or scenery due to a very limited budget. "You get what you pay for" is never clear. There are repeatedly annoying reuse of limited sets, without paying attention to garment and some special effects that the blend chamber floor for dr. Who would hit in 1976. The helicopter explosion is worth returning to demonstrate my point. Of course there are masochists who will upload this trip, but if you watch this movie for a bet, make sure you get more than your pay rate. At $ 2 this DVD will make a cheap and interesting beer.
