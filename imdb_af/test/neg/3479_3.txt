With some good Rick Baker-esque special effects and Deran Serafian in a small role, this nice Italian movie deserves some recognition. Cerchi gets some credit for still filming while most other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava and Enzo G. Castellari) moved to lower-key TV movies. As far as plankton is concerned, it is half of Piranha - half the thing, with people turning in monsters, raping women and causing general chaos. The ultra-grim, sloppy and over-the-air feel of the movie makes it hard to enjoy. Only available in Italian work prints.
