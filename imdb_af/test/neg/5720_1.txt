I remember the trailer for Conan's infamously weak spin-off. I saw the movie years later and laughed my head. By accident! Poor Briggite Nielson. Her career never had a chance, thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The story of the movie is: Sonja (Brigitte Nielson) comes from a tribe of female warriors murdered by an evil queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb that protects the female warriors and uses it to destroy every town she passes. Sonja goes on a hunt for Queen Gedren and later finds that Gedren killed her parents. On her quest, she unwillingly joins Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his clumsy idiotic servant, Falkon (Paul L. Smith). Together they went on a hunt for Queen Gedren and the orb. The acting is subpar and the action scenes are soco. I mean Briggite Neilson looks so emotionally distant. For someone who has lost her entire family as well as her female comrades, Sonja does not look like it. Arnold plays his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr .... what an annoying snot-nosed brat he was in this movie! Moron servant Falkon had more personality than those guys. The action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the movie, although they sometimes get flat. The scene where they fight the mechanical sea creatures made me laugh until my ribs hurt. The dialogue is also a hoot. It is as if the scriptwriter thought no one would take the movie seriously, so he all gave dull lines to work with. I can only recommend this movie if you want your epic movies extra champion. Anyone else bothered.
