Good enough. Every time I think I've seen a movie so misunderstood, so bad in every way that I think nobody can find something to praise, I just come to the IMDb where I'm greeted with the plain uncivilized masterpiece "GREAT MOVIE" - I mean honestly, what movie do you watch, because it's definitely not the mess I just watched on the new Fox / MGM / UA DVD, there are about three amusing lines and a plot And then, after ninety-three minutes, it just stops and starts the end credits, then there's another scene, the DVD is pretty miserable, which fits the movie. Source material is almost completely blurred to an ugly brown. It's hard to think this movie follows Get Carter, the critics and the public managed it - it was lambasted and a checkout disaster, and so forth. to try, and I'll keep trying to find a movie that does NOT have someone rave.
