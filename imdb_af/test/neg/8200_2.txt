This story begins at the end! So the movie's opening credits advise us. Unfortunately, this is not true, as we treat about 70 minutes of a typical B science fiction movie of the 1950s. The story is sad; The plot is very poor and is clearly filmed on a low budget, as it was often in those days. <br /> <br /> The story could cover any situation where people in a secluded home resort and being threatened by someone outside. It just happened to be adapted to fit a scientific story. <br /> <br /> The landscape consists of a few rocks, bushes and smoke. - Oh yes, there was also a pool of water. Someone wore a rubber mask with a bill like a face and looks like feathers. <br /> <br /> Written by Lou Rusoff, who has published various scientific stories about that time, including The She Creature and It has conquered the World. The filming was completed in a matter of days, which did not allow the actors time to develop their characters better. The low budget constraints also prevented this film from reaching its potential. Mike Connors and Richard Denning did some life to the movie, but even they couldn't pick up this movie in the category you could say. - "I enjoyed the movie". Richard Denning's acting career began in 1937. He played with Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in an Affair to Remember, and later became known on the television series Hawaii Five-O and The Flying Doctor. br /> <br /> Targeted by Roger Corman, who has both films as a director and producer. He made good movies and still makes it. He became widely known for his directing films from the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, who was often Vincent Price. He also made other low-budget films; some were good and entertained for some reason, and most were much better than that. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> Darnmay <br /> September 10, 2007
