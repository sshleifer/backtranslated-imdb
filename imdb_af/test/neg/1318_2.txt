There is something intriguing about disaster films. The simple, primary point of departure can lead to several good stories. Assigned, most disaster films tend to explore familiar territory, but I can usually live with it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Flood probably marks the low point in the history of these subgenres. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie, even though screen time is divided between different places and characters. He gives a barely decent performance. Also, Joanne Whalley is very uneven. Veteran actor Tom Courtenay (he played in doctor Zhivago for heaven's sake) is especially bad. I mean, his timing is completely out of the way, and his characterization is extremely poor. What an embarrassment to this man. The rest of the shooting ranges from decent to really bad with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, who I thought he might be there as a plot device / eyecup, gives by far the most convincing performance. It doesn't mean much to consider how bad everyone is, but still nice to see that she cares. <br /> <br /> The writing is really bad, confusing and clich√©. Some of the worse lines I've heard for some time are being performed once by the actors. You've seen this story a thousand times. It uses every dramatic hook and tear you've seen in "Outbreak", "Armageddon", the Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others. <br /> <br /> The direction is terrible. No sense of timing, nothing inspired. The shots are vague, dialogue and action both fail. Editing is bad, but how do you edit such a mess? Without a doubt, this movie is trying to make too much of (rather weak) CGI. The human factor, the drama and the battle of the characters are overlooked. Scenes where the characters actually get the flood are scarce and poorly done. The made-for-TV feeling gives nausea. Some guys have to take a helicopter rope? No problem, let's show him inside a helicopter and make a very poor cut / edit job and put the next frame with him safely on the ground, in the most obvious possible way. <br /> <br /> The movie score is rather poor. All over the place, no timing. <br /> <br /> The end is probably the worst I've seen for some time. As much as they went out of ideas. Delete it, you can't run out of anything if you never had it in the first place. Must have run out of budget. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of amateur work. I give it a 2 for using London as a place, which is a good change, because Gilsig is actually decent in an important support role and for the few CGI shots that were decent (those of the water in London and the gates close). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch Day After Tomorrow or just about a disaster movie in front of this one. It includes older classics such as The Towering Inferno.
