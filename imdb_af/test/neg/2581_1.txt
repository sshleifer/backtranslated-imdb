"The Patriot" star Steven Segal is a 90-year-old excitement / action movie that is not really a thriller and not really an action movie. rather, it is Steven Segal who plays Steven Segal with a different name, but this time he is a native American local doctor who kicks his butt every time. By bursting the obvious plot line hole, the movie itself is absolutely incredible in terms of the blatant disregard of character deviation. <br /> <br /> From a marketing point of view, I asked, "Who in the world were they targeting?" The bio-thriller plot line is a way of middle America crowds and Segal as his cowboy will never sell to anyone, even if you have fried it deep and put him in a crib-cream donut. The whole movie is just out there, even for Segal fans, because it simply doesn't deliver on any level.
