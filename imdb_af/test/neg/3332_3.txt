My boss at the time and showed it to us at a Halloween party at our office. He is the Chris Huntley who co-wrote and acted through it. He knows it's bad, we know it's bad and we all agree that the monster looks too much like a vagina happens to be. Perhaps it was a wrong gynecological experiment. <br /> <br /> It was a VERY low budget and the actors were all friends, so what you have here is a case of "hey gang, let's show a show". <br /> <br /> No one was hurt and it was a first attempt. Nothing wrong with that. This gave us all a good laugh and it's a great movie to watch with friends and have fun. :-)
