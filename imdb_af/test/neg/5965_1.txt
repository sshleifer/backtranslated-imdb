This movie is a complete and complete waste of time, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And come from me, it's definitely something to say. In fact, I wish I could have given it negative stars instead of seeing it as a pathetic one. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I had an open mind. I find the legend of the chupacabra interesting and I love cheesy horror flicks. But I draw the line at this one. <br /> <br /> The play sucked. The chief gives one of the worst performances ever, which looks and sounds unnatural, as he delivers his poorly written lines. The main lady gives a slightly more palatable performance, but it doesn't really take much. <br /> <br /> The chupacabra ... and considering how low the budget should have been this movie, the creature was tolerant. However, it looks exactly like someone in a mask and body suit. The mask is reasonably detailed and may look personal but not on the screen. <br /> <br /> Speaking on the screen, you think they could at least use a better camera. It looks like it's shot with a camcorder to cry out loud. Not a very good one. <br /> <br /> I don't know what everyone who wrote this horror thought. The dialogue sucks and just ... I can't describe what I feel about it. At least not without being in trouble with the site. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid it at all costs. It's just not worth it. When it comes to TV and you have nothing else to do or to watch, * find something else to do or to watch. Read a book, listen to music, anything. * Don't subject yourself to this. If you do, you can't say you weren't warned. And for the sake of lady and lady, don't rent this sucker. It's not worth it, even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents. Trust me, I know.
