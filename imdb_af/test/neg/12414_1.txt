This movie starts with a man who apparently is some sports manager. He meets a gang that contains an arrogant boss, a clear idiot, a fat boy who never speaks and a woman turning between the three. The group called Satan's Angels wants Rod, the manager, as their personal manager. He says no, but then says yes after the authorities made him a spy to look at them. They rob a gun shop in a ridiculous play. The scene involves the woman entering her shop with her long hair in a bulb and large round glasses. She says she wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show her how. She then took it from the shopkeeper and shot him. The other three in the gang (excluding Rod) walk in the store. They take everything off the walls and continue to play with it, like children who receive their toys on Christmas Day. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely does not throw any precious screen time off with a plot.
