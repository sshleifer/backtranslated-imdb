I don't care if this show is supposed to communicate in-depth messages about human existence. <br /> <br /> The show is shit .... how can anyone enjoy seeing it? Yet it is so well received. It reflects a sad situation of Joe Moron out there. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch this program when it first came out as friends talk about it. The annoying laugh between the two main characters and the spicy dialogue made me cry. <br /> <br /> It is convinced that people can see this show. Yet I think the creators had the last laugh. They made themselves rich by taking p.ss out of the people who would see a show like this. <br /> <br /> I dare laugh all the way to the bank.
