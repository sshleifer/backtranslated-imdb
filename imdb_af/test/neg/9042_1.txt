Uuuuaaa! Barf! Yuk! Yuk! Disgusting! Puke City! The worst piece of mess ever made. Ill. Strange. Horrible. Enough said. Keep your nose. Don't eat. After watching this sick, dementia, rubbish bin from a movie, you won't be able to eat your food for a week. But maybe it's good. A new diet was invented. Check out this vomit-inducing film. Get sick of your stomach. And you'll be shut down by the whole mess, so you can't eat for at least a week, and you drop about 15 pounds. <br /> <br /> Lie Me! With a name like this, it's really great that she doesn't follow a "cult" fan. She is the worst actress ever. Her films make Ed Woods look like Gone With The Wind. This movie is a minus 10.
