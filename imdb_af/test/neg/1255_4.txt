Wow, I just saw one of the biggest poker tragedies and I'm not talking about the premature death of the big bits. This movie I was sorry to say was terrible. Totally terrible. A true tragedy in film history. Well, maybe I'm a little hard, but if you don't have a little interest in the life of your children, you don't even think of getting close to this one. And those who have an interest in his life will find that most parts are trivialized and set as great novelty scenes. I watched it because of Stu UNgar, but almost wanted to end myself as he did while watching this movie. 4 stars for trouble, but unpleasant pain
