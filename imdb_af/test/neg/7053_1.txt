This movie had to end as soon as the joke about Bebe's Kids was told in the opening. I like Robin Harris and most of his comedy, but the really funny routines were not meant to be something that the whole family could see. Seems to make the point of one of Jerry Seinfeld's jokes and try to push the joke as long as possible to make it into a movie. This movie had to be self-service, because I can't find someone who has found the institutions or communities that are known. What is most funny about this movie is that the authors of the writers and producers must give it away as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.
