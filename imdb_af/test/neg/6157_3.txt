The story and the characters really needed it. The world idea is kind of neat, but nobody bothered to develop it through outline or plot. Despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the movie, it makes sense that you won't use exponentiality, since no one is new to this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) run away from the field and get lost and the wind worshipers and the fat, lazy rich in the museum, we don't get any real idea of ​​who this people are, or why we should care about any of them. Smart movies have ways to develop them simply by having the characters in the world. Simple things, like ordering a drink at a bar, or discussing something about the past - these are the kinds of things that make the movie world memorable, not endless shots of crappy aircraft, and cheap CG effects from someone try to do loops in an ultralight. <br /> <br /> If it's too difficult for you, here's a little hint. If everything goes untouched because you get up too often, stay in one place for a while and the characters speak a little. All the superfluous shit must be removed. Get rid of the whole wind-worshiper scene. Get rid of the stuffy museum people. Get rid of all the crappy flying crap, unless you can make the wind relevant to the story. Keep the whole thing on a big plane or something. Just people need to talk about something we care about. <br /> <br /> Hey, get rid of Bill Paxton. Owned the film center around Tasker's character and his relationship with the robot, Byron. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the biggest problem with the movie is that we don't care about anyone, because nobody takes the time to either explain their motivation or delve into their characters. We don't like Matt (well, because he's played by Bill Paxton, among other things). He's a rogue, who doesn't leave him alone, except to let the Android, Byron, go. And this action has even less significance than most because of three key points: <br /> <br /> 1. Byron is a killer. 2. Byron is irreplaceable 3. Byron can leave any time he condemns. Instead of Byron, there is a kind of pathos there, but it is largely undeveloped. All we have left is a glamorous, slippery robot man who is momentarily active and momentarily timed, and virtually the next. We don't know why or how he develops emotions, but we know he killed someone. We do not know why he killed someone, or the circumstances of this Greek event, because it was not developed. We can't be sorry for him if we don't know the story. All we know for a fact is that he killed people. And he likes Bill Paxton. <br /> <br /> We do not hate Tasker enough (partly because he is played by good-natured Mark Hamill), since while he is abominable and ruthless, nothing out of the ordinary does his character - a post-apocalyptic peace officer. Surely he is killing Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers on the road to growing poppies for heroin. And they first shoot him. He doesn't kill anyone who doesn't get in the way or doesn't even physically harm him. This applies equally well to the final confrontation in the museum. He uses a smuggling of police brutality against a lazy dilettante (F. Murray, Abraham is wasted in this role), and everyone else pulls a gun at him. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand the deal with Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), Tasker's partner. After just 10 minutes with Matt, she is ready to change her sides, despite her shouting of loyalty, and despite Matt's garbage, she speaks and pushes her out. If it is love, then I will hate every day. <br /> <br /> Really. Paxton's character is about as sweet as Simon in "True Lies", or Pvt. Hudson from "Aliens". Is there anyone in this movie for him? No why? Because he is a lazy idiot, and a loser. Why is he at the helm of this movie?
