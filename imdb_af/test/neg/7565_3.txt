Jeez, it was very boring. The leading man (Christian Schoyen) must be the worst actor I have ever seen. And another thing, if the character in the movie moves to America when he was ten years old and has lived here for over 20 years, he would speak much better than he draws from it. or to say it in my own language "Brokenly broken". But it's cool to see Norwegian dudes in a movie made in Hollywood. It was just a damn disgrace that they were talented hacks. The storyline itself is below mediocre. I have a suspicion that Christian Schoyen did this movie just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the movie by bending one beautiful babe to the other.
