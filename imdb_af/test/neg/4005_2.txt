I think this movie has really bad production value. The lack of acting makes me think they should mark it as an early docudrama. It might have had no money to make it. I feel bad it was a ruff ride in the Major League for Jackie Robinson. <br /> <br /> I believe he was much better than many of the white players of his day. He really had to be wonderful to break the color barrier of time. No turn that was a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wishing more information about its creators. They may be limited by the quality of actors who were prepared to tackle the project. Maybe there is no money to get good people.
