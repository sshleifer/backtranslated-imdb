I saw this movie last week at the Berlin Film Festival and have medium-high expectations. - The director is Bertrand Tavernier and I was familiar with some of his previous work in the French film. I actually enjoyed his previous movies. The movie: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steenburgen ... I'm looking forward to seeing all this talent on the screen. I was not familiar with the book on which it was based and I did not read the film in advance, but I was told that it was an in-depth investigation film (we saw a lot of the past, perhaps as good as the other ...) <br /> <br /> 2 hours later the end titles appear: THANK YOU GOD IT WAS UP! - The plot is not understandable. If you have read the book, you have a great advantage. There were too many small characters and there were many useless plot bows. We didn't understand anything! - The accents. My God! Tommy Lee Jones's accent is decent, but I still have nightmares from Mary Steenburgen's Cajun French song ... - Poor pours into my opinion. I can't believe old man Tommy Lee Jones can knock the crap out of a linebacker building ... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman. - Who were these people?!? We hardly understand who all these characters are and what they do. There is a bait shop? Tommy Lee Jones has a girl from Guatemala? Bl√∂rg! - Comic efforts were pathetic. The funniest thing about the movie was probably his "action" and "tension" scenes. They were terrible. No excitement. Bad play (Can Tommy Lee Jones make different faces or is he like Derek Zoolander?) ... And then there's the sci-fi stuff. No spoilers, but it gets ridiculous and annoying. <br /> <br /> I usually do not comment on IMDb, but I thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that I was forced to share my opinion. But that's just me ...
