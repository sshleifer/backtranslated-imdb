Odious Chuck Norris has decided to put a final nail in the coffin <br /> <br /> with his film career for the CBS Safe World <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> with this hysterically bad supernatural <br /> <br /> action. <br /> <br /> For such a silly movie, this thing is definitely suddenly. Norris is Chicago <br /> <br /> Policeman Frank Shatter. First, what kind of name is "Shatter"? <br /> <br /> Have you ever met a Shatters? Genforum.com has no list for <br /> <br /> the family name Shatter, which opens any half-smart viewer to <br /> <br /> replace the "a" in Shatter with an "I". He and his partner, Calvin <br /> <br /> Jackson, do the same old buddy cop routine you've seen <br /> <br /> yet: make fun of the pimps and make their captain angry. /> <br /> Jackson, like the theoretical love child of Whoopi Goldberg <br /> <br /> and Rick James, is quickly getting nervous with his constant <br /> <br /> complaints and Eddie Murphy patented facial expressions . <br /> <br /> Shatter and Calvin become involved with a Satan delegate, <br /> <br /> to whom we are introduced in too many opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Prosatano is a demon enclosed in King Richard's <br /> <br /> Lionhearted. The devil's scepter, from which he gets his power, <br /> <br /> is built into nine pieces and hidden in nine different parts of the <br /> <br /> world by holy men. In 1951, some grave diggers accidentally omitted <br /> <br /> Prosatano and started collecting the nine pieces. He <br /> <br /> disguises himself as an antiquity professor named Lockley and <br /> <br /> always happens with a lecture where a holy man is killed <br /> <br /> and a piece of the scepter is taken. <br /> <br /> Norris brings his "Walker: Texas Blunder" cohort Sheree Wilson, <br /> <br />, which plays Lockley's assistant. She helps Norris with his <br /> <br /> investigate, they make an eye on each other, and we <br /> <br /> fearless investigators travel to Israel after a rabbi has been killed in <br />. <br /> Chicago. While in Israel, Calvin is even more complained about <br /> <br /> about the heat, the lack of restaurant accommodation, the common <br /> <br /> drivers and the fact that he is the Chicago Bulls playoff <br /> <br /> games. Norris even manages to work a cute Israeli child in this <br /> <br /> nightmare. Bezi steals Calvin's purse and hangs around the men, <br /> <br /> guides them around Israel and doesn't evoke any kind of <br /> <br /> possible suspicions. <br /> <br /> Finally, Lockley (Prosatano) collects all the scepter <br /> <br /> pieces, but needs the royal blood to complete the ceremony <br /> <br /> and the to call up devil. Where does royal blood find? Well, Sheree's <br /> <br /> father is a duke! She has an American accent, but she is the <br /> <br /> writer author's convenient method of forcing this monstrosity <br /> <br /> to its inevitable conclusion. Certainly, this minion of Satan can have killed countless hundreds over the years, but how does he kick <br /> <br /> at a good old-fashioned American kicks? <Br /> <br /> Having been defeated by Prosatano, murdered by his own scepter (I <br /> <br /> envied him, he doesn't have to see Bezi's Calvin wallet again <br /> <br />) We are treated to a terrible coda that keeps a beard with a little bit of activity. <br /> <br /> Who watched Shutter, I mean Shatter, and Calvin at <br /> <br /> their quest. You see, it's predicted ... somewhere ... that two <br /> <br /> warriors from the west would defeat Prosatano. The silent <br /> <br /> bearded man who watched the couple was none other than <br /> <br /> Jesus ... I don't kid you. He is listed as "Prophet" in the final credits <br /> <br /> but you and even your pets will be the subtle Christian <br /> <br /> reference after which the filmmakers exhibit here. <<br /> <br /> As in "I am using a Walker: Texas Ranger," Norris is aging and he can no longer <br /> <br />. He kicks a lot, and <br /> <br /> people move slowly over furniture, and then Norris gives his line readings in the monotonous voice of his. Oh, what a real <br /> <br /> director might work out of him! His brother, Aaron, <br /> <br /> who also directed him to other movies, has no sense of story <br /> <br /> or momentum. Sites are being thrown in for myself, not to entertain <br /> <br />. The plays when the dynamic duo first meet, drag Bezi <br /> <br /> and over, and Bezi is not so important to the rest of the <br /> <br /> movie. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Israel, which means the Americans can personally offend the Israelis. There is not one like an Israeli character here. The Israeli police captain is a while. <br /> <br /> The policeman driver doesn't know English, and Calvin convinces him <br /> <br /> that the word "sh * tty" is a compliment. Nothing more fun than <br /> <br /> mute foreigners mock at their home fault, especially <br /> <br /> when all this racist humor comes from an American minority <br /> <br /> who would was more than offensive when the tables turned <br /> <br /> and the Israeli policeman put African American police in <br /> <br /> in the murder. <br /> <br /> This film was poorly written, poorly acted and badly directed. It does not <br /> <br /> as action, cop drama or even horror. It just shows that <br /> <br /> the newly created Cannon Studios was ready to throw their money <br /> <br /> anything, no matter how bad it was. "Hellbound" is <br /> <br /> definitely a most suitable title. <br /> <br /> It is designated (R) for physical violence, gun violence, strong <br /> <br /> profanity, some sexual references and some adult situations. <Br /> <br />
