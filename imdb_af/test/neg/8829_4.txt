I love Japanese movies - seen at least 100-200. So it's clear that I'm not afraid of Japanese movies. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well for Westerners. They may be hits at home, but abroad just doesn't look good, well ... normal. It's like the live fish my wife has eaten at a business meeting or strange PS2 games such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy - things that are confused by non-Japanese. This is probably the way other things see Americans take for granted, such as American football, roasted Snicker bars and Paris Hilton! Well, the king of strange Japanese films that just don't look right for Americans can only be ATAMA-YAMA. Now the style of animation is not the problem - it is different but nice enough. No, it's the story concept itself and the bitter end. This makes it a very unusual movie and it goes as follows: There was a sturdy man who had no tree out of his head for no apparent reason. Initially it was small and it simply cut it off, but again and again it regrouped - so he just decided to let go. And after a while people began to live under the shadow of the tree on his head. Strange as they were under the tree, they were small, but when they were gone, they were great again. Then, after it finally got sick and watched the tree, the man drowned himself (!) In the hole in the head of the head where the tree was! The end. <br /> <br /> See! I told you it was very, very strange - but not in a good way like TAMPOPO or HAPPY OF THE CATAKURIS - just strange. O-D-D .... strange! And unless you have a very high tolerance for this kind of thing, I doubt you feel bad about knowing that this Oscar-nominated movie hasn't won. Frankly, it makes me happy, because I really don't want to make this movie on such similar films. The only reason it deserves a 4 is due to beautiful but not spectacular animation. <br /> <br /> This movie hurt my brain .... I hope it's not a sign I have a tree!
