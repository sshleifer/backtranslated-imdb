movie I've ever seen. Actually, I find it one of the more entertaining episodes of MST 3000 I saw. Not that it was good, but for all who saw Manos: the Hands of the Lot know that this one was not two. The monster in the movie looks awful, everyone wore upset swimsuits, and the plot was laughing. I still have no idea why they made the monster, they never really gave a good reason. The main woman had to be the scariest gall I've ever seen. They would have done better if they had tossed the bile that was killed at first, as the head. On the plus side, the dolphins were acting great !!!
