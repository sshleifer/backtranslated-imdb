I picked the box "contains spoiler" if I said something that was a spoiler and didn't realize I had said it before reading it again after posting. So that's just the case. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to review this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on skymovies earlier this afternoon, and by describing Sky your people have to be acidic) it sounds pretty good, but when I was actually about 30 minutes in it, I was terrified. This film, in my opinion, has the worst screenwriter and actors / actresses - ever. The young girl who fell in love with L.A's son after about 3 hours is a very dim, lame character, who has an annoying, haunting voice and her hair. -.-. Then there is her lover, who is an idiot, and is also very crazy. Actually, they may suit each other. Then there is the boy's mother, who is on holiday with him and surprised, surprised - she is a doctor and - oh my God, wait, there are even more untouched surprises! A virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows everything about viruses! = O. SHOCK HORROR! Yes, right. Lol. Then there is this insane religious servant, who continues over '' ers '' or something, and how the Lord knows everything. Everyone on the island seems to love him, but he is actually a stubborn, arrogant, steroid pump (you just have to watch this movie for the scene where he comes from the sea after a swim, his head is like little and she body is MASSIVE, it is hilarious). The man had too much to drink. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after all these weirdo characters, including a stoned-looking taxi driver, the religious boy finally gives the doctor in, and she takes a blood sample, and they get straight to work to find the cure for it, for some reason he was dramatically saved, all to "" and God ". AND OH MY GOD. Yes, there is another surprise !! YOU WILL NEVER GO WHAT! Just in the neck of time, with 11 minutes to go before everyone on the island dies deadly, including her son and his girlfriend, she finds the healing, and injects everyone, and that's all solved !!! What a pathetic movie. I mean, I knew it had come to a definite end when I first started to look, but I am actually both good and have some subplotting, but no no, it was just boring and dry. /> <br /> Don't see this movie. You will end up like me - stunned for 3 hours and claim the one and a half hours of your life spent looking back.
