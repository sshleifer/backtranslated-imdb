I really enjoyed The Wrecking Crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (the first being Urban Menace (1999) I still saw). I know it was baaaad, but the three leaders did a pretty decent job, considering everything. <br /> <br /> However, it was really horrible. Ice-T was terrible, and he is the producer! Can't say I ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learned to spell), but his performance was one of the worst I have ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Miss Jones played pretty well in her small role, although she later made horrible, racist "jokes" on her radio program after the SE Asian tsunami (plus other occasions unhappy). Ways to go, girl ... <br /> <br /> No one else comes out with any credit. Strange, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (both pretty bad) are much better in The Wrecking Crew, which was made with Urban Menace at the same time as Corrupt. I don't know how it works. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to try the IJT comment to see if he's apologizing for the movie, or trying to make us think it's a good piece. of movie-up.
