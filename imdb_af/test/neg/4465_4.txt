Title: Dracula AD 1972 <br /> <br /> Director: Alan Gibson <br /> <br /> Posted: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beacham <br /> <br /> Overview: Sometimes movies can be time capsules that give you feedback at any given time. In this case ... our time capsule Hammers Dracula is AD 1972 which gives us feedback after a time when Austin's powers would feel right at home. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of kids (where not a gang! was a group!) who likes to hang out at a cafe shop called "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm strange nickname ... wait ... it spins Dracula back!) A new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks. He offers them an evening of black mass and black magic. After which they also say "sure why not hell, it can be fun!". So in no time flat, find finding their count Dracula out of the ashes. <br /> <br /> This movie opens with a swinging party at some rich cottages. He doesn't know about the people at his party, but everyone is in the house all night. Doing drugs, making and dancing on top of tables. The filmmakers made sure that this order was completely disregarded in what young people were cool at that time. Everyone says words like "way out" and "coarse" and they end many of their sentences and say "all that jazz". So yes, it's pretty clear that it's the 70's. To download it all, there's a band that sounds like "Jefferson Airplane," ... I mean you'll be drowned in all things. And when I looked at it, I asked myself, "How's the Drakula with his black hat and getting up to fit in here?" And that's exactly what happens. Old Dracula feels out of the middle of all the parties and the rock and roll and drugs. Many of the scenes in the movie are great .... but unfortunately the music they decided to add to the proceedings didn't fit at all and got totally out of touch. Something terrible or scary will happen on the screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and kongos are knocking and just taking you out of the horror element. It took me out of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> But all the distracting 70s music aside (a disease that also suffered from Satanic Rites or Dracula) was pretty good. But I will call it. The story was just a repetition of what we have seen before in Taste the Blood of Dracula. In fact, the story is almost identical. Let's see ... a young boy inherits Dracula's ring and as ... check. He then decides to bring back Dracula, with the help of some people who know nothing about what they come in ... check. Black Mass to bring Dracula back into a displaced church ... check. The list of agreements goes on and on. So this movie is not very original if you ask me. <br /> <br /> There are a few things that make this movie worthwhile. The fact that the film is a time capsule for London in the early seventies, makes the film entertaining. I giggled and laughed every time someone spoke in 70 jargon. I couldn't believe the clothes these people wore and the cars they were driving! It made the movie fun for me, but we're here to find ghost, here was to see Drac kill a few virgins and take revenge on the Van Helsing House. Did we get any of these? Well yes. There are some good ranges that are restricted to satisfy old schoolgirls fans. First, there is the Black Mass sequence that was above all satanic! They call the name of many a devil and a lot of blood is wasted. The order was wonderful, but it was messed up at the most important moment by the music. Then there is the real resurrection of Draculas that I acknowledge, from a visual point of view, was great. Some misses from Draculas grave and slowly but surely, Christopher Lees's silhouette and face come from the mist. Cool shot! I love it! We have a Cushing and Lee face at the end. And I couldn't help laughing at one point when Dracula threw a piece of furniture through the air. I laugh because he did it in every movie since Horror or Dracula. It is this Hammer tradition where the characters throw candles and chairs together. And I think of myself, they are not more exciting things to show than a bad guy who throws a Christmas stick at our hero. Oh yes, anyway, Draculas downfall in this one is very similar to all the other Hammer Draculas before it, vampire is beaten and then we cut to a series of frames until there is only one. <br /> <br /> All in all, an unintentional funny Hammer Dracula movie. It was caught in the '70s and it made it a fun watch (and it's not as terrible as Satanic Rites of Dracula). It still doesn't sound good with the Dracula universe we expected from Hammer. <br /> <br /> Rating 3 1/2 of 5
