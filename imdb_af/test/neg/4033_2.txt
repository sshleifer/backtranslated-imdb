Watching this movie really surprised me. I never found myself stopping to watch a movie as a whole, because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good amount of money and it does, I must at least see the whole thing and me earn money. I made it about 30 minutes of this absolutely crappy movie when I thought to myself, now I'm a little more dumb after watching this movie. I can't believe the director and actors in this movie actually had so little respect for themselves to allow it! <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can say that was not said by the other reviewers, but even in the worst movies there are usually one or two decent performances ... not in this piece of pathetic rubbish. I performed better in high school playing. Everyone and I mean every 'actor' is badly out of faith, and what is truly incredible is the uniformity of the bad ... yes, it must have been the director. Where did they get these people? <br /> <br /> It's probably one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Although it is entertaining in places because of its laughable writing and even worse acting, and I use the term much better, it is unfortunate that this movie has not been sent to B-movie hell forever. What could have been a good idea was ruined by an ultra-low budget, poor sound and effects and actors who probably earned their wings in children's television, and poor children's television. <br /> <br /> Please, Stay away from this movie. Not worth a minute of your time.
