Just listen to the Broadway roll album and to the voices of Barbara Harris and John Cullum, who do wonders for the wonderful Lerner and Lane score. Then, with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind, watch the movie, with Streisand as Streisand, and Yves Montand reads his lines with such a heavy French accent that a chain saw can't cut it. The best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what Montand does to the introductory part of the title. Listen as he sings / says: Can anyone have an impression or an idea among us, what magic of wizard and voodoo you can do? (That one part summarizes the problem arising from the broadcasting of "name stars" in movie music instead of the appropriate talent for the different roles.) I can only see Rex Harrison entering that scene and suggesting that Montand can also learn to do justice to the beauty of the English language. <br /> <br />
