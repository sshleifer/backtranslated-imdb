If you are not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, they are the following: They are a few film producers and financiers from Israel who set up the Cannon film company in the early 1980s. The only Israeli to get a worse press than the two was Menachim Begin. Probably starting to earn the bad press, but Globus and Golan were a god who sent to filmmakers, because no matter how bad your writing was, they happily financed your movie and would normally appoint directors who can't directly and actors be that can't act. In fact, you often got the impression that people would just go to Yoram and Menahem would ask them for money and force them without seeing the filmmaker's resumption. If only producers nowadays trust so. <br /> <br /> THE YOUNG WARRIORS is not a Cannon movie, but Globus and Golan have funded it and it has their signature on it. It is badly directed, poorly acted, poorly edited, but it is the scripture that jumps and attacks you with its horror. It starts with a lot of high school jocks that get involved in all sorts of pranks. The first 20 minutes of the movie play like a sex comedy and it's something of a shock when the YOUNG VICTORIES become a vigilante movie. . But it's not just any kind of vigilante movie like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEAD WISH 3. (See a band? They are both successors and they are both vigilante movies made by Cannon films.) No, sir√©, this is a nice vigilante movie about the pretty boy high school jocks and their poodle goes out to be wiped out. This film proves that Globus and Golan are giving money to people, regardless of their film ability and you need to worry about people who want to spend their entire reserves making movies completely vigilantes.
