How do you take a throw of experienced, well-known actors and put such a silly movie together? Nimrod Antel answered: Armor. Six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large cash on their own. But just as they come to their first base with their plans, everything is unfolding quickly. With a plot like this, you don't think it can be bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see six normal, everyday types of guys. They joke, they laugh, drink together, etc. Then we suddenly learn that they plan to rob their own business. The hero Ty (Columbus Short) is sucked into the scheme by the cold brutal world, even though he is a decorated veteran, nice old and reliable employee. Oh me, oh me! In the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular guys almost all get paid psychos, who are willing to beat each other for cash. In the last scenes, Mike, (Matt Dillon), is about a suicide rampage for no other reason than killing his former friend. The viewer has no hint before it ends that these men are these relentless and bloodthirsty. It's totally incredible and "B movie" is almost too friendly for this kind of cheese platter. I'd say you're not wasting your time - too bad nobody gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before taking this photo.
