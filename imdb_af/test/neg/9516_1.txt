This movie was so frustrating to watch. The diverting screens don't let you get involved in the emotions of the actors. I went back and forth and looked at all these little images that I found wiplash at the end of the week. It's actually a rip off of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode". I was let down with these filmmakers trying to be cool. I wish I went out as many other people did.
