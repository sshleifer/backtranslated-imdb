Another direct to video movie from Disney, it's actually ideal for kids. The problem with Kronk's new groove is that everything that made the first movie is a fun ride, replaced with a more sad and gloomy movie. In this film, Kronk teaches many lessons at the expense of many others. It takes a lot of time to create a more enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove deals with two stories: Yzma returns for repayment and one me. Birdwell hopes to defeat Kronk's camp guidance championship. All this leads to Kronk confronting his father and his disapproval of his son's direction in life. <br /> <br /> From Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's Thriller, Kronk's New Groove regains every time it allows to entertain. his viewers. If you love the original, or look forward to the upcoming TV series about Kuzco, I recommend Kronk to his loyal fans.
