I don't really know where to start here. Imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the play to the props for the story that it hurts you. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it says a lot because I've seen bad people. When I saw this movie, I knew it was a blade, but I thought he had kung fu and vampires, a combination I thought could not fail. That's until I plugged it into my DVD player. How Ron Hall managed to make something as cool as vampires and martial arts is beyond me. first the acting. I didn't expect too much to start here, because it is an action movie and a B one, but the acting here is so bad that I can't help but worry about it. expressions and voices were way out, there was absolutely no emotion in almost the whole movie and when it was, it was so laughing that it thought I was watching Mad TV. For example, the girly man shouts. Derek lets out when he kills. Master Kao who should never have been born in the first place. All in all, I performed better at elementary school play. There is the action. Not even subpar compared to the things done in the action theaters. but the action was not yet a complete deviation, as Ron Hall has some art skills. but even the skill he has is overshadowed by the silly things he does, for example the part of the movie where he starts turning and then the camera changes. I almost tore a pillow in half. And the battle scene where his jailer fights vampires by turning his arms with them. WOW.OR How about the part in jail where Derek suddenly knows magic and can chants preform that makes tap water holy water. and go as far as the props. The guns look like walmart toys, the teeth are stolen from Halloween costumes, and words can't describe how bad the CG graphics are. I can spend hours on all the things that are wrong with this movie and trust me it is just the tip of the iceberg. his only one gets a 2 because it made me laugh. even though I laughed at how bad the movie was done, a laugh was a laugh. would I say it is vampire killer unless you want to laugh at a terrible movie or plan to be tortured for long periods and want to practice
