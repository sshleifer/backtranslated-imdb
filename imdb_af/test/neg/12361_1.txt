Somehow I really thought I was going to enjoy this movie, because I love mountain climbing pictures and a big secret in the plot. I have to say that photography was fantastic and there were some scary scenes that caught my attention. I thought Nicole Eggert, (Princess Pennington), 'Thank you, Good Night', '01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and met some characters who wanted her lead on the mountain. Marc Singer, 'Angel Blade', '02, played a very unconvincing strange man and performed in many scenes with a bad mood that looked comical. This movie was a great disappointment and not worth watching unless there is nothing to enjoy on the TV!
