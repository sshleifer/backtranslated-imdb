When I see it in the cinema, I remember going badly in a minute or two in the first scene and telling me right away: no, it should get better. It didn't. The performances are fairly uniform teakwood and no, there is NO sexual chemistry in this movie, just the awkward finishes of a pretty crazy, strategically talented actress born to satisfy the "Interviú" coverage and not much else. . If the screenwriter thought that Mériée was a character, it was an incredibly original creative trick, and he might have got more out. And Aranda, if he thought the matter a little more, would have realized that Carmen's story just got a thoughtful, iconoclastic, parodic deconstruction, not this leave-your-brain-on-the-turn case of ersatz passion and comic-book dialogue. This is the contemporary Spanish theater. <br /> <br />
