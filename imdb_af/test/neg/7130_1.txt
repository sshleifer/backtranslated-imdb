This "remake" is a complete disgrace: so mediocre, inexpensive and prose-like, it won't earn more than a few regretful lines. <br /> <br /> It's also a deceptive, and amateurish "acting", you're always aware that there's a set, a camera, a fake, no direction, no suspended reality whatsoever let you dip into the story. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobic, suffocating tension of the small spaces and rooms in the original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 & 2) is all here but in lost sets and spaces. <br /> <br /> But worst of all, the moral grandeur and unbearable suffering that both gave a ruthless logic to the original mother and victims of children who changed in unrelenting revenge. It is completely destroyed by turbulent nonsense and hollow boogie-style-scarce. <br /> <br /> If American audiences don't want to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator, prefer swallowing this kind of patronizing hogwash instead, they deserve this pathetic curse: the movie itself.
