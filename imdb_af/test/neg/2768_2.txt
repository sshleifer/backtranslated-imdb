I couldn't make head or tail from this terrible film noir. <br /> <br /> The plot was confusing, the acting was good, but the picture quality was terrible! Although I bought it from WalMart for $ 5.50 at a "Gansters Double Pack" (8 movies on two discs), and when you inserted the DVD, apologize for the terrible picture quality that some of the movies might have have. <br /> <The plot was flip flop wherever I couldn't understand it and didn't know what was going on. Then The End beat and the movie is over. <br /> <br /> What a waste of my time! <br /> <br /> I say, don't waste your money or time on it! Or if you also bought the Gansters Double Pack, just save this one ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
