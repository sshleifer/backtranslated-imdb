The plot - in the future when almost all men are killed by a Y chromosome target virus, creates a (hot) female genetic engineer a man in a chemlabbe - is intriguing. Despite the somewhat promising point of departure, the movie falls flat in almost every respect. The dialogue is laughing. The characters are paper thin. Exploring a gender world is level. The worst part of the whole movie is the Asian detective who gives such nice lines so you can vomit. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how on earth this garbage was produced. Most of the movie is male bashing. "All men are violent." "All men are raping women." "Men are just animals." All the women - even the 'closet hetero cases' - look to anger, fear and hate for men. If you want to see a sci-fi movie that is in line with this movie, you will do the best to look elsewhere.
