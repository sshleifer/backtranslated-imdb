I had the misfortune to see this movie recently and have to sit through it. A friend bought it for Â£ 1 and insisted that we see it because it sounds good from the back cover story. <br /> <br /> 10 minutes in the movie it was clear that the actors were amateurs and that was an extremely low budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were very poor, the writing was stupid and the story has many scenes that look unnecessarily long, so the movie will be of a reasonable length. <br /> <br /> For example, when the main character hires a warehouse, the movie spends a ridiculous amount of time on this scene, with a meaningless dialogue that doesn't serve a real purpose or necessity for the plot. <br /> <br /> The main actor is supposedly revenge on a woman sleeping with guys to give them HIV. He never thinks to be tested once. Instead, he becomes a mad killer who decides to torture her before killing her and cutting her into pieces. <br /> <br /> If it sounds good and you think it will have many gore, think again. This movie has no real security order and is fairly soft for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> It doesn't frighten it, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't provide quick fun. However, it can make you sleep, it is sure to wear your tears, so save yourself the despair and follow my heading. <br /> <br /> BELIEVE THIS MOVIE 1/2 out of 10 (it doesn't even earn 1) <br /> <br /> The movie was 78 minutes, but it looks like it's 2 1/2 hours.
