That's right, I can't watch Comedy Central anymore, just because I can't watch the recurring ads for this show. I'll tell you the truth, it's a terrible show, not because I'm insulted, but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I've ever seen. I'd rather look at Root Top doing a George Bush impression than looking at this no-skill hack. And to believe, he calls himself the greatest. Even if he does not steal the jokes, he is still bad at telling them, he is gone from time to time and inexplicably. I remember in one joke, he said: "Why are white people going to camp to make it poor for a week?" Now, what's that supposed to mean? That all white people are rich? Another one I didn't understand was when he did a khaki from the Price is Right and he said to a fat man: "You need to know how much a fridge is, you're fat and The fat man had the sad look on his face ... But what does it mean that "fat people" are always looking for fridges - these are just the two I saw in his ads, God knows what his performance is. <br /> <br /> This show falls in the case of Epic Movie and Date Movie.
