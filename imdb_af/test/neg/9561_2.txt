Not as bad as Billy Bathgate, but close. Try as he can, Warren Beatty just couldn't be believed as Bugsy. Every time he fell out, instead of being shocked by the violence, I found it very embarrassing because it was so false. The other actors are not doing well either. Annette Bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe characters. As many people have noticed, Joe Mantegna would have done better if the writing had him as a more credible George Raft. Only Harvey Keitel appeared harmless, but then this man can do these movies in his sleep. And Robert Beltran, with just one line, steals one of the great Beatty, Bening scenes. With these movies I am never sure if the director is planning to make the people like ordinary businessmen look like it or just like that. Anyway, I don't like it. These guys were killers and no matter how much Las Vegas is owed to Bugsy Siegel. I don't think a movie should glorify the man, especially one with a great studio background.
