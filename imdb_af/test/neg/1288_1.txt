My wife rented this movie and it could never be easily seen. If I ever want to torture her, I'll make her movie. I watched many movies with my 4 year old and I can take almost anything. Barney is refreshing after a shot by Quigley. <br /> <br /> The plot, dialogue, cinematography, and play were one step above (or equal to) a cheap porn movie. I feel out of $ 3.69 anger we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes of my life, I will never return. I will say my 4-year-old likes it, fortunately it was a rental we had to return immediately. <br /> <br /> I just hope the younger actor's careers aren't ruined to be in this movie.
