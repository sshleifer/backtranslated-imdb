Thanks for not having heavy machinery, it could be an equally worst disaster. Shots were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, the same shots, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. Story line was rather empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did he get that stupid accent? Random scenes of scenery just to include them didn't add much. There were more shots of Arbor driving in her car than anything else. We didn't take that direction in any of the scenes and it didn't make me feel like any characters. I would have rated it zero if IMDb had the option. Great calming if you can't sleep. There have been 2 hours of my life, I will never come back.
