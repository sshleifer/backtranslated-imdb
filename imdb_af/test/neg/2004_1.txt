I will not repeat what so many others have said about this movie; I'll try to add some new points. The Coolio-as-vampire bit is a nod to fans who are known for their turn on the Blondie song "No Exit" in which he takes on the role of a clapperboard (it actually works as a musical concept and actually a wonderful song). Casper Van Dien is no worse than Brad Pitt and is actually more attractive. And really, who's going to a Brad Pitt movie for others like eye candy? The same here, though poorly filmed (look at "Starship Troopers"). And of course, after playing Dracula in the Morrissey / Warhol movie, Udo Kier has little more than a cameo. Enjoy it if you can.
