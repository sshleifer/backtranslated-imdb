It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would anyone make a movie to get away with murder!?! Mr. Allen plays the only kind of character he can, the sexually disabled man who can't get the girl. Get an idea, Allen, there is a reason that is the only character you can successfully portray. Remove this movie! It's a waste of time, unless you want to know how to kill someone successfully. I feel sorry for the actors who say 'yes' to Woody Allen. Look at his role and tell me how many of the people are still working. My respect for all the actors, who work for him, immediately goes off because they have chosen to participate in the film.
