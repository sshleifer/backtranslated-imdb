I watched this movie tonight and I have to say it's awful! I expected it to be good because you know, we usually don't mix many movies about Asian vampires with Asian culture; but already in the beginning it started in a bad way: the introduction of the movie does not seem to end! The plot is so weak and if you take down the battles and the soundtrack, you have nothing at all! The director of this film does not seem to be some important concepts about how much time can be used in the introduction and flashbacks. (Not to speak otherwise) <br /> <br /> For people like me who want to watch a big vampire movie, I really recommend "Lost Boys" or "The Interview with the vampire" '' look.
