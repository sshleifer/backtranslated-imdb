I saw this movie in the theater and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Oliver gets worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance I can't meet. Junior upset his father because he didn't go to school, his father, Ben, got mad. Also the Crazy Dance ride operator is not fair for Junior, because he doesn't let him go on the ride. And that Lawanda Dumore is as terrible as a serial killer for Junior because she has made threatening insults to Junior. That's why I can't tolerate this movie. Even if the movie is released again in the extended version in the theaters, I will not see this movie yet, because this movie is not something I can even tolerate. In fact, this stone!
