Despite a small handful of beautifully executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who managed the wonderful MERMAID LEGEND and the original Japanese splatter film, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the sensible condition. <br /> <br /> An Miscreant is obsessed with an extremely conservative woman who is reluctantly shooting in a porn photo. Predictable stalking, harassment, assault and rape follow. <br /> <br /> The staple food of Roman porn is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting subjects, surely, but not when so little effort is being made to make them fresh. A masturbation scene in which a woman squeezes pencils on her opening (via a condom) is too little kink until late. <br /> <br /> The series' rain motif continues and the film's last scene brings relief.
