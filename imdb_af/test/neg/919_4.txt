This film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life, especially love for which he did not sing for 5 years. <br /> <br /> It's basically a movie with a guy with very poor social skills, and he always says the wrong things. The plot is hollow and confronted. The main character, James, is lonely, but this theme of loneliness is not sufficiently investigated. It is more like an empty statement that causes other subplots. Sadness and disappointment after being dumped is superficial. There is a serious lack of emotion in the film. <br /> <br /> It's also not funny as a comedy. There are some funny one liners, but that's it. It lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood. I don't find "I want someone to eat cheese with" funny.
