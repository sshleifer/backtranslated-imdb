Wow, there is a lot of poison on this movie, and a lot of it is earned, but it's not the WORST movie of all time. (It's probably 'Zoolander'.) <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're high on something, very drunk or just in the mood for a B-minus minus movie you can enjoy , it can be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Yes, as others have said, let the first part of the movie make you think of an update of the Bram Stoker novel. Two of the main characters are known as Van Helsing and Mina, the ship is the Demeter, and they are in the Carpathian galaxy. You later find that Van Helsing is a descendant of the original, and he only happens on a ship in the 30th century with Dracula. Suuuuuuuuuuure. <br /> <br /> Yes, and to add to the originality, this spooky Ghost Ship movie has another character called Ash. Sound known? <br /> <br /> There are paper-thin character development and anachronisms such as the aforementioned tutorial, and Coolio and Tom Lister speak of the 20th century black snake. But what really makes the movie ridiculous is the end. If so with the characters, then the previous two hours are a waste. <br /> <br /> As I said, you want a silly movie to play "Mystery Science Theater", with your mind in about the same mode needed to lose the "Big Vegetable Rebellion" episode of VERLOR To see in space, you can find this delivery. Otherwise, put an interest in it, it's done.
