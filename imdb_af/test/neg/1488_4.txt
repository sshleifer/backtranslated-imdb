Like many Western Pennsylvania history buffers, I really look forward to this much talked about PBS program produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. However, I must now say that I was somewhat disappointed. On the positive side, I believe that this film had a fair justification to explain the main issues and describe the events of the so-called French and Indian War. In particular, his representation of the Indians' position was somewhat new and interesting, although it was certainly over-emphasized in time. On the positive side, too, the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and composed slightly better than many of these typical documentary documents that included interviews and paintings (a la Ken Burns). On the downside, many of the battles had a somewhat "advanced" look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Most of me I was very disappointed and frustrated by how little interest was Forbes's successful 1758 campaign against Fort Duquesne compared to the previous failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular, I was somewhat unbelievable that no mention was made of Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary in the British service, who was most responsible for Forbes's success. Finally, I couldn't believe the complete omission of the 1763 Battle of Bushy Run, which began as a repeat of Braddock's defeat, but ultimately the victory that determined the outcome of Pontiac's War, thanks to the will of the same. colonel bouquet that must surely rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.
