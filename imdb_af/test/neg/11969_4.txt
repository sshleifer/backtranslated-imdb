"Scarecrow Gone Wild: He's the Party's Death!" Should I say more? Scarecrow that has become wild has four of my ten stars, for one simple reason: apart from the terrible plays, plot holes, cheap special effects and anti-climaxes, it was movie gold! I think this movie might have been really good if the scarecrow became the baseball coach (as depicted by the equally brilliant Ken Shamrock). But then they had to cut off those huge electric special effects of the Jedi electricity. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, my friends and I were convinced that it was actually written by one of our friends, a stereotypical teenage boy. This film has women, miserably fake gore, topless and dialogue that could not have spoken from a paper bag, or in this case a wheat field. <br /> <br /> If I could ask the filmmaker one thing, it would be; "How much did you pay the teenager what it wrote to you?"
