A scary young man comes back to West after he got up in the hotel business via Boston; He quickly learns his friends in Spanish colonization. Old California expects to fill his late father's shoes instead of a romantic thief who is known to kiss his female victims after robbing them. Colorful but stupid M-G-M production has a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera, but it never goes down. Perhaps it was fun, second-string material for Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead. Combining loose-tune comedy and musical interlates is hampered by poor staging (Sinatra is photographed at one point in a mirror, but one doesn't concentrate much on its performance than seeing how strange the star is reflected in this way! ). Kathryn Grayson is the governor's daughter who falls to Frank, and her high soprano vibration changes her singing screens into self-pity. Apart from Robert Surtees' cinematography and the decent artistic direction, this Bandit remains silent. * of ****
