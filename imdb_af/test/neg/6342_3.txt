But to be a little more precise, I don't think it's as bad as it really can be. Although the actors (known for semi-famous) did not do a very good job. Director Error? Can the writing also be difficult for me to say? Anyway, if you're into very cool guns and action, it's not the movie for you, but they run around with many ww2 vintage guns. Kind of fun :) Well, I think I can say more, but it just doesn't feel like it's worth it. If you are desperate or a Hackman freak sees it differently, don't! <br /> <br /> Stay good and prosper
