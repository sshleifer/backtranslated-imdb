Last night I attended a show of Badland at my cousin. We were very excited to learn as soon as we got there that the director / writer, the producer (his wife) and various roles were also present and that there was a discussion and Q&A to the movie. But as soon as the movie was over and the credits started rolling (and the movie wasn't really good enough and too long), my cousin and I, without consulting each other, got up and left immediately. We only realized when we started talking outside. We were both so angry that we didn't just want to stay in the conversation. We couldn't even look at the role and crew who walked near the exit and who we walked in. just as we are gone. <br /> <br /> I figured that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which Jerry cut his daughter Celina's palm with a big knife so her blood could be used to leave a false trail. It was inevitable in my mind to join in the physical pain that he had inflicted on her body with the emotional pain she had inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence, saving her, and carrying her along with her. take him when he fled. I cut my palm (accidentally); even a rather superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive and it is very slow to heal if you do not keep it, because you just keep it open to try your life. But after a short while with just a narrow strip of cloth tied around her palm and one scene with a big band aid, it was as if she had never been cut. My wrath has reached its peak - I will not spoil you for this moment - in Celina's final scene. <br /> <br /> I was angry because Celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the movie (the actress portraying her is a good one); I was ?? and you can't tell me a good scriptwriter won't know? Think in her both physical and emotional pain; and the scriptwriter, through Celina's emotional pain so cavalierly treated, with so little respect, treated me, the obedient, cavalier and with extreme disrespect. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the writing has moments of tears for Celina, and some dialogue that tells us she's hurt, somewhere, somehow. But by this time we feel the audience so manipulated that we have closed down. The manipulation starts very early in this movie, when Jerry's family spells out to the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Arrange one, scriptwriters: give your audience some credit. Let them do a bit of creative work on their own. Tell the story; Don't explain everything we have to think and feel. We don't like it. <br /> <br /> My cousin also knew she had trouble with the movie, in a timely manner, in dialogue, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other, except f *** it, f *** That is me. Some couples indeed find such relationships that the f-bomb is ultimately every other word in their mouth. But it's like looking at comedians who are very curse. Some of them are really funny; the curse is complementary. But some of them replace the curse for humor and this scriptwriter, in order to draw the metaphor to his conclusion, is not Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This man and women's team have boldly chosen to tackle a very complex story with extremely complex characters. But they do not seem to realize that the meaning of a story, especially a complex one, will vary for each member of the audience. Successful storytelling requires attention to important factual details, and does not work desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience. <br /> <br /> I worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I heard more stories than most, and I'm always happy to see movies released that bring their stories to a wider audience. It is important to hear at all sorts of levels that we hear it. But I'm less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the movie even started what Jerry's story meant and spelled it out with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to the details.
