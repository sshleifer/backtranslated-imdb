The people who bash this movie were looking for it as cool and smooth as the first one, which it is not. This movie would be the complete opposite of Ocean's 11. It's been said by many members as well as director Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12, while not having a gripping plot, is grounded because it was different from what people wanted. If released for Ocean's 11, it will be taken very differently, not as a failed successor. The problem with persecutors is that people envisage it with a predetermined idea of ​​how it should be and have many expectations. They have to go into this movie with an open mind and don't expect it to be "Ocean's 11, again".
