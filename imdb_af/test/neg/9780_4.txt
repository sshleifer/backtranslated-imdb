This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one. Put the outer space with the South African desert, throw in the same ingredients, a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape, have them hunted by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary movie trying to monkey a classic movie. A group of miners and scientists are looking for some missing colleagues and find their bones stripped of desert in the desert. Their vehicle breaks down and they are searching for civilization as they are knocked down by the monster. The African place is pretty enough, but it's basically all this movie goes for. There was a vain effort to build up the tension, but I found that it didn't really work and made the movie rather boring. The creature didn't appear much and when it did, it didn't really have a sense of horror installed. There is One scene where someone gets the flesh, ripped out of his arm, but it was basically on the front. Finally, I found this movie so exciting as to look dry. I give this movie 4/10 and that's just because of the interesting place that alone is not enough to save this movie from a total snooze festival
