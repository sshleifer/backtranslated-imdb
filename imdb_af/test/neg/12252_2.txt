Dictated by thin experience (from both life and industry) and no cash Sofia Coppola's early short is almost necessarily a high school observer. The role-play is pretty poor and doesn't benefit from being shot in b & w (it's difficult to tell the characters apart). The sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage marriage. <br /> <br /> There are, however, one or two things to notice. In contrast, the inconsistent editing of the high school campus is filmed with a balance between aspirin colors and intimate close shots. The edit-to-music also creates an interest and momentum (without descent into the world of the music video). Coppola made an effort to change the tempo of the movie. The dramatic turn is quickly cut and at the point and the second act is almost non-existent; we admit that it was in the first place played, which is the point of the narrator-on-crutches (which is an otherwise peculiar character in the first act). Despite these notes, it's an awkward short. 10/02
