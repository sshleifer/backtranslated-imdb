Man, are you serious? Did you read the book or watch this movie? Well, if you did, let me warn you, it's fake. Mark Furhman has been looking for a job since losing his job with the LAPD. You remember him, right? He was the man who lied at the stand and gave the OJ Simpson defense a foothold that they were looking for. Well, he has since written three books. I read all three of them. No, I'm not a fan, they were given to me. But I will tell you one parable in all three, destroying the importance of Mark Furhman. He shamelessly exaggerated his stature in all three. In "Murder in Spokane" he pretended to have had something to catch the murderer when he had nothing to do with it. In all books, he has great joy in carrying out local law enforcement efforts. Similar to his efforts, the PB hearing concluded. In this movie there are many slow motion shots of ladies watching Furhman and lusting at him. Many other shots put him in the center of attention, when in reality I was sure the only thing people thought of was "hey, isn't it the racist that caused OJ to come out?" It was an interesting real life story, but not a good movie about it.
