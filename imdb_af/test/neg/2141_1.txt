I can't tell how terrible this movie is. My eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears spit blood from the terribly horrible one song soundtrack. There are four children and dogs and they run away from a hospital and get away with stealing two cars and a bus. No one gives them any punishment or anything to fix them. The acting is just as terrible, it sounds like a teaching video for social studies. I can't think of one thing I like about this movie. Nothing. Even the child who lost his dog made me vomit. He gets his dog back without the woman even running the dog out of the door. Perhaps the dog tried to escape from this movie. Then there are a few horses in the whole mixture. It was torture to watch this movie. Then the oldest boy at the end says that something like staying together is not a crime and they all hug and love him. Steel gas is a crime. Stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he had to go to the youth hostel or something. Avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
