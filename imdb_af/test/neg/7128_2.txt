All the way though I think to myself, "Oh, why!" Initially I thought, "Right, it can be average," but the play and plot on most parts was terrible. <br /> <br /> Every part of it was so predictable, although the first movie looks a lot like the ring, it was a half-decent movie, but it just seems to make all the good things of the first and made them terrible. Some pieces have all wet in the audience, eg. The part where Geller fell from the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to tell me to stay quiet, and I continued to comment on what would happen next. And more than less I was right. Why go home, let her come after? , It does not make sense. It was a bad excuse for many murders, and there was no depth at all. <br /> <br /> You can see everything coming that just made you feel there was no point. Oh shes behind her ... didn't see anyone coming * yawn *. <br /> <br /> Certainly, these people had to think ... oh I don't know, carry a knife or at least don't try to fight back, instead of being eaten, but someone's hair ? At best during the movie I was very frightening (and I mean generously), I just cried for the credits, while they rolled, I took out a brief "thank you God". If you haven't already, don't waste your time and money on it; useless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel!
