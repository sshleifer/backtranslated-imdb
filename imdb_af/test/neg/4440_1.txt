Robert Altman's Quintet is a foolish, dreary, difficult vibrator, which you eventually give up because it's so complicated. <br /> <br /> I remember this with my local twins on opening weekend with a full house. By the time the picture ended, it was less than a quarter full. I have never experienced such a mass exodus without an emergency to drive people out. It should tell you how bad it is. I believe it's the worst movie ever made with so much talent in front of and behind the camera.
