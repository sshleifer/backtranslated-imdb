After I didn't see the movie in the theater, but had to buy the DVD for my wife for Xmas, I had to see it. I didn't expect much, which usually means I get more than what I negotiated. But 'Mamma Mia' - extreme, complete cr **. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this movie is just awful. The stage show looks like a little musical, but these races along with songs that suddenly follow one another, no characterization, the dance numbers (which are choreographed hard by the extras on the DVD) are only discarded by half the bodies. Always on the screen, the dance ear of North Europeans appears on a small Greek island, while the set and set of numbers in the sixties of Cliff Richard would deter terrorists! Meryl (see me, I step up) Stripe can't even make her regular cup effective in an over-the-top musical! Her big piece - 'The Winner Take It All' - is Meryl at the Met! Note to the director - it had to be shot in silence with the camera gradually growing the distance between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the songs are terrible karaoke on amateur night. The camera can't stop moving like bad MTV. One can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. But what's even worse is how this broken piece of excre **** became the highest gross movie in the UK and the best selling DVD to start? Blair, Campbell and New Labor really reduced the UK to zombies - critical faculties anyone ???
