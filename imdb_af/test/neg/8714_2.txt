A Terrible Deception: Controversial movie, Teddy's winner in Berlin in 2003, has become a fiasco for Mil nubes de Paz. The actors recite everyone (well, it's not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet, but eventually became a dubious bet: it remains in the superficiality of two guys who kiss and a man whose lover is gone; It has no purpose: nothing to do with gay sexuality offered in other films (eg Before Night Falls (2000) by Julian Schnabel). Technically, the only thing that works is photography; Otherwise, the camera is placed in strange angles (to make it more 'art film') and the whole film runs in a black and white atmosphere. The film is so pretentious that it bothered. I mean, it's good to be pretentious if you have talent to support it. Or maybe it's such an art theater that it is incomprehensible. The story slowly, slowly, slowly flows. For me, more form than essence. Wonderful edition? It was good. Excellent direction? Don't think so: the movie is weak. It was an interesting project. It's a pity. This is a mistake. One star from four.
