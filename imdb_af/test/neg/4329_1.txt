Imagine looking at a slideshow where the projector hangs long enough on each slide, so you can memorize it three times. Imagine that the images in the slideshow consist entirely of everyday scenes ?? a small park; and empty tennis court; a piano. Imagine now that the people who perform the slideshow have a frustrating slow, semi-clear conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they show you. Great ?? You just imagined the whole movie of the Indian song. <br /> <br /> The movie is a painfully slow fitting of images that do little, except just shouting. "Look at me! I am PROFOUND !!" with such blatant self-interest that the images themselves and the movie as a whole are not merely rendered desolate, but robbed of REALITY of depth. static images as described above, as it is so scarce that there are actually people on the screen, and even when they are, people just move slightly more than the furniture, they never talk or interact in any meaningful way? Just to look at each other and sometimes cry.The most energetic moment in the first hour of the film is when three people walk slowly into a parking lot, in fact, the visuals can easily be left out, as the story completely The story is about a woman who hates India because it is hot, and hates people who don't hate India because it's hot (this point has been covered several times). is entitled o m to sleep with the aforementioned woman, as she will sleep with anyone who asks her, but he can not just sleep with her because he never asks and he is very upset about this. So he stared at her as a single tear ran deep into his cheek. Later he stared at his bicycle as a single tear ran deep into his cheek. Actually, you don't see the single tear running deep into his cheek as he stares at his bike, but you know that anyway, just because it's the kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The narrative is the best and serves as a perfect compliment to the coma-inducing visual arts. Usually aware of the whole of this movie, will require a ruling of judgment. To see this and actually get away with a serious and meaningful idea of ​​what it was supposed to do would cause the same kind of migraine than to read long technical documents in the dark. This film may be the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic pretense that man will ever know.
