This is so clickable, you will want to turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, with a fair going on and someone being killed. This movie would have been better, put on this institution. <br /> <br /> So, Jill Johnson is a depressing sprinter with boyfriend issues. I don't see the point of adding her break up with her boyfriend, taking place in any of the events in the story. <br /> <br /> Since returning home, her dad sends her to the Mandrakis babysitting in their glamorous home in a deserted lake. The children are sleeping and the girl is cleaning, another empty house on the side for their son at school. OK. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour of stalking around the house, she gets some hang-ups. Oh, scary ones. Wherever her friend comes to the rescue, to find some high school lines about 'love' and whatever. Friend leaves and goes to her car. Until that moment, she drops her keys. Uhhh ... then the music! DumDumDum ..! She fumbles to pick them up, and gets into her car. Of course that doesn't start. How clich√©d is this ..? So. She disappears = D Jill, only again. Mann. (Most of these movies are at herself, so there's not much dialogue). So more hangups, she calls the police. Who says they can't help her, but call back if she has more problems. <br /> <br /> So she suspects her boyfriend is calling or calling her friend's friends. They were just once. As it is supposed to be frightening? Oh, and did I mention? Her friend just came on the caller ID and there was a little ghostly voice going on. She gets everything out and shoots. <br /> <br /> Yes, so skip it. She saw the light in the Mandrakis son's home. So she runs through the woods with music as her companion and enters. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> USE IT, I CAN REPLACE !!!!!!!!!
