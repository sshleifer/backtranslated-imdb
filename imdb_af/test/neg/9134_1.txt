Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this last installment of the trilogy is a major deviation. They have turned away with stock and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his own image in the movie ... It's just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $ 3m to spend, it would have been something. I actually thought Steven Soderbergh had corrected it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio, the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, managed it. I have to accept that they just don't have the budget to make a decent movie. You'd think that Francis Ford Coppola played a role in this movie and helped get more money together.
