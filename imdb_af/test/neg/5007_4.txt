What is wrong with CURACAO (also known as DEADLINE, although the reason for the name change I have no idea) can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover: <br /> <br /> "Keep it off baby , I'm trying to sleep "<br /> <br /> It's not the problem of the problem or how it is delivered, it's the actress's central European accent. Nothing wrong with it until it reveals its character is from Philidelphia in the United States! It struck me about this thriller as I watched it - The way in which accents did not match their characters. Apart from the Philly woman with a German accent, we see a South African with an English accent, a local police chief who seems to be an Irish man depicting a Gestapo officer and worst of all George C Scott plays Afrikaans or English with an accent. It sounds like it might be American with South Africa. You quickly notice what follows on the screen and ultimately focus on what nationality a character can be because of the strange way they speak. It is interesting to note that this site did not give this movie a country of origin. With so many different actors from different countries, you feel it has been produced by the United Nations. <br /> <br /> Even if you're not curious about accents or dialects, you'll probably have to stop following the action because CURACAO plot is less. Things like a boat that explodes, and a hostage situation and the hero is recruited as an agent for South African intelligence, but you keep beating your head and wondering what it will lead.
