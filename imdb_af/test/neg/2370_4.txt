This film is derived from a long-running ITV sitcom of the same name. The Sitcom lasted about half a year and Rigsby, Phillip, Alan, Mrs. Jones and Vienna brought to our screens. <br /> <br /> Then in 1980 the movie version hit the Cinemas. Now Richard Beckinsale unfortunately died and was replaced by Only when I laughed actor Chris Strauli. <br /> <br /> I felt myself giving the movie a different feel. chose if it wasn't shot, as Richard was an important character. It's like having the dirty movie without Godber or Mackay! <br /> <br /> The movie definitely has some classic moments, but it does have a bit of De-Ja -Vu! Many parts were previously seen in the TV series. Now if you've seen the movie first rather than the Series, you'll get a different feel about it than the series lover! <br /> <br /> Say Leonard is definitely top-form and makes the movie just like in the TV series. The movie recently received a new lease of life on DVD and is usually about a quiet weekend on Terrestrial. It's a good movie, but for Rigsby fans you can feel you've seen it before. <br /> <br /> Say it is worth buying / viewing <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
