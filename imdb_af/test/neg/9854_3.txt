I thought this series will be another fun action series with some dynamic plots and good performances. I was wrong. While I love Jamie Denton, this show is not worth watching unless you like to see some people brutalized and the actions of the agents are probably justified by the "national security" theme. The show is a good propaganda for the current government and boasts jingosism as if we were talking that day. After a few episodes, it was boring on hell, and I started looking at House Invaders at BBCAmerica. Rather look at CSI and without a trace, no doubt.
