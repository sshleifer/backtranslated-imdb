If you're an average man like me and have good acting, good plot, good scripts, new ideas or entertainment, you might want to overload this one. I was honestly bored with the opening credits up to the end, but tried to give the movie a chance and watched it all over - just to be disappointed at every turn. <br /> <br /> The acting was incredibly subpar, but I'm not sure if the actors should blame themselves or if it was the ridiculous wood and horrible dialogue along with an even worse writing. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped and I think the audience should get a deeper meaning from it or to pass it somehow, but it will be a waste of time. <Br /> <br /> The film has some kind of rough sexuality that does not serve any purpose other than to display tattoos and underwear. No one seems to have any motivation, except to make money off a kind of investment deal that is never really explained. The relationship between the characters is not very clear, and there is little or no character development. <br /> <br /> It's either a kind of subculture movie meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolutely crazy, but you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 because it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but probably not the worst.
