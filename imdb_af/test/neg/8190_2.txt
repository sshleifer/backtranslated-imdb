I didn't see much movies worse than this one. The story line, the dialogues, the acting: it's horror! The story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between. Every time you think you missed something, but no, it was the way it was meant. And why on earth is the character Jenny Garth so in love with that non-no-loser man (who is actually playing in the movie Cinderella Man with Russell Crow!)? Oh yes, it's not Spielberg, of course ... I have to write ten lines to write. This movie is really not inspiring enough to write 10 lines! It's a romantic, good movie with a bad story, so if you're there, you'll have a ball.
