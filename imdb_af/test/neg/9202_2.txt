First, this film was made in 1978. So it tells you that the movie will be bad anyway. But I'm not saying that all old movies are bad. Secondly, the special effects are terrible for that time. Finally, The acting was so bad, Bozo The Clown did it better. It makes you wonder how people get the money to make these pathetic movies. This movie sucks!
