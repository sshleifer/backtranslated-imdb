OK, before I get here, we get ahead and get the warning out of the way: this movie is the distinctive "cinematic" definition of SLEAZE! There are movies out there that can definitely be out-of-shock or dissatisfied. This movie has WAY more artistic validity than it can be said for this movie's maze. So what makes it so sleepy? Let's take a moment closer to "Wet Wilderness". <br /> <br /> In 1974, for almost nothing, this "rough" has no real true "plot" to talk to others about what would happen if a FAMILY were going to relax in the desert and a spend a day while being fitted by a thick man in a ski mask and looking for a cup of kicks ..... the kind that ends with everyone who is forced to have sex with each other while they are systematically murdered by the masked crawl. Therefore, those who are sensitive to themes dealing with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere. Then the group's "daughter" must be discarded after being forced to have sex with her brother and finding a random black man (!). linked to a tree branch ("... that the thick summer has left me here for 3 days ...") with virtually NO explanation whatsoever! He is saved ..... or is he? Of course not !! They are caught before they can escape, where our murderer forces them to have sex while forcing the mother to enter, with a dead black man (with a hatch through the chest) when all is said. Then our murderer forces the daughter and mother to give him oral sex when one of the women grabs the machete ........ and the movie suddenly ends !!! Just like that! No warning, no fixed points ..... it's just over. Now, maybe there is a real end to this movie (I honestly don't know), but I just saw the extremely rough Alpha Blue Archives version. Their version looks as if its end is completely cut out, or that's how it ends. If it was deliberate, then in Film-up 101, I'm sure there's a kind of dirt over HOW to end a movie, but it shouldn't be like that! Fans of the movie "Psycho" should be happy to hear the soundtrack music because it's all through the movie! I want to be willing to bet that no rights are licensed, anything. Even though it's a "violent" movie, there's not a hell of it, so ghore will find nothing of real use here. None of the violence is shown graphically ..... just the results (one of the victims is stabbed with a cup right above the vagina area). Also, the sex is some of the UNLOCKED sex I've ever seen! The interesting thing about this movie is that it is too ugly to work a movie as an effective erotic porn or to turn someone on, but those with a tendency to find things sleepy, nasty and ugly, but not violent enough to get any real fame with those who are looking for. for something really brutal like "Cannibal Holocaust" or other movies like that. The only "notorious" thing about this steamy pile is that violence has been added to an adult movie, a fairly new concept at that time, especially if you think as porn chic was all the rage and gravel houses filled, 42 things like these games played. to a most dressed group of porn mavens. It wasn't and isn't "mainstream" porn. <br /> <br /> If you were in film school and there was a list of filmmakers, this movie would be a shining example of that lesson! This movie shows what happens when cerebral challenged filmmakers get a "budget" (in this case, probably about $ 142 ..... cuz it looks!) And ignore all the "don'ts" and change them into "do's" ..... yes, this movie is so bad! Another thing: Those who take offense from racial epithetes are also encouraged to look at something else. The black man in the film is verbally abused by his color and the killer is of course racist, but in the early 70's there was no political correctness. I'm not sure a movie like this can be made today. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it won't shock or shake anybody, but those who get out of it. Actually, I got bored. The sex is so ugly and commonplace, it's hard to look with any sense of eroticism, so if you give it a chance you'll thank God for the fast forward button! The "acting", if you want to call it, is at its best amateur (I mean, it's even bad for PORN!) With no reason to care for someone or something about this! If you have to see it anyway, then download it, because you will really feel like a heel when you buy it. Some things are simply worthless ..... and "Wet Wildernes" is. The only thing that is more unpleasant than watching this movie will look at this movie and sit in a theater and watch the others attend it, and suddenly look unsafe. Probably not society's largest collection of thinkers and intellectuals. But if you're for some stupid but SLEAZY porn garbage, give it a crack. It's 54 minutes and yet it feels much longer !! Crackheads would love it! Then again, maybe there is something wrong with me to find out in the first place ...... LOL! Caveat emptor, sleaze-lovers !!
