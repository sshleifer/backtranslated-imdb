It could have been a good movie if more things are explained. Too many plots to find this pleasant. The end is in particular from the left field. SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper come back to Dundee so quickly, and Dundee appeared at home within two minutes? Get out of here. How did Anna get the money? No explanation whatsoever. If Pete, police, knew Lancaster was in danger, why didn't he have a policeman at the door in hospital. These and many more questions remain. Bad because the premise was there, just bad writing and execution. <br /> <br /> Good throwing is wasted here. DeCarlo goes from bad to good to bad? Lancaster's character lacks development and Dureya is just blah as the "bad man". <br /> <br /> It can be re-created with a coherent story line and better writing. Of course it would be much more violent with lots of free sex and everything. The editing will also be jerky, I think, so let's leave well enough alone.
