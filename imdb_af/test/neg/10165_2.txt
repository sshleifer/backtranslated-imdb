To watch this movie, I had the feeling that this thing is missing about 10 to 15 minutes from the start of the story. John Wayne runs out of this trading post / salon in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner over some robberies. All he sees is the signs of a carnage, some dead bodies, signs of battle and no one is living in sight. This is because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in the old English murder story. <br /> <br /> The reason why you find those hidden rooms in such stories is that they were formerly priesthoods. Catholic families who clung to the old faith in England in the 16th century built these things to hide those who were fleeing from the royal authorities because of their faith. Not something you see in the western world, but a good smile. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, due to bad editing or writing or both, we never know exactly what Wayne brought here. But it was a B-western and not even a good one. <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes is here and he is clean shaven and plays a dumb part of the time. An unusual circumstance for the fiery Gabby. <br /> <br /> If you want to save and find out what's happening and see a capricious Gabby Hayes, watch this movie.
