He is the clever marketer, Jess Franco, of course, also agreed to the great temporary success of psychedelic spy films such as Mario Bava's eventually sensational "Danger: Diabolik!". Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar movie, as he can release as many sleazy, kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque plots as he wanted. And he understood it very well, as "The Girl from Rio" turns on a man-hate organization, led by a funky dressed boyfriend, who plans to change all men into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (at least for them), the deadly plans battle with the daily business of a dreaded crime syndicate boss, played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well-presented, but it is a surprisingly poor and unsatisfactory adventure movie. The plot is rich in imagination, but apparently only on paper, as the action is pretty easy. The film is also very colorful ... but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of evil sex. There is a little nudity, certainly, but too little according to normal Franco standards. All the characters were sick in the head, so the least I expected (or hoped for) was more distorted undertones or indignant themes. Franco has, of course, a bigger budget as usual to work with, and I have to say he spends that money well on more convincing pieces and talented members. Veteran actor, George Sanders ("The Damned", "Psychomania") is one of the best players ever to appear in a Franco production. Bad even, he can't save "The Girl from Rio" because it's a big deviation. A legendary Euro smut movie maker like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
