I would hate to see someone who is "inspired by a true story" movie and to draw any conclusions about the real event. Few things they've done are overshadowed by things that just weren't true. Ed Gein never dragged anyone behind a car, never met anyone at the cemetery and killed them, no evidence of returning body parts to the cemetery. The things he did were terrible enough, why try to make it worse? <br /> <br /> This movie is among my 10 worst wastes. "In the light of the moon" is a much better movie on the subject, it is more factual and the play is better than this one.
