I'm glad I didn't pay to see 'The Wog Boy'. <br /> <br /> I was sitting there hopefully waiting for something original and / or funny to happen. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of many of the predictable English comedies of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I won't save a plot summary, I suggest you do something else for 90 minutes <br /> <br />
