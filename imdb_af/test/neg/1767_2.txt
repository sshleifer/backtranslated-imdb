First of all, I'm a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion both these movies have created and defined the Si-Fi Horror Genre as we know it today. I noticed Lifeforce was often compared to the Aliens saga - after watching this movie, I wouldn't agree. There are some good special effects with the alien vampires, and the story line could have been acceptable. I just can't get through the naked woman's vampire throughout the movie, it's absolutely absurd (though she looks good). Add in a bunch of bad British plays and that's pretty much over. Most of the movies take place in London or somewhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the exuberant environment and any hope of a real Si-Fi Horror action and excitement. <br /> <br />
