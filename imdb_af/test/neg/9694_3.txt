Sorry about that. But if you have seen this "epic", you will, of course, know of the total disregard of the true text of the Bible. Now, I'm not exactly following the line for holiness, but I know the basics. And the basics were this. God wanted to wipe everyone off the ground because he believed they were damaged to the point of no return. He chose Noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family had to be spared because of their intact ways. Noah builds an ark as instructed by God to house him, his family, and two of each creature as he overflows the rest of the planet. These are the basics. In this movie you have other people moving around in the sea like peddlers and pirates. But I thought everyone was wiped out. I think the managers at NBC have never been to church. There are other inaccuracies, I am told, but to be the average Joe, I have no idea what it is. Sorry. Back to the movie, it was inaccurate, as said before, the scene storm, but some of the effects were good, I'll give it. But as a whole, I've seen a better and more tasteful version of the story done as a small scene on The Simpsons. God helps NBC executives come to judgment day. 10/03
