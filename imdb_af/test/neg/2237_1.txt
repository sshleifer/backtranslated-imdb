I went to see the movie because my boyfriend was worried about how much he wanted to see it and how his friends were and loved it. So I came in with a neutral attitude and didn't expect the worst. Unfortunately, that's what I got. I can write a 15-page paper on why it's easy THE WORST movie I've ever seen. But to your advantage I will show the benefits and the endless supply of disadvantages. For starters, the play was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also some lines that deserved a laugh and some exciting scenes. Unfortunately, good acting, a little humor and tension are where the good points end. The whole story could have been good. A Jewish girl's family is slaughtered, she is going to hide, later meets the man responsible for her pain and then breeds a great revenge plan. Sounds great. But the movie won't be quite as "satisfying" for the Americans and Jews seeking Nazi blood. I did not kill any problem with World War II movie or Nazis; I saw Defiance and enjoyed it very much. However, this is the way we kill wild heroes. I'll give you a good example of the kind of hypocrisy this movie makes. Our hoodlum gang hits a German unit and kills / scalps all of them except a sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). They ask the sergeant to give out information about another German unit. When he "with respect refuses" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers, he puts his head in a baseball bat, cheers and curses as if they were at a soccer match. They took the Nazi's head off yaaayy! Let's look at the hypocrisy in that scene. Here's a hypothetical situation: A group of American soldiers are captured by the enemy in exile. The same scenario follows and the US commander would rather die than betray his fellow soldier. The enemy robbed his head with great feast. It would insult an audience if this scene was in a movie. That American soldier was a hero to put his men above himself and those savages murdered him brutally! Well, how about the Nazi sergeant? Well, he's a Nazi and deserves the cruel death possible, right? Coincidentally, the Nazis felt the same towards the Jews. See the hypocrisy? By celebrating the Nazi victim, we are putting ourselves on the same sadistic level. <br /> <br /> Big hypocrisy # 2: The Nazis make a propaganda movie about a German sniper that kills nearly 300 US soldiers. At the end of the movie, the film is revealed. Hitler and his cohorts giggle with joy as they watch an American soldier shot from a window and fall into a fountain. The Nazis cherish as a soldier after the soldier falls to the sniper skill. It's supposed to enchant the American viewers of this scene. The evil Nazis laugh at the death of our brave men! Well, the irony is, isn't it the thing we're doing (or should it do) all the time our Inglorious Basterds are watching? Laugh at the pain of others simply because they were the bad guys. How will we feel if native Americans somehow made a hit movie in which they brought vicious revenge on American settlers? Or what made blacks a movie that glorified the Nat Turner Rebellion? Good enough about hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> I'll summarize other reasons for the 1 star rating. 1) There were spectacular admirers in the movie. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by holding his finger in her gunshot because he suspects she has betrayed him. He's the good guy? 2) Scenes dragged on the road longer than they need. 3) Brad Pitt's southern, so-called Tennessee accent is PUBLIC and thoroughly annoying throughout the move. I'll stop now, since I have 700 words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general population doesn't seem to think anymore, they just want blood. And so this movie got such a high position. I recommend this movie to the ignorant or if you are Jewish and just want to see a beautiful "fantasy justice". Personally, when I finally got out of the movie, I felt like I was being chased (or wish I had it, I wouldn't have had more than 2 hours of mental rape).
