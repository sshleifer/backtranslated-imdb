1940's cartoon, which today is banned for the "Black Beauty" gag, in which Daffy is riding a black person as a horse. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place in a bookshop where the characters of The Books come to life every night. So we have the Ugly Duck (Daffy) and the Wolf Wallstreet. They swallow in the rush after the wolf hit Daffy with a fake duck (ie the title). <br /> <br /> And chase, everything is in this little cartoon, which doesn't really appeal today. Just fun if you're a real fan of the Looney Tunes, I think ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
