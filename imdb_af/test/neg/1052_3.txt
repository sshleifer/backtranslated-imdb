Physical Evidence is one of those movies you want to keep, but should be really much better than it actually is. Developed as a successor to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it gives the impression that everyone involved just made it while waiting for something better to come along. The point of departure is perfectly serviceable, it's mostly technically efficient if it gets terribly uninspired with even Henry Mancini's musacky score surprisingly pleasing, but you can't help feeling that things would have been better if one of the prospects seems to be the killer is rumored was originally the case). As the opening scene of his last seen, personally disastrous Heat (1986) showed, Reynolds has all the deeds of a big screen. As there is, there are few surprises and a sense of half-hearted filming by numbers, as it builds a couple of intertia, as it is unimportant to a less-than-big-will-do? final. <br /> <br /> Reynolds is fine, penetrating charisma into what is clearly a star vehicle. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Theresa Russell. An impressive and fearless actress in Nic Roeg's husband's films, which allows her to dip into the dark side of human nature, is trapped in a part that requires star quality, rather than depth, and she doesn't spade it no. She doesn't flash her lines or bump into the other actors, but it's about everything that can be said in favor of her surprisingly stunned and often amateur performance that makes the movie fall bad. Apart from Ned Beatty's prosecutor, the supporting cast only adds a slightly surrealistic presence in a Boston, where everyone has a bad disguised Canadian accent and the streets have an exciting deal with Toronto and Montreal. <br /> <br /> Also director Michael Crichton, who showed in Westworld, Coma and The First Great Train Robbery that he knew how to lean an audience on the side of their seats, seems like the action on a purely perfected way is handled. It doesn't even come together and looks almost arbitrary. The climax itself has no flair and is completely deprived of threat or danger, and many scenes are played for much less than they are worth. It's not a big surprise that Crichton, in addition to undeclared reshoots on the 13th Warrior, has sincen't been targeted. <br /> <br /> This is a notion that is mature in an 80-year-old TV movie, even though it never promises its opening. Whether it's enough for a reason to watch is down to individual taste.
