The director doesn't know what to do with a camera ... too many options and she always counts the wrong one ... she takes travolta control ... and he controls the movie from start to finish. . The characters are not developed ... maybe because we have to watch them sing ... no pace, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow ... missed: travolta OK ... johansson, she's too big to be a 18 ... even though she's really 20 ... <br /> <br /> the happy ending? Well, there seems to be one, so the story is sad, but not too sad. Travolta doesn't know how to play a guitar, but the director doesn't seem to care too much about being out of the way. ... <br /> <br /> The idea is the only thing that is wonderful ... but how did she develop it? Well, it's just full of stereotypes and lines have heard too much ... <br /> <br /> too bad, another missed opportunity ...
