As if the world had not yet had enough cheap Jaws imitation, writer Boaz Davidson decided to make the sequel to his quirky, but reasonably pleasing creature. Octopus, a complete rip-off of Spielberg's classic, a concern policeman who believes no one, and a mayor more concerned about his fourth celebration of fourth and human lives. <br /> <br /> Even in the hands of an extremely competent director, it is unlikely that this derivative litter could be anything other than Hokey B movie rubbish, but with Yossi Wein (yes, the Yossi Wein!) the shots behind the camera, a man with a break from Mr. Spielberg's talent (I estimate about 1/10000), Octopus 2 is guaranteed to be as bad as you can imagine! <br /> <br /> The predictable and extremely clickable plot is not worth describing (replacing Jaws' Amity Island with New York and Bruce the Shark with a giant rubber octopus and you get the core), though Several points about the movie I am definitely worth mentioning, just because they are so funny: All the octopus attacks involve the actors struggling to make incredible false-giant tentacles look, which is actually screaming.
