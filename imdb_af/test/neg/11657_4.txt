This movie seems to be rushing to release for some reason. Definitely not a well-made movie. So incredible. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) was the center and walking among the people was a farce. There will be no chance that the ordinary people will be in that situation within 30 meters of the President in that situation. If it wasn't for the blood and the curse, it was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents have never been realized in this movie. Shatner's play is good. The production values ​​in this movie leave much to be desired. Overall, I think most people will be better off wasting time to see this matter.
