wow, this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> This movie was an embarrassment to the original sandlot. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible. Every part except the part of the 'Mexican' Sandlot Manager was terrible. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry, although only a few parts was absolutely horrible. It was the worst role ever. Even the kid actor who plays him as a child is someone you want, even in the end, lol. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of those kids movies that are going to do the extra mile, which makes a little goofy. past the funny stage. The humor was for 6 year olds. <br /> <br /> If you are older than 12 and want something that you have to look at, watch this movie and look at a sitcom.
