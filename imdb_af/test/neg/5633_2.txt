This movie had to be watched when it was hung on development stage and to get a Redgrave and a Jacobi on board, the cashiers had to be excited. All I can say is that they clearly had nothing. Jacobi camped it in the way that only Jacobi could do and I thought he looked more like the actor he played in Frasier a few years ago in his cameo role. Vinnie Jones isn't really bad, he's just clear from his depth as a leading man. He really loves the whole thing and if it was a pilot for a TV show, it might just have uploaded. However, the slide and camera work was frightening. Quite why this "jounalist" and a press officer of the Met ever work together is never explained. This can certainly not have been due to the sexual chemistry of which there is none. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far-fetched plot that you can pass as original, but the whole thing is just as adapted to the two stories at all. It was confusingly edited in just two stories to make two hours. Check out dry paint for a few days. Your life will be more fulfilled than watching this garbage
