Anyone who sees this movie will see the makers throwing a lot of money in this movie. Interestingly, they called the title "The Hole"! The production values ​​are good for a short movie. The hole tries to look great budget in some ways but is hampered by the video format on which it was shot. I wonder if it was shot at 35mm, it would look incredible and raise the contents slightly. Many Hollywood movies look good and it's enough for an audience, regardless of story and content. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. Maybe Ishimoto's next movie will deliver.
