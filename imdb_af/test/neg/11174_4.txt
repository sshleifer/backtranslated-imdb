Well, I was hoping I had heard about this movie because I was a big fan of Ruggero Deodato and didn't want to see him. but unfortunately, this Giallo-style supernatural load of nonsense is just as bad as I was led to believe it was - and it's pretty awful! The plot doesn't work at all, as the film seeks to mix murders and a supernatural theme through a phone, and it all feels very forced and stupid. In addition, the plot doesn't make much sense, and you have to ask yourself "what's the point" several times in the movie. The plot focuses on a young woman living in a block of flats and being terrorized by a telephone. The best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of beautiful English actress Charlotte Lewis, and unfortunately the good points stop there pretty much. There are a handful of death scenes, some of which are gory; But everyone who is incredibly stupid is the one who sees someone being murdered by coins, especially in that respect. Overall, I really can't recommend it to anyone; Non-Deodato fans are unlikely to be impressed, and Deodato fans are likely to find the film depressed. Avoid!
