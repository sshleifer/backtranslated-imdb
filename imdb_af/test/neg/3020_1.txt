It's just what we need, a show about people who don't like anyone in high school or college. Man or woman. People who object and congratulate themselves on doing so are exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking. And this show is just disgusting to do just that. So four men sit in chairs and watch two other guys trying to pick up women to have sex with them. And in the end, one of the two wins, big ... just f-n big. I'm also supposed to accept these four shower bags as "judges" of people's "game". The term "game" must be the most moronic thing to come from modern English since the term "Bling Bling", adding that these men are called "experts", just make me want to throw away what is left of My respect for the modern culture. These are not goddamn role models, they are the result of MTV culture that bites us in the ass. If you enjoy the bullshit that wastes the sides of this monstrosity, then you probably think that Paris has Hilton and Britany Spears talent. This is not true and you have to be ashamed of yourself to think so. <br /> <br /> And for all the people who will say I want it better if I'm laid or just jealous. Go screw yourself because it is clear that a real girl will definitely not.
