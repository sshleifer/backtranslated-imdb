I must prescribe this comment with a kind of recording: I think I just have a soft spot for the original TV series of the 60's. I think the filmmakers have made it so far that it will be in the show: in a supposed remake, audiences will look at hip reflections, athletic Linc (Clarence Williams III) or the cool, with Michael Cole, and so on ahead. Instead, we get Giovanni Ribisi as a poor-white-white rich boy who is just as pathetic as he is in all his roles. (In the office I was working on, I am once amused myself by creating a fake movie scene, pouring on several actors as office staff members, guessing who I throw as the brave son of the company's president?). Danes does OK as the new July, but none of the characters have much to do, as the story just sits there, in conventionality. So this is also quite forgetful. What did I talk about?
