I saw it on the strength of Albert Finney alone. He is one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just stupid. It's about a little boy who is about to be born, but when his mother goes to work, he refuses to come out! It sends God and the whole human factory into crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to convince the boy to change his mind and decide to be born. So Finney takes the unborn son for an adventure in the Big Apple hoping to show him all the reasons he wants to live. <br /> <br /> Despite the ridiculousness of the plot, I could have accepted it if the director did not try to turn it into your typical Hollywood sentimental moralistic message movie. Directly, the film was made unbearable by a horrendous soundtrack of the sentimental music that could not resist the Hollywood directors. <br /> <br /> He also devoured the somewhat unconventional story by giving away his hand at any moment. Whatever turns around and turns in the store was completely given away by the way the story is unraveled. It was as if the director had accepted the audience, just a bunch of idiots who could not see the obvious tips of a mile away. <br /> <br /> Even Finney was in his actions, though satisfactory, a little uncomfortable and out of place; and the little boy with curly locks, though he had to be cute, was actually tough. Bridget Fonda intended to duplicate Demi Moore's performance in 'Ghost'. At a moment's notice he poured tears. <br /> <br /> I understand that the movie has been unsuccessful so far to get distribution in the US, which is surprising I think it has the cash potential to be a modest hit, which is attractive to both children and sentimental adults. Regarding quality, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not very good. (4 out of 10)
