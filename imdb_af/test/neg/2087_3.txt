Just Desserts was, I must say, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was terrible and even the plot line was laughable. I gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because I like to laugh at ominous weird movies. My expectations weren't high to start with, but it was more than I expected. I thought it might not be as bad as it started, but as soon as the competition - The Golden Whisk - emerged, I started to change my mind. It all went down there. The only thing I liked about this movie was watching them cook. However, as a dough chef movie, there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked something. I would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie. You will see the more food being prepared, and you avoid the pathetic one-liners. But if you enjoy corny love stories, sometimes fun, go ahead and watch.
