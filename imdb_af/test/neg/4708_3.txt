I know ... I know: it is difficult (if not paradoxical) because there is such a thing as "credible" fantasy. But to me, there is also such a condition in which too much inability interferes or derives from my general opinion of the movie. The latter was the case for me regarding Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have too many unanswered questions about the storyline, but some of the plays were also a bit at the top. (Maybe it's the writing: ask them to put too many trite, predictable, cleaved (over) reactions.) Others said enough about the plot. I just wish it was done - and I think it could have been - more convincing. P. S: This is a VARSE comment about this movie. I just watched it a few minutes ago. not a reminder of years ago.
