As previously mentioned in other comments, NVA's major problem is that it cannot decide what it wants, the best of the cheapest type or an honest parody of the East German army. There are a few moments that move a lot, for example, when one of the recruits returns from the Schwedt army with a completely broken personality. But in the end, Leander Hau√ümann goes for the infantile humor. No wonder the film has been running at the German cashier's office because it is historically unreasonable for the real situation in the training camps and led by an actor who unfortunately is unable to give a nuanced performance. <br /> <br /> However, there is the camera work by Frank Griebe who does a wonderful job - as always. If it wasn't for his beautiful images, I'd have rated the movie much worse.
