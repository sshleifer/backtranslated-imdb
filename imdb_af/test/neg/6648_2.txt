It's a movie that should have been a mini-series, as it tries to over-infuse a space. The whole story is constantly bombarded with subplots, character introduction and meaningless pieces of information that go nowhere. There is an underlying plot where the boy meets a girl, she has doubts, but at least marries and then her dubious surface and she's going to see if they're real. They didn't seem to be, but her husband wouldn't believe she wasn't unreliable and her almost boyfriend didn't want her because she wasn't unfaithful to her husband. That said, there are no fewer than 1000 subtypes and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible. In the first 15 minutes you will be inundated with so many things and situations that you just cease to care about. You don't care about any of the tangled and screwed rolls moving in and out of the story, like vultures that feed on a corpse. Everyone comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer. After half an hour, and completely uninteresting, I stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours from pure morbid curiosity. I couldn't think of where it was going, but as if I was staring at a fire, I couldn't get up and turn off. The production values ​​are wonderful, but the resulting film is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.
