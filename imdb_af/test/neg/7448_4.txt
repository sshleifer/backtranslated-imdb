I was a big fan of the original Robocop. <br /> <br /> But to say I was disappointed by this first successor would be an understatement. <br /> <br /> The problems are a lot. <br /> <br /> Glossy although the movie may look, there are many bloopers on the screen for everyone to see, threads, cameramen, etc. something I find totally unacceptable to someone from Irvin Kreshner's family tree. <br /> <br /> Robocop has become a robot. There is no human spark in the character to be found here. A real disappointment when one believes that his "soul" has returned at the end of the first movie. Here his posture shows no human side and makes it difficult to sympathize with. <br /> <br /> Caine is a poor villain. OK I know Boddiker of the first movie was better than average, mainly thanks to Kurtwood Smith's performance, but the usually solid Tom Noonan creates a character you couldn't give in any way. <br /> <br /> What happened to the Old Man ????. I appreciate that he has not reached where he is, as he is "nice", but the change in his character here is nothing but dumbfounding. In the first movie it was made clear that he despised Dick Jone's tactics and attitude and yet he was no better than Jones. It is no use. <br /> <br /> Doctor Faxx is a poor substitute for Bob Morton's charismatic, if unpleasant, OCP resident genius. <br /> <br /> The action series, save the sequence where Murphy stuck to Caine's truck side, is hard and nasty and pushes rather than entertain. <br /> <br /> And finally. What's with the musical score? Don't tell me. Poledouris could not have done so, simply because he worked at Total Recall at the time. A series (TV or Movie) of soundtrack is part of his personality. Part of his character. Removing it will familiarize you with the characters we look at. So it's bad enough, but shame on Leonard Rosenman. His score here is lousy, camp and dull. <br /> <br /> The story has its moments to be fair. There is a lot of originality in this. But it tries too many new things to go into one movie. Hob is a well-known villain and the only really unsuitable "villian" in the move, Thumbs to Gabriel Damon there. <br /> <br /> The final confrontation between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. <Br /> <br /> But for the vast majority of its long time it is a serious disappointment.
