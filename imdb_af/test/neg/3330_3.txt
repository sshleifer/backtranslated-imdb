A group of 7 gold prospectors are going to a mine that was recently reopened after an earthquake. Of course, they do not pay attention to the local legend that there is something there and kill people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick followed a little cult and I'm not quite sure why (unless it's because it's so obscure). I will admit that the last half hour is quite entertaining, but the hour there is pure torture. A lot of walking and talking and our titular strangeness does not last up to 45 minutes. Even in the extras, co-author Chris Huntley acknowledges that it is the unpardonable sin of boredom. I would forgive them if they were strictly amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I hope they know an exploitation competition should be exploitation. Anyway, as I said, the last half hour was cool, as three survivors fought the stop motion sample and there's a cool John Carpenter-like score. I wanted to see more of the sample, but it's literally 45 seconds on the screen. <br /> <br /> Even if the movie isn't the best, Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and audio comments by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Sawicki and co-author Huntley. The stories about how the film was made are very fascinating and inspiring (like a cave set in a backyard). More importantly, Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shortcuts, which are actually all better than the distinctive production. Huntley was a fairly talented artist and it is a pity that he did nothing further. Sawicki worked in Hollywood as a visual and camera effect. The movie's VHS is a kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure it's much better. But you still get scenes where the only image is five helmets in the black storm. Safe to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still a "horror movie in a mine" champion.
