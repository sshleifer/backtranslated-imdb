It was a shockingly bad movie and for the first time I saw the Blue Shields first. Imagine the worst Blue Screen special effects you've ever seen make it somehow much worse, combining it with poorly made rubber and Play-doh puppets that look like a semi-delayed preschool art class . Then add a few screams, Yngwie Malmstein-esquire, melody-metal guitar solos things that are too hard and expensive too long. The overall film is absolutely horrible and makes "Feeders" like "Rashomon." She's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, with every quantifiable metric spiral, downhill, like a water drop in the everlasting, slow-moving whirlpool of a broken Rest Stop toilet. Yet, a movie like "Actium Maximus" should not be missed by the bad movie congressmen out there, even if it's just to look for clips on YouTube or somewhere. This movie is a little eye-catcher, if you can stomach the ride. However, I think this director may be mentally ill, which is a bit destructive. To watch him discuss the project, you get the feeling that he really believes he has created something wonderful. I think he's the "Star Wars Child" of gono movies. What a mess. :-)
