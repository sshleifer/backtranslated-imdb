I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangular friendship between a girl and two boys. While living this situation and getting lost, I hope a similar story will inspire me. <br /> <br /> My main concerns are: - Why (a) & How (b) does the triangle form? <br /> <br /> (a) The movie offers a simple answer: "because it's better!" <br /> <br /> (b) here it is an open triangle: the three share things together. Mine was a closed one: each one knows the other, but never the three are gathered or talking about the missing. <br /> <br /> (c) The film does not offer spoken explanations, but rather prefers visual and emotional assumptions: the end comes with sensuality, sexuality comes in the triangle, or more accurately, when for one member deep feelings tied with intimacy, and, as for the former and former, they can be divided. I agree with that. <br /> <br /> (d) In the movie and in my story, silence is proof that something is not good. And in an ironic and painful way, the tool for these sad times. , is always the phone: I lived this terribly intended phone call: "Call me back: I'm waiting for you" ?? And when the time comes, is the phone silent? A variation is also shown when the line is connected, but one refuses to speak ?? All the screens were very hard to see for me. <br /> <br /> If the movie was a great help in that way, he also had many mistakes: <br /> <br /> - I zapped on the boy's family problems <br /> <br /> - Why the shower scene on the DVD cover is cut on the film? <br /> <br /> - How does Mickael finally get into the hotel? <br /> <br /> - Does Cl√©ment always see Salome? he says "no" but has her address; and who is the girl with him in the bar: his girlfriend? how can she know the address ??? <br /> <br /> - what happens to Vanessa: the ring at the final shoot is evidence of engagement ??? with whom ?????
