What if someone made a horror movie that was completely without plot? <br /> <br /> Well, I think it'll probably end up like this one. I don't think I ever saw a move, was so steady that it was the hackneyed slide (at the beginning) to finish the crap (at the end). I just sat in it because I thought it couldn't get any worse. Well, to the end, "Necrophagus" / "Graveyard of Horror" showed me wrong. <br /> <br /> Who would have suspected a movie with a walking herd-man, evil grave-robbing cultists, and crazy scientists being thrown in for no observable reason could be bad? One would think there would be at least some humor ... but not here.
