In one sense, I liked this movie because of a "bad", positive atmosphere that carries this kind of. I had a problem with an aspect of the plot, but more about it later. First, the characters were a bit goofy and one dimensional. The "good people" had similar physical and character traits, and the "bad people" have similar physical and traits ... hmmm. The basic storyline was OK (fairly simple and standard) - nothing too exciting or offensive. The main attraction was, of course, the miniature dinosaurs - kind of a nice fantasy element to have. However, they had a very minimal presence in the movie. <br /> <br /> Besides, the movie kept up a quick pace and didn't cut it in one place. I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the plot has to do with the idea of ​​"stealing". I think this movie may not have been thought enough - something is wrong, especially if it is a child's movie. I will abstract the next to not be a spoiler (skip it if you're worried). The 'good guys' do a little stealing and they don't have the same information as the audience - so it just steals and it's a bad thing for a child's movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you're kids, because of a dubious plot aspect I'm considering. However, this whole movie is pretty low anyway, so it shouldn't matter. Pass this one if you have any other interesting choices.
