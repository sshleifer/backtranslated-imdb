To be hones, I kept this presentation and watched regularly, but now (thank you!) I don't understand why I watched it. Sex and the City is one of the most sensible and abusive TV shows I've ever seen. I really didn't get the point of this show, despite trying. People say sex and the city are funny. In what way? By cursing all the time, talking about vibrators and the size of the penis? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the plot: we have four girls trying to find a perfect man by sleeping with every dork that comes. And this show is about four spoiled chicks sleeping with every man in town, but eventually they admit that the best fun comes from the penis vibrators. And yes ... the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every relationship. If you can have a good sex, you are a good man (or woman). It doesn't matter if you want to be loyal and have a good heart. The size matters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is also bad acting. The four main actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis) are so bad and unconvincing that it makes me just look at this show. Parker always shouts and complains all the time, Cattral shows her old boobs and always says the f - word, Davis gives her smile (and nothing else) and Nixon acts as if she is bored all the time. And yes ... men are sex - hungry pigs in this show. But, according to this show, women are not much better. This show is offensive to men and women. The women are shown as primitive and emotionally, as they have no heart, just hungry for sex. It is insulting to everyone. <br /> <br /> Sex and the city are one of the worst TV shows and I'm glad the show ended because it produces bad acting and useless stories. The whole world is not just about sex and vibrators.
