It was an interesting adaptation of William Shakespeare's last known solo play, but in my humble opinion, a terrible one. Jarman tries to change the personality of the characters for a start. He makes Miranda insane after holding on the island for so long. Prospero is no different - a mix of madness and self-pity on his part. I couldn't think Shakespeare thinks his characters are something like the way Jarman portrays them. <br /> <br /> Caliban's appearance is perhaps the only thing he has right, but then I was under the impression that Caliban is a devastated, deformed monster, but apparently a mad accelerator, a northern man constantly harass, not as I would imagine. Ferdinand makes a short look, the closest time and quiet. <br /> <br /> In fact, to the point, I stopped looking at this terrible adjustment, they were cut off so many lines from the play. If anything, I think Jarman has tried to rewrite Shakespeare and include his most scenes. So much text is cut out in the first part, it doesn't make it a Shakespeare game, but a load of 70-year-old melodramatic, ominous rubbish. <br /> <br /> An endeavor to interpret this scene more realistically in the end, but this play was never a realistic one, and nothing like the text shows it.
