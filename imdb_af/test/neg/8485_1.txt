I can not believe it! I thought it was a good sequel when Jim was in the movie, but a baby, but rather a movie with crappy actors, stupid and intimate scene. It should be in 'crappest movies of sh * t in the earth'. Thanks, the same director didn't make it, because it's so stupid with some cartoon-like parts like the fart was not funny, not the shit and not the dance! I laughed at it because of how stupid the person made it like homer Simpson to make a movie about a donut! I wish someone made a repeat of the boy's mask with a plot like this! The masquerade (Jim wears) and his wife have a boy who is a normal baby. When the baby gets another mask, he has also become the mask and the mask man tries to get his mask back! This is very crap, so I'll get it a 1 out of 10. Fu * king sh * t!
