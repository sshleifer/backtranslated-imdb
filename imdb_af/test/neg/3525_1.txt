Let me see ... I've seen all the movies Lou Ferrigno made. I saw Batman & Robin ... twice. I memorized the dances in Breakin '2: Electric Boogaloo ... I watched unfinished Blade Runner rip-off student movies ... but this movie is the painful thing I've ever seen. <br /> This was the first movie for "straight to video market." So thank you Blood Cult for all the mysterious Michael Dudikoff movies at your local Blockbuster. You need to know it's not even a high quality video. This is consumer grade. It's your dad's video camera he never used. That's what you have to look for for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will not drill you with plot details, as I get drowsy but just think about it, but I'll tell you the movie is a form of torture. I just look at this movie if I'm angry with myself. So I recommend this movie if you are suicide or if you are a powerful challenge. <br /> <br /> If you rent this movie (God has grace), you will know what you are from the first 10 minutes. This is when you are hit by the usual horror movie intro. You know the drill. There is a lot of tension and build-up before a girl dies. Yes, you have seen it before, but not so. It's the most boring intro I've ever seen. I honestly believe you can get an ebay camera for ten dollars, grab the bum that smells like gin and candy, and tell him to movie your mom-cooking meal and it would be more interesting than this intro. It bored me to tear. I cried like a baby. <br /> <br /> One of the things that make this movie so painful is its actors. Yeah, I saw bad acting. TRUST ME. I saw 4th class productions by Oliver Twist with more realistic dialogue. The main actor makes me sick. The "supporting" actress is a train wreck of a human. <br /> <br /> I won't even comment on the boyfriend. True horror. <br /> <br /> So rent this movie if you can find it. You will never be depressed to spend 3 dollars on anything else.
