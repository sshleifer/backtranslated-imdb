The opening was a steal of "Eight-legged Freaks", a movie that is all that is not one. Stilted and pedestrians are the words that apply - along with others who cannot be repeated. Drifter type returns to his home (?) Town, meets old friends, etc ... The usual, annoying child, single mother, local hardmaker, and so on. Special effects, alien ship, atmospheric disturbances (hey, did not see the director "Close meetings"?). Good acting? Good story? Good camera angles? Good cut? Not here! Don't rent unless you share the cost and have lots of beer. Don't watch television, rather drink lots of beer - you'll enjoy it!
