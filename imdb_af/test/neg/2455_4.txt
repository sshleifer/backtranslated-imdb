From 1936 to 1939, Peter Lorre had a series of highly successful mr. Moto films made. While technically B-movies, they were much better than typical movies of the genre. Lorre, however, is tired of making these highly repetitive films and telling friends that he wanted the series. When it was canceled in 1939, Lorre was excited, but his plans to get more complex and satisfying roles did not arise when he moved to Columbia Pictures. ICELAND OR DOMEDES BUT is one of those movies and it's pretty clear that the studio doesn't put much effort into the movie, because I think the plot was written by penguins. Talented penguins, maybe ... but still the movie made little sense. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy who agrees to be a government resident agent. He is infiltrating an island in the US where something strange is wrong. Now they can easily get a search query to do this. But because the penguins wrote the film, the agent took the rap for a murder, and he didn't commit a year in jail. He apparently hopes he will be on this island, as many parolees are sent there when they complete the term. <br /> <br /> There are some serious issues with this idea. First, they only served him a year before he had parole - but he was found guilty of MURDER and refused to reveal who he really was. They will never peer anyone into such a case. Second, what if he wasn't placed on the island? He would not have been in prison for a whole year! Thirdly, why not just divers or paratroopers or police officers come to the island? Talk about a contracted plot! <br /> <br /> Once on the island, the agent discovers that evil Peter Lorre has set up his own private prison and staffed it with men on parole as slave labor. What about the men who have to report to their parole officials? It has never been explained, but Lorre uses them to mine diamonds and they are horribly treated. Now, another question I had was that if Lorre discovered big diamonds there, he was a very rich man. So why don't people just pay for the diamonds? Why set up your own version of Devil's Island and kill the men? <br /> <br /> Eventually Lorre gets what she is and the island's slaves are released. Unfortunately I didn't really care. Overall, viewable but rather stupid. Lorre's career only took a turn for the better when he moved to Warner Brothers the following year. With movies like ICELAND OR DOMEDE MEN, I could see why his stay in Columbia was short.
