When Las Vegas came out, one review described this show as a harmless piece of fluff. Needless to say that after seeing a dozen or so episodes I think this description is right on the money. A variety of beautiful boys and strut models play a variety of paper thin stories while always trying to pretend to be serious business people. One-dimensional characters, in a one-dimensional environment, following one dimensional stories. It pretty much makes Vegas up. I'm still watching from time to time to see if the show is trying to develop and take itself a bit, but unfortunately it doesn't work. So far.
