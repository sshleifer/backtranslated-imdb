It was just a horrible movie. I watched it once when I was about 12, I'm now 19 and I don't think I'll ever forget this movie. <br /> <br /> I still feel sick when I think about it, it was just everything that might fit into one movie. I really don't understand what kind of person this total garbage will enjoy. It's not enough just to eliminate your thoughts to enjoy this movie, but I can enjoy the dull Disney movies as much as the next person, but that's something else completely. <br /> <br /> Usually, I don't like judging a movie until I see it myself, but believe me I favor you. Don't see this movie.
