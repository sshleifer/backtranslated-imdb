Where on earth do I start with the mess that Darkhunters is? First, the screenplay is one of the worst ever to come on a cinema or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly rated Stephen King rip-off. At one point, the suspiciously frightening dark hunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who helps the guy he drives, is as annoying as "a horn in a citizen". I'll laugh when I finish it - BUT I ARE NOT! Just as ridiculous is how Carol originally has the power to see people die. A Kat gave it to her when she kept it in a car accident, she had as a child. WHAT ???????? <br /> <br /> Secondly, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever. It cannot be helped by the fact that all the action happens during sharp, broad daylight. Not very atmospheric. <br /> <br /> Third, the play is really awful. Pinion again proves to have to speak in his mother tongue to be credible even remotely. Jeff Fahey is apparently on an automated pilot, but how can he blame him if he runs through a prettiest Humphry Bogart simulation like Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? Credit must go to Susan Paterno, an actress I didn't know, she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other, more experienced actors into shame. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even explain how the human character can understand what Van Husen's character says to her. She obviously has a degree in foreign languages. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, one moment is good, the car accident with Susan. The sfx is completely credible and if it wasn't for the hilarious storyline, it was an applause. <br /> <br /> All I can say about dark haunters is that British horror will never recover from its irreversible decline as films like this are still made and shown. Avoid this movie like the pest, though the pest would be terrifying. <br /> <br /> Darkhunters 0/5 <br /> <br /> p. The insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too intelligent are honest hilaries. This is a poor defense when some claim "you didn't like it because you didn't understand it". The letters to my name make you a fool, not me.
