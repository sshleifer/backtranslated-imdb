"The new hope of Romanian theater" ... if that is the new hope, then I would not really like to see the saving hero of such a productive theater (Romanian theater, that is). Now seriously, where do I start? 1. The crappy scenario: you're joking, it's not even credible, it's not a high degree of stupidity. 2. The direction: what direction? This movie had at least psychological tension, as they decided to make it look as trashy as possible. Okay, I admit that Radu Muntean is not Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list goes on), but at least the minimum effort will be appreciated. 3. The language: Okay, I don't understand why each of the Romanian directors believe that if you make the movie as miserable and obscene as possible, then you have art. I don't care for express language or bad image quality as long as the final result makes it worthwhile. In this case it is not. There is nothing to say, since everything that this movie wants to say has been told a thousand times, the characters are painted too thin to be memorable. The shocking events that occur are also poorly illustrated and become unimportant. This film is based only on the self-induced emotions, on the "we need" hype. Someone is murdered, so "we MUST" feel sad, scared or panicked, someone has gone through it and it must feel "WE MUST" in a certain way. It's baloney. Because a movie is a fiction, nothing is really here. So, the only real emotions are those you discover when you walk deep into the world (the movie is it) <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
