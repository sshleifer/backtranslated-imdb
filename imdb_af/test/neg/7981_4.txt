I was recently in a stage release of this play. And on the last day of the run I was excited to see it playing on TV. I held a tape as it was late at night, and I watched it the next day. I must say I was very disappointed. The actors in the film made little of the discoveries in the screenplay. This is understandable, as the redraw process is probably different, but it was disturbing to see. Much of the original script has also been changed for the movie to make it better for the screen but I don't know if it didn't help the movie at all. I just gave these 4 stars because I know the writing and the writing is much better than this film depicts.
