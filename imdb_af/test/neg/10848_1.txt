Don't buy this movie for comedy value as I did, I didn't find it a bit funny, but so f ****** miserable and lame it is incredible. I gave it to a friend for Christmas which was very funny (on my side). I recently heard that he looked at it and told me what a ** i am! <br /> <br /> There is nothing frustrating about looking at an over-light, dramatic, poorly-recorded scene in which the camera sits on a tripod ... the movie is really pathetic, and I can just say DONT BE THIS MOVIE !!!! !!!!!!!
