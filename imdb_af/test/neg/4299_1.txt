I found this movie on the flea market for cheap. I was so psyched because I thought it was a skateboard movie. I turned on the house, the apron tiles and the opening scene with the old guy rolling on the skateboard was wonderful. At that moment I realized it was a post-apocalyptic movie, but I still have great hope for it. This movie was terrible. A friend of mine was stoned out of his mind when we looked at it and even he thought it was terrible and a waste to be high. I fell asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was terribly horrible. I do not know whether during the apocalypse all the good music and music just as crazy are destroyed, and everyone's memory of how to play it is cleaned clean, but I think I would rather die than that endure shit. Also what was hell at the TV studio? I can only assume that this movie is adapted from an ancient Greek play, with names and titles, but some plays are not meant to be adapted to a futuristic scientific environment. Or at least not by the people involved in this movie. If you are forced to watch this movie, I can only suggest bringing a handgun and closing yourself before the end. It will be a good movie to kill yourself, everyone will understand why.
