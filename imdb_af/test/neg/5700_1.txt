It must have been a long time since I saw such a bad movie. I have to say it's really hard to make a good and / or realistic movie about air disasters, but this movie was such a waste of time and money. Also I think it's an unofficial way to get a bad reputation on Airbus. Firstly, the cabin looks much like an Airbus cabin. Secondly, you have a stick, the third with the use of computers to control paddlers / aileron via "fly through wire". When I watched this movie, I thought the movie's intention was: "Don't fly with computerized airplanes like Airbus, use Boeing, but they have a direct connection between steering and steering." <br /> <br /> All I can say: Bad story, horrible acting (most of the actors), the worst movie trick ever ...
