I wrote it for my birthday in a box called Broke Skull. Well, after watching one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised, I plucked this sucker. It was worse than I expected, and I didn't expect much. This movie is basically a winding story about a man who dies and returns with the crowd. There were some interesting ideas in this that were never followed. Now everyone said there were many gores, can anyone tell me? I have seen a bad effect of a crushed head, brain tissue (or something ...), and blood twice from the penis area. I have to say the part where the man gets his head off the head tore me, that was the only good thing about this movie. And that gay sex scene was just thrown there for no reason. The acting in this was Atrocious, really, it blew. That Asian chick was annoying, then the annoying Mexican boyfriend coming in was just killed. I say if you get it in a box, it's good, but don't waste money on it.
