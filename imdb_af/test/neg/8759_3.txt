Well, I saw a lot of reviews on this one, and many promo have always shown the decay scene. But this movie is a difficult one. And I mean it in every way. It's hard to find a copy, because it was a low budget independent release and because MPAA was chasing every hunting copy on VHS, it didn't appreciate it, but it had to be named for the MPAA. So copies in the underground scene disappeared. All the people involved in this movie never did anything else in the biz. So this made this movie unique. VHS copies hardly ever appear on ebay or other websites and if they do, you pay a $ 100 to get one. But because of American connections, I could catch a release on DVD sold worldwide. Limited, but it was a kind of official one. Occasionally there are a few more shows of this explosion. But is it worth having all the hype about it? As mentioned earlier, it's a difficult one to catch, but also to go through. There are gory murders, there are nekrofilia, there is nudity, but there is also much talk between the hairdressers. And to be honest, if you want to see the movie in 5 minutes, look to the end, it's a glimpse into the killer's thoughts. The blood is flowing and indeed, it's a spicy festive season, but not the full 80 minutes. The quality of the film is okay, sounds good, no lift, color okay, black is black and not blue as in very low budgets. It's okay to see it, but you'll never be scared, but it's one to watch with your friends with a beer and a pizza I think. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
