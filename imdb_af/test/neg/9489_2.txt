I saw it once at my son-in-law's house when it appeared on TV and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. Well, she can. <br /> <br /> See, I can occasionally enjoy a chick fly as long as it's good. But this one is extra juicy, unrealistic, and just predictable, despite some decent performances by Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It is unpleasant how quickly a woman can accept that she is taken away from her. Oh yes, they say love is blind ... <br /> <br /> The neat and neat happy end has almost made me. And how often did we need Otto Kruger to repeat the title? It didn't happen once, not twice, but THREE times!
