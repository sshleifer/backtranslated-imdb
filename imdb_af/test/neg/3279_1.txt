The acting was bad, and the plot, well, I don't think there is one. <br /> <br /> Some fat blonde chaps that are always dressed in a lunch bag kidnapping some sort of a nightclub, I think he kills a buyer. Useless battles then happen. Kidnapped girl is placed on a boat in the loft, why? Hard, uncompromising champion trained policemen came up, spoke bad English and did things that didn't make sense. His extreme trip. But he does have a nice car. Christ on a bike, this movie was a waste of 90 minutes.
