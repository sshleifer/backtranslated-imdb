I saw this movie on TCM this morning. Very bad acting, low budget and poor plot are the impressions I felt while watching the movie. The only highlight of the movie was watching young girl, Rita Moreno, (23 years old), playing a teenage Indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50's. She reminded me of a previous version of Sue Lyon as Lolita (1962), just a more innocent Lolita. She jumps up and down like a teenager of a 1950's, almost as if you expected her to be chewing gum, falling over this old man, who wants to give him, because he plays it off as if it is a hindrance to him is. Any man in his fifties who had a beautiful, virgin teenage girl who wanted to do something for him and be his bride would be mad to not take advantage of her. It is too bad that the censorship board will no longer allow a character like Rita Moreno's to be extended when this film is released. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is Rita Moreno's appearance in the movie.
