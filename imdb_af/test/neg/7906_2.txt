"Soul Plane" is a horrible attempt at comedy that only attracts people with thick skulls, blood-bladed eyes and hairy pawns. <br /> <br /> The plot is not only incoherent, but also non-existent, acting is mostly sub-sub-par with a gang of highly moronic and horrible characters caught up for a bad measure. never a little amusing. This movie has no structure and is full of racial stereotypes that should have been old in the fifties. The only thing that really goes with it is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want, you can get something from the "Adult" section. OK? <br /> <br /> I can't see anything here to recommend, as you'll probably have much better and productive time hunting the rats with a sledge hammer or finding waterproof tea bags or whatever. <br /> <br /> 10/02
