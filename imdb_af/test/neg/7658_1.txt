Actually, there was nothing funny about this accident !! This movie was a complete horror. The absurdities in this movie almost made me vomit !! I think the people responsible for this movie made use of their viewers. They took a relatively decent series of movies (I said decent, NOT GOOD!) And completely put it off by trying to put money in their pockets. Making planes! was a way for Hollywood to make up for this crappy flick. The worst part is that no one in 1979 realized the asinine events of the movie (such as Concorde's door that haunts at a high altitude or Patroni shoots a flair gun from the window at Mach 2 for a NUCLEAR SECURITY to avoid!?! ... what were they thinking?) was completely unrealistic or they just didn't mind! I think it's the last of the two. The authors and directors of this "movie", if you want to call it, really tried to dry the airport dynasty with this shit!
