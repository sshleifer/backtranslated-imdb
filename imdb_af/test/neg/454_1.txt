From the weeks and weeks of promotion, ABC's "The One" was supposed to be "The Real World" with American Idol. We had to watch these singers perform, compete and see how they lived together in a house. The drama! The tension! <br /> <br /> Where does one start with this cruelty? Let's start with the "adjudicators" known as "musicians" on this program. "Experts" imply that they have expertise. AndrÃ© Harrell had at least a pedigree. He was in charge of Motown Records for a time. The other two ... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle, who may be Mr. Weird Beard could be called. He colored his hair in three different colors. I wonder how scary he would have been with a black light! And the Paula Abdul wannabe, who did something I didn't think could happen: she was even more gossip and cloying than Paula! She then corrected and became critically critical of the first episode. The candle of criticism presented by these three was a real joke and an insult, not only the process of finding the best singer, but the audience who is now very skilled. It's already done on Fox already. /> <br /> There was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was not Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was as clumsy as it could be. He actually drenched what little energy there was in the program, dry. How he got that job was the second biggest secret to the show. <br /> <br /> The first was how did they choose the 11 competitors for this program? It was literally a talent-free talent show. OK. Maybe it's an exaggeration. And being awarded, the artists should be relatively close-knit, because if they weren't, there wouldn't be a "game". If only one person was "good", there would be no "tension". So, I find that they should all be comparable. But they all had * a few chops! In addition, the judges ran a "Singing Academy", so the program was also part of "Fame". Obviously these artists desperately need the lessons. But you need many talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented. And that certainly wasn't what happened here. <br /> <br /> It seemed as if the show was the priority for the "homelife" elements, as all the players were very appealing to look at parts of how bad they voted. But the filmed segments in their home were so chopped and cut, you couldn't get into the stories that started, so the show didn't capture the events there either. <br /> <br /> So bad The one made an incredible, incredible, fatal design flaw in the results that made it completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The audience phoned in their voices for who they liked best. , just like on "AI." But when the public's voice was unveiled, the three three participants were forced to sing a final song. The "music experts", based on that performance, chose one of the three to save for the next week. And THEN, the participants who were safe had to vote for who they wanted to keep the remaining two, the remaining participant at home. <br /> <br /> The "design error" was that the participants had the final say. I mean, if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the road as you could, would you vote to keep the better singer, or would you like to get rid of your toughest competitor? Any first season sister of CBS's "Survivor" can answer that one! And that's exactly what happened on the program. The person who had the better potential was lost, and the contestants returned "the one" who had no talent at all! In addition, the contestant who was only rescued by the "experts" from the bottom also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! <br /> <br /> Perhaps if they let the contestants vote, the "experts" would at least save the better of two evils to end. But it just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcasting, how unsatisfactory was the whole process of seeing and how wrong the producers were to try it.
