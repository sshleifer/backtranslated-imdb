Not even Emeril Lagasse cuisine can save this unfounded, over-the-top idiotic nonsense, with Emeril Lagasse as a TV chef out of the food channel, trying with the help of the crew to make the show better, drain poor plot and stupid script , Robert Urich wasted in the poorly supporting role and unfortunately it was his last one ever (RIP) <br /> <br /> It is the worst performance of 2001 and it will be on the list of the worst performances of this decade. <br /> <br /> I feel very sorry for Emeril Lagasse to make this sitcom, he even said he knocked it. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that they are the same producers of women's designs. It did this mess. <br /> <br /> TV Review: 1 Star
