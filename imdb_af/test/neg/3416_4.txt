Love sublime says the title. Another blurb during the promotions of the film spoke about inner and outer beauty. Well, in this case, the beauty - you decide internally or externally - is provided by slender dressing (or is it slenderly dressed / printed). Zeenat, who called director Raj Kapoor, a talent of talent while the film was made. Of course, one cannot accuse him of sarcasm - he has promoted his own film. <br /> <br /> The paper thin plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a well-proportioned body, a big voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar) with whom the hero Shashi Kapoor falls in love. He didn't want her face just her voice. The play is desperate and even the 4 is due to the music with Lata Mangeshkar giving good numbers. The rest are of course bunkum. Avoid - save your money. Inner Beauty vs Outer Beauty. !!! You don't have to be Einstein to find out which one the director is concentrating on
