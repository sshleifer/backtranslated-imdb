An absolute staggering western with flash-forward sequences that were in a crazy asylum, Southern Hel-Berg was one of the first films produced by the sklock masters at Cannon Film. Along with William Sachs, who will later be the favorite favorites such as The Incredible Melting Man and Galaxina, the film tells the boring story of a thirty gold robbers bumping into a cabin occupied by two women who hide some secret secrets worth discovering. The film (most of which has never made another film) is trying to age, but is disturbed by the script, which generally does not make sense. The Asian scenes are edited in little effect and are tracked by ludicrous sound effects and band loops. Ultimately, it is much talk and a little different.
