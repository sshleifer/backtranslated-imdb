Although Casper van Dien and Michael Rooker are generally transferred to B-movies, they are even above this movie. It fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement, fear or fear - unless you count the fear of putting away the rest of the garbage. The direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and rugged movement that hide the fact that the killer is not near the victims when he attacks. And what a killer he is: a cheap skull mask and a black cap. I liked him better when he was against the man. This is one of the funniest works of character design I've ever seen. I mean, this is Skeletor! And he's on a horse! It is supposed to be a little shy, supernatural being? How should we take it seriously? All we get is screens of this man riding the bush on his horse, which he barely can stay. It ranges from scenes of soldiers shooting at random in the forest and thinking they can shoot a ghost. Sometimes Skeletor will shoot or drive someone with an arrow and stab someone and reveal how granular the effects really are. I usually enjoy Sci Fi channel map on a basic cheese level, but this movie is too impractical for any level of enjoyment. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need him ???
