Bad, bad, movie, so bad, it's worth watching. As long as you watch this movie and know it's bad and you spend 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but watch the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened. It's just very funny. If your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo, won't you do anything to save her? If she ate, would you not fall on your knees to call out your heart? This man just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. How anti-climate is this? Maybe he's supposed to be in shock or something. He joins his sister in the komodo's stomach - that doesn't mean spoiling it for you.
