This movie is about a young girl who lives with her rich cousins, falls in love with one of her cousins, and rejects the advance of an amoral babysitter who brings problems to the family. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, I decided to watch the older version. I found it to be true to Fanny's character in the book, but it was also boring. Fanny character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was lackluster; She often seemed to faint. I also didn't like Robert Bourbage who played Henry Crawford. I couldn't imagine him interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood played by Mary Crawford, but the wig she wore was so ugly. I was interested in her acting and I stared at her. I expected it to fall off her head. I could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig.
