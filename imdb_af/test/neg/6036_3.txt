The White Warrior is definitely one of, if not Steve Reeves worst movies. In the 18th or 19th century Russia (?) Stepped a cossack warrior trying to run over a crazy Russian tsar by running a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy Russian white tunie. The large part of the Reeves body is hidden in a sturdy knee-length tunic, with an even more soulful Russian hat. <br /> <br /> The action is pretty minimal, with just a good wrestling scene from the waist to It shows off the big Reeves body. It is an obvious effort by producers to move Reeves from the sword and sandals genre to another historic era, with poor results. The writing dialogue is difficult to understand at various points, and only commentator commentary allows the viewer to understand what really happens from scene to scene. I would regret the image of Reeves to make this film, but in an effort to get out of his gown and sandals and tribune armor, it helped him to make other historical characters like Morgan the Pirate and The Thief of Baghdad. start.
