It's hard to be too hard on Brad Sykes, a hard-working guy who does what he loves, there's an honesty about him who often doesn't lack other micro-budget directors. Look at the minimal crew credits on Camp Blood. There's none of the ordinary people who thank them for the pizza add they've eaten, Brad and his friends, and it's not pretentious junk. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not your average horror flick heroine, but good enough for you to see hardly, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny that it hurts. The Clown is hardly an original horror movie bad guy, but the design is good, Shemp Moseley does a decent job to kill him and the image clashes with the rural background. Camp Blood is horror if blue collar and basically like it, not a good thing, not a bad thing, just a thing.
