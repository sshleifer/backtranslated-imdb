The figure of Emperor Elizabeth of Austria (1837-1898) is mostly associated with Romy Schneider and the Sissi trilogy by Ernst Marischka (1950s) where beauty, gentleness, sweetness, but also history are ever present. It was the Sissi, perhaps myth for some; however, a powerful portrayal. The spirit of the Habsburg greatness, as well as the spirit of Bavarian simplicity and regency, influenced many of these films. They simply had a soul. But Jean Daniel Verhaeghe's film, made 50 years later, seems to be a misrepresentation of Empress and her life. It seems to be an attempt to show something different, to reveal some realism as a cure for sweetness; Yet it doesn't seem to add much, but rather deprive the whole story. Let me analyze this in more detail. <br /> <br /> September 1898 begins Sissi at the port of Geneva. With her courtmate, she goes to Dr. Mayer (Didier Bezace), who will tell her the whole life story to find herself in this tragic life. The action consists of flashbacks to important moments in Sissi's life, but these moments are chaotic and therefore anyone who does not have much knowledge of Austrian history can be completely misled or confused. Much attention is drawn to Sissi's bad marriage to emperor Franz Josef. The scene of her wedding day is a failure. No one treated such an emperor (I mean to pull out and pay). The misguided focus on Sissi is correctly historical, but the points that her views differ from the rest of the courtiers are not true. Where is her desire for peace? Where is her love for her nation? Where is her charity? Sissi seems to be very elegant, modern, liberal (from the 21st century point of view). For the first time she gives her her appearance that is not historically true. Sissi has an inner life that is not shown in the film. "As soon as women wear pants," a sentence is said by her and that is the image of the Sissi presented in the movie. Sissi denies monarchy, which is the film's striking criticism of the Austrian empire. Furthermore, she accepts partially anarchic movements and, to my surprise, she blames her husband, emperor Franz Josef, for the death of Rudolph, their son. Where is any history in Sissi's history in Mayerling? Sissi's relationship with Sophie, the mother-in-law, is better shown, but Sophie's death scene hardly seems authentic and the conversation is a bit clich√©. <br /> <br /> Sorry to criticize so much, but another important aspect of the movie I find poor here is performances. Although Arielle Dombasle has her moments as Sissi, she usually does not fit into the role. She looks more like a "femme fa story" than a tragic empress. Her makeup is seriously inaccurate, as well as most of her gestures as the emperor. Malik Zidi is a little better than Rudolph and can be considered the one that increases the value of the performances in general. Still, Stephane Audran does no special job as Sophie: you simply don't get the impression why she despises Sissi. She despised her for Sissi's young age, crowned for her behavior, lifestyle and belief. In part, it appears in the movie, but definitely not enough. But the biggest mistake is, I think, Julien Hans Capua and Andrassi. Andrassi was a count with pride, honor, patriotism ... here it seems he is a kind of liberal thinking to just love his queen. And the depiction is so poor that this show is very pale. The right choice is Tatyana Ivanova as Catherine Schratt. She fits the role with her body and her gestures really. But unfortunately her role doesn't require much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> A good point of this movie is some costumes and pretty authentic places. The port of Geneva is well-presented and the moment of Sissi's death takes place as a good surprise to the movie. It doesn't seem like it really was; However, the moment is good from the symbolic perspective. The empire runs and knows nothing about it being her last moment. That's how she had to feel about it, so one dishonest man destroyed some of the greatness of the world. Another good moment was visual when Sissi spoke to her son Rudolph in Corfu. But these moments are rare. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a good movie. It distorts a very prominent historical figure, an important historical time, and tries to cure the sweetness of Sissi trilogy, but seems to offer nothing creative. The charm is gone, greatness is gone and history is ignored! Not much to look for! 10/03
