I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Satanic horror movies, and I actually look like I see a new one every time, and it's not really surprising if I watch movies like brotherhood of satan! Despite its low rating on IMDb, I was surprised to hear good things about this movie and my expectations arose. It seems to be a big mistake as it is exactly the movie that suggests its rating is: a very bad one! The plot is your basic bunch of Satanists who cause problems, and we focus on a small town where people have been murdered and kidnapped and that is not really why. Of course, Satanists are behind it and it is bad news for a mother, father and daughter on a road trip trapped in the mysterious town. I had a feeling that this movie might be the same as the crazy satanic movie 'The Devil's Rain', and although it's not quite as stupid as Robert Fuest's later movie, it's not much better either. The plot is pretty much down to Earth, but it's also pretty boring and I can't say I enjoyed myself during this movie. Of course, Brotherhood of Satan has his supporters, but I am not one of them; this is a movie i see no reason to recommend ...
