The Bravest indicates that the main character is, of course, brave. I will not agree. The more brave thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her is brutally beaten up with her fiance who doesn't live another day out is to go to the criminals without a total distorted view of society. Jodie Foster's character, Erica, is a radio personality whose niche runs the streets and footage. We don't get the right depth, "she had someone she loved, he was dead, the police didn't take it out, she got a gun, yada-yada-yada, she got a little but not really involved at the chief detective "In character, and so on, remains of previous movies have been left: the vigilant justice system, where the power is taken in its own hands, is all there is. But we are never sure whether Erica is healthy or not, if the filmmakers somehow take a position (that is, to the end, which is such a stupid message to take anyway, a dog like that. Including a remaining metaphor Today's New York City, which has become considerably safer than twenty years ago, looks as if you have been beaten or beaten if you just go right up or just sit on a subway car. <br /> <br /> There may even be a slightly better movie in the middle of everything - perhaps just in the sub-boiled subplot with Terence Howard's detective, involved in a child's strike that doesn't she and a woman is not. He's not tied to and a stepfather, because I don't know what apart from parking lots and is a bad guy, but we are left with a script that is both sophisticated and untouched by logic. For example, it is ridiculous to first see that the logical side of Erica cannot really be shot, as seen in her first shootings in a convenience store at the convenient moment of a woman's robbery by the man and then closer to the illogical from her shotgun to shoot at a pimp and drive a motorbike on her and kill him and just bend in time not to get overflow. It doesn't help Jordon's style with the camera become a little more than impenetrable. It is called a place cam for a * reason *, not because it can weave complexly. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the writing and the direction are getting very good, or better working the best they can under the desired circumstances: when you look at the real throbbing scene under the bridge, caught between one of the criminals through a regular movie camera in a pass that is perfectly disoriented. And when Erica returned to her radio show for the first time, and his freeze tried her to do her old shtick, and expressed a sadness about how scared she was - this scene, of Foster's performance, towards the clear direction and the writing, is the best scene in the movie. But besides, there is only a lot of aptitude in psychology that is faint: is she a De Niro in Taxi Driver or a Bronson in Death Wish? We have her story about plays, and it doesn't have to do with her radio show, and see how disgusting she is about to walk around at night, nothing but her self-imposed task of cleaning the streets. But unlike Death Wish, a movie that has more ambiguity and never had an answer in the end in a revenge situation, the path of endless violence only keeps a message, one that won't be news to anyone who has seen a second of lifetime not movie-of-the-week melodrama. <br /> <br /> The actors make it with what is given, and in the end it becomes much more frustrating to stay with the expected, the chopped plot turning and the ordinary guy inexplicable (plus the unintentionally hilarious, like Some scouts screaming Howard after shooting in one scene and the temptation to walk out are getting stronger and stronger. This is a very problematic picture, with only a few moments of real interest and clear-cut convention.
