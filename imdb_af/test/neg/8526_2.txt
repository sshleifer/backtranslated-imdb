This movie has tried something but failed. All the stress attempts were inexpensive, and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes that I finally laughed at and went through it all. At least I'm entertained. <br /> <br /> The ghosts are trying to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl whose name I don't mind remembering. And what was the beginning of the black and white? I know what they are trying to do, but they have become very short. And where did the man (John Corbett's character) come from? He just waltzes from where not in a vast field. And why did he suddenly lose it when the ravens came? And if the crows were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, why did they attack him if he tried to kill the family? Don't make sense. So many things in this movie just don't make sense, and the acting isn't too good on the side of the main girl character. It's not terrible, just a bit like her kiddy movie days. <br /> <br /> So everything in this movie wasn't brilliant, but I had a good time ripping it and sometimes it's all a horror movie has to do. Don't rent for entertainment quality.
