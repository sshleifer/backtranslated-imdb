The Joe Cool Review - Hellraiser: Bloodlyn <br /> <br /> With: Bruce Ramsay as Phillip L'Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Angelique and Doug Bradley as Pinhead <br /> <br /> Plot: This follows a timeline of the Merchant Bloodlyn line, which started with Phillip L'Merchant, who created the box that the door to hell. Start with the 18th century to present the time when Pinhead first meets with a trader and tries to cut the bloodline. (He's the only one who can stop Pinhead, you see) and eventually in the future where the Paul Merchant finally came out. How to send Pinhead hell for the good. <br /> <br /> Openers: This is a movie hated by the people who made it. They said fictional director Alan Smithee would be the credited director. They only pull Smithee out of the woodwork when they really think they've made a terrible movie, like classic like The Birds II: Land's End or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No, I didn't solve it. How did I keep it? You read it so I'm sure it's what you want to know. <br /> <br /> The Good: This movie is not as bad as you were taught to believe. Oh, I'm not going to do sugar cover. This movie has been filled as much as possible and has finally become a disaster, but it does have positive effects. Cooler cenobites this time to start, like the twins and the demon Angelique. Pin head is still a leading role and still has good lines ("Pain has a face, let me show you") and it's somewhat entertaining. Gorehounds will love the movie because it is endless supply. There is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you will have to look to see it. The Chatterer Dog is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The bad: But for a story about hell vs the cursed Merchant bloodline that could close the gate forever, it was very complicated and with the band. Nothing is really looking at its full potential and there were some very stupid things. Pinhead kidnap a kid and keep him ransom! Random deaths only to contain more blood (not always a bad thing, but not for the sake of the story). Pinhole is at its worst here, round and round and round, even when he is going to die! For the very clever demon he used to be, he was best reduced to nothing more than a Bond villain. If Hellraiser fans ever need a reason for returning to a comedy role, it is. Bloodline has ruined it all for us. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. This one has skin ripping, drilling, crochet impaling, decapitation, and more goodies. The Chatterer Dog, while awesome series of bad special effects during the chase. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: This movie has the potential for something wonderful, even horrifying levels of greatness. But it was all messed up. Who knows exactly what went on to produce this crap, but we can only blame Alan Smithee. <br /> <br /> Compared to the rest: This movie is the worst of the Hellraiser series. Only for finalists. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of *****
