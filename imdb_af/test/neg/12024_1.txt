What to say about "Dead End Road" ... <br /> Just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so shy. The acting, writing, effects and everything in this movie were just awful. It doesn't even matter! This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I ever had to go through. That's also why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the end because I didn't care what happened to the characters. I saw badly, but it was definitely the worst. I hyped this because I am a Poe fan and it was just bad. Not bad. <br /> <br /> What upsets me more is that you can't judge negative-numbered movies.
