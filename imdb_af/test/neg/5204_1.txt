**** SOME SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie you haven't seen on the internet yet. Nothing is shocking about this movie. In the film a man sodomizes a goat, there is a bulldozer deapit, and a lesbian face is burned. All these scenes of "extreme violence" are so false, it makes one wonder why anyone would even want to revive this piece of waste. I simply can't believe I spent hard earned money on being the worst movie ever made. Don't let the reviews fool you, this movie will be sorry for ANYONE to own ... except perhaps prisons who want to torture prisoners. For a real-life classic, look at Bloodsucking Freaks or even the more recent Doom Generation. The Island of Death sinks to the bottom of the movie toilet and must be demolished.
