After I endured this movie last night, I turned off the DVD player in a sense that I deserved a medal to see the stamina to the end. Throughout the movie, I felt I was watching the storyline fillers you get in a high-budget porn movie. the act was stiff and stiff, the camera worked awfully and the places and sets were so poor, they felt they had borrowed from the local high school "Amateur Dramatic's Society". <br /> <br /> The only saving grace for this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in his credits, except that it was purely dribble.
