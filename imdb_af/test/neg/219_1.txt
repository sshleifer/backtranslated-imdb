This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The movie was fantastic, but the movie itself was terrible. It was so terrible, I had to register to just say how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and I wanted to break it every minute I watched. It could have been good. Had a good starting point. If you are robbing an armored car, and there is a homeless person who sees you, do what you have to do. For the main character to decide to kill a policeman and kill his friends and co-workers after the homeless man has died, it's just ridiculous. And yes, I'm sure there will be answers on how his consciousness got him, but come on. <br /> <br /> The main character crawled the bottom of the armored truck, no one saw him. He blew and grabbed the lot of money and dragged the police behind the other guards and nobody saw him. He could come back into the armored car, and no one saw him. This movie has potential but has blown it. <br /> <br /> You can't pay me to see this movie ever again! Don't ever see it! Aggravating ...
