This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I give this movie too much credit! My best guess for the reason to make this movie is that someone wanted to show someone else's martial arts abilities, but realized that you can't just fight a man who is fighting another and showing people, so have he was fighting a story ... and people haven't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> This movie's storyline was thin on the skin. It was goofy and stereotypical of any Kung Fu movie. The dubbing was literally the worst I ever heard. It seemed as if you were playing a small role in this movie, like the fat man or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net, no matter who made your voice. It could have been a dyslexic with a swollen stutter and no one would have said anything. But alongside all this, the movie is making itself with the somewhat awesome battle scenes. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were definitely about this movie. But the battles of the fighting were totally absurd! In most cases, a man jumps out of the long grass, or looks at the main character from a distance and then attacks him. But once the battles have started, things are balanced. There were only two things that made the battle really difficult. The constant wooshing sound effects added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword, and the poor editing that made 25 percent of the fights. Someone will be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly kicked to the ground, and then immediately back on their feet that block a punch. But while cutting and pasting editing was more of a nuisance than anything else, it didn't really affect the overall movie. <br /> <br /> In the end it wasn't a good movie, but I wasn't expecting a good movie. A big movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movie. All I saw was a way to pass an hour and a half boredom. I seldom say it, but it was just one of those movies that you didn't use practically, so you watch it if you have any spare time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good day here. <br /> <br /> -
