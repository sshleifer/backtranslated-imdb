Joe D'Amato may have made some other notable films in his very long and productive career productive, of course, in turn, to make very cheap Z-grade films in Italy's huge exploitation of the late 70's early 70's - but Porno Holocaust is not one of them, or at least it shouldn't be. Granted, I shouldn't expect much from a movie with such a title, but I thought at the back of the box's description that it could be some funny spectacular screens with the "horny, mutant, cannibal zombie" have. It seems that the zombie no longer appears halfway through the movie, and at every turn we get a dull sex scene as hardcore as you can imagine. What's good. But it is not very pleasant, except in most "what the f *** is this BS" kind of way. There is a ridiculous dialogue with lobster that costs more from mail orders Japan than in Paris. Hot, smart women play biologists and zoologists who have particular sexual hang-ups (unlock the door to be raped and a two-polar type of pleasure <br /> <br /> It all leads to the island, where the " main attraction "a guy who just stares at an absolutely pathetic (forgetting ridiculous) time just looking at the newcomers to the island's radioactive desert on the island, and as soon as it is revealed, has a face like one of the guards in Jabba's palace and has a sweet potato for a main genitals, but much thicker than that is the "relationship" between the monster and a dark-colored lady, who has an unnecessary amount of time to escape, but Just sit there, with the naked face, because the monster brings gifts and for what must be a racially motivated exploit on the side of the filmmakers. The monster rapes and locks the white women and not her, and of course it ends with a "happy" end of course, from a kind of shock that it can have any legitimate end. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, this is NOT what you can expect, possibly a bloody horror movie with very tough but cool Italian monster zombies that consume the human flesh. If anything that is violence in the movie, it is done on a lash; A slap on the face is cut immediately, which is like the aftermath of a tomato hit by someone. So really, the last part of the title is more meant for the market. But even as a porn movie it has little to do, except as a reason for the cast and crew to get a paid vacation to the Caribbean (as suggested by George Eastman, it was just one of them) some quickies made on the island). It has penny-bought camera work and similar actors, filled with genitalia about 3/4 of the time and with miserable lip sync and music like Nino Rota, forced on a firearm to make something funny in a bordello. Another piece of celluloid mixture all this can be a great guilty pleasure, but it is not.
