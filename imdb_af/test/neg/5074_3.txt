How? I wondered why I didn't see it in theaters, or even a single commercial for that, and when I saw the movie, I realized I was HARDCORE muted. I'm a big Transporter fan, and a big Blade fan, so when I saw it, I fought a killer scene between two badasses, lots of gunplay, a lot of stuff. Instead, I got the Ryan Phillippe movie with a short comedy by Statham and Snipes. The guy doing the audio and video in the crime lab has more screen time than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie expecting a lot of Kung Fu and Erin Brockavich. I'm expecting bad movies from Hollywood, but actors like Snipes and Statham have to deal with the fan base better.
