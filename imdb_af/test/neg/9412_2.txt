I went into this movie determined to keep it. I usually enjoy plays like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc. I thought in this movie I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I'm a big Pacino fan. <br /> <br /> What a piece of garbage. Certainly the worst movie I've seen in five years. This actually makes Pacino's debacle look good in any given Sunday. First, half watch the movie after Matthew McConaughey. OK, we got it. You are in form Matt. We don't have to see every other scene, with iron, shirtless pump. <br /> <br /> Second, how many plot holes are in this movie? Why does the phone call from Brandon's lost dad never put it back on? What was the point of his mother hanging him up - why did she even call to say he was sending her too much money - what was the point? The man from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? Also, since sports betting is illegal in NY and its recognition is illegal, how can they probably ensure everyone's commitment? <br /> <br /> It was simply a very poorly written script. It had potential, but it was without a coherent plot. I thought Pacino had learned his lesson on choosing Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My Gosh, it's the same actor who played in the Godfather! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
