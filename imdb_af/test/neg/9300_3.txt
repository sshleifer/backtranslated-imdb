Frank Falenczyk: It's not a pity that I killed them; It's a pity I killed them badly. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about a swing and a miss. You have a good role and a great plot with endless possibilties ... how do you f_ck it? Well, John Dahl apparently found a way. With a horrific joke with jokes about such a funny as a malaria epidemic and so painful dialogue, it does not make any of the characters seem like: 'You Kill Me' may be the biggest movie fall of 2007. A positive note, Ben Kinglsey offers another great achievement as the alcoholic Polish hit trying to clean, but the material he needs to work with is shit. Tee Leoni is good, as well as Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the movie. I think the best way to describe 'You Kill Me' is a terrible movie with good performances. Degree: D +
