Total shame! Actually terrible! The script and dialogue is a joke, and combined with a director who has no idea of ​​life in Saudi Arabia. This is not a surprise, but Saudi film ha, the director is Palestinian Canadian. The author is Lebanese. The lead roles are Jordan, and the shooting took place in Dubai. All these elements are very good at representing the film far away. the Saudi society. Yes it contains some Saudi clichés, the things we see in cartoons every day, but it's about everything. The film had the opportunity to show real problems with Saudi society, or at least to give us something new and real about the youth problems and concerns in Saudi Arabia. Instead, it was copied and pasted from here and there. The result was a mess. Even the so-called love story in the movie doesn't exist or we haven't seen it. The only bright side in this total debacle is a good thing that plays the supporting role. Veteran Khaled Sami was funny in a poorly written role as the grandfather, whom he clearly missed, because he looked younger than the actor playing his son. The actor who plays the role of fanatic brother Turki Al-Yusuf did well, and he was the best actor in the film. The rest of the actors, who have long been professional, did an OK job, but the main actor, Hisham Abdulrahman, was just bad. He got a glimpse of a small, beautiful bobby for all situations. He couldn't even say his lines properly. He has charisma winning him the title Star Academy, a very well-known reality show, and he's good at interviews and TV shows, but he was just the worst link of this movie. The main actress I didn't care about, but even she did badly in some screens and unnecessarily crossed her sensuality. <br /> <br /> The movie was a big hit, Saudi was brought to Bahrain in thousands and Dubai to attend when it looked, and made a lot of money, and it was in pay per eye, then in broadcasting, and it was in a few weeks. It was to pay for Saudis eagerness for homemade entertainment, but unfortunately; the movie was not homemade or entertaining.
