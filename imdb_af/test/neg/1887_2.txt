I watched this movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was terrible. Now that I've been older, I found it so terrible. Universal could have done better than that. They just decided to make the most money they could to use all their samples at once. For me it was a cheap shot. These characters were able to keep their own in their own movies, and the choice of actors was deplorable. Dracula was needed to be Bela Lugosi, Frankenstein's monster had to be Karloff. <br /> <br /> In my mind, it was the Disney rogue sequel order made decades ago, and it's not appreciated. Umiversal started out with something fantastic and original, and then thought they could shake the masses with the shock that this movie clearly shows.
