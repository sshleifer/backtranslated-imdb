The intricate points of performance can be a good idea in some movies. Here it is a total mess. <br /> <br /> But the total mess begins with the story: a video clip bit wants to shoot a light comedy with a damaging noir-like female character. She is beautiful and no men can resist to dive and crawl and suck her toes. She is becoming more materialistic, looks like the butter won't melt in her mouth. <br /> <br /> The movie melts away in its own pretentiousness: be smart / funny / beautiful. Phalocretinism at its best. Only white trash, please.
