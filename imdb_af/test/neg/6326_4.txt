I just have to comment on this movie because I gave it a 4 rating, and I think it's pretty high for a soft porn movie. The real plot is kind of hokey (which would otherwise be expected), but Hafron is so incredibly funny, and he delivers everything in a Cyborgish voice so it's easy for him. Everyone who wrote the script definitely had a look! I have to laugh aloud ten times, and that's not why someone will pick up this movie. The only softcore movie I've seen that has other merits than beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle is dripping, beautiful ... just look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> Any movie that can entertain me predominantly how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is, and also the consideration of the movie is not made to entertain artistically, so to speak, it gets at least four in my book. I mean, who wouldn't see it before Stop! Whether My Mom Will Shoot?
