I watched this movie with great expectations. The blurb on the back indicated it would be a nasty one. But it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfactory. The violence was nothing that I had not seen a thousand times before, the gore level was just average (do you think there was probably more than seen in Hollywood in the past 5 years - perhaps more), and at no time was I even uncomfortable feeling scared. Once again a CAT 3 movie with big wraps did not live up to its hype. <br /> <br /> Sure rent this movie, but don't come in with any expectations. I'm so eager to come across the entire Asian horror scene, but are constantly disappointed. I loved Ichi and Audition, but then again, Miike is at the moment. <br /> <br /> Please my inspiration ..... there is a large group of ruthless genre fans who are starving at quality. !
