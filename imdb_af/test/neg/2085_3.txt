I saw this movie more than 20 years ago and had quite good memories of it. When I caught up with Cinemax this month, I realized how little distinction I had about movies. It is a completely ordinary spaghetti western, with absolutely nothing to say about it. Writing, direction, acting, photography are all a big blah. Stick to the Sergio Leone westerns!
