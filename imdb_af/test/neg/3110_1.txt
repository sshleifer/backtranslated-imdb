It's the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw a lot of movies. My friends and I rented this one on a Wednesday night. Man we had a lot of fun. This movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen. But it makes you laugh! You will lie on the floor to turn around to get air. You wonder why? Just rent and watch the keyboard playing girl at the sleepy Russian pub. My mom will make a 1000 times better movie about her cat food.
