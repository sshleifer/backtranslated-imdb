This movie is terrible. It does not create characters in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including a stupid little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish speaking elves. The book was a simple story about faith, and this movie is a dark, ugly and unnecessary and terrifying film about nothing. <br /> <br /> The animation is great, but the story has been devastated by Hollywood. <Br /> <br /> The good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box and maybe producers will learn to love toddler with a story that doesn't need to be improved. Hanks was exaggerated and I didn't see why no other actors' voices could be used.
