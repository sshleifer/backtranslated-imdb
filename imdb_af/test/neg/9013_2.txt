For the viewers who thought of the 1979 film "Alien", the first to portray a male Earth that could come as a malignant alien, "Night of the Blood Beast", which was fertilized 21 years earlier of a surprise. In this film, America's first man in space is returned back to Earth and is believed to be dead after the investigation. He arrives later, only with half a dozen or so strange sea urchins that grow in his belly. The Mum (?) Alien also appears to scare the small group of scientists who are our brave hero, and she (?) Has the body of a bear and the head of Yarnek, the rock of a 1969 star Trek "Episode. Anyway, with its short, 62-minute time, a small group of scientists and a cheap monster, this movie sets nothing less than a Grade Z warm-up for" The Outer Limits "(four years later not premiere), but without the fine print that the show usually boasted, despite the lurking title, this movie is definitely sci-fi, not horror, and also offers no frightening, laffs, little tension and little thoughts. It seems to cost about $ 100 (but probably twice as much food), and his musical score is often unrelated to events (I won't use the word "action" on the screen). There are many more questions about the movie: How was our hero to satisfy these animals? to learn our language? (To justify that title, no doubt!) Why can't rural strangers land on our planet rather than drive on our ships? How was our hero with conception to begin? That's all this little cheapie doesn't bother. It's just for the 1950's sci-fi finalists.
