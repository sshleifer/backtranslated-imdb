Fred "The Hammer" Williamson delivers another cheap movie. He may have set a new standard for himself. Look out for the painfully obvious special effects mortar gun that is visible on the street during a chase. You don't see it once, you see it a few times. Watch the out-of-focus shot in one scene and the camera operator tries to fix it as the act plays. Watch it with a group of people and create your own Mystery Science Theater!
