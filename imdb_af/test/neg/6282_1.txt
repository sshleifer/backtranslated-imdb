SPOILERS <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is Tenchi? </ br> <br /> It's not Tenchi. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone was terrified ... When it comes to characterization, the only glimpse is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko. The rudeness is also not punished for her conduct, which comes to mental rape. If a male villain did one of the women who did Haruna to Tenchi, then he would have really painfully bought it at the end of the movie, dying, and cheering. But not only does Haruna not pay a price for her crimes, Ryoko actually gives and UNDERSTAND her actions. No! The real Ryoko would have disintegrated her for what Haruna did to her beloved Tenchi; The audience I saw here, including myself, made everyone on this scene audible. <br /> <br /> Anime fans avoid this movie. Tenchi fans even avoid this movie harder.
