I got this little piece of scuzz on the VideoAsia "Tales of Voodoo" DVD label. Where the voodoo is supposed to fit in, I have no idea. Indeed, I will not commit voodoo to Indonesia anyway (let alone WIPs). <br /> <br /> I know and love WIP movies. I saw most of them. So I couldn't resist this little-known jewel from the description given on the cover page. <br /> <br /> This is APPALLING. You can't have a WIP movie if the women keep their clothes (even in the shower!). Whilst nodding to the mining genre, WIP is without a nudity like a Big Mac without the beef. <br /> <br /> As my gym teacher said, in general, I'd rather be at the disco.
