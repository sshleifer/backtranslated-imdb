This film follows in the footsteps of The Riddle for an all-star British cast in a horrible movie! Poor effects, poor editing, poor direction, a role I hope were well paid, as it would be a nail in much of a career. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer again had to carry his Neil wedge & It was like a particularly long and protracted episode of "Torchwood" but without the camp fake Canadian doctor fella. However, it had the same dramatic music, constantly repeating, in a vain attempt to solve tension. <br /> <br /> Oh mankind!
