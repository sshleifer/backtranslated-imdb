First thing first - although I believe that Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director, and more often (as here) is right, the lion's share of blame for this ugly travesty of a movie after John Grisham's novel. <br /> <br /> At an indefinite point in time (the 50's? 70's? now?), the movie opens with the rape and murder of a child by Rednecks, so discolored that their purpose is apparently to ensure racists that "at least we are not that bad"? Cut for the bad guys who arrive at the court building when the girls, Samuel L Jackson, are terrified, they will shoot off some technical skill and drop them into cold blood before the trial. <br /> <br /> The environment is a 'deep south' that probably never existed - the few black characters live in huts and look like cotton, the colored-in-the-wool racists ( Kiefer Sutherland is a cartoon version of a Klansman) is laughing in their villain. The proceedings are the trial: for the defense is the "good guys" - a milquetoast lawyer who is played by Matthew McConaughey as if he were in a coma. His assistant plays through Sandra Bullock's breasts (she doesn't look like any other goal) and Donald Sutherland as the required drunk-law-sobers-up-to-fight-the-good-fight. For the prosecution, Kevin Spacey goes through the motions to cultivate demons, while in the town large crosses are burned, witnesses are intimidated and local citizens do not seem to care? <br /> <br /> Some of the reviews claim the film immoral, as Samuel Jackson is surely a killer and must rely on the powers of the law rather than on a bad heartbreaking piece of magic by Matthew McConaughey. To be honest, offensive even though the underlying message is "Vigilante justice good," can smell everything about the movie: the characterization is pitiful, the acting lead, the direction of plodding, the script and the almost parody dialogue. Peter Menzies sumptuous, 50s Technicolor cinematography is beautiful but distracted. <br /> <br /> And it's about two and a half hours! <br /> <br /> What else to say? It's a 141-minute waste of someone's life, it's boring, empty and hammy, and almost like an afterthought, it's morally contradictory.
