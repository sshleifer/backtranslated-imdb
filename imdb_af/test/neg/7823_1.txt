Not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the movies. I'm talking about how big productions companies are wasting so much money on things that are actually boring and don't talk about ridicule. With the millions they used to make such a movie, because I don't think the actors here actually work for free or for an insignificant sum. With that money, imagine how many good independent movies you can make, or maybe one good Hollywood movie. It's just to snatch you, but not someone, just the majority of teenagers who are willing to watch an Ashton Kutcher movie just because they are fans of him. I also don't really know how anyone with common sense can actually act in this kind of movie. If you actually look at it, the actors are the same quality of this movie. So I don't think I should be surprised, I couldn't have expected it anymore.
