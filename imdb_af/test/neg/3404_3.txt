I saw it after seeing "Death Tunnel" (this is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my life) so you can understand that I have made my eyes roll a bit around the directors and see producers of that movie in charge of this one. First, I thought the director and producer were the same man. They are both Kid Rock meets Dawg the Bounty Hunter. I looked at the TAPS investigation, and I'm not skeptical. I think TAPS is the closest person ever to come to the field in a scientific way. It was cool and credible. I believe they are ghost. <br /> <br /> But, like the reviewer above, it's like taking a tour. Good, but the "investigators" and "group leaders" were a penny and had a financial investment in whether they played or not, so when they have imaginative stories, I have to take it with a honey tail. of salt. <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, I could find out what they wanted me to see about 50% of the time in the picture. For the rest of the time I couldn't figure out anything. Also, without any context for the photos - time of day, type of camera, moisture in the room, dust particles (which is 75% that the bulbs are), again and a few other factors, I cannot accept it. I also can't help thinking that some might be recorded. <br /> <br /> Why would the tire hold the numbers of the door? Vandalism? Also during the TAPS investigation, they tried to dig the death certificates of those nurses - and they only found one that was "coincidental" (people didn't want to suicide officially). But when one of the guides called it, he said, "Yes, and his suicide." It really feels like the guides for the haunted houses here in October. <br /> <br /> However, I interviewed the patients and staff of the old hospital (s) who gave it a lot of perspective and a personal touch. I am also glad they mentioned that the staff had the best intentions and were not a few ghoulish wardens. They weren't the best methods, but they were all they had. They were desperate to stop the disease.
