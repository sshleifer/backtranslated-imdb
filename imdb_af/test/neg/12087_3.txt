THE GOVERNMENT IS A MAGIC PERIOD, The winding story of a Jewish woman who died after her father died until 1830's Scotland and pretended to be a heathen to find work to support her family in London. <br /> <br /> Rosina - or Mary, as she calls herself in a not too subtle piece of symbolic writing - is a motionless child, a social person with dreams of being an actress. She makes an alliance with her employer and inadvertently solves a major problem in his photography research. Blessed with success, they start with a quiet and uncomfortable affair, while the eldest son of her paramor falls hopelessly (and inexplicably) in love with her. <br /> <br /> And like a child, she doesn't understand the consequences of her actions - in the end, those who deceived her betray a life for herself. <br /> <br /> Many claim this is something of a feminist manifesto, but I disagree. Whether or not this is meant or not, this movie only resonates with me if I consider it a cautionary story. In the end, Rosina's biggest disappointment is the truth - that she lied, happened in a way to help a man want her to be her father and her lover and eventually contributed nothing but destruction. As such, the end of the movie gives me the impression that nothing she did, no one she used, made her happy - and that's exactly what it should be. <br /> <br /> Do I need a movie for so long and do I want to learn this lesson? Not at all. On the contrary, it was not for excellent cinematography, unique score and my hope that she would get her rise, I would not have stuck it to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fans of Minnie Driver are likely to be disappointed by her uneven performance, but would love to see it anyway. I doubt young female fans of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers will be able to stay awake for the payout they expect, and I can't help thinking it doesn't have too little cultural detail to be of interest, even to photography buffs. The 3 points I award to the movie are exclusively for his visual style and score. Based on their other work, I assume that the actors' performances are so disappointing due to poor writing and worse directing, but ultimately they are unbeatable.
