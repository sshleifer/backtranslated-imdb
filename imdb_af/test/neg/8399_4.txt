... now go on, because it's on my nerves. <br /> <br /> The man behind brilliant pieces like "My Own Private Idaho" and "To Die For" (and other not so brilliant movies, ie the unnecessary "Psycho" remake) has an experimental phase with " Gerry "started, which reached its peak with the formidable" Elephant ". "Last Days" had some interesting aspects, but it was very uneven, while the "Paranoid Park", its new movie, also had good 15-year-olds to walk around ... and not much else. Some cool references to Fellini (the soundtrack revives some beautiful pieces by Nino Rota) and the elegant cinematography by legendary Christopher Doyle ("In the Mood for Love") are the highlights, but the movie is just too artificial and meaningless for his own punishment. We had much better stories of age stories, and "Paranoid Park" brings nothing new. I see nothing artistic about the view of excessive shots of Gabe Nevins in his underwear or shower. Or when Nevins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen (the little one of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"), who plays his cheerleading girlfriend, had sex for the first time just because she felt they had to do it and after they called her friend to say how wonderful it was (and you can tell from Nevins's face how traumatic it was). Everyone knows that they are starting today and earlier, films like "Thirteen" and even "Elephant" themselves (showing how lost their minds in general, not just in terms of sexuality) made a better representation of it. Gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the final result is just boring and uninteresting. His next project, "Milk", a biopsy about Harvey Milk with Sean Penn, will hopefully bring the good old Gus back, because frankly, this obsession with underage children is almost ... creepy. 4.5 / 10.
