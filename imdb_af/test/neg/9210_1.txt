There must be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. <br /> <br /> It was painful to watch, but it is strange. Compelling because it seems incredible that a movie can actually suck so much. I thought "it should get better." It got worse. And worse. <br /> <br /> How on earth people knew how to make such a categorical piece of junk, I will never know. The most surprising thing of all though is all these reviews I see from people who really love the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the movie was very bad. Worst movie ever!
