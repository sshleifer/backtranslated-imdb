Scarlet Dawn throws Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., as a Russian baron disrupted by the powers of the Russian Revolution and now has to defend himself in a world that is not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats. He is also not terribly suited to any kind of real work. <br /> <br /> Doug could be caught by the Reds, but because his former servant, Nancy Carroll, didn't give him away. Nancy had a great old loved one on Doug and married them when they were in exile in Istanbul, referred to by the former Christian name of Constantinople in the film. They married and sat down with Doug, now reduced to washing dishes. <br /> <br /> But Fairbanks' former mistress, Lilyan Tashman, who always plays bad girls of a kind on film, sees him and offers to get him back in some style He once used to sharing from a scam against the father and daughter of American tourists Guy Kibbee and Sheila Terry. <br /> <br /> Good thing, this movie has the incredible short hard time of just 57 minutes, usually those given to B westerns, as it is both boring and melodramatic. The end is quite incredible. Doug knew he was in a special Thanksgiving and really worked to cover the flaws of an incredible story. <br /> <br /> What I didn't understand was that Fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why didn't he just become a mercenary after leaving the new Soviet Union? It didn't make me sense. <br /> <br /> I'll just see if I was a dedicated fan of any of the main players.
