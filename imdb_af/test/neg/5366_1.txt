I was excited to see this show when I saw the promotions on A&E. I have been fascinated by the ghost and the paranormal since I was a child, and I loved getting "Ghost Hunters" when it was on (sci-fi channel). I tried to watch three episodes of the "Paranormal State" and just use my time to comment on it because it's so bad and the idea that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a believing freak. "Paranormal state" is past cheesy. Cheesy "Director's Log" voice leftover that leaves you for Captain Kirk. Cheesy teasers go in commercial breaks that are completely out of context. Everything that is paranormal to this show is automatically accepted as "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. Then come the exorcists, demonologists, psychics ... as in "Poltergeist" you almost expect the team to go and say, "This house is clear." I appreciate the "Ghost Hunters" approach, where they are going to refute claims, then take away what they can ... and they are almost always reassuring to the client (if they find something) that doesn't haunt is evil no. "Paranormal state" is not "so bad, it's good" ... it's just bad. Did A & E not stand for "Arts and Entertainment"? The art part has long since gone, and the entertainment factor is now also declining.
