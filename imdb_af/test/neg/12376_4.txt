I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I remember the scariest scene was the big bird eating men who hung helplessly from parachutes. The horror. The horror. <br /> <br /> As a young child on Saturday afternoon after these cheesy B movies, I was still tired of the formula for this monster-type movie that usually includes the hero, a beautiful woman who is the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster finally died. I don't care much about the romantic corner as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the unintentional humor. <br /> <br /> But about a year or so later I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved the star, Janet Leigh, who hit the film early. . I got up and noticed at the time. As writers set up the story, it makes it as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.
