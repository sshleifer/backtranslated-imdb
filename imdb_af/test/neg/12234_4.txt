First movie comment ever! I'll start with the words "Come on! Wasn't it that bad ... was it?" ... No, it's not that bad. I laughed and peeped through the movie, so I couldn't tell my heart that it was junk. <br /> <br /> It's completely different, this and Epic Movie (Epic Movie sucks badly .. doh!). "How so?" people will ask. I'll tell you how. This movie is not as near as useless, not to mention the stupid (and I say stupid, because it is silly makes it funny) things that happen and with the characters is actually nice in this movie. Not the best thing to do though ... what would you expect - look at the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I find that when a comment is written, it should be more objective (my own opinion), but yes, it was, of course, stupid, it's a movie about 'stupid'! Look, I'm not telling you to watch the movie now, or you've missed the event of the century. What I am telling you is that if you see the movie somewhere, don't cut your eyes on the openings. See what it's about - who knows, you might have a little bit of it. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 because I'm not that bad, and let me laugh and some unexpected good sex-related jokes.
