Yes. It takes a Norwegian to destroy and kill two big books and a concept that will work well on film. This movie is really the worst Swedish movie of all time. I hate it so badly that I even considered going out of there, something I've never done before. But it was so terrible that I was almost compelling. I just had to sit to the end. Like an early 80-year-old Stallone action role, this one FIRST takes Swedish action back to the stone age. So full of logical mistakes and stupid mistakes, it's almost amusing - but who can ever see something good in the terrible play, Mark Hamill's survivor of a minefield or dumb ass, useless and irrational action? <br /> <br /> Let me ask you: are we not wearing zero-clock watches, is the hero escaping in the neck of time and two friends reuniting enemies at the end? STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> And another thing: the product placement in this movie is incredible. While other countries understood that it would not be so boring, the Swedish film industry did not seem to understand at all: just look at the credit card that Hamilton uses to open a window? Or or ... this movie really makes me angry.
