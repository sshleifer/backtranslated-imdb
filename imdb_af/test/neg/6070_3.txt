Trite and unoriginal. It's like someone who has watched Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and decides to mix them up and steal other formal parts of the movie to make another one. As with most historical movies these days, there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better fit the story, which is largely understandable. For example, during the remaining days of Beethoven's life, other people needed to write down what they needed to say so that he could understand it. It would of course be a nuisance to show on the screen. The writing, though filled with a few quotas, does not hold the feel of that period and, along with a bad play, looks pretty contemporary. Diane Kruger is nice enough to look at, but she still has a lot to improve on her craft. Ed Harris doesn't work for me as Beethoven and I especially blame Gary Oldman. Overall, not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro's life. Better find yourself a copy of Immortal Beloved. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
