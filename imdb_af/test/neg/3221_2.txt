A friend of mine decided to rent this thing, fortunately it wasn't my money. Pretty much, however, wasted my time. A story that might have been interesting was totally wasted by amazingly bad acting and horrible editing / directing. Maybe it could be a classic because of all the strange overworking :) (Gary Busey's character, for example). All the exaggerated characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a bit interesting because they grabbed your attention (for all the wrong reasons of course) where the movie itself failed. In short: A waste of time and money <br /> <br /> 2/10
