As Joe Bob Briggs would say, this movie relies heavily on the actress's talents rather than their talent. This early 1990s show-the-babes-in-bikini festival has very little to loose it, other than to show beautiful women almost naked. Joe Estevez, Martin Sheen's little brother, proves again that his film career will be nowhere near his brother's career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one unless you like to look at pretty women in thin clothes. It's about the only thing that saves it.
