My first impression of the Saikano: Live Action movie car (see on YouTube) was "Wow, it may be one of the few better-performing action anime adjustments." <br /> <br /> This time I was just wrong! Simply put, the live action Saikano movie was a puzzle that misses a few pieces; <br /> <br /> The movie story vaguely follows the anime and manga, but the movie story is just the framework. from a car rather than a full car. It seems that many parts of the story were originally omitted in the anime, changed or completely changed. In fact, the end is completely different from the manga or anime ends. <br /> <br /> Characters in particular; many have run out or had a different feeling. The connection between Fuyumi and Shuji has been reduced to that of Shuji who knows her because she is the video store lady. Chise's character felt too strong and only responded to the infamous. I'm sorry a few times in the movie. The same can be said with Shuji. We have the shy, unceasing but long male lead, the song he has lost hums, and his regular action to fool Chise. Other characters like Tetsu and Akemi had a different, rounded feel to them. Perhaps the fall and toning of other characters was much more focused on Chise and Shuji, which did. Too much. Do you expect many sweet action scenes like those in the trailer? Well, don't! Those in the trailer plus a few minutes are the only amount of action you will get. So much of the movie speaks as I watch the movie before I watch it all, I thought I got a regular Asian romance drama. <br /> <br /> Pacing was way too fast. In the film we see the well-known scene of Chise armed with small wings and a chain rifle arm, in just a little less than nine minutes to get it started. There is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. What they had to do was split it into two movies, or even a trilogy. If it wasn't, it would change or fall. <br /> <br /> But again, the movie plays like a frame. The anime was more of a complete car because even the small details and such small ones can really pick up. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * <br /> <br /> Visuals-Visual was disappointing. So many of the special effects have been challenging with quite a few cases, especially the CGI. Unfortunately, they were like those found on Sci-Fi channel movies. They are portable and this movie is not for the effects. <br /> <br /> -Music- Music was average. Many were orchestral background music, except that there were really no themes. The film has dropped the addictive song that Shuji always humming in the anime. A noticeable piece of music is the end of the song heard in the trailer. Not a bad and somewhat beautiful song. It is a pity that it is not integrated into the movie itself or an orchestrated version of the song. <br /> <br /> Composition of Saikano was also so-so. The lead star was Chiki actor Aki Maeda, who is best known for her role in the Battle Royale films. The actor who played Shuji was pretty good, but they took away the glasses of the original character. Oh and Tetsuo looks like Lupine the 3rd. <br /> <br /> Unlike what I heard from a few others, the play in the live action Saikano wasn't that bad. Rather, I feel guilty of the way the story was laid out and the series just stuck in a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> * What can be learned from the live action Saikano: * <br /> - CGI- I really wish the CGI in Saikano wasn't that bad. But even with that, we could have gotten some more scenes! Probably the most anticipated live anime adaptation Neon Genesis Evangelion is unlikely to suffer, as they currently have WETA Studios assigned to do the effects. <br /> <br /> -Modernism-Fuyumi owned a video store. Chise used a sound cassette player to listen to music and give Shuji a mixer for his birthday. Why? This movie is made in 2006! Not only in film reality, they can create something like Chise so it can't happen in the 90's! The future is an age of CDs, DVDs and MP3 players. Hopefully the Shinji in the gospel will have a Sony Walkman MP3 player. Not one that plays cassette tapes. <br /> <br /> -Story & Pacing- As mentioned earlier, the Saikano movie became too fast and forced the story to drop many details. It was a clever move on ADV Films and everyone else to make Gospel in a solid trilogy, allowing more time to make the story as possible as possible to the original. <br /> <br /> -Characters-Leave most of the character designs alone and let those classic quotes be said! What if the living action Gospel does not Asuka's "What are you, stupid?" or Shinji's "I shouldn't run away!" Sometimes as small as they look, add the regular quotes and who the characters are. <br /> <br /> * CONCLUSION: * <br /> <br /> All in all, the live action had Saikano movie potential. It really did. Those you are not fans of and see this movie: You will be reluctant to start the anime or manga (don't even watch the movie!) People who saw and loved the anime don't get your hope this one. Studies show that you will most likely be disappointed. It was still fun to see the anime come alive in the live action adaptation, but it could have been so much more. <br /> <br /> I cautiously give live action Saishu Heiki Kanojo (Saikano) a 2 out of 5. <br /> <br /> If Chise says, "I'm sorry" <br /> <br /> ~ NekoTakuto
