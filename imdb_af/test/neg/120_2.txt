It actually bothered me to say this, but this movie was terrible at every level. The blame is not entirely at Van Damme, as you can see that he has tried his best, but let's see, he's almost fifty, how much more can you ask him? I find it so hard to believe that the same people who compiled undisputed 2; probably the best (western) martial arts movie in years, it created. Everything from the plot, the dialogue, the editing, the overall acting was just terribly compounded and in many cases boring and stupid. Scott Adkins, whose combat scenes look more like a demo rule, was also terribly underutilized and not even the biggest villain so shy, because 1) He is more than capable of playing that role and 2) The real chief villain was not only intimidating, but also very annoying. Again, do not blame Van Damme. I will always be a fan, but avoid this one.
