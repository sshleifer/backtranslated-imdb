I was a little worried about the theater, I came out with rage at the garbage (past for a movie) I saw. The actors, especially Travolta, should be ashamed of their participation in this. The only thing in their minds was clearly the payment control, no matter what the talent of our talent was. Travolta has to go back to do some more "Look who's Talking" movies, as he has slipped back to the level of his pre-Tarantino work. It comes down to something when the LW Talking successors are better than that. Travolta is no longer the King of Cool, but the King of Corn. Michael Caine himself allowed to do bad movies for the checkout, Trvolta must follow it if he has self-respect!
