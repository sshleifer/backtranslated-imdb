Terrible, stupid, silly movie dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchasing Timber Company. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and improper. A member of the college's English Department can only sign his name with an X. <br /> <br /> When it appears that a straight-cut senator (Victor Moore) comes to the state to investigate, everyone tries the innocent but foolish Bob Hope character. <br /> <br /> Is it a wonder that Vera Zorina didn't get the part of Mary in 1943's "For whom the toll did"? Of course, the Corrupt officials, along with Hope, are trying to show Zorina photos with Moore to destroy him politically. Moore married the head of the restaurant he insulted when he asked for a ham sandwich. He thought the reason she was upset was because it was a kosher restaurant. This is the range of humor this absolute mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> When Hope tries to defend himself in Congress, he does a reduction of James Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." By that time the movie went too far for any good response. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics are both absolutely horrible. The song Louisiana praised in different ways is absolutely horrible. Irving Berlin had something to do with the music of this totally horrible movie?
