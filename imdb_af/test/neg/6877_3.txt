Here he is. A new horror icon for the new millennium. Better than Freddy. More dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More angry than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But his time is here. <br /> <br /> Ray The Prick. <br /> <br /> Yes, the antagonist, Ray is a complete dot. This is partly due to the naughty things he does. Also because he has a scar on his face. But mainly because Ray The Prick is milked. <br /> <br /> Yes, Ray doesn't hurt. He is not even cursed, not even by a voodoo game. No, Ray The Prick's milk. As DeNiro once said, you can milk anything with nipples. And Ray's milk. Of evil. <br /> <br /> How do you milk evil you ask? Snake nipples, I answer. Snake nipples. <br /> <br /> Why do you ask Ray? Being a prick, I answer. Capital P. <br /> Look out for the New Line Pictures extravaganza titled "Freddy Vs. Ray The Prick". <br /> <br /> Do you think your new horror savior was Jeeper The Creeper? Well, no more, because Ray The Prick is here. And I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the atmospheric lesser, PG-13, unmistakable real quality of the movie, because Ray is a star.
