The trailer is so misleading ... I thought it would be a good movie ... What was the point of killing the women in Hong Kong? They could have done it in Paris. And the fist half hour: <br /> <br /> - It loves me! <br /> <br /> No, I don't! You love me! <br /> <br /> No, I don't! You love me! <br /> <br /> No, I don't! Repeat for 100 times ... then ... Well, I don't love you ... So I shoot you! : D So here's why movie piracy is a good thing! Imagine if I even give money for this torture! I'm sorry for the time I lost it to watch ... the filmmakers have to pay me <br /> <br /> for the inconvenience ... Worst movie ever seen ...
