I usually do not classify a movement as boring. I'm not big on action lenses and my senses don't have to be stimulated during a movie. In fact, I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have any of those features. Diane Lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty can't save it. Terrible residual music is equal to the moronic dialogue and acting. None of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the film does not relate to the audience. I think the scenes where the townspeople are marching somewhere were supposed to add to the story, but it seems they are just inserted to fill the space. The screens appear slack and incoherent. There were some nice shots of the sea and the beach which was beautiful.
