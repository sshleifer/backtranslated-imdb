I'm sorry, but I just can't honestly see why anyone would really like it. It's stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers are NOTHING like they were at this show !! Personally, I'm glad it was canceled after the first few episodes. I mean, this kind of show will definitely be good if everyone knew that home teachers were not really that way, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of it. If someone who looked at it actually believed it was what happened to a home schooler, I felt sorry for them. It reminds me of the kind of portrayal they have of homeschooling children in Mean Girls. It is sad, really, that people think so. It's a complete garbage, IMHO.
