I don't find a reason to save social value. Whatever the book or movie people want to suppress, from Huck Finn / Heart of Darkness to, I don't know, Deep Throat or the latest hostage abstention, I wish they didn't. I am not a lover of porn or violence, but what about those I give is that I tend to see camera angles, cuts, pans, lighting, rhythms, almost to the exclusion of fear or titulation, sometimes even missing filmmakers 'or actors' intention. Even from footage that reasonable people may argue, never had to exist, I always think there's something to learn. I wonder more about how a movie does than what it does. Maybe it's wrong of me. Better, but louder than the dissolution of unpleasant theater, can be cuts, pans, etc. To see, with one and inseparable from whatever content. I ask myself what horror film makers and church architects have in common. Add in political filmmakers, fascist and not. Everyone manipulates with light, space and sound to change perception and mood. How else are their goals? How else are the goals of those who are genuinely horrifying movies as propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I left it indifferent for almost a year. Curiosity made me buy. On the day it arrived, I sampled a few minutes of the "1", up to the awkward, healthy street corner that seemed to be an attack on the viewers' sensibility, but found it improper but effective. I definitely have to come back but didn't enjoy the prospects. Clearly, it was not the sublime horror of Cairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the rawer, but still traditionally the horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, the overt political work of Koji Wakamatsu, or even the brilliant cruelty of the early Cronenberg. br /> <br /> Maybe the word "attack" is key. Matsumura does not attack his characters, but his viewers. I can't see it at this stage in history without thinking of both Abu Garib (which I think I remember was shown on video) and the hostage videos, but also about Godard's martyrs (in Le Petit soldier?) who's atrocity is just a job, a break from a person's work day. And then there are the long-lasting news reports from Northern California whose details I barely remember, but it can't quite forget, because it also means 'cinema', a duo serial killers notorious, if the proposal doesn't play games with my memory not, <br /> <br /> All three ANL entries are revenge films, vigilant exercises, but I attach these notes to ANL3 because it is the most ambitious and can be a turning point for director Matsumura. (I didn't see the entries that followed ANL3.) Through the first two offers I thought a camera was in the hands of one of those fringe children of middle or grammar school, obsessively warring or draw other atrocities. (Or as one of Matsumura's revengeful characters has become author-director. Anyone who sees what Michael Powell's Peeping Tom didn't see will do well to see it.) But ANL3 looks like the mainstream. Matsumura's protagonist grows carnivorous plants, which for some typically allow Japanese cool close-up shots. There is also a Matsumura movie, a traditional erotic order for the first time: Kikuo's female boss slumbering and gazing at him as he looks at the love hotel's clients. Kikou finds himself dissatisfied. He is a middleman voyeur. The short excitement comes from the low voyeurism. There is even a philosophical / poetic rubbish sifting, a rubbish voyeur that somehow reminds me of the poem that is repeated in Wakamatsu's not-as-it-sounds like Go, Go, Second Time Virgin. <br /> <br /> I'm not getting anywhere, and it gets in the way of my comments on other movies. Can't escape the suspicion that I will be running a Matsumura retrospective in my local film archive for a few years. Perhaps it is hosted by a learned character trapped on something I miss. <br /> <br /> How much does it matter for the director to "or just" get his deadly distorted protagonists? Should he even understand them? Perhaps a director's job is just to spray it out, then critics, sociologists, and the rest of us exchange things. Perhaps direct or artistic responsibility is a false idea. <br /> <br /> My final battle with this thing made me wonder what a woman thinks on earth to watch these overwhelming male exercises. We put women over and over again, from Star Wars to et cetera and so on, and again and again and again, but is something as masculine as the All Night Longs?
