In Thailand, Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his friend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) are contested in a Muay-Thai battle, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She is asking the hotel for a stranger, indeed the average vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of vampire vampires in motorcycles. Connor joins a group of "good" vampires led by Sang (Stephanie Chao) to rescue Amanda from Niran's claws. <br /> <br /> I was expecting "Vampires: The Turning" was a great movie. The places and cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy music score is excellent; Stephanie Chao is beautiful and attractive; but unfortunately the script and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of Meredith Monroe does not help her fallen breasts. The story is very short, and the unknown Marty Weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle races, battles and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum movie run time. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampiros: A Convers√£o" ("Vampires: The Conversion")
