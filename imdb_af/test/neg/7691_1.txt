This piece of crap is not worth a critical review, so I'll write information for those who don't know the background of this movie. First, it's not the first Saudi movie, they use this wrong information for commercial purposes (they lied!). Secondly, they made it for money, not something else, so they won the Star (like Big Brother). It's a popular show and the Jerk Hesham is popular, but stupid, cheesy & untalented, the well-known Kuwait actor chose. Mohammed Al Sairafi (also stupid and indisputable), but has a popular (count how many times I use the word "popular", and send me an email to get your prize.) Has a popular show and the Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan who appeared in POPular comic show CBM (unfunny), so she is known * PoPular! Then they selected a few Saudi actors for .. blah blah blah. The funniest thing is the director! He is Canadian with Palestinian roots (I believe the identity of the movie is the identity of his director). Wait a minute! The screenplay was written by an Egyptian scriptwriter (very terrible one!). With a little help from Lebanese critic (known as critic, but actually he is a money collector!). This group of multi-racial (money slaves) knows nothing of the Saudi culture they do not represent, but if we know who is behind this garbage, all our questions will be relieved! Waleed bin Talaal is Saudi prince and (BUSINESSMAN) who do not care about the Saudi culture or Saudi people, he does not even live in Saudi Arabia (even if he lives, he will live in his own world, his world is far away from the real world people world) so he knows nothing about anything but cares for his endless fortune. <br /> <br /> * Not a Saudi movie. /> Screw them all. <br /> <br /> Beeps out of 10!
