Warning: It can spoil your movie. See it, see if you agree. <br /> <br /> Thinking that we as humans cannot learn from the past. The futuristic society portrayed has glowed Hitler's beliefs, wiping out a race of people (in this case men) in favor of society. It made me sick to my stomach. The plausibility of a Y-bomb is also insane. Even in war, our instinct for self-preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity. We made mistakes in the past, namely: Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in '45, but as a result, we avoided a bigger mistake in 63 during the Cuban missile crisis.
