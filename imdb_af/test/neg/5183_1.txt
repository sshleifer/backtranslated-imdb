This movie is just terribly horrible, the movie was just an hour long and for about 25 minutes the movie was just useless random snowboard clips that didn't even relate to the movie. The storyline is completely "again", my 5-year-old cousin can probably write a better script. I don't understand how anyone can afford the production of a movie like this ... This is definitely the most horrific movie I've ever seen in my entire life. I think the deciding director just took a few random children off the street to perform in this movie. Directing, acting, producing and writing this movie are all really bad. I feel bad for the people who have lost money to fund this garbage. You couldn't pay me to see this shit again.
