Ed Wood is driving again. The fact that this film was made must give any young <br /> <br /> aspiring filmmaker hope. Any screenplay you may have thought of using <br /> <br /> to direct a trash or birdcage shouldn't look that bad. Don't watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. When I watched this <br /> <br /> movie, I realized that Boa vs. Python was not so bad at all. It would probably have been better to do this movie in Claymation, because at least this way, no actor would have to have credit to be in this movie. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases. There is a bright side to watching this movie in. If you can get someone to bring you a bag of cookies, then you can get your way out of the khaki cheese that surrounds you, eating you <br /> <br / > Look at your TV set's cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.
