John Candy was a hit-or-miss comic actor. His death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot, but WAGONS EAST, in which he plays a clumsy wagon master who agrees to take a group of pioneers from the wild, is even sad. I don't understand why it was even released. The story is pointless and weak, and the jokes aren't there. It made me even worse that Candy's last movie would be his worst movie. Let's forget about this one and remember him in his better films like summer rental, airplanes, trains and cars and uncle bucket. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5
