Cujo is a giant, sweet, gentle and loving St Bernard owned by the Camber family. In the opening hours, Cujo chases a rabbit across the fields and through a local wood somewhere in Castle Rock, Maine. The hare disappears in a shovel and Cujo stumbles his head into the entrance hole. The rabbit vanishes from Cujo's eyes, angry, starts beating Cujo, and inadvertently wakes up and aggravates a colony of bats, one of which bites him on the nose. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) has a relationship with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, Dee Wallace's real husband), who discovers her husband, Vic (Daniel Hugh Kelly), who works in advertising. Obviously their relationship is strained. Fortunately, it is unaware of all these things, their young son Tad (Danny Pintauro). Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) is restoring cars for the life of his barn on his farm. Joe is planning a weekend with one of his friends Gary Pervier (Mills Watson) when his wife, Charity (Kaiulani Lee) wins $ 5,000 on the lottery and decides to join their young son Brett (Billy Jayne and Billy Jacoby) take. to see her parents. When he got to Gary's house to pick him up, Joe found himself dead on the floor. He goes to the kitchen to ask for help and his dog, Cujo, who is now rabid and kills him. Donna and Tad drive to Camber's farm to try to repair her car. The place is deserted except for Cujo who is now completely rabid, foamy on the mouth, his fur dyed red with blood and bruised by pain. Cujo drops the car to try Donna and Tad, fortunately for them, the windows stay firm, at least for the moment. Donna tries to start the car, but it has completely broken down, they are both caught up with nothing but the hope that someone will come and save them. Cujo is awake, ready to attack and kill anyone crossing his path. Directed by Lewis Teague I thought the movie was a little slow for my taste. The first half strung together, the second half built a steam head, but I still felt it was a little bit subversive and unaware. The acting is good by everyone involved, I have no complaints there. Technically, the movie is OK, photography, music, special effects, editing and it's generally made good. The big problem is the script of Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier and in particular it is the first half, most of which seems to extend the run time. It only took more than 90 minutes to think. It's also a bit predictable. Cujo as a monster never really scared me, but I don't think it is a villain overweight. St Bernards, scary, I think. I think there's nothing really wrong with that, but I don't think I'll be in a hurry to see it again. On average, not too bad if you can get a copy cheaply or it's free on T.V. can get.
