These movies wanted to shake me to live why this abomination is not the bottom 100 list I don't know. <br /> <br /> My healing power of danny trejo saved my life. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever, I dare watch you. It's like a 90-minute collection of calling commercial, just much worse. I'd rather look at the blue screen, it's really that bad
