Power began to be promising, but quickly became boring and boring to watch. The plot is about an old Aztec doll that owns those who own it. The idea is "decent enough" and this movie would have been pretty entertaining if it was done better. But after the first ten minutes or so it soon becomes boring; We do not get good death scenes and have to listen to many talks. In the end, one of the occupied men meets his death for two girls, but it is not very interesting and certainly not a pity. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend the power to any horror or slasher. if there was little to know.
