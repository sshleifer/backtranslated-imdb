The filmmakers apparently had enough money to afford proper makeup effects, but not enough for a creature that would convincingly attack and attack. We never get the chance to see the "monster" movement from one place to another - when that happens (presumably), the camera focuses on the "terrible" reactions of the people who are near. And when a man is attacked by it, it simply appears that he is holding a lifeless object against himself so that it does not fall to the ground. It's not the worst "Alien" rip-off (the two "Xtro" movies are even worse, for example); It's really fun if you save 68 (!!) minutes. (* 1/2)
