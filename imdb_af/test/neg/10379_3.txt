An add-on exorcism exercise with a disappointing non-fidelity and the use of the term 'blackwater'. The cinematography appears right from basic cable MOW land that removes any tinge of marshy, dark atmosphere from the proceedings. In addition, there are not enough gore, sex or attractive young things to satisfy the majority of the film's targeted viewers. It is said, the main actress playing the possession has a sexy olive-present presence. What still needs to be said about this non-winner? Do not rent unless you have a thing for middle-aged adults who interfere with their past and shrink, shrink clich√©d priests, Spanish stalwarts who regret their past actions.
