Antonio Margheriti, director of the enjoyable cheesy cult gruel Cannibal Apocalypse, helms this Gothic-flavored Giallo-leading gambling 70s icon Jane Birkin (as well as her massive-consolidated French lover of the day, Serge Gainsbourg). <br /> Unfortunately, despite the inclusion of such delicacies as a nice two-sex French teacher and a very unrealistic killer orangutan, seven deaths in the Cat's Eye become a thirsty mess that is a battle is to endure, end up. <br /> <br /> After years, beautiful school girl Corringa (Birkin) returns to her family's Scottish estate, only to discover that a maniac is killing her one by one. Margheriti combines a confusing story that sometimes promises supernatural action, but ends with a lame cop man, who has a meager copy of a haunting old house, that ends up being extremely extreme. <br /> <br /> "And where does the cat fit all this?" I hear asking. Well, a rather pudgy moggy witnessed every murder, justifying Margheriti's rather cool sounding title. <br /> <br /> 'Gory, stylish fun' claims the DVD cover; "Boring Pile Missing" says I.
