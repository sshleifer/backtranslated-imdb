One night at McCool's you want to think it's a hip and smart black comedy. It pushes its "peculiar" characters and "exaggerated" situations at the viewer like a cracker making overtime. The premise is about a gold digger named Jewel, who immediately puts men to steal and sometimes kill them, so they can have all the worldly possessions she desperately desires. You know, it would not be a bad strategy if she pursued the rich. This movie really wants to believe that a foxy con artist will waste the time bartenders and Andrew "Dice" waste Clay. Please. The big mistake in Jewel's scheme is really the only entertainment found in this stinker (and it is unintentional). If you see it, it's hard to believe that there might be a good movie in the area. One night at McCool's just couldn't decide which direction it was going to take, so just sit in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. It tries to be sexy, but no clothes are removed on camera, and the few scenes of body head are terribly pedestrian. There is one recurring scene where a Hitman asks the protagonist (played by Matt Dillon) about how sex with Jewel is. Matt doesn't seem to know, nor the viewers. Why did he talk to her anyway? One night at Mccool's will also be funny. Sorry, bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings didn't even work on Three's Company. What's worse is that this movie really looks like it's going to be a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy. Similar to a socio-social Coen brothers movie, but his level writing could not play subtly, and his fearless dirt sledge hammer could not be in any shock either. What the audience is left with is a film that is trying to please everyone and just call on the road.
