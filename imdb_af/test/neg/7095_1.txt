This movie ripens off every gang / gangster movie ever made. LP Da Last Don has a reference to every movie. The acting was by far the worst I ever saw. Who is John Mario anyway? His play was by far the worst I have ever seen. He's doing bad actors. As far as Master P goes, he sells faster than a N * sync concert. I really wish I was there to tell the whole production company: WHAT THE HELL DID YOU THINK WHEN THE SCRIPTURE WAS MADE? "It is clear that these people are so tied up on the gangster image that they have decided to make a movie and live their gangster lives in their minds. One thing I know is that there was no one who this movie didn't want to spread, so it seems (and predictably) that the guys at NO restriction had to start, NO restriction movies. I said enough! This movie is terrible and it doesn't deserve a movie!
