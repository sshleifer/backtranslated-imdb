This movie was not very good to me. Although it wasn't half an hour, I didn't feel happy. There were parts where I jumped and a few small violent / gory scenes, but overall just one who was easily scared would consider this movie scary. <br /> <br /> The overall writing and acting was very poor. The characters never developed or grew as humans. Even at the end, the chief, whatever his name, did not act and had to be saved from the fire at the last moment. The plot also had inconsistencies. The police officer killed was NOT murdered in the same way he died in the match. The October October girl mentioned that in order to kill the evil demon lady, you had to read something of the correct text. Funny how they never bother it, and still managed to escape. The Malcolm-in-the-Middle died in the game but did not die in real life. Also, playing the game itself was very poor writing. It would have been good for the brother's death, just to let them play again. But you have to play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play ... why do you even need the game? If you like movies like the Ring and the thing, it's scary and fun, watch this movie. If you know such a person, you can see to laugh, do it. If you like horror movies that make you laugh aloud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do it. Otherwise, far away.
