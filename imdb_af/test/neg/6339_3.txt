Disappointing comedy drama with sentimental layer ideally cast Michael J. Fox as a former child star now managing a talent agency for thespian tots; Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are his assistants. It all sounds like it can't be missed, but too much of the scenario is surrendered to Christina Vidal, who is a streetwise man who believes Fox will be the next big thing. They quickly include lock heads, and the handling dialogue takes them back and forth to an uninteresting, formula finish. Fox and Lane are both attractive, but the energy of the early scenes gives way to move. Sharpening produced, but eventually birthday. * 1/2 of ****
