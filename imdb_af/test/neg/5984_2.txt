It seems to go somewhere, then the main characters quickly lead to a three-ring circus of remarkable stupidity that permanently destroys the liquidation of the characters. I'm a great collector of Stoner movies, but that's something I won't consider a valid add-on. Bong Water is a waste of the deepest areas of the dumpster, and I won't be dead on my shelf. I'm actually convinced that this movie was created by a partnership for a drug-free America. If you are a Jack Black fan, I will say you might think 5 minutes of the movies are OK because Jack Black will sing his legacy of songs for delays. I really can't say enough bad things about this movie.
