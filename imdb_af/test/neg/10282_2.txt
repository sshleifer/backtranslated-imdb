The show is at least partially decayed (it's not reality, but just as if it is reality), which makes me believe, at least anyone without the face blurred out is a fake episode. <br /> <br /> Prove in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed. There is already a camera crew on the boat before he gets there, can be seen as his boat approaches. <br /> <br /> The actors playing "ambulance officers" did not remove his shirt or the <br /> <br /> They also parked the ambulance in the parking lot and did not drive to the Emergency Access. It doesn't make sense unless it's fake and they won't be allowed to go there)
