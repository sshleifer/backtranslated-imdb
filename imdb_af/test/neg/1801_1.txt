Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, had a clear sense of description that made this book amazing. While reading this book, I drew every scene into my head and I knew what each character looked like. This book had many pieces and when I read the book, the puzzle seemed to be complete. After reading Heat of Darkness, I watched the movie, which was a mistake. The movie cut out so many important parts. For example, in the novel, Marlow waited a long time for the rivets to come and fix his boat. It was a great source of futility. In that movie that part just left out. The film added more parts that were useless and didn't make sense. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book, Kurtz hit the neck and killed him. What purpose did that scene have, except to make the audience sorry for the monkey? It is as if the writer did not even read the whole book and just put the parts he read in the movie. If I hadn't read the novel before I watched the movie, I would have been thoroughly confused. The book was wonderful and it is truly a classic American literature, but the film can be well-named for the worst picture in the Razzie Awards.
