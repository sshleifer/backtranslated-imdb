This movie is a good example of what happens if a studio wants a sequel to a fine movie from the gates at all costs. Only with this movie is it really nearby. Everything looks in place for Robocop 2 to be a worthy follow-up to the first groundbreaking film. The complete original cast (apart from the casualties, of course) returns and gives it their best. Bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as well as neutralizing their efforts. <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner may have been the ideal to go to George Lucas to head the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner, there is not much in the luxury movie series of Lucas. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have needed to return Paul Verhoeven, or a director with enough buyer to give his own spin. Kershner does not know how to give his own spin (Lucas has appointed him for that) and he is certainly not Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> So, what we get here is a movie that goes through all the movements to repeat the first movie, but with nothing of the freshness, humor or bravery of the original. Kershner probably thought he could add Verhoeven through more gore and gratuitous violence, but instead he revealed how much he was at work as a director for rent instead of a passionate movie maker. And it's a pity, because everything was in place to make this other classic. As mentioned, the actors give their best, but Phill Tippet delivers some groundbreaking stop-motion effects and there are some good ideas in the story by Frank Miller, who was born to write a Robocop movie. If only the studio hired a director who was capable enough to make all the potential.
