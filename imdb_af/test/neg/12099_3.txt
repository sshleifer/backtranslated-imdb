Cheesy 80's horror co-genre genre favs Ken Foree and Rosalind Cash with Brenda Bakke are some of the leading players in this haunted story. Goofy dialogue and some nasty effects make this movie lookable. Not bad, but no good shake. <br /> <br /> Recommended for bad dialogue and acting. Only B movies. <br /> <br /> B
