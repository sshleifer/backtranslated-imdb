This movie is really bad. Most of it looks like it was filmed in a park or basement. There is a huge spin, but all we see is one leg. There are a few worms living in a cave, which are only cheap socks with cardboard boxes. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that doesn't make sense at all. The whole thing is just laughable.
