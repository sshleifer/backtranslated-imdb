The only reason I checked this movie was to see the "early" Kim Bassinger. That, and the fact that my TV guide said it was a "grab", and it was three-star rated. The rating must have come from the man who wrote this drift because the only suspension in this movie was whether I would finish it or not. Robert Culp turns in what the "disaster" of his career should be as a cop who is not even close to credible. At one point, ONLY is a suspect, including a frail old woman. If you deliberately want to watch a poorly written, pound-like, poorly-activated movie ... go for it. It can appreciate you compared to fine movies. I wish I returned that hour and thirty-six minutes.
