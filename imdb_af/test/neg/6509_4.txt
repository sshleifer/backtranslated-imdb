Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see this one and it was one of the worst things he did and Steven Seagal didn't help much. It starts with some strange religious murders that don't make much sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan). He is surprised to see a new friend waiting to work to crack the case, but Jack Cole doesn't seem to be what everyone thinks he is until Jack's ex-wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that eventually He also makes the suspect. It's the same thing as all his other movies: Smoke, CIA involvement and now try to be a normal policeman. Why does Steven sound like he is from a Western movie? And the prayer cattle also make things a little confusing.
