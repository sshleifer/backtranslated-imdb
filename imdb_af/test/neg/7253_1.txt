And I'm afraid I can't imagine why. It's really a really dire and extremely boring movie. In some ways, it is reminiscent of early science fiction when every set returned to a Hollywood bunch of what was lying around. From the mischievous and unconvincing set (seemingly about ten feet away) apparently made of plaster, to the actors who are also apparently made of plaster with "amusing" stereotypes that have been poorly painted, to the strange warm pool in a frozen cave to the survival of the unashamed role when medium shields burst a few meters on open ground, and finally the horrible script that reads like a training manual more than a movie. I really can't tell how boring it is. Even the opportunity to see if young James Dean survived was not enough to keep me awake for more than an hour. It's really one that should be avoided at ALL costs.
