A true expectation, the novel is such a brilliant gurgling journey in madness, but it is made for TV movie style nonsense is painful and painfully slow. Stick to Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body made a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick threw it on the cover, he had to take over this one. Stacey Keach is too sloppy like Lou Ford, and the whole thing has the same production value as the seventh TV spin, from Planet Of The Apes. I strongly recommend that you purchase and purchase many Jim Thompson novels, actually The Grifters are not doing badly, it's one of them, with Jon Cusak in the lead.
