Sometimes a movie cannot be easily classified. Such a movie is "Tank Girl", sharing cartoon, sharing comedy, and part action movie. I'm probably somewhere there is a "Tank Girl" audience, but it's extremely small, maybe punk comic book readers. Most viewers will be looking for an early exit or with the fast forward button. The only redeeming quality is short bursts of humor "find me a microscope and a few tweezers", but these tiny moments of comic relief are swung through the sophomorical actions. There is no character development, it is not surprising, as the source is a comic book. Do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid. - NOTE
