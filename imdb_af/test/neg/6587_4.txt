I borrow it on DVD from a friend the other day. I didn't really know what to expect. I didn't see many Russian movies, and I don't think I've ever seen a Russian war movie. Maybe I was expecting something different, something more in line with an imaginary Russian mentality. But whatever their expectations come from, they are ashamed, as it is a very common war movie. <br /> <br /> The whole formula of following some young people from their recruitment, through training, to deployment and through some battles, is well known. We have seen it many years ago, as well as more recently (as at Jarhead). Sure, there's a difference here, because the film is about Russian soldiers instead of Americans, as is almost always the case. But in general it can be just like a Vietnam movie. I think it just shows me that Afghanistan was the Soviet Union Vietnam. A country that had to be a superpower, has caused the war for many years with a terrible loss of life for both soldiers and civilians. <br /> <br /> The good points in this movie made me feel like good photo is some beautiful ambiance shots) and decent effects for what I thought should have been a pretty low budget movie. What disappointed me is mostly the story itself. It just doesn't beat an emotion in me. Mostly because character development is common. And to really feel something when people are fired, you have to make people, not just faceless cardboard cuttings. They fail to do this in this movie. This too is too long, and it seems like a recent trend. In my opinion, a movie over two hours long has a lot to offer, and this movie does not cut it. There is also a disturbing music set over every scene like a wet blanket. Especially in action scenes it is very disturbing, not that you need action music, but something more than just a slow keyboard music will be nice. Otherwise, the production values ​​were good enough, which was not where the problem was. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to watch this movie. As a reminder of the fact that no matter where you are, the war is struggling? That Russian filmmakers have watched too many American war films to make something original? Regardless, this movie is rather clicked, lacking in spirit and, while having acceptable technical characteristics, lacks in the development of writing and character. In the end it just becomes one of all the war movies that doesn't make you think and fails to add something to the genre. I saw a lot worse, but also much better. I rate this 4/10.
