The 1935 version of "Enchanted April" simultaneously runs boring <br /> <br /> and perfunctories. It is difficult to shoot the transformative magic of Italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical Italian behavior to belabor. The transformation of the four strangers fleeing London is instantaneously cut from the first day after a week later. Instead of developing, the script flashes a switch and the <br /> <br /> characters differ. <br /> <br /> The men are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up, even if their presence is not the four women back in their shells and / or hostilities. <br /> <br /> Jessie Ralph has the most fun (instead of chewing <br /> <br /> completely) and Katharine Alexander has some sad charm from her <br /> <br /> man's shadow (and away from his boring drone). Ann Harding is <br /> <br /> unbeatable here (with the Production Code enforced). She had a <br /> <br /> appropriate rule in an earlier (pre-code) movie, "When Ladies Meet": "You're <br /> <br /> not a minute of one terrible hour worth it or one of us gave you, but in "Enchanted April" it can only look sore, storm out and preach to her mistress.
