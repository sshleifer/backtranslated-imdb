I find it hard to understand what the seer's feeling makes it a powerful movie. I would guess that the main intent of this movie would be a character study and the impact of racism in a British community. It is therefore increasingly disappointing that all the characters are two-dimensional and the acting is at the level of a college performing arts course. I'm always skeptical about "improvisation", another word for lazy to write a decent script. I was ashamed of the performances and sat in an audience that laughed when they had to be moved by the story. Racism is a serious problem, but I think a subtle approach to cinema works much better than trowel.
