Terrible psychological tension that is almost painful to go through, every aspect is terrible. <br /> <br /> The combined talents of top actors, Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman, have been completely wasted, and while performing well, one wonders why they are bothered. Mark Kasdan's writing is a complete mess, and Martin Campbell has jumped the story all over the place, but if you can't follow it, take it as a blessing. There are too many useless, crazy scenes that just don't make sense. Jerry Goldsmith's music is also not much. <br /> <br /> Although there was potential in the plot, director Campbell's approach completely destroyed it. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
