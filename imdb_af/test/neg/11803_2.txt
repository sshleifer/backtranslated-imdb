I was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out, said this movie was a real story. The majority of the scenes looked me up. For example, when one girl ate her sandwich and there was a cloth in it. While eating the sandwich, the camera on the opposite side showed that there was a khaki there. It's funny how the camera just filmed on the sandwich when the girl was eating it. Another scene is when the gang is going to open a wardrobe and a cat flew out of the closet or should I say it was thrown out to give it effect. This movie was not realistic at all. It is highly doubtful that the events that happened were where the "St. Francisville Experiment" took place that night. I believe the house can be haunted, but not at night this film is filmed! The end was amusing when Tim and other girl were chained to some cellar. Paul and Madison found and saved them! I'd rather look at the Blair Witch Project and then back through the St. Francisville Experiment movie sit down. As I said, if the creators of the movie didn't say it was a real story with real events, I might have more of it. Your better off is getting more fun from the Blair Witch Project (though it's not a real story either) !!!
