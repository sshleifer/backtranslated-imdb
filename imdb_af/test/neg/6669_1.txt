It is unfortunate that someone who is being humiliated by many children as well as parents, as well as parents should prevent themselves from appearing in these exploding bandwagon jump tops. I often wonder if Mr. Wisdom looked back in his later years to his excuse for a movie with pride. Sally Geeson had at least the decency to retire to do something worthwhile after being damaged in this low budget. A come through a long, forgotten doll, called the Pretty Things, can't save the movie from its fear. If you want to invest 60's nostalgia in 'Here we go around The Mulberry Bush' instead, with Barry Evans and Sally's sister Judy instead.
