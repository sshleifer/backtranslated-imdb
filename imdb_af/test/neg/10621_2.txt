Well, the name in the summary should tell you everything. FRED OLEN RAY - the modern King of low budget flicks, whether for television or directly to video (I doubt he is no longer producing the silver screen - killing the B-movie double-feature and everything ). <Br /> <br /> Creator of such cults (?) Classic, like Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and Dinosaur Island .... <br /> <br /> Well, I'm like these guys. It's mostly entertaining (in a clear cheesy, campy and especially inexpensive way) and if he's one thing, he's a pro-something you can't say to all the guys in the movie. <br /> <br /> But this one movie here is one of the weaker in his other. Insipid acting, an uninspired script and lame jokes conspiracy to anesthetize your brain in minutes. If you are looking for true F.O.R. goodness (or rather bad), look forward to the above, and generally its good from the 70s and 80s (I think he has lost some of his edge lately).
