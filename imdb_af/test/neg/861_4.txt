Sylvester, the cat, sneaks on a ship holding Tweety's bird with his owner Ouma. Oh, I don't even have enough words to convey how much I despise the Tweety and Grandma characters. They simply aren't funny to me and made it short to fix reality. Sylvester is a great character on his own, but there is just as much he can do when faced with the sheer horror of the cursed bid and the grandmother's senile old witch. This animated short can be found on disk 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and features an optional comment from Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
