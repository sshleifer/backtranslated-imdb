You will feel like you have experienced a holiday in hell after you sit down and watch this horrible TV movie. This movie is an exercise in overworking (very bad overworking) situations that have meant to be more than they are. I won't give away the plot, but once you realize why the people in this indigenous movie are in the movie, you will claim the two ruined hours of your life back. The only plus is that Marcia Brady walks in a bikini!
