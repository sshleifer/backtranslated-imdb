I had to rent a few movies for my cousin for New Year's and she chose The Swan Princess: The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom and The Little Mermaid 2 and we just watched both movies while they were sleeping, I thought I could get a few comments. :) While it's a very chaotic cartoon, it really wasn't that bad. You must acknowledge that this is important for children for these plots. This can be a good introduction to these stories for them. Odette finds out that Derek kept the magic secrets of Rostho secret and she tells Derek to destroy them right away, but he is an old man, usually he does not and tells her that the magic could not reach without his help. When a witch named Zelda gets her hands on them, she finds out that Derek destroys the last words of a game she wants to use to destroy everything, and she abducts Odette to get this information. <br /> <br /> The Swan Princess: The Secret of the Enchanted Kingdom is stupid and predictable, but to the children I would honestly say it is a twist. It's so scarce that we now have these cut-out cartoons, so I'm gonna cut the movie a bit. It was just strange, since all the voices suddenly changed, I grew up with the first one, so I think it was just in my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
