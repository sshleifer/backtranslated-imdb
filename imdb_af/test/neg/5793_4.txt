If you thought Herbie was trying to kill himself by forcing a bridge into 'The Love Bug', wait a minute until you see him gently see in this staggering, foolish second successor. Dean Jones is back as the driver who rides in Paris to Monte Carlo; This time his sensible VW falls in love with another race car, a Lancia run by Julie Sommars. By this time in the series, the energy and charm are even more lacking than in "Herbie Rides Again"; The movie is overlapping and thin, although it is denounced, thanks to the return of Jones's typically happy performance, a few funny pieces, and the throw of the fairground.
