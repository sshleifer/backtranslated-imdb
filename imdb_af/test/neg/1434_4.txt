It sounded like it would be like the Silence of the Lambs of Zodiac, or something, but it wasn't. It was really more like one of the Halloween movies without all the jumping scenes. It was a bit like Plan 9 from outer space, in the sense that the main bad man kept unwilling speeches that let me get a bite without breaking. The idea of ​​a person so crazy about kidnapping people and complicating them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but the execution is to make for TV feeling. I must say it was better than I expected for a movie and starring Dee Snider. A good first attempt. Maybe he'll learn lessons and his next attempt will be less clumsy.
