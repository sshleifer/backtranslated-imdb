The Daily Mail's Christopher Tookey had a few choices about this movie, among them "it looks completely through his 82 miserable minutes, and I guarantee you will shake your head and ask," Did we really descend to this? "Yes, we did, because if ever a film testifies to the utmost cynicism, tastelessness and moral corruption of those who make and make British films, this is this horror. "Tookey continues" aiming at undamaged underwear, dirty thoughts and knuckles that graze the pavement as they walk. This sex comedy is so sordid, indecent and unworthy that it is enough to put your sex, and indeed movies, to life "before closing the" Gender of the Potato Men is not just a really dirty movie, it is symptomatic of a new national culture of immediate self-gratification, yobbishness and sadism now being celebrated on the screen. "Normally, I don't listen too closely to the critics, but in this case Tookey was afraid of the money. It goes beyond just entering a little eternal and a bizarre parallel universe, where every painful minute is left for an hour and where the definition of "hilarious" is in a Brummie accent. depressed for anyone with half a brain who grew up with the Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, not the Nine O'Clock News and Fawlty Towers. <br /> <br /> Ideally, Sex Lives Of the Potato Men silence disappears after his release from the cinema and has b y the equally great Vix-spin The Fat Battles (2004) and the bad stars All Saints Vehicle Honest (2000) joined the celluloid cemetery, but it seems to be endless late-night schedule filling. shows and deceived "best movie ever!" raves of people who need to know better, so I have to apologize early to try to fix a mistake the British film industry has put into an undeserved world in all its wisdom. Yes, I'm really sorry to bring this one back from celluloid death, but I actually remember: "It can't be as bad as the critics said it was ... but, as God is, it was WORSE. <br /> <br /> Acting - much from start to finish, special mention for Mackenzie 'Albert Steptoe's legs on a young man's body' Crook. <br /> <br /> Sound track - cutting and paste 'ladrock' mostly skull-based lower-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle that brought back scary memories of seeing the chirpy cockers do the Lambeth Walk after a skim mimic of the Specials knob shiners Madness on every comedy / variety program in the Eighties ... and 'Ace Of Spades' by Motorhead as the title music?
