It is proof that filmmakers and their financiers treat their audience with contempt, not a new phenomenon, as it was done so early in the 1940s and HOUSE OF Dracula is a good example. You think you have a movie with Dracula, the wolfman and Frankenstein's monster that the producer would dictate to the screenwriter to appear in a scene. They had a chance with HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN when they bitten a second cookie, they blew it again with HOUSE OF Dracula. Losing one chance is an accident, losing two obstacles to cynical money. <br /> <br /> Obviously the producers don't care anymore. Larry Talbot resumes, even though he died in the previous film, summarizing the franchise's cynicism. It also shows what a poor script is and we are being abused by some terrible plots, as Talbot's condition is cured by a special kind of plant that will soften its skull. I think writer Edward T Lowe made his skull softer if it was the kind of thing he got. <br /> <br /> Director Erie C Kenton can't improve on the script and throw in some of his own keys. For example, Talbot is shocked to see Dr. Edelmann picked up an elevator on a wagon, but echelant saw Edelmann climbing a wall and jumping into the castle. One cannot help thinking that Talbot's reaction shots were flawed in the editing stage. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney Jnr is known for his roles in horror movies, but didn't have much of a career outside of them. Maybe it's not the fact that he's not a good actor and here he does the worst kind of acting - lots of wood. However, this is not entirely his fault, because all the characters rather spit a terrible dialogue and are all fairly woody, mainly because of Kenton's dull direction. <br /> <br /> HOUSE OF Dracula felt a million miles away from James Whale's 1931 movie and his successor from 1935 and would have been a very sad note to end. But ironically, Universal decides to make another movie to raise their franchise with a horror comedy with Abbot and Costello.
