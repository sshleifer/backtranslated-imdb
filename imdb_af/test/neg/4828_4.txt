I watched this film thirty years ago and it has so far held my mind. When I got it on DVD, I didn't hesitate too long, because I love early Belmondo's movie. But what a bad surprise! Some movies should be allowed to resign from public exposure, to preserve some memory, and not to shock audiences. <br /> <br /> Welcomed as one of Chabrol's rare cynical works, the only lasting impression I got was watching it be boring. Some movies don't really work in style. But how about movies that didn't feel at all? <br /> <br /> The mistakes in the script, uninspiring - presumably due to the lack of direction - a kind of production design that doesn't. It doesn't earn its name, less than mediocre photography, and finally the worst editing work. what I've already seen makes this one really hard to stand. <br /> <br /> My impression was that there were a lot of people with too much money and equipment, but of course, no idea or skills. It's really a surprise that this one did not suddenly end Chabrol's career. Don't blame it for the overall bad taste of the 70's, this one is in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless waste of celluloid ever.
