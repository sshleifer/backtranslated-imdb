It's a very foolish work of miscasting - about as bad as Hepburn plays a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. Playing the lead Hepburn is a combination of Beverly Hillbillies grandmother and a faith healer! This movie is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart didn't play a mountain car - he was just surrounded by them. And the dialogue sounds like it comes from a Li'l Abner strip! However, the problems do not really end with the outrageous casting, as the plot is completely astonished and the "love story" can hurt your head. For no reason WHAT ALSO, Robert Young married fall for this Ozark bobcat. Was it her beautiful personality that won his heart? I doubt it, as she, as the fiery "spitfire", was named the movie, and she really felt like a victim and a scrappin 'and hollerin'! Was it her female charm? With no makeup and fashions that seem to be designed by Ma Kettle, I doubt if that was the case either. In the end, somehow, Ralph Bellamy fell for her, but again it doesn't really seem like that. <br /> <br /> So, here we have two city rangers. for an unashamed bastard by Mrs. Hepburn is played - now it's a recipe for a good movie!
