The IMDB plot summary makes it unlikely to sound like Noah Taylor's movie, when Fairuza Balk is the central character. It's amazing how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateur, pointless, non-movie. Balk breaks with Boyfriend Taylor, sleeps with the devil (I think - played by Dempsey), and Taylor accidentally dies - who follows her for the rest of the movie as a ghost. May be the worst movie I've ever seen.
