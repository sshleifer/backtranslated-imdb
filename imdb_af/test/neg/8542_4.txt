Jess Franco makes exploitation movies, and he made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking movies in cinema history, and God blesses him for that. Unfortunately, The Diamonds or Kilominjaro is a truly horrible movie that does not meet its standard standards. <br /> <br /> Exploitation movies should be judged on story, sex and gore. What else is there? This movie fails on most of these criteria. The plot is paper thin and puts a handsome young girl in the jungle among cannibals. We really can't find out why she and her father were in the first place. As expected, her father is the "Big White Chief" and she becomes a goddess, sitting in trees, naked. Add fortune hunters and precious stones, and you have your basic rescue plot for prying reasons. The characters are stocked and do not add a gram of credibility to the proceedings. <br /> <br /> Gore? None, or at least very little. This film is often mentioned in the same action as the classic Italian cannibal movies. Those looking for that kind of gore should run the other way around. Save for one cheap heading, this movie has surprisingly little blood and gut. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say is the only reason this movie exists is that Katja Bienert, Aliene Mess and Mari Carmen Neieto can run around naked. Actually, "Lita" (Mari Carmen Neieto) does the full forward heavy lifting, while the two jungle ladies become bare bald. Yes, there are love scenes. Probably the most sterile Franco ever had under supervision. The women are beautiful, but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a series of low budget buffooning. The sets are laughing. The acting is terrible, and the editing is confusing. There is no real story to keep it together, and not enough of a budget (or attempt) to shock or titillate. I think Franco fans expected more from the master of exploitation.
