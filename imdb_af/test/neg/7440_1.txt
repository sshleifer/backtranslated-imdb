It's a pity they didn't trust the original to build on it. <br /> <br /> But "RoboCop 2" takes the great ideas, imagination and characters of the original and replaces it with all the stereotypes that persecutors offer. <br /> <br /> The initial commercial was cute and so was the scene that followed (reminiscent of "Guys and Dolls"!). Except for a flash of thoughts here and there, it's one movie that is slow, dirty in the middle of nowhere. br /> <br /> Ideas are introduced and dropped, interesting characters from the original get screen time here, most of the new characters (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring they won't like whatever the movie, and then there is the tone. <br /> <br /> In the Holy Original Paul Verhoeven knew how to arrange with that kind of attitude. If you have the attitude and sensitivity of a good pulp comic, even the most repulsive violence will be entertaining. Kershner (although he ordered a "Star Wars" order). And scene after stage also makes you shit, look away or put it out completely. <br /> <br /> And what's with RoboCop? HE must be the most important thing, right? But there are screens where he doesn't even show up, and what plays he is so half-minded and shocked that you don't know if he's part-man or part-cyborg - since he's boring. <br /> <br /> I never saw such a rapid fall out of grace. Why does Hollywood make such bad successors? On purpose? Why; did the filmmakers make a bet? <br /> <br /> Only one star for "RoboCop 2"; the FX is good, but the story doesn't even try to fit them.
