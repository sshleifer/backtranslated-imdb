For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film - and especially of horror cinema. The reviews I've written so far are for movies that I love, respect, and admire, and I eagerly attributed them to awards and perfect ten ratings. A lifelong horror moviewoman, it is a great pleasure for me to share with others my thoughts and ideas about big horror movies and hopefully have a hand to expose people to movies they can't otherwise find. . I only recently started reviewing movies for the IMDB and it was my first intention to focus only on my own personal favorites and explore what I believe and endure for the horror genre. However, the existence of films such as "Graduation Day" is without a pun, a thorn in my side. Completely uncovered by any merit whatsoever, this 1981 hodgepodge of uninformed ideas is amateurishly directed, poorly acted, and in every way an unmasked embarrassment for horror theater. During the short few years before and after the movie's release, we have the appearance of domestic (and Canadian) films such as "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Terror Train", "Madman", "My Bloody Valentine," "The Prowler," "Just Before Dawn," "Final Exam," and "Hell Night", among others. These films, although of varying degrees of quality, have strived to achieve something in terms of story line, plot, acting, direction and overall tone. Not every movie released during the abundant season of the Slasher Era will be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th", but these films are all well made and clearly contributed to the continued development of horror movie. "Graduation Day", a deadly prisoner of a masked killer-speaking member of a high school track team, was directed by Herb Freed. The one who just hopes will never again try to defile the horror genre with such a tribulation. The task of creating the valuable horror movies is best for those who have a true love and respect for the genre. This movie fails at every possible level miserably. Not least are terrifying wood performances, dime-store special effects, an annoying musical score, and above all a story that lacks even the slightest tension or tension. A relentless exercise in how to waste film, "Graduation Day" is a great shame for horror theater.
