The most generic, surface-level biography you can hope for. Busey's imitation of Holly is accurate - but who wants to sing Gary Busey, "Maybe Baby"? Typically, the Hollies members are used for comic enlightenment and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively) instead of as humans or even characters. When Holly uses a string section, the old Jewish guys who come in tell him that he uses the same techniques as Mozart. It's just a fiery statement that makes cinema biographies like this (and "Amadeus", about the aforementioned Mozart) so worthless. Some entertainment can be derived from Holly's excellent styles and songs made in a B variation.
