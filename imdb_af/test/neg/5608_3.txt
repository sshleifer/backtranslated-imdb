Simply put, these movies are without any substance whatsoever. Just take my word for it and save yourself the time it is a complete DUD! I would say the characters are one dimensional, but that would mean there was some kind of character development. I thought Eric Roberts would jump a second, it was so close to B-Movie status. <br /> <br /> The girl from the 70's is beautiful ... but unless you're a stalker-type fan of her, this movie has nothing for anyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid..Ovoid ... Avoid <br /> <br /> This movie was straight to DVD for a reason ... that's ... it's a train wreck !!!
