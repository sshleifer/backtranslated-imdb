Release the fourth scene (the one National Lampoon has its name OFF or) looks like a comedy classic. A complete mistake and a sad effort to capitalize on a one-time proud franchise. Painfully unfunny and unwatchable ... even for a TV movie! The Cousin Eddie character gradually became less amusing, from the original holiday when it was fresh and unique, through Christmas holidays when it was thin, to Vegas Vacation where it was actually annoying to come on the screen, in fairness there a lot of things that were annoying to see on the screen in the movie!). But this attempt to move the character to lead the status is unfortunate to say the least. The holiday films themselves met an ugly death in Las Vegas, and this hope of reviving, even the thinnest thread of the series for television, was thoroughly misleading. Chevy Chase and his company brought back a great trilogy when he was in his head; Let's just pull the plug and leave the title in peace. (One small interest: The original Audrey Griswold - Dana Barron, the first of four actresses to play the role, including Juliette Lewis - returns 20 years later! The one is just to wonder ... WHY?)
