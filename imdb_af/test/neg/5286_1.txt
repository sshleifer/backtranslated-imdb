This movie is by far one of the worst B movies I have ever seen. There are no plots at all. Although the play is decent, the storyline is terrible. There are also many mistakes in the movie, and it was difficult to watch. For any of you who like horror movies, slasher movies, or even B movies, I don't recommend it to anyone at all. Most of the movie is focussed on senseless killing, in ways that aren't even worth discussing. This movie can very well be compared to a crappy remake by Jeepers Creepers, who was not so good at a movie either. For anyone who wants to spend a day at home, watch bad movies, this one takes the cake.
