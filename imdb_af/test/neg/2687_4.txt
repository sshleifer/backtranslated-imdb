I'm new to Argento's work, and if that and Suspiria are any indication, Argento is far more a film maker of experience and story. In his films, characters are placed in disturbing and stunning horror contexts that completely saturate the logic of the world around them. The camera literally flows gracefully through sets while the characters run, stumble, and push their way to an ultimate horrible conclusion. It worked, VERY well, in Suspiria. For some reason it didn't work here. <br /> <br /> The problem I see with this movie is that although the protagonist is getting "help" from the police and asking for help from her friends. still feels as if she refuses to get help in terms of a solution to her problem. The arrest in this movie is that she is trapped in the killer's little game, one of which she could easily get by ... not so easy to set up? In a strange way it seems that the character wants the torture, which the murderer gives her, which is in some way the point and can work, except that the whole psychology is mostly thrown because of whatever Argento feels . <Br /> <br /> As a loving tribute to "The Phantom of the Opera", it is definitely an interesting and unique task. For all its value, Argento also enjoys operational movements, which highlight the action very well. It just doesn't make much sense, especially as it ends in a completely useless end (yes, I know it's a reference to Harris's novel "Red Dragon". No, it didn't work). Why the character should go from one terrible experience to a willing one with the director is beyond me. It felt almost confident about Argento's part. <br /> <br /> Overall, a fun experience, and between this and Suspiria, I'm more than willing to follow up on more Argento productions. But it's not a movie I want to return or remember. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
