Let's look at it, a really horrible movie, no ... I mean a "real" horrible movie, is a weird, strange and beautiful thing to see. I acknowledge that there is a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 from outer space, half the cupboards, species, etc. And although I give this movie 1, I request everyone who enjoys a bad movie for what it is. It really is a nice movie to have a friend, goodies, something to drink, and the special occasion it deserves: Aussie Park Boyz. <br /> <br /> From the very first moments of the main actor's side-by-side role performance as he attempts to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera (a cut ham straight out of silent photos Say your heart out of Rudolph Valentino) to the sudden hey-we are out-of-the-film conclusion, you ... will ... not ... stop ... laugh. <br /> <br /> To summarize the movie, it's a poor man's Warriors under, completed - and that description alone must be enough, but then the wonders of the "spaghetti set scene", the " We They got their tickets, they are not going to leave town now, "scene", "It's the Asians! Run! "And more. The only real offensive part is a free-filmed rape. Besides, I dare you to watch this movie. And I dare to find evidence of acting, or lines, or direction, or any of those others boring and superfluous elements that so-called critics say that a movie should be judged as good. <br /> <br /> If this movie does not fit the uncontrollable laugh before it ends, all I can do is threaten my eyes from side to side to you and shout: "You dog! You dog! You dog! "
