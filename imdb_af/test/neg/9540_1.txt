Move over Manos. Back from Boogens. It doesn't take a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of these toms) will always be (unless someone is a sequel to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst movie ever made. The only horror in this thing is watching it. I wonder if it was an effort for someone to meet babies by throwing a movie. If so, the babies are not babies, just like this is not a movie. It's drunk. No wait. I dishonor the word drunk by calling it drink. Ulli Lommel (from Boogey Man celebrity) calls it "uber drunk" or Schei√üe. It must be used to torture prisoners. If you find it on a shelf in a video store, you should quietly come back and notify the authorities.
