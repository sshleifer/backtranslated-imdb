After Matt Dillon's phenomenal performance in CRASH, most are likely to be in a hurry to get a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is real or just get a happy rebound from a big book. <br /> <br /> Well, Factotum definitely has its moments, but the simplicity of ... everything will probably turn viewers off. But nothing should be taken from Dillon. His performance is wonderful and full of lethal humor, proving that he is a solid actor with significant chops; It's just a shame about directing and writing. <br /> <br /> The story is about Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to meet everything that looks normal. He stops or comes from work in mere minutes, just to find himself in an urgent bar that even meets drainage women while trying to write a non-conformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about, except that it means everything (cancer, movies, you, me). Jump from workplace to workplace and constantly return to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a loving girlfriend who is as busy as herself, trying to discover Hank in vain to keep his life for him. Whether he ever learns what it is, is for interpretation. Some may say he never does, while others may argue that his life is just a path to obscurity. <br /> <br /> However, Factotum doesn't matter much, even with Matt Dillon's good performance. The story winds through Hank's life without much audience-mindedness. And that's a shame. Dillon's performance would even have sharpened if he had given a decent script.
