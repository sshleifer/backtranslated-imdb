Having seen Carlo Lizzani's documentary on Luchino Visconti, I was bound by higher expectations before I watched this movie three years later by Adam Low. But the viewer like me became dissatisfied. I got a need for critical opinion, which I generally don't like to give, because there are no documentaries that every viewer will satisfy. There are also no documentaries that will investigate a theme completely. But when I read the reviews already written on this title, I also felt a bit confused. People sometimes do not know what to criticize. To make this clear, I split this movie into two major parts that are significantly different: the former Visconti one before his director's career and the last one about Visconti's director. <br /> <br /> The aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that young Luchino experiences and enjoys is clearly presented. His attempt at horse racing is called, as well as his relationship with his mother, so disturbed by his parents' divorce. We also get a very accurate idea of ​​where Luchino was educated as a true count of Milan: in wealth in general, with childrens children, cooking with access to everything, in true architecture. For example, his father's beautiful villa in Grazzano and other wonderful villas prove it. Emphasis is also placed on Visconti's critical visit in Paris in the 1930s where he met leading people ("left wingers") who later had his influence on his style and message in art. This clearly explains the idea of ​​a communist with the aristocratic education (a contrast at the first sight). <br /> <br /> The part about his director's career, which began with OSSESSIONE during World War II and ends with INNOCENTE just before the director's death in 1976, was poorly executed. His movies are not well discussed. Why? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. Franco Zeffirelli, the director, remembers the works on LA TERRA TREMA and that's right. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. But later such films as IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig, I didn't interview her. In addition, some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to be in such a documentary. There is no mention of significant works by Visconti such as CONVERSATION PIECE. There are no interviews with the prominent Cast Burt Lancaster. There should also be mention of Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider. There is one interview interview with Maria Callas which seems to be interesting, but it is only a short while. Franco Zeffirelli, although I appreciate him as a director, makes it fun rather than saying something really precious. For example, he called the event how Visconti separated from him after years of service. That is why I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> What I find strong here is interviewing Visconti herself. As a result, we can get his own opinion on his works. For example, I appreciate the words he says about death as a normal chapter of life and as natural as the birth itself. He also discusses his health problems after the stroke during the filming of LUDWIG. <br /> <br /> I think it's better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) by Carlo Lizzani as this document. Although it is shorter and condensed, you will get a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti would be furious about this and the anger of his people mostly turned people's emotions and views into stone ... 4/10
