There is an increasing trend in the media to deceive and mock men. One sees this in television advertising and program plotting. Cheaters are an excellent example, they can find many female cheaters, but the vast majority are men, why? The primary threat to any government's power resides in the male population, they are less likely to hold authority and are more of a physical battle threat. A way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas, full of self-righteous policemen, including grim-aggressive women who all accuse them of trampling their rights and making their men feel like foam. In Australia, many top male sports stars have recently been arrested for questionable assaults and drinking costs, another example of government that controls the male population and arrests their heroes and claims domination. Cheaters, apart from political worries, are an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights, and most of these women are attacking the men! If it were the other way around, the men would be in jail !! If it were a fair show, they would find women cheating because they are not normally caught because their male lovers are very fortunate not to hold on and do not stick without swinging the boat. Men 's mistress is looking for the men and wants to own and control the men, catching the men.
