So many fans, so little to show. I know, I know, these words will find me in a big minority. Many people really liked Good Will Hunting. But seriously, please, make wonderful film, not even close, and let us blame it where it belongs ... in writing. Now I know they won an oscar for that and son did them. looks good emotionally on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with a lot of curse in it, and a slightly bigger budget. <br /> <br /> What this movie shows is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein can go wrong, give it to you, and you eat your eating beans. And that's exactly what the studio did with the movie. They created such a high false buzz, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much - that they saw brilliance where nobody was. <br /> <br /> Now I know some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a very bad movie, I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also made for some big ones Made for TV movies (although not HBO movies, HBO movies are exceptionally better than Good Will Hunt will ever be.) It's just a nice, small movie, with some good shows, Robin Williams was not good at it, they just gave him the Oscar because it was a while to do it. And of course, the Miramax public relations machine Ben and Matt secured their writer Oscar ... but one person comes ... there are better movies out there, what's GWH.
