Rich to poor. Big city vs small village. White collar versus blue collar. These things are not original themes in movies. So when one prefers these themes, the situational story line has been better original, or very good. This one was not either. I never believed in the romance of the two young lovers in this movie. Not convincing or compelling, it just fell flat. Don't bother even with a video rental.
