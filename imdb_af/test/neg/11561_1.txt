Robo Holocaust is about the miserable, most pathetic attempt to make a post-apocalyptic film I saw. And I thought Italians were the masters of miserable Mad Max wannabes. Some of the movies like Escape 2000 are positively brilliant compared to this piece of poo. The plot is stupid ?? even with a narrator setting up every scene. And the boy dragged it. Scene to scene with nothing of interest. The special effects (and I use the word "special" loosely) consist of socks. Yes, that's right? sokkiespoppe! The acting is uncomfortable. Angelika Jager is in the running for the worst show I've ever seen. Sure, she's French or German or whatever? but the man is bad. I can't think of a single positive thing about the movie. So I'll stop there because ten sentences on this litter are about ten too many. <br /> <br /> But, fortunately for me, I saw the MST3K version of Robot Holocaust. Some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this MST3K episode a winner. For a season one episode, the riffs come fast and furious and touch their point just about every time. On my MST3K rating scale, do I give this episode a 4/5 ?? looking for it.
