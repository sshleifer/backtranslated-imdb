I'm a big fan of "Tannie Mame" with Rosalind Russell. She was really the perfect actress to play that character. <br /> <br /> I heard Angela Lansbury was very good on stage in "Mame", but it's hard to imagine anyone, Rosalind Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was such a good comedian that her comic pieces saved her performance in this movie, where I think she was disliked. Really, they had called her singing voices - the trial of these songs sang at a faster pace and with strong voices changed the whole effect. <br /> <br /> I only saw the increase revival in Washington DC and I think Christine Baranski was very good as Mame, Harriet Harris - the nasty chain smoking agent at Frasier - played Vera and she was especially good. <br /> <br /> Both will be good for a TV movie of this show. Perhaps if the production makes it to Broadway, they will consider filming it. <br /> <br /> I also think Tracy Ullman will be good as Agnes.
