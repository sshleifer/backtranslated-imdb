Cult buyers are undoubtedly familiar with the term "video nasties". It was a notorious British list that contained all the films that could harm society when viewed through irresponsible audiences (dramatization). For gore buffs, this is an excellent checklist, as it contains inhumane cruel and disturbingly realistic films (Death of Death, Cannibal Holocaust, Driller Killer), as well as excessive and ultra sick horror movies (The Burning, Nightmare City, The Toolbox Murders ). To keep this in mind, it is quite unusual to see the night of bloody monkeys appearing "nastically" among others. It is a pity, but blood and violence were so poorly presented. I can't imagine anyone being offended by it. And the crazy plot (about a desperate doctor displacing a gorilla's heart in the chest of his dying son) is not exactly what you would really mention. All that remains is a rather surprising pulp-horror movie with terrible acting and useless sleaze. The male-monkey makeup effects are laughable and there is no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere. Just enjoy if you're in the right mood, in other words. The few rows showing detailed games of women's wrestling (which is one of the leading roles of life) is very cool.
