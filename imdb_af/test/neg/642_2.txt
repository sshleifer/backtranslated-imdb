Alien Express is one of the worst movies I've had the trouble of experiencing. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. The strangers look like rubber sockets. The consequences would have been mediocre in the 70's, but are just horrific according to today's standards. Couldn't they take a real train instead of using an obvious model? <br /> <br /> The acting is not good, but really, the dialogue is the worst. It flushes its way into your mind. "Don't die on me. Not now. " If you can ever suspend unbelief that is long enough to be absorbed into the movie, you will quickly be returned by the strangers, the model train or the clich√©d dialogue. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give this movie a "1", but it does not deserve so badly that some weak suckers might see it for the pleasure inherent in a really bad movie no.
