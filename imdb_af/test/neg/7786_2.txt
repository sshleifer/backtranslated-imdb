When a murderer of the BBC is, it is common with heterosexual dysfunction, you know who the murderer should be: The Homosexual. <br /> <br /> Who killed the sexy blonde teen (who is also a pathological liar) on the way home from school? Let's see, could it be the mother who made her teenager's son leave (unmotivated) visits to his serious boy behind bars? Could it be the moody boy, who's impressed with his dad's feelings about women? Can it be the serial killer, who can manipulate the events behind bars, a la Hannibal Lecter? Could it be Mom's boyfriend, a teacher at the school whose relationship with a former student led to his wife's suicide? Or can it be a boyfriend's daughter, leaving everyone's secrets on school, causing incessant misery? No, it's not one of those likely suspects. This is ... The Gay! <br /> <br /> The only secret to the viewer is who the gay is. Of course, this can be anyone, as the only features of homosexual disgrace are secrecy and a tendency to murder and otherwise complicate life for "normal" people. The homosexual is the invisible cause of the disease of society; Only when this person can be exposed and eliminated can the broken family return, and things can usually come back. Whatever it is. <br /> <br /> As far as the cast is concerned, both Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially beyond their sales dates. The world can get amazing without ever seeing the screen again, but as long as the BBC has roles for The Aggrieved Woman and The Misunderstood Man, I think they will still come back in movies like this.
