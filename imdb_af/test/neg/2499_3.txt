D'Amato's hardcore / horror hybrids do not really live up to its extraordinary title and intriguing point of departure, in which several vampire contemporary types are attacked by an Atoll formerly used for nuclear tests, but mostly the film is so slow the action so furious and the throw is so frightened to have sex with each other, that the film becomes a choir to watch. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because the movie puts a promising idea. . A group of scientists are being taken in a small vessel to the Atoll by a naval officer. The scientists ?? three women and two men ?? is an intriguing cross-section of sexual types, suffering from nymphomania, co-dependency and frigidity in various degrees; There is even an intrigue in the world of female sex tourism, where one of the women at a brothel stops renting through two honky Caribbean studs. The creature itself? a broken native islander with a frightening face and an unspeakable long pizzle? Carries some affinities with the old creation from the Black Lagoon and is the kind of core nightmare that has waved over the postmodern man since the cold war, despite those of us in the West who have returned to hedonism and relativistic science. <br /> Porn Holocaust is definitely a movie showing the post-sexual revolution. Westerners come across their mirror image in a nuclear sample, but the folly with which it unfolds really leaves the brightness of the idea. There is a promising interaction of action shots with POV shots, suggesting that the sample (which looks like horror samples of their POV position is likely to do) is related to the voyeur in the audience on the sex between the ". nice people. " The face of the monster, forcing a beautiful young woman to suck his bulk, definitely throws the target audience's ugly fantasies in their face. But D'Amato has developed similar ideas better in other films, and Porno Holocaust is a potentially passionate idea that is being dropped (even with D'Amato's ordinary cinematographic skills leaving him with very urgent camera work).
