This movie is not one of those movies so bad, you get annoyed and angry because it looks like it's his own ass and yet it's not quite funny. It's just that there's nothing of interest in this movie. There are no real jokes to entertain you, just look for 80 minutes and then turn it off. I bought it on a very affordable DVD and I'm happy because it's not worth much. It's not even one of those movies that is so bad, you can see it with friends when you get drunk / high and a good giggle. I didn't hate it as if I hate movies, but it's rather boring, and it's not worth investing. <br /> <br /> The only people who had 10 votes on the vote for this movie had to be linked. somehow because I can't imagine anyone who actually likes this picture except little children
