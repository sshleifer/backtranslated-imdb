It was the second MST3K'd movie I've ever seen, and still holds a place in my heart, as it's one of the scariest scary movie experiences you'll ever have. <br /> <br /> In this, Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is using his tool to sign another payment on the mortgage on his property. He is stiff, wood and unconvincing, but he is still left as a cool, nice man and at least he is photogenic. This is the only decent thing I can find about the movie, so I thought I'd get it straight ahead. The fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves it as a "1 out of 10". <br /> <br /> In no particular order are examples of how poor it is composed: <br /> <br /> 1) OK, the Tanya Roberts clone (Mila) events to the "end of the earth "To find Ator, who takes 3 minutes of screen time, including the time she spent to die, to die from a poisoned arrow in her shoulder (which meant to me a little slow). So Ator healed her and took his trusty help, Thong, and returned to her castle ... and continued to take the next 50+ minutes of the movie restoring the land that Mila had put in 3 minutes. How does it work ??? I know the fearless crew by magical powers and enemies etc. On the way back but still ... harassed! <br /> <br /> 2) The writer / director apparently had the need to add 'depth'. to the film by adding a running debate / Socratic dialogue / game of 20 questions between Zor (the average John Saxon wannabe) and the wise man Akronas (the Richard Harris wannabe). But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training of Hallmark cards, T-shirts and bumper stickers, and he doesn't understand pace, pacing or timing ... nor the actors. (Crow's comment during one of these exchanges is the code for my entry). The screens with these two drag on and off, screaming the movie and stopping any momentum or excitement generated by the sword battle and the quest for the heroic trio. <br /> <br /> 3) Once Ator at The Castle (and is captured), things go even further downhill. Zor decides to feed a lot of women victims, along with Ator and Mila, to the snake God he holds in his cellar. This scene has the potential for excitement, so the director instantly kills this potential by settling the scene with all the drama of people waiting at the DMV to pay their traffic fines. Ator continues with a huge battle with the snake which is almost more convincing than Bela Lugosi's struggle with the rubber octopus in Bride Of The Monster. <br /> <br /> 4) The climactic scene in which Ator views the hang glider from twigs and animal skins is so exaggerated that it blows the viewer completely out of the movie and rolls you on the floor, laugh until your sides hurt. <br /> <br /> 5) Oh, and the filmmakers have decided to close inventory of an atomic explosion at the end, with the moral that Ator decided to destroy the 'nuclear nucleus' McGuffin that manages the movie because humanity was not ready. ("Zzzzip! MESSAGE COMING IN !!!"). Like 'Bride Of the Monster', you have to think about it again. All it needed was a bystander to see, "They've been diagnosed in God's domain." <br /> <br /> 6) For some reason, the release of the movie features introduced and includes gay erotic credit lines that are absolutely nothing to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. I have no idea where these footage came from, but it's actually WORSE as the real movie that it books. <br /> <br /> Just watch it if you're a big fan of Miles, or enjoy the way MST3K splashes material.
