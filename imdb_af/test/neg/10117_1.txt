It is truly one of the most horrible movies of all time. It is dull, ponderous, poorly acted, and teeth crawling pretentious. <br /> <br /> I watched for about an hour and waited for some kind of drama to unfold before I realized there wasn't any. The shot on a shoe liner budget was particularly painful. It must be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine's Outer Space. <br /> <br /> The only scarce redeeming feature is the ridiculous 'devils' that wander a plastic cat basket around the countryside. How scary is this? And I thought they might be used as extras, I think they are the least cheap. Although it seemed a little obvious that they were seduced by the careful placement of a tuna in the camera. <br /> <br /> This movie is so scary that it should have a public health warning. There was a queue at my local video store when I took it back, from people returning their money. I don't kid you!
