This movie is about 3 stories composed around 3 separate individuals. One of the worst movies available and even better if it's not available. <br /> <br /> The Good: 2 beautiful lesbian actress 1 true and pleasant story about Theresa Chan <br /> <br /> The bad: The main story that revolves around the blind and dear wife Theresa Chan a movie format and more fitting in a documentary format. No connection between the 3 story lines. Minimum DIALOG in the movie, replaced by text messages and CHAT programs on the computer. No cultural insight through the movie and it lets you forget even before you step out of the theater.
