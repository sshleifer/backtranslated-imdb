This movie is proof that you can't just go to a Redbox and read descriptions of movies and choose one and try. <br /> <br /> While giving a big credit for producing a movie with half-way special effects on such a low budget, at least a half-way decent script and story line. Unfortunately, it was just like this: halfway decent. <br /> <br /> If you like movies where things come from It's all neatly wrapped, and don't mind low budget effects, you might like this movie. Honestly it wasn't really my cup of tea. I just had to go to bed, rather than look at my time. <br /> <br /> For a better science fiction movie produced on a lower budget (!), see 'Primer.'
