The movie is very fast, bizarre and colorful. It's like Mad Max on speed that tons of color and makeup. Also many Cartoonish, as it has said; cartoon sequence appears here and there. The plot is also very bad, but I believe it's meant to be. The thing that really scares me in this movie is the characters, they are painfully annoying, especially Rebecca played by Lori Petty. She's really annoying (I think she's the most annoying creature I've ever seen). The editing is also annoying, many MTV styled. Another thing missing from Tank Girl is an exciting adventure. The humor is also not very funny. It does have some nice visuals though. <br /> <br /> But many people love this movie, most of them are women, and it's not strange, because this movie is all about the girl's power. Tank Girl this is a real chick spot, and the best example of a hate / love movie.
