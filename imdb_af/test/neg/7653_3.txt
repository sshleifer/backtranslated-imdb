I watched this movie last night with a lot of friends at a Halloween party. I had to say that the sarcastic remarks never ended and I have to say they did deserve. Although I feel that the direction is well done, the insanity in their dialogue is just too much cheese. I think I came in about an hour before I first realized what it was like to drive home. You get a little quick catch that this whole family is beautiful, and something is about them, it's just a little too slow. This movie could have been about 45 minutes and was much better. The only thing that made it tolerable was the two bottles of wine I put down in the course of the movie. Bring the slasher movies to people because at least I know what to expect from them. It was not my thing, too much dark humor, and the subject matter of cannibalism was a bit explicit and rough. I have to say that Randy Quaid has played so well and it could have been, and I will also give him props as I normally see him as a drunk goofball or a runaway fighter who wants to kill strangers. <Br /> <br /> Finally, I give this horror / comedy movie a very generous 3 out of 10.
