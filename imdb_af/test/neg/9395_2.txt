This movie was thoroughly unhealthy, restless and unsatisfactory. Apart from some nice shots from Italy, there is nothing to recommend this movie. As usual, Hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a broken existence - the _next_ guy you meet with whom you sleep, after knowing for a few hours that he was Must be right. As far as humor is concerned, there are a few in the movie, but I can't see how anyone can call it a romantic _comedy_, as about three quarters of the movie is totally depressed! My recommendation? Skip it to the theaters, wait until it comes to DVD, then skip it. I want someone to give me the two hours I wasted.
