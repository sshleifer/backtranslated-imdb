The video case for this movie read "A story of beauty, passion and forbidden fruit". Talk about the same movie I just saw?! They can't be because the movie I just saw was beautiful, but there was no passion and for the fruit, that's all the intention to seduce the potential viewer to see this movie. If it had just a passion or a little life, I would have enjoyed this movie very much. Instead, it was a painful, slow pace and not a very interesting movie that I definitely didn't want to see again. It's not that it's a bad movie (it is very beautifully filmed), but it is dull outside of faith. I kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen, but then the movie just ended. There was no great sense of excitement, mystery or anything - just a rather unconscious story about a young girl serving as a girl and spending the next 10 years of her life as a girl.
