If everyone is 29, Rob Lowe is a detective in charge of a murder investigation. <br /> <br /> When the husband of a social woman (Leslie Hope) is found dead, police suspect the rich chick may have something to do with it. Tap Rob who immediately falls for the beautiful widow, although he claims to be "useful". Rob is such a good policeman, he can sink some of her incriminating love letters into his coat before accidentally throwing them into the fireplace. Monotonous dark drama with endless drone background music. <br /> <br /> It is a good substitute for sominex spouts.
