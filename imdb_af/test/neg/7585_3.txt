I picked this DVD from the cheepo bin at Walmart because the lid showed one of the planes I flew during Viet Nam (C-123k). I didn't fly for Air America, but knew he was a C-123 pilot. I knew a lot about who did this, including those who flew into my Reserve Unit at home. I'm not a film critic, but wonder about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers making movies like this. The best part of this movie should go to the cameraman. The flying shots and stunts (though completely cartoon) are excellent. The movie starts with Hollywood's favorite valman in 1969. But the fact is, Nixon didn't start Air America, he didn't start the lie. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon inherited the lies, the war and Air America. It's not fair or accurate to portray Nixon as a liar on the subject of Air America. All presidents inherited the lies of their predecessors. No one who was smart enough to fly a C-123 was stupid enough not to know what they were gathering. This makes the Downey character incredible. A C-123 was a rough plane. It can easily fly on one engine or the two auxiliary devices. The three strokes that shoot a duck with one shot are more likely. Pilots flying with Air America were civil servants of the CIA, they were not reckless soldiers of luck. They had a good reason to act and believe in a future, if they survived their extremely dangerous work. They got double the time for a retirement pension. They didn't have to sell dope or guns to get a good pension. Dope was legal and a way of life in SEA, as it is still in Afghanistan today. If individual pilots were trying to make money, it wasn't the CIA policy. The CIA was a war against communism, not drugs. The author based his story on "war stories". Pilots love someone who buys and listens to them. The author and director who had an ax to grind over Viet Nam and Nixon. See the movie, and remember how it started - it blames Nixon for years. Remember, he did not become president until January 20, 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is lifting the hill in the jungle. Air America pilots put aircraft in places where aircraft designers never thought. They were very funny stories that could be shown. Instead, the Director chose to use the excess rubber scene to show how stupid the CIA was. This scene shows that the director and writer fell for a pilot beam and the joke is on them. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley Virginia.
