A Christmas is one of the only movies I've seen where I can almost say nothing just happens. I felt like I was watching a drug-dealing middle-class couple, walking around with a child, eating, smoking, talking (apology I swear) most of the movie. And I don't believe I miss the point. I think this movie was well-directed, well-acted (although the man's performance was quite timber) and the constant sense of impending punishment. But when the dust was cleared, you left zero (just a boat load of blur-outs). I didn't want car hunting, gun violence, addictions, etc. I'm sick of violence. But my goodness, let's get a little deeper in all these characters (let's get to know each of these corrupt officials a little better - not just a glance at them as street people). Why was the dialogue so youthful? Everyone spoke as if they were high in the junior. I even believe this side of our human race can be something other than fu_ _, sh_ _, etc. Say. The pacing and story of 'R Xmas I found very interesting, but the performance was simple and simple-blank.4 / 10
