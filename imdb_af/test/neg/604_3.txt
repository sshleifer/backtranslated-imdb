To sum it up in a nutshell, this movie was disappointing and could be shortened by twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was subordinate, the only decent actors of the Trisha cluster, the murderer and Molly. The music was slightly lame, but appropriate and the special effects were too much use. The story / script was poor, the unnecessary torture / romantic scenes were dragged too long and a disappointing ending. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie was pretty slow, the fake looks not very important. Trisha arrived home and there was a condition for a good story. <br /> <br /> Trisha received the threatening calls, which increased the tension. This instantaneous suspension began to build the best feature of the movie, but then the friends crashed the place and destroyed all the possible tension / horror in the movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the plot becomes blunt. Chemistry sparks between the two couples, and then the killer Frank and the other girl fall. This scene was dragged and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The killer makes her way to Trisha and binds her. There is an exaggerated torture that lasts for at least ten minutes. As the gore is done badly, it is not entertained at all, and it breaks more than shocks. <br /> <br /> In summary, the first thirty minutes of this movie sounds promising but then poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruin this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
