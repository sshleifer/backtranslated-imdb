During my childhood, I saw and enjoyed the first three "Critters" movies. They were fun and entertaining horror comedies perfect for adventurous, scary kids. I have never seen "Critters 4", so I finally decided to check it out. My pronunciation: forgetful and pretty bad movie with strikingly low body numbers. The screenplay by Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is both predictable and clich√©d, the plot ripens from "Alien" and "Star Wars" and the sets shine and dark. The tone of the film seems to be deadly serious by making it slow and juicy. "Critters 4" was apparently so low a budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects; those taken from Android seem seriously dated. from 10.One to avoid.
