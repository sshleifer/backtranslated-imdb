It's so poor, it's alert. <br /> <br /> The plot deals with a grizzled spacecraft crew that operates on a floating, seemingly deserted Russian vessel. <br /> <br /> In the empty space of space, the two vessels accidentally collide (!) - and "Alien" boxing comes out as a cyborg of the Russian ship disputing our crew. <br /> <br /> The spacecraft interiors are clearly a rolled-up factory set (metal paths, boilers, pipes). In this totally unconvincing environment, 'Kody', 'Snake' and the rest of our heroic agency, shallow, run around and run them repeatedly and repeatedly their shotguns without shooting them. <br /> <br /> The continuity gambling is what defines this movie, and they are nothing short of wonderful: <br /> <br /> Stuff appears and disappears. The shotguns are pulled. A siger is smoked longer by smoking. The shotguns are retracted just to make sure. The contents of a bottle rise by being drunk. <br /> <br /> The movie progresses through the usual clicks through intense hamsters, poxy camera works and Ed Wood quality props to a hanging climax.
