Sadness in every aspect, this poor excuse for a career boost for Connery was not that neither the hit Warners wanted it. Extended by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassment for everyone involved, this film and Robocop 2 prove that Irvin Kershner didn't really have control over "The Empire Strikes Back". Connery was not in a hit since he bowed from Bond from Bond in 1971, but it didn't bring him back. 'Octopussy' was released a few months before this film and easily spread it. Imagine that a Roger Moore Bond is not only better than a concurrent Connery release, but it sticks out (and compared to "Never ...", "Octopussy" is equal to "2001." <br / > <br /> The worst Bond-themed song, even worse than the man with the golden gun, useless scenes that relentlessly relentlessly (with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - who gives?!) and the most horrible collection of non-talent as far as the fianc√© "Bond Girls" goes. Is there anyone who seriously thinks Kim Basinger is attractive in this movie? There were girls in my high school who could never get better dates than she did in this movie And Barbara Carrera - Just as stupid, but the way Kershner managed to move around all the time did not help her, she is the seedling that would become the impressive "Onatop", the best feature of GoldenEye, "but it doesn't matter if you have trouble in this movie. <br /> <br /> About sting Searching there as a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-trap interaction Connery and he is supposed to have is very bad. Two plays have never come together like that - see the scene where they, to escape local authorities, strip them to their boxers and pretend that they are not exercising - I can't imagine another scene in any movie that has tried so hard to laugh so fruitlessly.
