My God, the things that are entertained for entertainment in this country ... <br /> <br /> It's * not * the "Tom and Jerry" you enjoyed on Saturdays, with an indifferent cat and a smart mouse. It's a very early animation series, with a few Mutt-and-Jeff clones that find themselves in different scraps that result in any of the then-typical dance-skeleton-type gags that built up so much early animation. /> <br /> This exceptionally dirty outing, which was apparently originally intended as a vehicle for some real black scene playmakers of the time, crashed the two in the ocean as they fly to Africa, requiring excessive makeup has, exaggerated "Negro" dialect and "Feets, fail me now" situations. <br /> <br /> It only shows that the American view of blacks in the 70 years between emancipation and this film is not progressing much. Then again, at least one of them apparently has a pilot's license.
