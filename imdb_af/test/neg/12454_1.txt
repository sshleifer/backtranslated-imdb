This movie was recently broadcast by Turner Classic Movies. It may have been considered racy in his time, and may have made money, but even the hardest Jane Russell fan will find it hard to go through this drink. <br /> <br /> There are many 1950's movie musicals that can withstand the test of time, though dated by current standards, but which can still be enjoyed due to good music or dance or entertaining plot. However, the French line fails all these aspects. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter that Russell is a good singer when she gets bad voice material. The whole scroll is dragged by a boring, proud plot and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth recording and just hitting the musical numbers - they are nice.
