Before we watched this movie (on a screen attended by the director himself), we were informed that the short film prize had won at the Galway Film Fleadh. Certainly, this result will hope for filmmakers, anyone can do better than that! <br /> <br /> How anyone can't see the remarkable rip-off of Donnie Darko in it, I'll never know. The film is pure bravery, the acting cardboard, the dialogue ridiculous and the end just flat! The only crumb of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this garbage was to comment too hard on how terrible it was before the director! Yes, it was mean, but liberating! <br /> <br /> At least Irish movies can't sink lower!
