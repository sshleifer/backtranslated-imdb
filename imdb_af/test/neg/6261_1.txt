Such a movie appreciates the work of professional actors. I think movie-goers are generally a bit too hard on professional actors and are ready to rest for minimal reasons. Just look for a few minutes of "Cheerlader Massacre," and trust me, you will change your views. A raid would almost compliment this non-talent actor. But then it's a Jim Wynorski movie again. Wynorski is a popular director of these ultra-low budget B films (with Roger Corman working on many occasions). The problem with this movie is that it actually tries to develop a plot. And if you offer actors lines as they read letters from an eye map, how should I give it? In Wynorski's "Bare Wench 2" he didn't try to develop a plot. He simply tried to push up a soft porn / goofy on the "Blair Witch Project." It was fun and it was titillating. "Cheerleader Masscare" is not nice. There are some compulsory female nude scenes, but they are few and far between. So it's not even worth enjoying on an erotic level. I must say, the worst scene is the one where Nikki Fritz walks over an overpassed bridge. First, her character doesn't have to walk over that bridge. Secondly, if the bridge starts to crack rather than trying to run its best, she just stands there and acts helplessly. And on top, we don't actually see the bridge crash, because the filmmakers made it for a $ 2 budget !!! Unlike many B-horror movies, this one is actually boring. And this makes it the worst of all bad movies. One of the few shiny spots was Lunk Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor in the film (though certainly not more than half-way decent). He was funny in "Bare Wench 2," and also has funny scenes in this movie.
