First let me start by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie. It is a pity that IMDb does not have tithes of a star ... I saw this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia, and that was absolute rubbish. The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The movie was completely boring. "Malachi" looks like the shadow with Alec Baldwin (The shadow is infinitely better than that too). The character Eva was so undeveloped and 2-dimensional that she didn't even grab my attention. I didn't even know her name was Eve. Don was interesting when he closed his mouth. The "TWIST" (if you could call it) was laughable and pathetic. When that happened, the movie did such a terrible job of building up tension or attachment to any character I simply thought, "Who gives a S ***." The only thing that made me even raise an eyebrow about this movie was the fact. teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (Also a film that was light years before this movie murder.) Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of 90 minutes of countless people's time. No wonder no actor of this movie ever had a fruitful career. In summary ... This movie is so bad, I feel dirty and needs a shower. The worst movie in history, Gigli was better, Prom Night (the remake) was better and I dare say so. Saw IV was better ...........
