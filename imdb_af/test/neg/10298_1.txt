I don't know what today's filmmakers are expecting, but watch 68-year-old movie. (Well, maybe I didn't watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so make it 58 years of movie). I expect to be entertained, not bored with tears, assaulted by constant profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are kept in mind for no other purpose, but to show that blood play and body parts are mutilated. Surveillance is one of those movies made by people who have no imagination, little or any talent, a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable feature to keep a scene long after the goal has ended. . That somebody would ever think it's a worthwhile movie, if it's nothing more than Hollywood rubbish outside of me. As a combat veteran, I've seen violence, blood and gore in many forms, and movies like We were soldiers are about as violent as a movie can get, but it has value. Monitoring should be dreamed by persons in a drug-induced stupor, without writing ability, no direct training, no experience in film editing, and a total lack of reality contact. Just a silly movie of two serial killers that make up FBI agents suggest a scenario to kill some turbulent mouth problems. A high price range that can just keep an idiot ...
