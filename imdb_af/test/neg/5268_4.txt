one of the worst excuses for an Irish accent I heard. of a really good actor. it is a bad Irish accent not to mention a dublin accent (which is completely different). The film is loosely based on the story of gangster Martin Cahill and it has done much better with Brendan's lunatic in the title role in THE ALGEMENEN
