Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is so common that it actually gets funny. The director has placed all the cliches that have ever harassed B-series movies. The stupid bimbo (nice stretch) is trapped by the bad people, the main criminal smears and reveals his plots before they happen, so they can be destroyed and who of course murdered the hero's father in an unclear past. side kick in the person of a policeman - small, naked and whose only preparation for the last battle (another clich√©) returns his baseball back. etc. <br /> <br /> The end point of the movie really falls. After the main villain dies when the hero Paralised Stoneface Jack or who throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high, they walk out of the building. From the outskirts, it looks just three stories high and much like your regular city hall. <br /> <br /> When they leave the building, the sidebar cannot walk, namely that its right leg wound occurs. How can no one know: ten minutes earlier he falls down in his shoulder and his feet are good. There is no further explanation for the curious mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as "Where is the villain's body that must lie near the building?" and "Why are there no police or even curious people meeting around the said body?" <br /> <br /> I could continue with the list forever. Why does one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts if he didn't kick his ass in no time? Why do bad guys generally make foolish movements when they attack? Why does the hero look so faggy? Is there anyone who really thinks "Yes, these characters and this plot make it a movie to remember"? And the actors suck. Our hero and savior of the day expresses the same expression on his face. The whole movie. It's disgusting, and trying to be a jolly sniff. It must be a copyright of him. <br /> <br /> Also, think so far, 12% of people who rated this movie have given it 10, fearing me. They might have been serious and then we are doomed.
