I say so. If you want to see art, go to an art gallery. If you want to see a movie, go to a theater. Trying to intertwine art and film, prove disastrous in "Where the heart is". An interesting throw is completely messed up in this embarrassment. You like Dabney Coleman, see "Short Time". You like Crispin Glover, see "Bartleby". You like Uma Thurman, see "Kill Bill". Above all, if you love Christopher Plummer, see "The Silent Partner" because his character here is a terrible embarrassment. In fact, this whole production is embarrassing. Certainly, the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes, so make a brief, but do not subject an audience to useless nonsense, mutilation as filmed entertainment. - NOTE
