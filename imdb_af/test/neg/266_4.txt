I enjoyed Oceans 11, I thought it was nice, helped by the gigs and the direction. However, I was disappointed with this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not a complete dud, thanks to the star performances of Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon and the effective direction of Steven Soderbergh. However, the movie is really slow, and the movie is so slow. I almost fell asleep between one key turn. Secondly, the plot is very complicated and there are many turns that make it difficult to keep up. The camera work was not as innovative as it was in the first movie. WHERE it was smooth and professional in the first movie, it was really awkward and uncomfortable here, and the music wasn't very memorable. The screenplay wasn't too greasy or fun, and the film felt anti-climate. At the end of the day, it all felt too lazy, despite the expert's play and direction. So much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
