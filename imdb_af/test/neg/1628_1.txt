The sequel that no one asked for the movie nobody wanted. Of course, there are too many mistakes with this movie to mention here, so I'll just concentrate on the acting. Miles O'Keefe would have been better suited to play the spritely Asian sidekick Thong, mainly because he would not have any dialogue. Lisa Foster delivers her lines that show one emotion, dull. Charles Borremel brings life to his side by interrupting every five words. And finally, the flamboyant, John Saxon-type guy ...... no comment needed. <br /> <br /> See "Conan the Barbarian" if you need it, but don't waste your time with this low-budget loser.
