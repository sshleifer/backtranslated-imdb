When a movie called Hell Ride comes, you expect a certain number of biker cliches. With character names like "Pistolero", "Comanche" and "The Gent" I turned myself into the worst and just faced it. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. Dusty desert fades away from the heat as bicycles break down the road while "CC Rider" plays and they talk about sex and violence. To yawn! The three leaders were just ridiculous and incredible. As old men like Bishop and Madsen (in a freaking ruffled shirt) drive a dusty strip of desert highway reminds me two men are desperately trying to relive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best, but with such poor material it was lost. Even an appearance of Dennis Hopper in full Easy Rider swing can't save it. And let's talk about the store being bought, will we? Many compared it to Tarantino's work. It's not even close. What makes Tarantino's work so brilliant is he knows it is on top, so he just goes out and takes it as far over the top as possible. Bishop has taken this film so seriously that it has become nothing more than a bad copy of the exploitation genre.
