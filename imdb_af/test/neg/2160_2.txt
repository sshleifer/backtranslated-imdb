Back in the cold and creepy early 90s, a show called Family Matters aired and became an instant classic. The trick was to buy a tutorial in standard family situations and their solutions, and attempts to add sarcastic remarks and you had yourself a beautiful little steal-wrong, parents-legal show. So it worked well, so Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: make exactly the same show. <br /> <br /> Here's the difference: "Family Matters" had Urkel. "Step by step" the man of that "Kickboxer" order has not seen anyone. He says things like "dudette" and "the dane master", and somehow the audience is not supposed to hate him. I mean seriously, "dudette"? How can you even get it over your lips? <br /> <br /> The rest of the people were mostly white versions of the entire Winslow forest, combined with some more one or zero dimensional characters, such as the stupid man (JT. Well, Eddie). smart girl (Laura), and a pretty girl who spends her days looks pretty (in theory). The character development was just terrible in this show. Grover and The Cookie Monster have more depth than the Lambert family. Everyone just milked their stereotypes for what they were worth. They were not worth much. <br /> <br /> Powered by a massive laugh-and-courageous tape stolen from something funny, this show has been broadcast for a massive 7 years. It was humiliating for the competition. Although you should note that it is time for family sitcoms to be almost all major hits, everyone just ignored their crappyness because it was good, it was the 90's, another crappy show didn't hurt.
