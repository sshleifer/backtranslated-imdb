Low budget, but still creepy enough to take your interest in another on the well-known Frankenstein story. This movie is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The in love Tania Frankenstein (Sara Bay) fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find out that he is still his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to continue the family tradition by creating herself a lover. It is closer to an ominous melodrama than horrorflick. Supporting cast features Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. A rainy night can strengthen the atmosphere. Another fun watch.
