Aliens in the desert. Small blue rocks that seem to be made of cheap plastic. The overall storyline is not bad if you want such things, but the acting is so poor that it surprised me that some of them actually entertained me in The X Files! And the special effects? Hello?! Where did they find their secondary school FX crew? I mean, come on; there was so much more they could have done! It was amateur and extremely basic. I didn't really enjoy it (and my dad slept in it!) And of course our hero fell in love with the front lady! It is so typical and highly predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
