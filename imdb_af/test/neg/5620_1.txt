Who wrote this movie? An uninspired 15-year-old? <br /> <br /> Can be written by one of the kids who did the Columbine shooting. <br /> <br /> Completely nonsensical, not funny, booooo ... <br /> Plus, the French do not place their flag anywhere. You don't run into a French bank and see the tricolore flag that is being displayed. Even on Bastille day. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the bloodbath. It's just that it's not credible or funny. Whether parody or something. <br /> <br /> Well, those who love this movie will tell you I should be a kind of fascist, so forget my comment.
