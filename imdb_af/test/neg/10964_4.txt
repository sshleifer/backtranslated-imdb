The plot of the movie is pretty simple: a viral outbreak has changed the population into carnivorous zombies. Those who walked away became "hunters". <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, it's NOT the worst zombie movie there is. Among the worst is "Zombiez" and the infamous "Zombie Lake". <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the idea for "Quick and the Undead" was very good, just poorly executed. Considering the budget they had to work with, this movie looks very good. I was not bored at all while I watched it. Special effects were solid, although they used CGI once (fat was shot in the head), but everything (gore, gut) was pretty good. However, action is terrible. Our chief looks like young Clint Eastwood, other "actors" are not even worth mentioning. As far as the plot goes, they haven't worked enough to develop the story. <br /> <br /> Bad: Acting, Low Budget. Good: special effects, idea for the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall this movie deserves 4/10 of me. It's not as bad as people say. Imagine a ZOMBIE WESTERN, then watch this movie.
