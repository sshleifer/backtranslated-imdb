The plot in Petites Coupures definitely obscured this viewer. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler *** <br /> <br /> In the space of 48 hours, Auteuil's character had a relationship with a teenager. , losing his wife's passions, attempting to seduce Scott Thomas is rejected by her going to pick up another female character in the back of a car and then finally being shot for his trouble. <br /> <br /> *** End of spoiler *** <br /> <br /> wha ??? <br /> <br /> The only saving grace in this movie is Kristin Scott Thomas. Similar to Charlotte Rampling, she looks like a * natural * star in the French theater. My hope is that one day Francois Ozon can throw her in a part where she can show her true talent. <br /> <br /> There are some good French films like the notable Le Colonel Chabert to beg a DVD edition. this is the chosen choice. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. <br /> <br /> Zzzz ..
