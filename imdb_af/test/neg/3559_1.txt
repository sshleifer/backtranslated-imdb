It was the most godly movie I had to go through. 30 minutes in the movie and I couldn't take it anymore. Seriously, don't save this one unless you are a sentimental note or one of those pseudo-arty types that is threefold like this so they can be grown more. Drilling, although the play is good; the child is just irritating. Some scenes are a bit strange with many weird close ups. I don't know why they did the whole movie in black and white, but what effect they hopefully failed. There was nothing to look at, and although it's a sad story, presumably, it's just as stupid that it's hard to feel any sympathy for the characters.
