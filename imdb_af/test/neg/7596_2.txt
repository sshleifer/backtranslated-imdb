It was a relief in many ways. The location filmed in Ireland is pretty pretty, and can't save this uninspired movie. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, if the married couple are trying to get their marriage on track and who owns a haunted house, are just not interesting characters. Paul, by the end of the film, gets incredibly annoying and one wish she's just closing her mouth and being shut down, because she seems to be screaming as if it just became an Olympic event! Other problems with this film are strange segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two housewives and the woman in a bed with a cut hand clutching her writhing, naked body. Although the woman is reasonably enough to do so, it does nothing storywise. One remains the production team needed to throw out a short running time and just throw in some padding and a bit of T and A. The CGI effects are also cartoon and the fiery final rival co-executive producer Roger Corman is much earlier and far better film The fall of Usher's house in all its ineffective cheapness. Any attempt at true tension and tension, and as a result cold fever, will blow the window into this low budget head. If you like images from Ireland, you can find something here, but you will travel better or buy a travel report. Save it unless you're not discriminating and think plot is secondary. Rent another low budget ghost story (if you can find it) titled The Woman In Black and see how good and scary a movie can be. It was a wasteful opportunity.
