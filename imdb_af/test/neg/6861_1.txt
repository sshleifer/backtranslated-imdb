Was unfortunate enough to see it while traveling by coach across Africa. It was by far the worst movie I've ever experienced. Earn to be the # 1 all-time worst ;-) No acting, no plot, very little talk. Much of the monkey-like grunting has been in this hopelessly unlikely movie. An unconscious self-satire - you will laugh or cry to it.
