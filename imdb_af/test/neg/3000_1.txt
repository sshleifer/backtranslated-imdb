It's the boring, pretentious and silly movie I've seen for a long time. I saw it at the Beverly Hills Academy, and there were quite a few people in the lobby who left the screen looking for shelter. Everyone was solemnly shaking their heads and watching as if they were a funeral. What a waste of time and money. Even worse are the critics who give this pretentious blimp, good reviews. What's with them? Are they just afraid they won't be considered "hip"? Were they bribed? This movie is staggeringly bad. Don't take a date to have an in-depth chat with the Cheesecake factory. If you are going to see this movie, your idea is to break through and keep your life over you.
