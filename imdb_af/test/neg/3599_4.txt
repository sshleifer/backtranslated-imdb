EWWW! A Disney sequel who is rubbish! Who would have thought that? Actually, much appreciated by the comments here, and they are not wrong. I was actually looking forward to seeing this horrible movie, based on my taste of the original. And that's where Disney's whole "cash-in" mentality lies. Kick an old junk on the back of a success and people will go for it. Don't think they're so cynical? Ask yourself this, then .... How many Disney movies have prosecutions? And then .... How many of the persecutors have succeeded? A significantly lower number. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove is just another example. The plot is lightly simplistic and drawn out. Even more annoying was the increasing number of out of place items and scenes - for example, an old people's house and God forbids an Aztec version of the Boy Scouts! Worse still, Kronk's opposing Chippamunk leader has a completely staggering over-the-top English accent for no reason whatsoever. An accent that slipped into the nerves after a very short while. <br /> <br /> There are some good things. The animation is very nice and the voice talent goes well with the sub-standard dialogue they are given - especially Warburton. But other than that, there really is nothing to recommend it. Sure, small children may like it, but there is little to entertain mom and dad while going through this cruel mutilation of the original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal that you will use to avoid a packet of raven-humans-lions.
