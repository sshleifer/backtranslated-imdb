This movie upset me for the simple fact that it was just made because Shepherd was gay. The men who killed him are clearly wicked. What happened to the poor man was really terrible and a tragedy. But where was Hollywood when four religious white children were carried out by two wicked black men in Wichita two years ago to do a lot of sexual acts on their killers and each other? The celebrities only worry about the camera when it serves a political purpose. Laramie is also portrayed in a poor light by this pseudo-documentary, which is, of course, almost surprising because they are the rear hookers who must be educated by omniscient and enlightened California. Yet it is always a surprise to see Laura Linney.
