Despite an absolutely horrible script (more on that later), this film is still vaguely vigilant, just because it dies two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Apart from one or two REAL stinkers, I will probably just watch everything with them in the movie, because I'm a big fan of Hollywood's golden era of the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I like their movies, I can't recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Fonda and Stanwyck on holiday at a ski resort. The two have not yet met, but the film starts hard and unpleasant with a scene in which Fonda terrifies yodels. It was done so uncomfortably and my teeth were sharpened, but I knocked it out - especially when Fonda fell into a snowboard and it stopped the yoeding! Afterwards, maybe I just had to turn it off! Fonda is eliminated in the fall and Barbara goes to help. Back at the ski lodge it looks good, but fortunately she is also a doctor and has x-ray and nursing him back to health. He in turn turns up and suggests her. Despite not knowing each other, they marry and so far the movie looks like a lovely but very light romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Once at home, however, it is not rosy, as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and begins with signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man because of his jealousy . The film plays everything for the laugh, but frankly, Fonda's behavior was completely creepy - spying on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening any man she is treating, with a patient who already has a back injury and a get a surprise party. that everyone there (men and women) is out to steal his wife. He comes down as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic, but it's all supposed to laugh. As it looks like it's a dangerous nut, you'd think Stanwyck will be canceling with a punitive order! But strangely she gets angry, but can't be angry at Fonda, because he's so ........? I can't think of the right word - 'creepy' is all that comes to mind !!! Later, out of the blue, the multi-millionaire Fonda gets a job that works counter at a shopping mall. Then he and Babs, through magical thinking, look his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past - such a work apparently heals anger and suspicions. When this work goes through, the film ends with Fonda who buys his own hospital, and Barbara gives a job there and they are happy to ever live. They do not go on with the story, but on the basis of Fonda's character I accept that he spent most of his time as a hospital administrator to relax all the male patients. <br /> <br /> The first section at the ski lodge and the next did not fit well, and the final "Horatio Alger" also did not part of the section in which the rich boy did well in the business world do not have. They were like three separate plots, but it was the biggest problem with the movie to excuse domestic violence and despair! What a creepy little movie! Thanks also not to Fonda or Stanwyck for this avid movie, but for all their other lovely movies.
