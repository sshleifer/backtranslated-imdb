I found this movie well. <br /> <br /> On paper, this movie has everything one might want! Romance, comedy, drama. A bank robbery, a unique role, good music and storytelling! <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is mostly rubbish, and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is my biggest problem: editing. This movie has by far the worst editing I've ever seen from local car dealerships. The editing could be better done by a deaf Parkinson's patient who's gone with iMovie with a dead cat. There are scenes where two characters talk to each other and you can see how their lips move and the sound / video is not synchronized because it is clearly mentioned. Why was it bought? I do not know! The English dubbing English! The voices were done in a studio elsewhere in some scenes! Can't get a boom Mic? They are not expensive; Jesus, even I own one! And I don't make movies! <br /> <br /> b) Andrew Keegan's performance remained. It didn't really seem like he wanted to be part of this project, and his performance was the equivalent of a skit performed by D.A.R. for school children. John Krasinksi had at least an enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Yes, John Krasinski is the only reason I rented this movie, and that's the only real reason to look. He did a good, witty performance and he was the three-dimensional character. Dean Edwards's character was pretty thin, as it was. <br /> <br /> Final Word? If you're a fan of John Krasinski, it's worth your time. If not, don't even bother. The editing
