I was a silent photographer who worked in Europe this summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three. <br /> <br /> I made some pictures for him, of which I was told, became the poster for the movie. I didn't see the movie until years later. I thought it was bad. Sorry, the elements that went into it were compelling. Robie Porter's girl was so beautiful as Rampling herself. Salter asked if I should stand and be an extra cameraman so they didn't have to shoot twice. I sure said, but I had to return to NY, with the promise that I would be back. Oh, I never came back. One of life's unhealthy melodies. <br /> <br /> I wish I could post the photos I made somewhere. <br /> <br /> Rowland Scherman
