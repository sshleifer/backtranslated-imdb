As embarrassing as it is to admit, I'm listed as production manager on this movie ... first of all! In fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. Look carefully and you even see me in one of the opening fields, as a quicker than killer called "Cely" (my own of). <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Hostages", this photo was changed to "Another Son of Sam" by the producer director who wanted to enter the serial killer at that time. Nothing could have helped. I don't even think this picture was good enough on "MST 3K!" To display. <br /> <br /> The movie was shot primarily with a collection of old Mitchell cameras and early Arriflex handhelds. In fact, the shot of the helicopter during the hostage siege was filmed with my own WWI era Arri. The photo was completely filmed in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina in the mid-seventies. Most of the "Stars" were local TV news writers, and the rest of the crew were just inexperienced enough or believing enough to believe former stuntman and producer director Dave A, Adams' lack of sufficiency. <br /> <br /> If you like watching this picture, you might love the work of another North Carolinian, the legendary Earl Owensby. <br /> <br />
