Through its 2-hour length, Crash, the emotional anxiety of its 10-year-old ensemble captures characters with the sometimes blatant and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying American society. This and the emotional anxiety of one of his audiences sits near the front and desperately tries to make sense of what movies have become. <br /> <br /> The era in which we live has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, even the non-enthusiastic flag moving from postmodernism, ideas are always shot by what post-postmodernism is aimed at destroying all of these ideas, not all thanks to the great destructive business ideas from the great "thinkers". But I deviated. It has nothing to do with what the movie is about, but rather what the movie is. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it seems difficult to earn a living in a Hollywood that has to conform to a market that post-mail everything that has become more cynic than just a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think or like about it. And so a new studio product is born! Indie films, once energetic and idealistic in its challenging experimentalism, now look as vivid as Hollywood movies to sell in the Indian movie markets. An Indie movie has to be sold at Sundance before being 'praised'. And so nothing more simple. Even what makes a good movie becomes so dark. While filmmakers in the past just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story - and in these seemingly simplistic efforts, the biggest movies are borne - filmmakers nowadays make movies that are good. movies should make people think, be meaningful, be challenging, ask questions, yadda yadda yadda. What it all means is a subversion of the Hollywood movie system, but this subversion looks strange to the formal similarities of Hollywood movies, the innumerable ways to be different to being essentially the same product. <br /> <br /> And I haven't even started the movie yet. Maybe I've become too fussy about movies these days. Perhaps because of my primary need to be entertained, rather than to say, be forced to watch a movie. But hell, this movie is one big load of shit. And I'm scared off by this movie not just because it guides the guide How to make a Good Film Good 101 guide, spit out the eloquent lines, and is as evil as they are gifted with the speech of God; it causes racism and life-related issues confronting racism in America; it affects a few moments where everyone is discovering more about themselves and more about others; not to mention the fact that when you hear the environmental / new age sounds of women singing in high registers in foreign languages, you know you are in all of the above. <br /> <br /> And about the above point - about raising questions about immediate-compelling issues such as racism - piss me off big time. Like all post-post movies, it's not just a message about this issue. Because oh, our audiences are very intelligent today in this post-post world. Our audiences want us to think, don't want us to put things so simplistic (and then they go existentialist crap and say), because life itself is not simplistic. Ha ha ha. What other general drill we do here, then the audience must think about things rather than feed them. Okay, okay and okay. So the film makes it a point to pound audiences with these non-messages, and since it's not exactly a message, it's so subtle and subtle, it does right? So we are hit again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. And as if the irony is not steep enough, we have transformed Ludicrous's character, the only character that apparently does not take all this racism discussion seriously, into one of those annoyingly meaningful characters where he eventually learns something, for meaning give and break where audiences also have to "learn about themselves". Um, yes. How I wanted to see an incredible racist movie after this man. <br /> <br /> To cut the long bullshit short, I think I wouldn't have watched the movie if it wasn't so inflated in its self-interest. The whole movie's anxiety feels more like a white boy waving like Spike Lee-ish. It's like Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the kind who want to blow flags over humanitarian will as the only thing they don't realize is the flag they are blowing, their hole-ridden underwear. Plus it has become so trendy in the post-after-world to be totally subtle about it. Nothing is simply more. In his best efforts to be really good, challenging and ultimately human, it's not another indie shit of an indie director who wants to make a name for himself as a credible indie filmmaker. Now Hollywood is at least simpler and sincere in its manipulation.
