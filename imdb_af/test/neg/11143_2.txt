Cheerful of Flesh and looking forward to Heat, but can't help but feels Morrissey is exploiting most of the "performers" used here. Struggling naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all that Dallesandro could use in this feature - a big and heartbreaking contrast to Flesh. His semi-erection in some scenes is the only indication that he is acting; Usually, it seems he has done something to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation and she is the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But her is a one-week show. She rarely gets to the other artists, but it must be said, her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to filmmaking. When she is on a young, beloved lover, it is the escape of a vampire. Two of the female artists, Andrea and Jane, have such annoying voices, you have to push the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that several of these artists have committed suicide or been murdered for a few years after simply exploiting air. But they were probably desperate to come to Morrissey's camera anyway. There is probably not a worse way to spend a Saturday night, but it brings at least a certain time and lives alive.
