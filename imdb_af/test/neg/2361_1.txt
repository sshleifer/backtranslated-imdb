I can't believe how these atrocities managed to capture the hearts and minds of a cross-section of the 'shiny young things' of his era, but I'm sure I wish it did. In my opinion, it is an inaccurate, poorly acted, poorly written, pretentious piece of gumpf. The short trips to an imagined reality bludgeon any humor to death. The situations are uncomfortable exaggerations that make the all-too-quick characters even more incredible and horrible. The romance is boring, the end is unsatisfactory and ruins the only sensible drug message in the film and the simple plot ('Withnail and I,' Fear and Loathing ') is tested with the uninteresting motion of the film. In short, this film is a blatant visual attack with no hint of skill or initiative. I condemn it to the ashes of history and pray that it stays there.
