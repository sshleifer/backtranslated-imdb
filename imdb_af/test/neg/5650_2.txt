Well, I have based this movie on the rather high score here (7.1 now) and on the good reviews. Usually IMDb is a good guide when it comes to scoring, but in this case I was very deceived. <br /> <br /> The movie is a contemporary detective story, with Vinnie Jones as the investigator journalist, investigating the death of a construction worker. Communion with this is a made up Dickens novel (called The Riddle, set in the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with a murder story. Both story lines are linked by the discovery of an unpublished manuscript. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? It could have been, but this movie fails in a number of areas terribly: 1) Acting. Moderate at best, but it is vigilant. Not worse than your average British sitcom, but for a movie you expect a little better. Especially with a score of more than 7. 2) Music. The music used is simply awful, it gets rid of and it is annoying. Especially the bar music and the music playing in the journalist's apartment. 3) Story line. It's a big joke. There are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the compulsory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny. Furthermore, without going into any detail, I can safely say that the end is absurd and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year. 4) Camera work. Sometimes camera positions and views are distracting and serve absolutely no purpose for the "story". <br /> <br /> I'm a movie fanatic movie and, on average, watching 1 to 2 movies a day, it's easily the worst movie I've seen in months. Don't waste your money or your time on this garbage.
