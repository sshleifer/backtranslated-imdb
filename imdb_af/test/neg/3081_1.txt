From what I remember seeing this movie, it wasn't good. I always say this when a movie is good and can keep your attention in the most difficult of times (for example: a Tylenol Cold & Sinus war) as it is a film that did its job. The fact that I slept for most of these movies just proves that I couldn't watch my attention and it didn't complete his work. Why did I become a victim of the Tylenol Cold & Sinus when I had a movie in my arsenal? <br /> <br /> To begin, Committed made no sense. The acting was poor and the overall story opened more doors that just couldn't be closed. I think the moment I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this movie) kissing. It didn't make sense. Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommate indicating that he had slept with one of them, and almost had a perfect lesbian couple. I think it was to show that most are not as dedicated to a relationship as Graham, but to me it was nothing more than stuffing. I felt this suspect the director of the movie slept with Affleck. His performance in this film was frightening. I mean, I've never seen him do a good thing, but it was by far the worst. Oh, I just had another moment during the fight, and I confirmed it with IMDb.com. What did John Stewart do in this movie? It was another moment when my eyes just opened for a moment in one of the battles that last forever. <br /> <br /> And honestly, it's Heather Graham - we can take less care of her after a while. She is just not interesting - she is just soft, boring and usually stops after a while. As they start throwing desperate characters into the mix to revive the movie, it just doesn't work and instead of just mentioning it for a day - they start throwing more characters into the mix, so now it's just strange, boring, boring and really, very long. Luke Wilson's slow striking acting style slows down an already crawling movie - why exactly were these two married? Committed is a truly horrible movie - the kind of "hip comedy" that leaves you, delays and bores. <br /> <br /> Degree: * Off *****
