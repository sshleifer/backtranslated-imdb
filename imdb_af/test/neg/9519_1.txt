What can I say about this movie, it's really one of the worst gay theme movies ever to come from the UK. I can only think like Diana Quick and Georgina Hale, need the money. What a story is there is such a turbulent mess that you lose pretty quickly interest. It is supposed to be based on actual events. Well, all I can say to that one is that it is an insult to the right characters. The DVD is currently in the UK. It is available in the split screen format, which makes it even worse that the full screen version I see. Gay theater can be so much better than that, and we deserve more.
