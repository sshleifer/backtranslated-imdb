I found and figured this DVD in the store, why not support a movie and watch a cool horror flick. Please save your time and money and pass this one. The acting, the script, almost everything with this movie is subpar. There is really not much of a story, and there is no character development. I didn't find myself what happened to the people in the movie as long as something happened. Everyone is supposed to be university age, but they all seem to be in the mid-thirties, except for the woman who plays a mother who seems to be pushing 40. In fact, the worst part of the movie is that each play is shown in a master's boot. There is no editing, no cut ins or close ups. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
