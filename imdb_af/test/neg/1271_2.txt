Opulent sets and cute costumes, well photographed by Theodor Sparkuhl, and a good (not large) performance by Jannings, as Henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camera work. Henny Porten chews the landscape as Anne. <br /> <br /> It's all very beautiful; but it is all surface and no depth. The melodramatic story of a woman who did wrong, made it a hit in America, where the expressionist "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" plunged in the same year (1920). It proves that what is popular does not endure so much. Lubitsch will be remembered for his live comedies, not sterile glasses like this.
