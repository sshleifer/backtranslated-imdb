While it's not as bad as some movies (such as the horrible Atomic Twister), "Meltdown" relies on common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear industry to promote its plot. I am currently studying Nuclear Engineering in pursuit of a Master's degree, and it was easy to point out mistakes that will be for everyone involved in the industry. <br /> <br /> The fake fear that a Chernobyl silent collapse could happen in an American plant, the film says any collapse (even partially, according to one of the gas commentators in the movie) would cause disaster to the area. mean. In fact, a partial collapse in an American plant, while destroying the nucleus, will pose no danger to the surrounding area. Three Mile Island experiences a partial collapse and no radioactive material is released into the environment, thanks to the substantial stability of the fuel and nuclear design used in this country. <br /> <br /> The security steps shown in the movie may have been part of the film farthest from the truth. At any important strategic location - it's power station, chemical plant, military base, anything - you'll never see staff responding to an alarm by talking to speak as if it were an unannounced drill. This is especially true at a nuclear plant, where the reactors will be screwed immediately when the alarm is turned off. SCRAMing can be done with the push of a button in the control room (you don't have to put the core into shutdown mode as shown in the movie) and the chemistry of fission prevents a nucleus from being brought back to power within about 9 hours from a SCRAM. If this scenario were played in real life, the attackers would not be able to cause a significant collapse. In theory, they can still cause a partial one due to residual heat if they expose the nucleus immediately, but this will be almost impossible, as many back-up systems are present in a plant. There are many more than the single backup pumps they talk about in the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the fuel pool, it may be possible to turn the pools into a dirty bomb by blowing them up, but it's much harder than just parking a truck full of explosives near the pools. The fuel is under (about) 18 feet of highly purified water. The water cannot become radioactive (no radioactive steam as they speak in the movie). Particles that are dissolved in the water can, but the water itself cannot; So the reason for very thorough cleaning. The only way to make a fuel pool in a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water. It's not easy as water is very heavy and the pools are underground with very thick concrete walls. The explosives must be in the pool under the fuel (which is securely fastened). And there will be a lot of explosives because water is very difficult to move through an explosion. Even if it did happen, spent fuel was not highly radioactive, and the explosion would not cause as much as a death toll as mentioned in the film, especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would be distributed. <br /> <br /> From a basic movie point, I got a little tired of the style used. The constant fading in and out, using gritty black and white, and fast tracking and panning seem amateurish. The characters were one-dimensional, especially those in the US government. I have problems with the twist that is thrown into the movie but won't discuss it as it would be a great spoiler. <br /> <br /> Overall 3/10
