When the budget doesn't allow for a Cadillac or Packard or Lincoln or Imperial hearse, we're talking cheep cheep. It is bird language for cheap cheap. <br /> <br /> What's in the hair of the 40-year-old teenage boy? The guy who looks like a cement head trying several times to run over John Agar and giving the only scare in the movie, how close he gets. His hair looks like a shoe. A leader's shoes. He's a shoe head. <br /> <br /> The nurse's wife needs immediate hair. She had lacquer in her blonde locks that would explode if the production company could afford lights. <br /> <br /> The monster? The music was scarcer. I'll try to run the music. The monster probably has better hair than the rest of the roll. Put a lipstick on the sample and you have Divine's older sister. <br /> <br /> The camera work and editing and plot provided a buffer to prepare the audience for the bad music throughout. <br /> <br /> Hello Mr. Agar? We think of a sequel to Night Fright and ... Mr. Agar? Agar? Tom Willett
