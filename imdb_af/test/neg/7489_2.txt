Last night I watched this movie on TV and hope for a realistic version of what can happen if there is an outbreak of disease. I was disappointed and I think the movie was rubbish. It didn't really seem to me. Some of the plays were terrible, especially the doctor's. She was the worst I saw. The whole thing played like a worst-case scenario from CNN. Even the compulsory disaster movie of human relationships does not seem sincere. I saw some disaster movies, especially the weather, which is so bad, it's amusing. This one is almost as bad, but it's not even amusing, it's boring and boring. Do not wrestle with this one.
