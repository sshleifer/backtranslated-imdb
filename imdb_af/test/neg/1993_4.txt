It's okay ... A few years later, Chayefsky's classic "Network" will be his true cinematic BIG home course ... but now this dark comedy is not the classic he strives to be. It's mostly awful, although it has some good scenes: the first murder victim was found, the ER clerk responsible for billing patients who make a surprise discovery, Drummond's delusion, and the last scene where Scott's character is restore professional integrity and self-respect. . It also has some ridiculous scenes: Scott's character's shining monologue during his early visit to hospital psychiatrist, Scott's character's rape of Rigg's character, Dysart's horrific turn in his short scenes, and the O.R. a doctor who on the operating table refuses to revive the wrong patient because "I already have one malpractice lawsuit". <br /> <br /> Chayefsky is also trying too hard to throw every conceivable stumbling block into this one hospital (ie, the murders, the administrative bugs, the poor protesters, etc.). It may have worked better than a glance at the industry as a whole. Conveniently pointed out: Scott is acceptable, Rigg looks scandalous, Hughes is inspired, and Dysart is scared by his short show. The rest of the cast is also one-dimensional.
