In addition to being just an abysmally-made movie (think of giving a video camera to the average high school drama club), the people who think there is something really about this legend should grow. It is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts do not exist. Most people learn this from their mother when they are about 5 years old. You must grow up seriously. <br /> <br /> The fact that a fraud was committed about two centuries ago does not make it any less fraud. The fact that a large number of inbred Hillbillies from Tennessee don't believe it either. Go to college. Or at least complete high school.
