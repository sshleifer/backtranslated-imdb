Interesting and short television film describes some of the operations around Jay Leno's replacement of Carson as host of the Tonight Show. Film is currently very topical given the public drama around Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of sparking viewers' interest in the events and shows some of the concerns of the stakeholders, especially the NBC managers. Ovitz's portrayal was extremely compelling and interesting, I thought. <br /> <br /> However, many of the characters were only briefly cut or touched, and some of the plays were perfunctories. However, an interesting story.
