Not to find the right words is the problem of everyone in this vaudeville-type urban comedy. They don't know what to say, and they don't know how to say it. That's why they start with the potentially humiliating venture of pre-arranged speed theater. Unfortunately, they all appear as cardboard characters rather than real people. The story follows a conventional three-action structure: getting to know the substantial rejection of their sorry few lives, the actual dating circle, and a last-stroke romantic fall-out, showing some of the custom couples' follies. Being so predictable, I will say it as a story, "Shopping" is a failure. As a comedy, it's usually too good to be really funny. Thumbs up to Kathrin von Steinburg. She stands out from the soap opera crowd as the separate, independent empire Miriam. Great makeup on her too (Verena Wei√üert): Heavy eyeshadow meets skin-colored lip gloss, creating a breeding and bohemian but girlish effect. Thumb also to Stefan Zinner as the Bavarian love machine and Tanja Schleiff as the hot nutritionist. They ignore the communication challenge through the timeless body language of copulation.
