Well, I'll be clean and acknowledge that as part of my history, I was forced to watch this movie and then write a short movie review as part of my degree. <br /> <br /> But even if I was the movie alone, at my own discretion, I found it very boring and absurd. The style is past his years, and the play is over. Rather than using a dialogue, they exchange one another instead of cans, or sometimes in the air. For me, such top performances, no longer carry emotion, and after seeing Ivan's face for the hundredth time, I was praying that the movie would end. <br /> <br /> However, the most disappointing is how wrong Ivan's character is. This man was nasty, his bodyguard's murderous thugs and his character cowardly. For me, the film was nothing but a piece of propaganda from Stalin, inaccurate and boring.
