On the face of the movie it looks like it can be really good. It's not. <br /> <br /> The role play is pretty good, but most of them were embarrassing the whole thing. The real disaster in this movie is not the flood, but the writing. It attempts to include every clich√© in the book, all incredibly weak. The end is very sudden, but it is a blessing in disguise. Surprises if you make it that far. <br /> <br /> All three major male actors (Carlyle, Courtney and Suchet) will definitely agree that this is the low point in their careers. I hope they paid a lot of cash because none of their reputations comes in touch. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty good, but the same thing is done for much better effect in The Day After Tomorrow. <br /> <br /> In short, a useless exercise. Don't waste your time.
