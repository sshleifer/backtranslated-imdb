I tried it - NEW - at my local store for $ 6 and said, "hey! An action movie featuring the Bloodsport guy and Enter the Dragon, directed by the man who imported the Dragon - and that's cheap! " So I bought it. Oops! It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a few dozies. <br /> <br /> You know how deliberately champions movies, like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive, are AWESOME? You know how movies are supposed to be serious, but seem so horrible that you have to laugh aloud and watch again, like Lionheart (an old Van Damme movie) or John Carpenter's Vampires, is it pretty cool? This movie, Ironheart, manages not to be theirs. I don't know what the filmmakers are thinking, but it looks like this movie was made without time to shoot, no budget for anything, and no writing to talk about. (While I'm on the lathe, I have to point out that Bolo Yeung has NO LINES in this movie. The only reason he gets the first account on the box is the fact that he's the only actor in the movie you will ever recognize (unless you are a Jackie Chan fan, in which case you will recognize the bad guy - and you will call him Giancarlo!). <br /> <br /> What is sad is that this movie is from '92. By that time, T2: Judgment Day has come out, so you know that the 80s era was over ... but not quite, then you will be the 80's Chuck Norris movies, high school competitions, and Jason / Freddy followers see, were works of pure genius. <br /> <br /> Things to know: <br /> <br /> 1) No one in this movie can act for beans. The closest you get is Richard Norton who looks pretty rich and scary, and Bolo Yeung looks pretty mean ... and shit. All the others are terrible. <br /> <br /> 2) The martial arts scenes are forgotten - just many cases of white guys with many muscles shouting their shirts, screaming, running at Britton Lee, kicked by Britton Lee, beaten by Britton Lee, and then fall . Even the last performance against Bolo is disappointingly short and as creative as the design of my running socks (and smelly). <br /> <br /> 3) The rest of the action is also pathetic: the guns look like they come from the toy department at K-Mart, and indeed they burn with the sound of a capgun. When someone shoots, they jump a little, then lie down with speckles of brownish red liquid on their clothes. Britton Lee is suddenly shot in the side, but you don't see it at all, but later you see the wound ... I had paper cuts worse than this! <br /> <br /> 4) Of course, the girl is wearing the wound, then kissing, then the next thing you know is that they are talking in bed in bed and talking to sex. Huh? What? Credible development of love, as well as any kind of character development, is completely overlooked in this film. Remember how Bruce Lee's characters didn't have sex with someone to be cool? <br /> <br /> 5) The car hunt is by far the worst I have ever seen. It seems as if the director was sitting on the curb with a hand camera, like the two cars in the road doing, I don't know about 30 miles an hour? Don't try it at home, kids, these people are professional! Hah! <br /> <br /> 6) Really bad writing. Here's a scene for you: Lee is followed so the girl follows the followers to warn Lee, but her car is too slow. So by the time she catches up, Lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there's a firearm going on. Lee killed two bad guys, but the third shot at Lee when the girl almost drove Lee, so the bad man ran away. (Huh?) Then the girl's car bumps and she can't start it. She tells Lee she is involved and she comes along. He shows her that they can't leave her car, because the bad guys will find it for her. She convinced him somehow that he had to decide how to deal with this problem - so he shot the gas and blew up his car. (And remember, later that night they had sex.) Huh?!? <br /> <br /> 7) If you look carefully, more than half of the nightclub shots are well-liked by the dancers. the music. The dancers were also completely co-ordinated (apparently in the 80's all people at dance clubs took dance lessons). There is a girl in the DJ booth with a microphone, but she does nothing but dance. The bouncers tell people who are fighting to "take it outside" - without moving their lips. In one scene, the only bouncers Lee and Stevo pass by are just inside the entrance, but with their backs to it! Also, if you're an important character in the movie, you can go straight to the head of the line. <br /> <br /> 8) On the first time Lee notices that he is being followed, but he does not 'Note the second time - although it's the same guy in the same car. However, the girl watches. Bad guys are followed twice, but they never see. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee is worried that the bad guys will track the girl's car back to her, even though they've seen him work twice. The girl continues to leave her child at work, taking care of a friend while having sex with Lee. Don't teach parents from this movie! <br /> <br /> Now can't think more grips ... you get the idea ... Ironheart is so bad, it's not even funny, it's SAD.
