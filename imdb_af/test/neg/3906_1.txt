I've seen this movie partially due to some positive comments here on IMDb. After having returned those 90 minutes of my life, I feel it is my duty to come here and say ... Please don't risk this movie. <br /> <br /> I can't argue with The Actors' efforts - they did what they could give the material, but the material is terrible. The pass was deadly - slow, winding, and you saw everything about an hour away, and then it went on forever to happen. The dialogue was boring, useless, not funny at all. The characters were all completely impersonal. And the cinematography was, in my opinion, very low quality - the clich√© of "character uses home video machine!" was used to a very bad effect. <br /> <br /> Yes, Jeri Ryan is a cool person. Don't let that waste your time on this movie.
