In the 50's, a gay photographer named Bob Mizer (Daniel MacIvor) established a male model agency that released a muscle magazine called "Physique Pictorial" and a movie of men. Many of the models have become prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this pervert. <br /> <br /> Changing footage from the fifties, testimony of many models and Bob Mizer himself in today's days, director Thom Fitzgerald used this subterfuge to show naked men. and many penis along 93 minutes of running time, in complete bad taste and very stupid crap. I've never heard anything from this morally corrupt Bob Mizer and I don't know what AMG is. In my opinion, only gay and very specific audiences may hold the theme of this boring and pretentious movie. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carne Fresca" ("Fresh Meat")
