... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which neither character is equivalent or even interesting people? I can see what the writer David Renwick has been trying to achieve: the deceptions and bad surprises he has placed in "One Foot in the Tomb", etc. I admit that the writing has done a bit more effort than most on British TV right now. But really ... who cares about these people? They are cold drills. <br /> <br /> Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sat to watch a video of herself and her late ex-boyfriend. It was the moment I turned this program off, never coming back. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is interesting to note that the posters that did not hold this series are all Brits, while those who appreciate it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcasts this series, it was ignored by viewers and sank like a rock. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it! There will be a second series in the fall of 2007 - though without the male lead. It sounds like the BBC has decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom.
