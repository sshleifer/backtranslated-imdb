This formal movie (hero's girlfriend marries the villain) didn't move fast enough, given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott looks too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, which exposes the scene. He responds poorly to the death of some of his hands; he escapes from Knox's gang by hiding in a full rainfall; his escape from the high country and the pursuit of John Russell seem superfluous, much like the movie. The plot could be equipped. <br /> <br /> High points of the movie: See "Tennessee" Ernie Ford without a mustache singing "Man in the Saddle"; Alfonso Bedoya's shortage as a cook; the color photography of the high country, and the battle scene there with John Russell.
