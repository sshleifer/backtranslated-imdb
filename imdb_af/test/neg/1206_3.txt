Don't worry about looking at logic. There is nobody. But on the other hand, there are very good movies that have complete logic, so why bother? <br /> <br /> I like and love this movie. I like it because the action ranges in the air are really good, you get a lot of dogfighting. I also like the F-16, which is a very cool airplane. <br /> <br /> But there are just too many goofs to really enjoy me. I think it is not fair to wish for any kind of continuity, as it is difficult to make a very good fight fly - but I also think there should be a reason for it. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: do they fly from California to the Middle East in F-16s without air supplement? I'd like to see it.
