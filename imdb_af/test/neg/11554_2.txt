After living in Michigan's upper peninsula (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I was eager to see this movie. It starts out promising enough, with a superficial understanding of the values ​​and characteristics of U.P. life. But Jeff Daniels was apparently not satisfied with a low key approach that would have been appropriate for the place and the people. Instead, he suggests extremely cruel humor and some inconsistent mystical / supernatural elements. Although a good film is made about this virtually unknown region of the US, it is NOT.
