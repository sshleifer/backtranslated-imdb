Fran√ßois Traffaut's "Mississippi Siren" had an unconvincing plot. The script requires too much elasticity in the suspension of unbelief. The plot went at a gleaming pace. It started in an interesting environment, but soon drifted to the shows of melodrama lacking logic or intelligence. What do the critics think? This one is overestimated, even described as a loser. Even Catherine Deneuvue, who enchanted in "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and "Belle Doe Jour", managed to simply be annoying. <br /> <br /> We rented this movie while renting another Traffaut movie. We first looked at this one and found it so bad that we sent the other one back together.
