This is the perfect example of how a big book changes into a poor movie. The direction just gives the impression that the movie was made while they were going, and Patrick Swaze is so timid that you can almost see the puppet rings on his body. <br /> <br /> Spy Vs spy movies aren't - be about car hunters and shooting, the bad guys in these movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when it's on an empty series. <br /> <br /> Even the action shots are just a clich√© with the usual tidy pavements and crashing through tables and chairs - yawn. <br /> <br /> I halfway through and off - completely bored.
