I liked the Far Cry game a lot, nice graphics, good level design, interesting and clever enemies, above average height and even a somewhat decent plot. I'm not at all against movie devils from games. I thought "DOOM The Movie" was hilarious. But what your Boll has done here is to take the game and change each of its good aspects and change it into something terrible (and not the length, the movie just runs a gracious 90 minutes). The characters are even more stereotypical than in the game, which is quite an achievement. The whole plot is told without any twists or riddles. Several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story. And come on "Genetically Modified Soldiers"? they could have come up with a better name. <br /> <br /> However, this film should be awarded the most idiotic love scene. I have never seen anything like this. I can't believe they were trying seriously. "We need to get out of the wet clothes." "I think I'll get hypothermia" (although everyone wears T-shirts) "we need to compile for body heat" Is this your gun? "But ... but ... there weren't people who consciously did it? There had to be a scriptwriter, a director, actors, a gaffer, an electrician, a food child! Why didn't anyone in Was that movie done by devastating, inhumane, genetically manipulated film people? I wouldn't start to frighten how many logical errors, inconsistencies, and scriptures were there, but even the hard action fan, it can be nothing but insulting. <br /> <br /> This movie actually asked to be classified as 2 out of 10, so I'll do it so well, but it does explain me where second star comes from. Special effects? Nah. Acting? Not really. References to the game? You wish. Wait! They used the font of the game for the title and credits. It was neat. <br /> < br /> If you are looking for a movie for a bad movie month, go to "2012 - Supernova", this one is just - sad.
