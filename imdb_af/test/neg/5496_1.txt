R.I.C.C.O. is the STUPIDEST film ever made. I can't believe my dad bought this crap. This film should never be made. If this movie was widely known, trust me it will be the # 1 spot for IMDB's worst. The play is terrible, it's scary, and that's why it's horrible. This piece had no horror at all. It's an urban action, which is funny, because I can swear it, it was a comedy. When people shot, I couldn't help but laugh. I am the only person who has reviewed it and I hope I will be the last. With this voice I just hope it makes it the # 1 spot on the worst !!!!!!!
