I like this movie, not a good one, but not the worst ever made. Although, everyone says it's one of the worst movies ever created, I thought it was okay. There are many immature jokes. It would sometimes be funny, but failed. <br /> <br /> The story is OK. However, it can be a little difficult to follow for the younger audiences. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is the most horrible actor. Sometimes it's even laughing. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor here. He is funny if he is supposed to be, but some of his lines are very good. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the main bad thing about this movie I hated was Tim Avery's voice when he was owned by the mask. The voice is terrible. The screens he is in are so unique that they are almost unbearable. I'm sure they could have cut him, and that won't affect the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Overall, you can live without seeing it. It's a nice movie to see if you have nothing else to look at. They could have gone without making the successor, but it is a decent effort. 10/04
