Even with its low budget, this movie could be worth checking out a story to tell here. It started out pretty well, and reasonably engaging and credible. The actors and characters were interesting, although there wasn't much character development. My favorite scene was when they all eat their rations. Some hated it, and some thought it wasn't bad. The story starts very airtight. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then it plunged into a small horror that is usually a death sentence for most science. Suddenly no scientific basis for any of these things. No real credible endgame for the villain? No real explanation of what is going on. Generally, if a movie has to use the F word for every other word, it usually also comes from there. I still believe it is offensive or not. I often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi? Isn't there a universe of wonderfully good stories out there? Don't make people feel they are wasting their time and everyone is different when they pour out things like this. Why do we get so much mediocre science like this? No female actors / characters? Not at all? It was the intention to be another "Predator" but fell too far. <br /> <br /> My final comment - poor editing and ultimately too low a budget to build a real campfire? What gives? <br /> <br /> My advice for any low-budget film production companies out there. Make sure you have a good story before you start, and point out bad special effects. It's better that we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculous.
