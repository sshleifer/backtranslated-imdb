I'm just writing this review because I'm a big fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and was shocked by the movie. <br /> <br /> I think if you didn't read the book, you would have lost the movie, as it didn't give Wurtzel a real backdrop. There was no mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at the summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she had never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling). ). If you read the book, you would be confused by the amount of editing that took place. <br /> <br /> I saw the book as a lively representation of depression, highlighting Wurtzel's low points and the experiences she had on the go. However, the film started at Harvard and literally threw the public without any real explanation of what was going on. <br /> <br /> Events that were important in the book (such as Wurtzel's miscarriage, her summer work in Dallas, her suicide attempt while she was on Prozac) left the film. <br /> <br /> It's also pedant, but Wurtzel didn't lose her virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt shown in Sterling's office was completely different from the book. For starters, she was actually exaggerated at Mellaril, as opposed to the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, if I read this book and enjoyed it With that, don't look at the movie. Read 'More, Now, Weather' (in the same author). Or look at Girl, Interrupted. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature was the performance of Anne Heche, which I believe Dr Sterling portrays. Christina Ricci was also good, although her performance seemed a bit .... Jessica Lange looked pleasant, but saw the opposite of how Wurtzel's mother is described in the book. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Don't bother.
