Ugly women-of-the-cell flashes the bottom of the midnight flask, combining quirky sleaze with the largest of girls-in-the-shower clich√©s. Linda Blair plays an innocent jail sentence (we are constantly learning that she was involved in the running of a guy with her car), with hard work in the Big House with some of the most beautiful characters this side of a Russ Meyer photo. Blair is constantly poached, beaten, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is disgusting throughout the four-letter word, and the movie does not make any mention of its obstruction of violence and stupidity. However, some viewers regard it as a classical camp, but perhaps his tongue is not far enough in the cheek. * of ****
