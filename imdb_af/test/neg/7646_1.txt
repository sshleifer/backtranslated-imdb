Apparently the movie has a hard anti-Bush message ... If it does (I didn't get it), that's all it is. It's boring and useless. Period. It's too serious sometimes to be a comedy, too slow to be excited, not funny, not tempting, not exciting, not movie. It's all about being the opposite, and vice versa. I was surprised at how bad a movie can suck. Don't even think about viewing it. <br /> <br /> I literally watched hundreds of movies, and I was never so compelled to write a warning on IMDb. Avoid at all costs. You're warned. <br /> <br /> Even "Making ..." is painfully boring. It's just people talking gibberish to many inside jokes in front of a camera, like a home movie. There is even a section where a man takes you on a tour of the food that the movie manages on the set. Still, the movie I think strikes ...
