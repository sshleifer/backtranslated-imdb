James Marsh's The King is a film that disturbs me. I can't imagine what it meant to be. It's a story about a young man named Elvis, played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who after 3 years of naval service gets an honorable resignation and then goes to his biological father and finds himself dishonest with him and his family. It's all really sick. Elvis worms his way into the family by seducing his 16-year-old sister Malerie (Pell James). It is quite impossible to identify with anyone in this movie from here in the middle of England. Preacher Father and leaping joyful Christian congregation; I couldn't figure out if the movie meant to despise them for their unconcerned beliefs. Or the target is the happy family and we are meant to think it is unreliable. OR just say that some people are lost and only hell is devastated. It's level. We all know that bad things happen; The interesting bit is to learn why, but this film just shows a violent violence without ever unraveling the thoughts that led to it. "The King" is such a lost opportunity. There are some very interesting questions about honor; the warrior code; the changing concepts of valor; honor murders in Indian families and so on. Honor is a very varied concept. But this film adds nothing more to the idea. However, Paul did the projection more than indicated his slender role. The DVD projector showed all the movies in a green only color and the only way to fix it was to send it to Belgium. He did this by Christmas. I think the postal workers and the repairers and Paul were far beyond the call and our reward was this dull film. But you can see it differently?
