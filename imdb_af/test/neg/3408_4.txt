Solange is not a wonderful Italian thriller. Get ready for the spoiler - the chief suspect, the professor, didn't. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know he couldn't have been the killer from the beginning; He and a student saw the first murder. So, there is absolutely no tension about whether or not the professor is the killer. There is a long, tedious build up to the final explanation of the mystery. The solution is interesting, but it doesn't come from anywhere. The rest of the movie (and it's not a short movie) just isn't exciting enough to keep your interest. Even in the tradition of a wrong man accused, it fails because the police never seriously accuse the professor and the murderer is never after him. Dull, boring, boring.
