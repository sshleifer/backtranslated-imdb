How sad it is when a movie moves as wonderfully as "Jurassic Park" slowly in the cut and mediocre area throughout its franchise. The latest successor, Jurassic Park III, did not think of characters, a story or pretty much a script, and rather rely on non-stop dinosaur action, which is not exciting or very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology. After 7 years of CGI progress, it just gives you the feeling that the movie has been pumped out for the summer that only relies on its name. Introducing a pterodactile does not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> See again "Shrek". <br /> <br />
