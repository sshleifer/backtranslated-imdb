I saw this movie when it first appeared in the theater. We all look forward to reviving Mark Hamill's career, but we came out because we didn't bother. Many people walked out after about half an hour - I wish I did too. The basic premise seems okay, but the plot was ridiculously involved and bad, and halfway through. It's totally irrevocable, not a movie you want to pay to watch. If you are really bored and it is on TV, it will help you kill for a few hours (or to nod you off!). 10/02
