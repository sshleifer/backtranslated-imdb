I was disappointed with the follow-up of the Swan Princess. I can see what they are trying to do with the story, show how married life went for Odette and Derek, but the story was not interesting enough to keep my attention and it covered the bases of the original. <Br /> <br /> It's not funny. The only bit I found was when Jean-Bob became a prince and then back in a frog and nobody saw it. He tried to convince them that it really did. <br /> <br /> The villain is rubbish and the animation isn't as impressive as the first movie. <br /> <br /> The Queen is a very annoying character and instead of cheering Derek to save his mother, you hope the villain spells her voice box to talk to her. <br /> <br /> It's a pity I really enjoyed the first movie, but it didn't meet my expectations.
