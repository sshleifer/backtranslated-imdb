If you live in the suburbs, it's relatively good financially and doesn't have much contact with England's city life, then it's the comedy for you. Not something that a mass audience is going to do, but if you are like these characters, they show you will keep it in pieces. Overall it is a comedy that snobs at the BBC will sit back and laugh for their pleasure and just a few of the public. Compare it to BBC Comedys such as just fools and horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder and other classical artists. This series tends to drive and deliver the BBC's regular product to the audience in somewhat of a folk culture.
