20 people classified this 10! That ballot box was better filled than a Christmas turkey! Talking about turkeys, here is a traditional story that hopes to haunt the current poker craze - without success. It is totally in linear jump, and if I say "tell," I mean to kill, let this movie never be a picture enough if words can be used. <br /> <br /> Stu Unger's childhood fascination with maps and his associations with hoodlums may sound like interesting movie material, but the director succeeds in sucking life out of them. At no time did I feel the least compassion for Unger, a genius on cards that threw everything away on other forms of gambling with which he was not so skilled. This, of course, leads to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, family loss, and ultimately its salvation (kind of), as we blow through THREE musical settings. Great yawn!
