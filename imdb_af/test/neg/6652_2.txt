I can't believe I watched this whole movie. Another "Ishtar" waiting to get it better, which never happened. The sound is awful, going too low to hear the conversations, blowing the sound in seconds. The plot is absolutely unquestionable, the acting is mediocre, although Keaton does his usual good work as a mental issue, although it is played in the role, can certainly be considered a negative. The director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, medicine, science or anything of a technical nature. "Socio" ???? I wonder how they came to the diagnosis? There are so many mistakes, goofs and things that are wrong with this movie that if they were to list all, it might be a kind of record. Demerol as a general anesthetic? A motorcyclist on the highway with a non-DOT / Fast off-road helmet. San Francisco ??? Paper walls move as they are typed, helmets appear just from the sky, rifles show one direction but hit things in another, lighting appears and disappears and there is hardly a scene in the move that doesn't contain a kind of error. My wife, who is an RN in an Oncology unit, eventually left the room so upset about all the medical flaws before the end of the film. I just gave it a 2 because of Keaton's play, otherwise it would definitely have a 1.
