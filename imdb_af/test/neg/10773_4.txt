I'm not entirely sure I agree with the director of this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I suggested Sir Percy Blakeney a very calm, seemingly lazy aristocrat. This particular Sir Percy Blakeney seems to be overwhelming with overwhelming energy and volatility. I didn't see the Houdini, James Bond. Mission Impossible style escaped by Sir Percy. In previous versions, white was the escape tool, not technology. Also the characters of Marguerite and Chauvelin are not adequately portrayed. There was little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters. <br /> <br /> I don't want to blame because maybe the reason for my aversion to this movie might be just a matter of difference in interpretation. If the director's interpretation coincided with mine, perhaps I might not have been irritated by what my bad character depictions looked like. <br /> <br /> I prefer the 1982 version. Anthony Andrews was quite effective as the incorruptible, calm FOP. So was Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. The style of this period seems to me lost with this last adjustment. I recommend keeping to the previous versions, either the one from 1934 or the one from 1982. <br /> <br />
