While posting this note, IMDb currently calculates Alfred Hitchcock's subpar Saboteur a 7.3 / 10. Personally, I rated it less than half of it. Honestly, I can't tell how a movie this bad could have come from what is probably the most consistent good director I know of. I saw about 10 other Hitch movies from the 30's to the 60's. Vertigo has so far been my favorite favorite while Saboteur is easily the worst. It's hard to believe that 7 years earlier, Hitch used the same formula in The 39 Steps much more skillfully. My recommendation would be to rather see it and avoid it like the plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie I have turned to the end and have no desire to go back and see the rest. If you have to look, rent or borrow it. Don't make the mistake I did and buy the DVD on good faith, earn by Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear Window, etc. Even a master sometimes screws up, I think. EDIT: Maybe I was a little harder on this movie than I should have been. It's definitely nowhere near Ed Wood or Manos or something, but there are three reasons I feel I should rate it so low: <br /> <br /> 1) The name "Hitchcock" brings some quality expectations. This film delivers on some of them, but they are overshadowed by the darn near the non-sensual plot. <br /> <br /> 2) I want to compensate a little for all the 8+ ratings this movie gets. Hitchcock is like the John Coltrane of directors. True fans will find reasons to consider something of a work of art, but the high rating on IMDb gives more casual movie enthusiasts the impression that this movie is much better than it actually is. <br /> <br /> 3) I spent $ 18 on it. Maybe if it costs me $ 5 or even $ 10, I'll probably be a bit less bitter. ;)
