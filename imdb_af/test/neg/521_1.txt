Drilling, ridicule and stupid "Submerged" is a waste of time. The shooting ranges were a joke, real people didn't just cover up with a cover, hopefully to be shot first! So many things wrong or bad, not worth listing, except one big mistake. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of L.A. and the water is 100ft deep ??? Even at that time, none of the people would have survived the decompression to push 100ft of water pressure for over 20 hours when they were educated. Just a terrible one.
