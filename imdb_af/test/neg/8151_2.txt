Gave it two stars because the DVD cover was good enough to make me buy. I paid a dollar for it at the local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have some good movies (at least I think they are good) that have never seen the inside of a video store. After I saw it, I was very insulted by it. Light years worse than anything I've ever seen, I can't even recommend it as a camping joke. It's so bad, instead of letting you laugh, make you angry. How did this terrible movie find any kind of distro? I can only believe it is self-propagated as the amateur DVD writer would suggest. Getting the producers of this "movie" out of business makes it obvious that you have no talent.
