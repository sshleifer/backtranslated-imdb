I read a lot of reviews on the IMDb (already five of those written at the time I write it) and I'm amazed at the amount of praise on The Brideless Groom, which is undoubtedly one of the smaller comedies performed by the Stooges. I prefer the parent where it was Larry, Curly and Tired, although Shemp gets credit for most of the funny scenes in Sing a Song or Six Pants, another Stooges short that is just moderately amusing, but much better than Groom. Indeed, there is a slightly amusing scene in the film, the "Don't-hit-a-lady" scene, which is almost amusing and is 15 minutes in the film. Not very promising in a 17-minute comedy. <br /> <br /> Shemp is a voice trainer whose uncle is dead and left him a $ 500,000 inheritance, provided he marries within 48 hours, taking short notice as it is, but by the time Shemp learns about it, he only has 7 hours left. This is a premonition that was previously done and rediscovered, but it wasn't, I think, a massive clich√© when the film was made, as it is now. There is a series of gags throughout the film. None of them are even near the level of comedy for which the Three Stooges are so widely known. It looks like the Stooges are in the same hardships that have harassed so many of Shirley Temple's films? There is too little reliance on content and too much confidence, just because they are there. <br /> <br /> The standard features of the Stooges are here, Moe is the average one whose meanness is definitely not used. Thrifty in this movie, and the slapstick sound effects (though with more exceptions than usual) are pretty amusing, but are tackled in their standard slots in this movie. The line "Keep hands, your love birds" is immortal. The rest of the movie is not. <br /> <br /> There are many talks among the other people who reviewed this movie for this site if it is one of the best of the Stooges shorts, which you will not find. the best since the early 30s shorts. It's just not true. I can certainly understand some of the automatic respect for milestone classics and the giants of early comedy, which the Three Stooges are definitely, but it respects respect if poor films are more praised than they should be. The Bridegroom deserved some respect because it was a Stooges movie, but for the same reason it had to be better. The Three Stooges were just better than that.
