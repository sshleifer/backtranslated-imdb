I didn't like this movie for many reasons - VERY BORN! It was interesting how they thought the future would look like, but I was very bored to watch it. There was almost no action. Although the classic orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The visuals were very creative. When this movie appears on TV, I feel the station is changing immediately. Not because it's a bad movie, just because I know what I'm involved with when I watch it - complete and total boredom. This is a movie I saw when I was young, but I never came to the science fiction thing ... because it simply wasn't real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic. Anyway, I never understood half of the movie.
