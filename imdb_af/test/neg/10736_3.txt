I think this movie doesn't have much content, it's not even worth a discussion. <br /> <br /> First of all, the package is really disgusting. Especially the stereotype filming and photography. Certainly, Joe Dante's film style was appropriate and interesting in "Gremlins" and "Small Soldiers". I mean the imaginative and visual, narrative storytelling of a Spielberg wunderkind (I really loved these movies), but in "Homecoming" it was a complete failure. Attacks of toy soldiers and furry creatures are simply not comparable to zombie invasions (dead, smelly, rotten creatures trying to kill life - without any logical reason, just because they hate them). <br /> <br /> Zombie movie is characteristic of simple, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Nothing to see in Joe Dante's debut. Another point is the annoying content: really stupid dialogue between the two main characters, a horrific exploitation of the "older brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized" and bad acting. And by the way, "Homecoming" isn't scary or greedy - and even less entertaining. You see, it's not even a horror movie. <br /> <br /> In the decade of their birth - it was the end of the 60's / early 70's - zombie movies were revolutionary, challenging (especially through its gruesome, explicit content) and subtle social critic. The original Zombie movie was actually a midnight movie called "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). This one was a low budget movie covering so many controversial themes. It's hard to name them all: a visual style of Hitchcock / Raimi, the American lifestyle of the 70s, political sincerity, the upcoming breakthrough of human rights of blacks and even more emerging racism due to conservative Americans (remember shooting the black main character at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and would like to learn more about the most important things, I recommend you: "Midnight Movies: From the Margin to Mainstream". <br /> <br /> So get away from "Homecoming" and even so from Romero's "Land of Death".
