Scanning through the comments, there doesn't seem to be much love for this movie, and it is not very difficult to see why it is dirty. <br /> <br /> Now I will begin to say that the finished Product has been hurt in any number of ways by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr Loomis) in post production. It required a repeat of the film's conclusion with Loomis who bought the farm and kept it supposed to end a double turn with Micheal's mysterious "Man in Black" swaps and I don't mean Johnny Cash. /> <br /> Now to the story. The fifth film ended slightly unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers escaping from prison with the mysterious black man. It appears that this man knows the origin of Micheal's evil and is also a colleague of Dr Loomis named Dr Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in sections 4 and 5 but played here by JC Brandy). Jamie, pregnant, escapes from dr. Wynn's army and so Micheal follows her and kills her. But she had the child, so now he has to cut off the baby so he can kill his big cousin. <br /> <br /> We hear a little ridiculous explanation of Micheal's evil that includes Gaelic curses, bloodline and mysterious symbols. A radio show is broadcast for some reason from Micheal's hometown. This gives Micheal even more impotent victims. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie, like this review, is vague, confusing and pointless with a very anti-climatic end. <br /> <br /> Some sex scenes and nudity. Poor plot, tradable effects, with a few good runs from the shooter dead, but lacking in motivation. For what was supposed to explain everything, it just raised new questions, made parts 4 and 5 pointless and was a poor way for a good actor in Pleasance to end his life and career.
