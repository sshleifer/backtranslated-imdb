Skeletons In The Closet, father-teen son takes genre to new levels of low. This is a movie that serves no purpose. The plot was laid out in the first few minutes, there is no tension, the characters are clich√© and despite plot twists trying to confuse and obscure, everything plays exactly as you think. Halfway through the movie I could no longer leave the snail's pace and quickly began to move forward. The movie ends exactly as I expected. Linda Hamilton is fantastic as always and the other actors are above average as there is a complete lack of direction. If you really believe that you should see this uninspired, shiny wannabe whodunit, look ahead quickly.
