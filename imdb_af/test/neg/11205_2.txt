Look, this movie is terrible ... the "plot" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and in the care of babies and babysitters, all of whom the children run away are completely stupid. Eventually, the children's engineer, Beverly D'Angelo, is an ex-convinced to be their new nanny, don't you care why? And D'Angelo looks at a TV talk show about selling children and decides she'll sell the twins ... and, oh, you don't want to know. It's all very unpleasant, and not funny at all. In fact, the announcer dated this movie before it was on the TV channel I watched! Don't bother wasting a moment of your life on this pile of complete scraps, right?
