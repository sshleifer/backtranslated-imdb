POSSIBLE LESS SPOILER <br /> <br /> It's not a terrible objective review, but I just found this movie terribly depressed. Like many of Russell T. Davies's <br /> <br /> work, it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) flames in hopes of chance and perseverance even after the apparent defeat. These lifting themes were strangely absent here. I think the fact that I'm still thinking about it is proof of the quality of the program, but the resolution was just too pale for my taste. <br /> <br /> However, I disagree with the reviews I have read and complain that the end is "being tackled". I think every conclusion follows logically from his point of view and the end represents a healthy personal conviction that solved only the primary theme of the show. While I never really questioned the progress of events, I felt there was a lot that could be expanded on. I also read that it was originally considered a quadruple series instead of two, and it is possible that the bullying did a bit of damage to the finished piece. However, these errors appear throughout, in series and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketchy. <br /> <br /> To his credit Davies is completely indifferent to writing big, and you must admire the beauty and scale of it. project. The point of departure here is the things of movies or novels? It's a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television. Strong points include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively mesmeric. For me, he was and remains the best reason to look. The portrayal of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant, thought-provoking and alluring and a real credit for both Davies's writing and Eccleston's play. I also thought the portrayal of the modern world's response to the Second Coming had come true. <br /> <br /> So, two stars just because I personally want to entertain my entertainment. I'd rather be excited or at least distracted by my fiction. I have a very big real world around me? as filtered by CNN or the newspapers - if I choose to be terribly depressed. There are certainly fewer subjective reasons for judging this piece, but I fear that my judgment in this case is clouded by my emotional response.
