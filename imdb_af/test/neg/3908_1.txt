About five years ago my friend and I went to the video rental shop to see something. My friend saw Space Truckers on the shelf, and so we got it. Once we got home and started to look, we realized what an absolute crap was! A beer can float in space? A man taking a shower in a toilet? A man with a mechanical dick trying to make a woman wake up by saying, "Whiz, whiz!"? WTF !!! The stupidest, dumbest, most delayed, terrible throne together with a piece of trash has ever been exposed to my eyes. My friend and I still refer it to the worst movie we've ever seen. Just one other movie came close to its crappiness (and that would be the stupid Jackie Chan movie, The Medalion). If you see this piece of junk on the shelf at your video store, then proceed as follows: 1. Remove it from the shelf and throw it on the ground. 2. Stump it for at least 30 seconds. 3. Continue burning it in an alienated facility (bathroom stall). 4. Lastly, take it immediately to your local hazardous waste management department so that it can be handled properly. <br /> <br /> Stay away from "Space Watchers" !!!!!!!!
