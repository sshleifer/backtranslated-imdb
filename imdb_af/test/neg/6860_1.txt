From the beginning I enjoyed watching Lost and endured some bad actors in poorly written episodes, because when Lost is good, it's really good! But this episode that Mr. Echos's downfall contained so many drawn scenes, with immersive watches of bad acting. I caught myself on the fast forward button. This episode is by far the worst. In fact, the difference in quality of Lost was so contradictory. I often find myself wondering how many writers they use. <br /> <br /> I will continue to watch, but hope things get better and hope I stop secretly wishing for the sub-par actors in the series to die.
