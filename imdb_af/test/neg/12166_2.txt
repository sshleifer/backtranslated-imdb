OK, I'm really into King's things, but it's just scary. The whole movie, I'm waiting for the main character to do something with his new youth and strength. I can endure the worst movies, because anything is better than watching a movie clip with ads in it. but it takes the cake. I gave it a 2, and I would never recommend it to anyone.
