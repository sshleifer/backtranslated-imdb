This movie has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. There is a reason why it was made to be a MOW (movie of the week). The continuity was wrong (palm trees in a Chicago area, although filmed in Toronto, Canada), the consequences were still to be expected for the year 2004. HELLO. "Lord of the Rings" had better CGI than that. But I think they also had the money for it. The budget will definitely affect the outcome, but anyone who calls this MOW more than 2 should return to the Film and TV School. Next time remember that care and time does not hit a classic rush for a tornado box office or TV smash hit. <br /> <br /> Also, I know networks can use footage from old networks or affiliates, but using 80's material for 2004? I have a hard time buying it.
