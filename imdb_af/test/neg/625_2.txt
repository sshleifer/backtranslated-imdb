When I was 8 years old and going through my Marx Brothers phase, my dad read in the TV guide that they showed the Marx Brothers movie, The Big Store, late in the Friday night, and the video recorder has it for me. place. When I woke up on Saturday, I undoubtedly had a bug in the TV guide - my dad and I discovered "The Story of the Humanity" instead recorded. <br /> <br /> "The Big Store" was probably one of the least funny of all Marx Brothers movies and yet it is one of the best cinema artists compared to "The Story of the Humanity. " I can almost justify the TV guide's fault, because Marx brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo - appear in both movies. Although they are divided into 'The Story of Mankind', they are divided into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays a guy who speaks to Christopher Columbus and plays Harpo Isaac Newton ????? Harpo's scene lasts about half an hour; Chico has only two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least funny, but terribly racially sensitive by today's standards. The rest of the movie does not carry. They pulled out some of the best actors of the day and called them total garbage. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology. <br /> <br /> For the record: "The Big Store" has a wonderful little physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates, and some songs by Virginia O'Brien. I really look forward to seeing it.
