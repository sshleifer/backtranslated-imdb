I thought this movie might be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead, it was more like something that someone in high school would make with their parents' video camera. It was not just the low budget that made this movie bad (very good movies were made on a low budget), it was just a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be a good camp. Case in point: for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except that the 3 main characters are sitting in their room smoking, sitting their makeup and then answering a call. You are waiting for something to move the story, but it never comes. The sound was so bad that I had to turn the TV all the way to just say what they said (which wasn't interesting at all). If I pay to rent a movie, I will usually suffer from it, even if it is bad, but that was all I could do to sit for 20 minutes. The person seems to have felt the same way in front of me because they did not rewind the tape and left out the same place I did. The only reason I gave it a score of 1 is because the rating system doesn't have negative numbers.
