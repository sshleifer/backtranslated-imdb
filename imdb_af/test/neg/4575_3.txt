Before I talk, I would like to make a few things clear. . 2) I just picked this one because I'm a Fichtner fangirl looking to see him in a bath. 3) I'm not a Demi fan, although I think her performances in "Immortal" and "A few Good Men" were sublime and earned places in my vid library. I also think she's a little crazy. sleep with Brucie). <br /> <br /> If it is a character study of an unfinished woman living double lives of independence and happiness, then I want to say we have one narcoleptic melodrama. Marty: Literary Agent. Make 6-digit salary. Living in an exclusive Manhattan penthouse. Easy for her to read a few hundred manuscripts and fall asleep on her desk for a highly suggested nightly escape. Or maybe you go through an interdepartmental portal? She has the career, the look, a cool car, a good road, where is the man and children? In step, our son Aaron, a true escape. What are architects? They are artists who can do math, dreamers who make real money. Aaron gives Marty the dream of security and fills a void where she obviously has no confidence. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the coin is Marie, still her schoolgirl fantasies, as she flees through motherhood. Her children are her career and life. But how about Marie, is she just through her children? In walks, William, a Parisian stranger who helps her draw her attention to the one thing she's lost to herself. <br /> <br /> A suspected journey of self-discovery and a lifetime of anxiety is a bit of resentment on Marty / Marie's own mother. It gets a 3/10. All I can say is thank you for the BPL multimedia department. I won't waste $ 2.99 at Blockbuster, but it will be a Harlequin Blaze title.
