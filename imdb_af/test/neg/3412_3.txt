After watching the first movie in BCI's new Aztec Mummy Collection, it's hard to believe how excited I was about the set and how upset I was when the release time was pushed back. I've watched many Mexican horror over the past few months. Very good? The curse of the crying woman. Some entertainment despite clear errors ?? Night of the bloody monkeys. And some cheesy ?? Choose any Santo movie. One thing that all these movies have in common is that no-one can be called "boring". Well, that's not the case with The Aztec Mummy. It was a while, because I last looked at something that slept like that. I didn't hope for or expect a good movie, but at least stick to it. The Aztec Mummy takes every situation that can be interesting and battles life through repeated scenes of people who do nothing and then expand the scene for what is like an eternity. I think that's what happens if you make an 80 minute movie with just 30 minutes of material. Padding extraordinaire! For example, for anyone who has seen the movie, what purpose does the Bat have but to bring a masked wrestler type to the screen and extend the runtime by 15 or so useless minutes? <br /> <br /> I just hope the other two movies in The Collection are more entertaining than this one.
