A very bad movie, an amalgam of clich√©s and historical inaccuracies. Some examples: In an early scene Soviet infantry is attacked by the Germans; Instead of staying in their trenches, they shoot on open ground to fight them, unlike all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the central characters, is presumably the daughter of a Belarusian and obsessed with her Russian, but she doesn't speak Russian; A guilty German airman is attacking an air rifle. However, the rifle does not break scraper scallops, but gets a direct hit on its plane, which doesn't look much like a German World War II aircraft. In fairness, if they could escape the preliminary plot and the resulting absurdities there, there are really powerful moments. The depiction of people who are slowly dying is convincingly done and moving, but it just shows the rest of it even more. A movie to be avoided.
