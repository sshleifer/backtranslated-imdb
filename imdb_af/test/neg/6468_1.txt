I'm really losing how someone can give this movie a 10 (or even more than 2!). It's full of bad lines, bad acting, bad play, etc. I never thought I could do worse than the purposeful bad plays at the start of UHF, but it was. And just when you think it might not get worse, it does! Over and over! You could actually have watched it in a theater? It wasn't worth being free on TV! My 4 year old and 1 year old loved it, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never there.
