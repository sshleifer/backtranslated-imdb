Quentin Tarantino's partner in crime Roger Avary (co-author on "Pulp Fiction") goes out on his own (QT is performing executive this time) for this over-cooked French thriller. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is Zed, an extraordinary security cracker who drove to France from the US at the request of an old friend. There he boasts a moderate crew of hippies, who, with little or no planning, think they can break down a safe full of knockers on a French national subject. <br /> <br /> Avary has gone the wrong theme that Tarantino developed so well in "Reservoir Dogs", just "Killing Zoe" is not good enough to survive on the strength of this alone, so Avary threw in a pretty lovely distraction. Julie Delpy is Zoe, a student comes to call girl Zed at his arrival in Paris. She is definitely a wonderful diversion, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> I think our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but unfortunately the move didn't help to add the depth that was desperate for his shallow plot. needed. There was never a story in this idea, it was nothing more, an idea. Even the surreal journey into the cunning dive of Paris is uninspiring. I think it must be conceded that there was never much of a movie in the story of a lot of gangsters shooting at each other over a blocked jewel case, that is until you add complicated characters and funny dialogue. "Reservoir Dogs" had it, "Killing Zoe" didn't. <br /> <br /> Stoltz's strong interpretation of the dubious Zed and Jean Hughes-Anglade's crazy portrayal of the obsessive ringleader, does nothing to uplift proceedings. In short, Avary unsuccessfully tried to defend entertainment from nothing. <br /> <br /> Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theater
