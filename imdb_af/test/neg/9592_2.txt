This movie contains 7.0 ratings on IMDb, so even I felt something rotten in his synopsis, I decided to try it out. What a waste of 100 minutes. First, the 80s were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre. Most of these were badly done in those days with a fool plot (if they had any), so there is very little that can stick out, and even if they were good, they are still not very good. The Hit, however, suffers from all that foolish crime photographs make stupid. It has poor character development, unlikely plot and is not written or directed properly, and if you have such shortcomings, the acting does not help. Stephen Frears has often tried to emulate French new wave in English style filmmaking and the two do not agree. <br /> <br /> First, Terence Stamp is hiding for 10 years because he has witnessed some of his former crime partners. He hides in Spain, from all places. He's finally caught up, and if kidnapped by a group of foolishly looking Spanish thugs, you just have to drive a little far to the two hits that are going to work with him. These two are John Hurt, who is supposed to be boiled, a cold killer, and Tim Roth (in his first role) as the devil's pupil. They do not immediately murder Stamp, they first dispose of the "three Amigos", they should not be rented in the first place, and then they drive Stamp to Paris because one of the friends he testified wants to confront him. OK, it's possible. But even with the stamp of such a dangerous figure that they had to offend four guys to overpower him, they did not tie him down, did not make him disqualified and drove with him, as he was one of the friends. Stamp does not object and fortunately goes to Paris to be shot, and not use one of a half dozen chances. This "professional" offers him to escape. If it turns out that Tim Roth is just a schoolboy bully, he makes the notion of a big crime boss working with a hard core hit like John Hurt, even more unlikely, especially on a major job like that. teamed up. But if John Hurt himself is not that hard, he spends twenty minutes of the movie, killing or killing the entire Australian surplus, played by Bill Hunter, whose only purpose in this movie is to make the sweet Laura Del Sol, she mistress (who he says is 15, but she looks more like 25) and whose role in the story and acting ability suggests that she is offered the role solely on the basis of the then director or producer's mistress. After much deliberation, Hurt killed the Australian, but took his mistress for no apparent reason. If he wants to kill her, but Roth with his "subtle ways", don't convince him, so even she kicks him, bites him and scratches him through the whole movie, he stays true to that deeply buried human side of him. <Br /> <br /> If you have ordinary idiotic scenes, such as when Hurt and Roth close the car from outside, try to prevent people from coming inside?!?! Anyway, the movie pulls on. Tim Roth falls asleep, keeps Terence Stamp with his rifle on his chest, and Stamp just waits there to watch the waterfall. Then the whole link of a plot comes to the point where everything we saw in the last hour and 20 minutes just goes out of the window. Let's repeat, the whole point of not immediately killing Stamp (except for having a movie) is to take him to Paris, so his former partner is a last word with him. And the whole point in him that doesn't run away is that he's willing to die and say, "It's just a moment. We're here. Then we're not here. We're somewhere else ... maybe. And It's obviously like breathing. Why should we be scared? "But my friends, here's where the plot turns, Hurt kills the man while he's still in Spain. And we ask why storage for and driving around for days, he could have done it in the first 15 minutes and contrary to his philosophy. Stamp is very scared to be murdered, so we ask again why did he not run, and he had a lot of chance. Roth is also murdered, but he must not be in the movie at all, and Del Sol, well, she has a role in this movie, purely for romantic (read sexual) reasons. So she lives alive again, even she attacked Hurt. 15th time in the movie. He killed everyone else, but not her, she must have the maximum screen appearance. The film is made on a shoe strip budget and it shows, but if you have no story and cardboard features, it is even more displayed. And yes, Fernando Ray appears and goes through the movie as the guest, with a single audible line of dialogue. terrible
