Normally I don't like Chuck Norris movies. I appreciate his work as a martial artist, and his battle scenes are usually pretty good-choreographed. Chuck is undoubtedly one of those martial artists. So, in my local bookshop, I found a movie I haven't seen before and taken it home. <br /> <br /> While the play in this movie was worse than most Chuch Norris movies, I was hoping to see at least one battle scene. I quickly realized that it was not a typical Chuch Norris movie; rather, it was a Christian movie that wiped out the paradigm of good will. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing on the packaging to indicate that it is a Christian film, except the label. .. Goodtimes Entertainment, I've never heard before. I will definitely keep this in mind the next time I see a movie from that company. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with Christianity ... I have a problem with sneaky proselytizing. If someone is going to make a religious film, it has at least the good sense to indicate to the viewer that this is what they will get. The only saving part of the exercise is that I spent just $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes watching a great martial artist who's not fighting. At least it was during dinner, and I spent some of that food and food. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts movie, and not a lot of hope, don't T like this movie because it doesn't even offer it.
