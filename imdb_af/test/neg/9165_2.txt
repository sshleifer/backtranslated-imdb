I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after I loved the cartoon in my childhood, and it almost destroyed that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the film, is scary. I understand it can't be easy to act with CGI characters that aren't actually there, but I really found his performance satisfactory, along with all the other non-animated characters. The chipmunks were spectacular, but sometimes blatantly obvious to shift the story of the story, so I did not ask me to stay in the movie for more than half an hour. If you feel like watching this movie, rent it at most. It is NOT eight dollars to see it in theaters unless you want a good laugh at the horrible acting.
