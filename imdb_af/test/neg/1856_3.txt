In the next Dylan Moran's star of the particular bookshop owner in the surrealistic sitcom Black Books, I could see that his comic potential is begging to be used in theater or larger films. The first big screen ruling in a leading role (he had a como like Rufus's thief in Notting Hill) had promises, but like the tense Steve Coogan vehicle, The Parole Officer, he had too many skins that had to be ironed out. . Preproduction. <br /> <br /> The plot is so complicated that I won't repeat the finer details (the font has every character for us), and the laugh comes from the show-in jokes. Michael Caine is a pumpkin who already has a production of Richard III. He's been updated to Nazi occupation (one of the few real laughs, a satirical jab at Ian McKellen), in which everybody does the Hitler salute when they take the stage. Dylan convinces that acting action itself must be a conceptual act, the two plots to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters through their acting ability. There is confusion (both on the screen and in the audience), there is a romantic sub-plot between Dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters blah blah blah and Dylan gets smaller dresses and makes funny accents. Michael Caine gives a few choices, and Dylan's comic timing is on the money, so why isn't it good? It does have a special charm that you expect from Film 4, but it also has a cheerful girl acting as a compass in a confused and irrelevant plot - a no-no in screenwriting 101. The exhibition overshadows everything else. You just want Moran and Caine to act as comic foil on each other as they were initially, but when they are together to the end, the mating has lost its charism. <br /> <br /> The actors are amusing, though unnecessary. If it arrives during a rainy Tuesday afternoon, you must be with you. Otherwise you would be better off watching or renting your old Black Books videos.
