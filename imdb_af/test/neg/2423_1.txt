Coach Preachy or Straight Sappy. It's bad writing combined w / even worse acting. You can choose to drink the Gatorade from this aftercare, but I don't have a motivating moment, even at the 20th Toby Robbins / Islander philosophy. It's too much attitude to be entertaining and not substantive enough to be informative. I respect the coach and the program this movie is inspired by, but the move itself is terrible. Since someone has been playing rugby in the States for almost 20 years, I was hoping for a better rugby movie (even one that was debauchery). And I can tell you that the Haka, run by a lot of Haoles and Islanders, is not intimidating (much like when seen by the All Blacks, serious boys, all of them, it's time to put it away) . If you want real intimidation, get it right from a lot of South Africans (the actual obvious suspects of rugby). It's a fake and bad movie about being a real and good person.
