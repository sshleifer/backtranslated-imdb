This movie can't decide what it is - a soft porn or a sf movie. Not enough plot for a real movie, but far too much for a porn. <br /> <br /> In a galaxy far, a good princess (we know she is good because she wears long blonde hair, wears a white gown, is polite, and becomes capricious about her dying mom when we see her first) inherit the kingdom over her older sister, who is angry (and we know it is wearing dark hair and wearing too much makeup, abusing her male sexual slaves, cutting and curling her lip all the time and talk about the horrors she will do if she is queen. The evil princess gets upset and tries to make a coup, but the good sister gets away to Earth. Of course, she is blown naked in a bar during a wet T-shirt match. It's really going down from there. The play is ridiculous, the dialogue sounds like it was written for a porn and the general storyline is ridiculous. There is not even enough skin to make the kind of person who sees it for the skin happy. I love "good" bad movies, and it's not even nice on a "bad movie" level.
