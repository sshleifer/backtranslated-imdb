It would be wrong and reprehensible to advise me to see Killjoy 2, you have to do better things, blow the car, throw bricks into a stream, but at the same time it is as terrible as you probably think it is. It's almost a decent movie, which can manage much more than most straight DVD slips. Killjoy 2 is greatly helped by Trent Haaga's manic turn as the eponymous fool, throwing himself in the role with such a swollen rejection that he almost wins the scales in the movie's favor, but of course it takes more than one man in big shoes. Tammi Sutton has been the most entertaining director since Roger Corman in Creation from the Ghost, and the whole thing is almost destroyed by the rushed, pure end. Over the place and almost good fun.
