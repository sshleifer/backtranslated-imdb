Bela Lugosi is a real mystery. In the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in Dracula. Still, he made decisions about his career time and time again. Perhaps he had a bad agent, maybe his drinking and drug use had a role in it or maybe he was just crazy. Regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in virtually any movie - ranging from excellent horror movies (such as the RAVEN) to large-scale aircraft (such as NINOTCHKA) to the Z-movie for the cheapest and flyhalf of studios. Interestingly, although he agreed to do this horrible movie, he actually switched off the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN! Regarding this movie, it is a very stupid and a hearing-produced propaganda movie that contains a dumb plot and miserable editing. Lugosi spends a lot of the sabotage murder film - not a bad thing at all. But in the end we find out that he himself is a Nazi plastic surgeon and all the American men he killed were actually Japanese !! The funniest part of this is during a flashback. You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before he changes to American men. When the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But on all the other non-on-shots, they're all VERY Western-looking - many with bald heads !! They looked absolutely nothing like Japanese men. I suspect that the plot had to undergo a re-write and that might be the obvious mistake. Or, it can only be clumsy production values ​​and editing. In fact, early in the movie they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (about 1942) are old Model T Ford - of course from stock images !!! The bottom line is that the movie is bad, but also very boring. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM OUTSIDE SPACE, it is difficult to laugh at the dissatisfaction - just slept on it.
