Where to start, where to start .... hmmm ... Well, how about some of the tightest, most unnatural, incredible and crafted performances you can imagine? What about stereotypical characters, situations and places? Or what about a manipulative, cloying, totally miserable script? I can't think of any of the elements in this movie that were original to watch or be interesting. <br /> <br /> Note to everyone that Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / LeeLee Sobieski fans enjoy - enjoy their collective fifteen minutes, people because they won't be much more familiar ...
