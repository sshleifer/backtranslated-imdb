I actually own this movie, which is the MST3K version called "Cave Dwellers", which is actually the only way someone could watch such a movie. If it wasn't for Joel, Crow and Tom Servo, it constantly makes wisecracks, it wouldn't be possible to put this piece of crap. You have a hero named Ator who looks much like Jeff Spigoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and looks just a little bit intelligent, but without being stoned. He takes cave dwellers (the cave dwellers)? Invisible guys, a giant snake (with a lot of anal retinal snakes who want to stick out all the skulls in the same way), a suspicious aircraft that looks like a modern aluminum one with a few cheap vineyards wrapped in it and then fight with the evil John Saxon devil. Then he rides on his horse over the tires of the four-way tires. <br /> <br /> Yes, I got the most from MST3K, which, as I said, is the only way to make this turkey a movie. If it wasn't, it would get zero stars.
