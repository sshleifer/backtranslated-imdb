This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an endless series of bad horror movies, I can say that it is a bit different than many I've seen. Not in the plot, which is a fairly regular slasher story, but more like the scene is being cut. Murder weapon gives us very foolish dialogue scenes, but they go much longer than in most movies of this kind. As a result, some of the victims look slightly less like cardboard cuttings. Not slightly. I had a hard time figuring out what exactly happened and wondering if certain events were dreaming. My favorite scene is when two guys from the killer are going and hiding in a car. In the glove compartment they find a handgun. "Thank you, God!" one of them would like to call out. The old man's head suddenly looks like a mannequin's head and it has just been enough time for me to wonder, "What is it? Where's the mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car?" Then BOOM! The head exploded and I figured it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car who shot his head with a shotgun. I love the scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 10/03.
