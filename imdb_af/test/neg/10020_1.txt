Certainly, most of the 1980s movies were not the <br /> <br /> celluloid they were filmed with, but the video nightmare could be the <br /> <br /> most difficult to produce. <Br /> <br /> Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course, <br /> <br /> and you already know, they are killing one by one by a <br /> <br /> mysterious alien. The climax has a ranger who tries to get the teens in time before the last cute girl gets mad. <br /> <br /> John Carl Buechler, my least favorite B movie man, made the common <br /> <br /> makeup effects here. The cast has Carel Struycken, from "The <br /> <br /> Eastwick Witches" and the Addams Family Flies. Unfortunately, he doesn't shoot <br /> <br /> until the end of the movie and is burned in <br /> <br />, making him unrecognizable. Steve Bond (someone <br /> <br /> remembers him?) Is here in an early role as a victim. <br /> <br /> Brown's direction, and the script that he crawls, both smell like <br /> <br /> offering brownish leave in the bush. He puts the film with <br /> <br /> as much stock wilderness material, I thought I had accidentally rented a special episode from Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Many of the <br /> <br /> pieces sit around the campfire and eat, then walk and sit and eat again <br /> <br />. The forest keeper is involved in the strangest scene ever placed in a slasher film: he jokes about a wide chopped frog to a beer stag. <br /> <br /> Jackie Coogan, who forgot to work once <br /> <br /> with silent theater legends, has two scenes, and is involved <br /> <br /> in the second strangest scene ever put into a slasher movie: he and <br /> <br /> the ranger has a conversation about cucumber and <br /> <br /> cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal ... yes . <br /> <br /> There is not one minute of stress here. The killer, a forest fire <br /> <br /> survivor looking for a mate, look at the students from behind <br /> <br /> trees. We know this is the killer, because the filmmakers have <br /> <br /> confronted in a heartbeat sound effect that wakes up the viewer every few minutes. <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for physical violence, light gun violence, gore, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > A profanity, short female nudity, light sexual content, sexual <br /> <br /> referrals and drug abuse.
