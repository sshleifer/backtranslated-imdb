Surprisingly, Kieslowski says this movie is disappointing for me because of the sometimes strange and sometimes clich√© writing that sometimes also seems to be a work of poor perception. There is an isolated young boy. He lives with one of his family, but he is lonely and looks every night for a woman living over their building. It appears! that he wants her to be one of the youths who are not good at communicating with the opposite sex. However, he likes that woman, when the woman comes to a man's home, Tomek gets pain. Then we understand that Kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a woman to flirt or fall in love with an adult woman. He does nothing else, because he can know that it is his salvation. One day he stopped that woman, suddenly he seemed a shy boy, but proved that he was not, so he almost explained everything. His lectures and refuse him. Everything is as realistic as the other Kieslowski movies, no problem. The problems begin when Tomek visits her, the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with an adult woman (but an unrequited love) falls in love with an adult woman in the story of a lonely young boy. In the beginning, the woman refused, but after a short while she began to change her mind. This U-Turn first makes the movie clip. The personality of Tomek is strange? or a result of poor perception? I'm disappointed with this character, that's my opinion and I'll try to tell why. When he goes to her house, Magda treats him very kindly. She asks what do you want from me? To kiss me? To love with me? to go out with me? At this point I remember the people who say she is a femme fatale. See? To replace the scene, Tomek rejects all the suggestions. Why? Because he is ashamed? I don't think so, but his communication is blunt, okay. After the leg scene at home, some events make the movie miss its purpose. I think the purpose of the movie was (should have been according to the story) to show us there are some people who suffer from a lack of effort and to save from this situation is not easy due to lack of communication and is separately separate for men. I mean that at this point, what does the movie say? This is vague and disappointing. It is seen that he is not hungry for love or for a woman or sex. Then what? And the suicide attempt scene supports this weakness. So he touches her legs, he wants to kill himself! By the way, as I mentioned earlier, some Magda say is a femme fatale. Not quite. She strives to make Tomek happy. Avoid contact with him? No, does she insult him? No, does she enjoy him? No. And did she deceive him? No. She has some problems with her (ex) lover, so she is not O.K. However, she does not take revenge from Tomek. She is not an angel, but not a femme fatale.
