MST3K feed. It's so bad, it's just worth seeing. There are a few hilarious things in it, like the mysterious device the bad guy sees, working for the whole movie, which seems to be this little helicopter fluttering to carry and shoot a machine gun, without much a cloud, but is brought down by a bag of balloons (the kind they release at political conventions). Many other wonderful touches of that kind. Star Charlie Sheen. There is one scene where he spends five minutes talking about, accidentally dropping the microcassettes at the Potomac River. If they were to throw Emilio Estevez into the part that would never happen.
