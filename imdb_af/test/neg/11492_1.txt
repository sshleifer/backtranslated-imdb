the movie is a complete disaster. I don't know who writes scripts for movies like this one, but I will definitely love to meet one and talk to him a bit. Perhaps writers are not really writing about the situation in the foreign countries in the current or recent past? or they just don't give a damn and write everything they think is interesting. <br /> <br /> A great and eternal formula with a crazy dictator + 1 lonely hero (an American of course) may seem a good idea, but come on? We had such a tyrant in Serbia (Milosevic), which many people did bad things, but I simply can't imagine him shooting "shoot them, shoot them" with such a barbaric passion as in the Middle Ages. Maybe they wanted to show how angry he was, but that was a stupid idea. would be a much better impression if he only did it in cold blood, as the right monsters do. <br /> <br /> The list of nonsense is too long, but the funniest thing is: no matter how many national TV stations there are in Russia, Russian president watches American SNN (CNN) news ?? OMFG! <br /> <br /> Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Please burn this piece of rubish! <br /> <br /> WILD!
