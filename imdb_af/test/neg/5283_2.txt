Ugh, bad, bad, bad, but I've seen worse. That's why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. Just finished watching this movie and I thought it was about as rotten as the flesh on Dr. Chopper's face. The worst line of the movie had to be: "I suggest you introduce someone ... meet my inner b * tch" which consisted of the only survivor of the fantastic 5 group trashing at Dr . Chopper throws and then the stage falls. Second worst line: "I'm the parker who's going to fetch you." What, this freak isn't even a policeman? Did anyone else notice how everybody immediately died of the magic gut (no one died so quickly from a gut, because I often see it in the operating room), except the super car park. Dude had a bucket of blood from that wound, pulled around on the floor and then came in for the finals to take a farewell to Dr. Chopper while inside b * tch lies on the floor. And if it doesn't beat everything, he doesn't even have the decency to die like any other. Inner b * tch helps him stay outside and continues to tell him not to die while running for help, because he is like her only friend now living. Since then, have these two friends become friends? I don't think a furious encounter in the forest where he tells you to go to the city, qualifies to get to know your time, but whatever. <br /> <br /> Just look at this movie if there is nothing else and you have nothing else to do with your time.
