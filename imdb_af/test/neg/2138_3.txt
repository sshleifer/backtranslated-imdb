Sometimes it is difficult to judge how badly a film made in Italy or Spain is really because they all use the same stable of 9-10 ESL-trained voice actors to provide the English voices for release in the US. And, anyway, things have always been forfeited in translation, dialogue, character and plot elements written for the expectations of European audiences may not go well with our American ideas about what is funny, hip or dramatic. I think the team responsible for translating the soundtrack of this movie into English had about 3 days to do it from start to finish. They probably each deserve the equivalent of an installment payment on their used Fiat to do so. In other words, pure hackwork, which is thrown into one or two, takes and is never reviewed or reviewed by anyone with a rights to the American language. <br /> <br /> Look at "Devil's Fish", I can imagine that if you look Italian in your native language, you might find it a bit of a piece of fluff. You will laugh at the "in jokes" and the amusing drunk, you will grab the monster and the villain of the bad guys and you will explain to the attractive pair of Peter and non-Daryll Hannah as their couple on the beach for no one apparent reason in the midst of a search for clues about a man who eats the monster who has already killed one of their friends. <br /> <br /> But since the crackling voice-acting and tin-eared dialogue, we keep Americans out of the movie experience, we can't help but notice that the editors had serious attention defects, so no one on the screen really can act as an attitude of a project, that the declared reason for the creation of the monster makes absolutely no sense that the action sequence has the impact of a cereal full of cooked oatmeal and that the director, writers and producers really hate. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about buying or renting this movie - just watch cable TV on Saturday afternoon with one of several beers in your fist, or with the help and protection of Mike and the Bots on MST3K.
