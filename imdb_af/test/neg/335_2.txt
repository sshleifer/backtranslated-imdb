I made a lot of effort to get this movie after reading the comments on this site. I really don't have time to write reviews, but I felt it was my duty as a sci-fi horror buff. This is just the second review I wrote. The other was for Dracula 3000. Now to the point. This movie sucked. Flat and simple. I wondered if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all the "lovely" comments. I saw movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, you call it and I saw it. But it really sucked. I don't care how much it costs or hasn't bought to make, movies like this and Dracula 3000 have to be banned and the whole hostage and crew are arrested and jailed for murder. Incidentally, I mentioned that this movie sucked. I mean really sucked. The plot did not exist and the acting was poor. It seems as if the writer Pitch Black has seen and become upset because he didn't even think of such a plot, so he decided to make his own rounded version. But instead, the suction factor took over and owned it. DO NOT KEEP IT. You will have more fun pulling down your pants and sitting on burning coals.
