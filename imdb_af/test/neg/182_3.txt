Honest young insurance agent Ronald Reagan (like Eric Gregg) is optimistic, but poor. His wife, Sheila Bromley (like Nona Gregg), longs for the finer things in life. Describe herself as "not weighed with tons of justice," Miss. Bromley is spending more money than Mr. Earn Reagan. Bromley gets the finer things in life, but blames the couple. Bromley is a fun shock. <br /> <br /> Handsome Reagan attracts other women, such as shiny clerk Gloria Blondell (like Patricia Carmody); but he does not enjoy it. To pay the bills, Bromley is hit in the insurance fraud - helping to shoot her husband. An unemployed Reagan seems to be calling for crime - will he stay upright or crooked? Clinton Rosemond has an uncomfortable "broken arm" scene. <br /> <br /> *** Accidents will happen (1938) William Clemens ~ Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley, Gloria Blondell
