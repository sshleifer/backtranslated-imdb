You know the movie could have been much better if the animal - in this case, a puppy - is the best actor on the screen! The acting in this movie is so bad, so amateur, it has embarrassed the dog to watch it. He (Rusty, our Golden Retreiver) could have done a better job than the people here. <br /> <br /> By now, it's almost a solid story: child finds animal, pet doesn't like or wants by one of the parents, but the "pet" wind up being one of those save children and is now a hero and an official member of the family. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> I remember this movie is a big hit, but never came to see it until the mid 90s on VHS. I was shocked how bad it was. Why so much excited about a movie? Was it because there was so much sleaze in the early 70's that a nice family movie stood out in the crowd? Possible. In the decade of the 70s, there was not much entertainment, and many people were suckers for cute zoos. Who can resist this cute puppy? Not me. But the movie I can resist is a Grade B storyline with horrible acting. <br /> <br /> Only for small dog lovers and I mean "lovers" because even the average pet owner will fall asleep to watch this movie in this one day.
