What an atomic bomb from a movie. The story goes nowhere and doesn't come anywhere. This leaves the theater with the poor and says "this is it". What happened to Redford. He was once a fair actor. Now he thinks he can appear on the set and make a few scenes and that's a task. Wrong. What an unemotional movie. I don't mean to be so cruel, but crazy about a movie. Incredible amateur chess. If I were in this movie, I would be so embarrassed that I wouldn't show my face. I tell you, if I'm associated with this movie, I'm in big trouble. This movie goes into the annals of the movie as the king of bombs with which all others are compared.
