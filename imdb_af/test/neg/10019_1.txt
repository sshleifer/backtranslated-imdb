It's truly, without exaggeration, one of the worst Slasher movies ever made. I know it came out in the 80's after a trend that began with "Friday the 13th". "The Prey" copies the above movie in many ways. The bush environment, the murderer, the dumb teenage years, the gore, etc. <br /> <br /> But "The Prey" is as bad as you would expect. I didn't even remember if it didn't happen. <br /> <br /> Well, the killer is actually human, so don't expect a supernatural killer in the kind of Jason. The situations are rather boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc. It just doesn't work for a slasher movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is simply awful. The score is terrible! a combination of boring instruments with the cheesy 80's tunes?! I won't even mention the technical aspects of the movie, because believe me, it just seems to cost $ 20. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one like the plague. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's something to say. Thank you, it looks like it has disappeared from the earth.
