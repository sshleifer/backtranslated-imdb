As a massive fan of DM, it goes without saying that I have seen this movie numerous times. But I look at it for the concert material. The rest of the movie is sorry, terrible to say. <br /> <br /> Celebrated rock music film director DA Pennebaker followed Fashion on their late 80's Music For The Masses tour, which promoted the beautiful album of the same name. The title 101 comes mainly from the fact that the concert material is included in the 101th and final concert of the Pasadena Bowl tour, but it is also a reference to the movie that is a 'beginner's course' on the band and how it flashes Depeche Mode 101. Amidst footage of the quartet that lives and explores America is a second story thread covering a group of DM fans who won a competition to meet the band on the tour in their own bus and attend the final gig. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said above, the concert material is huge. Fashion is on top of their form as stadium rock gods, which in the late 80's was a somewhat unusual performance for an electrorock band. Although the film captures the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece "Violator", there are still many excellent tracks seen and heard here, eg. Behind the Wheel, the majestic. Never let me retire again. Everything just can't do enough of the Vince Clarke years, shaking the disease and many more. <br /> <br /> When the mode is on stage, it is brilliant. If they are not, they are very boring. Nothing, even vaguely important, happens to the guys as they watch the US in the dying days of the Reagan administration. For example, the likely "highlight" of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. Not exactly exciting things. I know that all ties should not be wild and reckless idiots, but these guys make the Mormon Tabernacle Choir like Rammstein. <br /> <br /> The only true excitement comes from several clips that focus on the group's lead singer Dave. Gahan. Gahan comes across in 101 as generously psychotic, talking about a violent force in himself, he can't control, reminiscent of a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on. There is one point in the movie where he throws a prima donna tantrum at a poor old back - really embarrassing. The man clearly had problems again, which was gratefully resolved. Songwriter Martin Gore and keyboard player Andy Fletcher are presented as a lot of articulation, clearly massively talented, but also completely colorless men; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member Alan Wilder is the only one of the quartets who crush the rock star press with any kind of aplomb. <br /> <br /> And as for the 'fan tour' wire, it's unacceptable. Let's not make ourselves. Maybe it's just because it's so * many * late 80's, but the bunch of young fans do little to me, but makes a sense of irritation. They are, for a person, simple level and dull people, whose fianc√© is banal if they are not hidden. Let me repeat ... * nothing * happens in the footage that is not on the stage of any interest. Nothing. Endless scenes of children spraying their hair with the purpose of changing their clothes, changing their clothes, going on their way to performances and getting their partners in bed with another competition winner, just make me one thing is wondering - if Cure fans were flexible in this idea in '88 / 89. seeing things filmed from them, I would hate to see the outings. . <br /> <br /> But the music is all that matters, and in this respect 101 is excellent. The Pasadena concert, one of their best performers, is worth seeing. The recent DVD issue of the movie has a bonus disc that contains remnants of the unproven concert material (a good 80% of the show), thus making the DVD an absolute must for fans. The band's audio commentary (minus Wilder, which was in the mid 90's) on the first disc is also strange, much more interesting than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> As a document from the sons of Basildon during their amphitheater idol period, Depeche Mode 101 is invaluable. But if you're looking for excitement, you're better off getting the accompanying double live album (now available in Super Audio CD format).
