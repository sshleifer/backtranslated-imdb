No serious spoilers, but a few very minors. <br /> <br /> "Acacia", a Korean contribution to the popular Asian horror wave, relates to a man and woman who decide to get a little and decide to adopt a child. The child, who usually has an obsession with the dead tree in the family's garden, eventually disappears when the couple finally have a child of their own and the above tree resembles the family itself. <br /> <br /> And that's about it. The movie moves at a snail's pace, with more than 100 minutes of 80 minutes of material. It is essentially a thin family drama with a creepy tree, and there is very little in the way of scares, just shots of the tree with weird mumbling sounds playing over it. However, the idea of ​​the child's mother's tree is very original, but it is not exploited to its full potential. This type separates "Acacia" from much of the new wave it belongs to: movies like Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite, and milk mixes ideas until they're red in the face. <br /> <br /> The movie starts at the end; But the realization of the child's fate and parent's actions not only alleviates the earlier curiosity of the story, but is revealed with such a machine gun operation that it is difficult to take everything in one go. The final order is undoubtedly uncomfortable, but it feels too late. <br /> Overall, the movie doesn't feel too much like a ring cash, but with the "movie renaissance" that Korea is currently going through, I can't help but feel this movie can be so much more have been.
