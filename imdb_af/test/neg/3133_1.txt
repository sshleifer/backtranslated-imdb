Great. Another foreign film that thinks it's Fellini. In addition, we need more propaganda about the killing of disabled people. <br /> <br /> I see no reason why we should be overwhelmed with these thinly disguised euthanasia ads. <br /> <br /> I didn't find anything about this movie. What can be saved from a man without the courage to continue, despite some adversity. It doesn't take courage to commit suicide. This is the action of a coward. Sharing this "wish" with his wife simply captures her with the same illness he has. If it was a movie about a man's courage to continue, despite his problems, similar to the Jill Kinmont story, it would have made a good movie. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in See true courage, watch the movies about Jill Kinmont, the former skier who has been disabled after a bad ski accident.
