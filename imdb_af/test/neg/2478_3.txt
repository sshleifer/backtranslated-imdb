1) If you want to make a movie about social realism, it is very important that the audience identify with the characters depicted. 2) The audience cannot identify with characters that are highly stereotyped or with obvious situations. 3) If you have a bad actor, you can't build any character. Anyway, even if you have good actors, their work will be ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictional Andalusian accent. <br /> <br /> Jes√∫s Ponce ignores the 3 points and also makes cheap jokes completely out of place. His writing is so predictable: a woman comes out of jail, she meets his old junkie boyfriend, life's hard, etc. Anyway, the fact that the story is all but original, would not be as bad as just Ponce not a complete incompetent writing and filming. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long will they still give money from our taxes to make movies like this one. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 3/10
