While I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered again, why do I remember a good movie? This version lacks the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear finishing touch. Maxime Foerste was more convincing than a sore child healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately, Zeta-Jones had to find another one she could own (she has other roles she owns). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. By comparison, Aaron Eckhart was passionate. This version was nice but slim. <br /> <br /> The love between Mario and Martha might be predictable but satisfactory. The therapist added an interesting little color that didn't look important. I liked it when he said at the end he would be back, but the movie was over before returning. I usually have Martha at home. Occasionally I repeat it.
