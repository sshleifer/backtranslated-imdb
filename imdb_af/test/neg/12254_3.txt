Although it should be the nadir of season six, this schemaltic episode is not badly written or performed. It's just that most of us looked at the X-Files for tough, gripping horror / thrillers that ended without easy answers and after dark, but indescribable conspiracies. Season 6 gave us a bunch of turbulent comedies that undermined the continuity of the show. First, Simpsons Halloween Specials looks like a big thriller TV. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Victoria Jackson plays SNL celebrity. the long-suffering friend of a man who sets him up as a rainmaker. But her husband's boss is the one who really loves her and Mulder winds him up to give him advice to get out of town. <br /> <br /> There is some playful pleasure in the chemistry between the agents and a little amusing but non-sophisticated characterization of Midwestern Hicks. It's nothing you want to see more than once! <br /> <br /> It's hard to find out. Season 6. Chris Carter, the X-Files creator, seems bored by the entire Syndicate Conspiracy story arch and leaves responsibility to the black comedy writers.
