Absolutely the worst experience I've ever experienced. I think my eyes began to bloom. I actually got sick that night after I watched it. I don't even consider it a movie. Movies are supposed to be worthwhile and entertaining. It fails terribly. I couldn't make it through the whole movie, so because the end might be the biggest feature in movie history, it gets a 1 for that little chance. Otherwise it would be a flat. <br /> <br /> I can't see National Lampoon sponsoring this atrocity, let alone any organization. Renting this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. Just look at it if you ever want to make any other movie you will ever see looking good. <br /> <br /> Without question, it's the worst movie I've ever seen.
