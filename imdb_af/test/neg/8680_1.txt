The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so bad that it forced me to register and comment. I must add here that I am a film that seldom gives judgment. But sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly thought out, poorly edited, with such a poor storyline that criticizes it. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at all the demands of how beautiful, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was very thin. The pace of the movie was malicious. I gave new chances in each turn (mostly because I didn't feel like wasting a Saturday morning in NY), but with each new scene it took longer, characters in which I had no interest I couldn't connect, for whom I could not empathize. <br /> <br /> If I see negative reviews on IMDb from small independent movies like this, I sometimes ask if the poster has a personal ax to grind. He used the gaffer, she threw him, and now he wipes everything she ever works. But here, no. I don't know anyone who worked on this movie. And I wish it would be good. But the film wasn't dark (as some have mentioned) or depressed (as others have said). . . this indicates that I am related to the film. . . No, Henry May Long was just too long, empty and boring. <br /> <br /> This is the Tomas Take this one.
