This movie follows the life of a great guitarist, who wants to make it big, but act irresponsibly. It is almost to the point of self-destruction. <br /> <br /> I expected the usual Woody Allen dialogue, sarcasm and humor, but "Sweet and Lowdown" failed to provide any. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and painful man. He is so unbearable that I don't want to care for him now. I wonder why a movie should be made about him. The pace of the story is slow, which makes the movie a terrible drill. Even Sean Penn's big play fails to revive the film on a viewable level. <br /> <br /> I love Woody Allen's movies, but "Sweet and Lowdown" is a huge disappointment.
