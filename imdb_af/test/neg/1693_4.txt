Very resistant but ultimately harmless movie version of children's literary classics containing an animated portion in the style of MARY POPPINS (1964) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971). The human role play is very distinguishable - James Mason, Billie Whitelaw, David Tomlinson, Joan Greenwood, Bernard Cribbins - but their roles range from the miscarriage (a 69-year-old Mason as a theft chimney sweep!) To the insignificant (Greenwood as a frozen aristocrat) to the bizarre (Whitelaw plays various exotic characters - including a circus, an old hag, a daughter and a fairy tale - for no apparent reason). <br /> <br /> The animated segment of the film, handled by a group of Eastern European animators, is hardly inspired, but in itself enjoyable and as usual with such a thing, there is a variety of songs that you should keep busy, one of which is in particular. He rejected too much for his own good. The film is directed by well-known character actor Jeffries, who has previously (much more successful) other children's films, THE RAILWAY CHILDREN (1970) and DIE AMAZING MR. BLUNDEN (1972; what I have looked at myself but released a while ago on R2 DVD by Anchor Bay UK).
