Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me hunt the hunt. <br /> <br /> Armed listlessness. Miscast artists work hard to have fun so you can have fun. The brilliant Meryl Streep gives it a good chance. Pierce Brosnan is just an embarrassment. Unexplained on a Greek island. Very scary women. Very. <br /> <br /> It was a dull jukebox music on stage, now it's a big, spooky, poorly-guarded screen-juke boxing music. If you like ABBA, so-so. If not, an attack on the senses and an insult to any intelligence you left behind when you leave the theater. I readily admit that I didn't really want to see this movie and with friends who did, but for the love of God. Why do my sex and squeal scream to convey joy? Always sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are totally determined to have a BIG night out of town? This is the feeling of this whole project. It felt just as good when it stopped.
