It is perhaps the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has ruined the British film industry, as Mockney Guy Ritchie unleashed loose stock and two poorly-trained barrels. This "real life" story from Carlton Leach (what?) Has everything wrong with this genre, a really horrible script consisting of people who "Cant", "Fahcking Cant" and "I'll kill you," you can't scare "ad nauseum. The play is uniformly scary, with the two most recognizable role players showing two former soapstones visible from their depths. For some reason, the film accepts that we have heard from these people and I can assure you that someone north of Essex does not, and that we are interested in some low life stories. Why? It's not Goodfellas despite the blurb on the DVD cover. The story centers on a soccer hooligan, which has spinners, becoming gangster, whose friends are eventually shot. Boo hoo. The fact that these people are completely unsympathetic is the only small plus for this movie. In all the action scenes, the camera seems to be tied to a rope and strangled while people pretend to fight and the story of someone most people have never heard and nothing really interesting is a total waste of time. People talk about how violent the movie is as if it were the sign of a big movie and although very big movies have violence in them, it's just an excuse for the FX man to show what he can do. Overall film is a reminder of why the British film industry is uncovered and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions.
