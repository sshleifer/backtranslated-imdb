Disclaimer: During my ventures in the foreign film, I have a large variety of films covering different genres, including horror, action, drama, comedy and romance, to name a few. So, I enjoyed the thoughtful, serious scene of drama, as well as the senseless, popcorn fun of action movies. With a wide variety of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films under my belt, I am confident in my ability to recognize and complement shiny spots in movies. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to admit. It's one of the worst Chinese movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To begin with, this overestimated swordplay epic shows the infamous "slideshow" action series throughout, which is nothing more than an ultra-cheap and pathetic form of action choreography. One should only show a series of close-up photos of grim faces, swords, legs and / or arms, and then a dead body. Bravissimo! You now have an action sequence for As of Time. The problem is not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the screens are so chaotic and inconsistent that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this movie is Non-existent, as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love or hate someone, rather than actually developing such elements on the screen and show, which leaves all characters generic and colorless, and the viewer is completely indifferent to their actions. In fact, the storyline itself is an absolute disaster, too many characters too fast, with too many plot devices. Plot complexities in movies can be very beneficially used (ie a story of two sisters), but Ashes of Time becomes exploitable waste if it does nothing more than convert a very simple plot because it's not good reason not. <br /> <br /> In fact, this whole movie acts like a series of smoke screens to cover its shortcomings. Terrifying action choreography is covered with a slideshow and chaotic camera movements. Non-existent character development is covered by the characters who openly say how they feel. And a mindless storyline is covered by confusing the viewer with convolution. <br /> <br /> As if that wasn't bad enough, this movie was extremely boring, which looked more than 150 minutes instead of the real 95. <br /> <br /> Rating = A rare 0 / 5 stars given.
