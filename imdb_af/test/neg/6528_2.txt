.... and now I'm on episode # 7. I really hoped it would be over now (not to cancel, as soon as everything related to the show - including the actors - was brought together in the middle of the ocean with some toxic waste, never seen again), because this series is really bad. <br /> <br /> To make this program appear under the "comedy" genre is misleading! It's so hard to believe that Ben Elton can write something so badly, it may indicate many inputs from other writers in everything he's previously linked to. In some episodes I didn't even laugh. Oh, and I can't believe that Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped doing "My Hero" and started doing it, but his decision-making skills were obvious. harmed that day - perhaps he simply can't read, and he didn't realize how poor the scripts were for "Blessed." Don't get me wrong, "My Hero" is not a masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And just to irritate me even more, I suggest that it get a DVD edition if Well, if there are so many TV series that are not released!
