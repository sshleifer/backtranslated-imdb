I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story line was very thin and the editorial crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did. <br /> <br /> Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unlikely character that I found difficult to support him. Andy's acting ability is good, but not good enough to make the poor writing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell did a great job with her portrayal of Linda, Gary's romantic interest. I can't say anything bad about Andie, I always enjoy her. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andie is so far-reaching and incredible. The two do not make a good pair on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was almost as much of a deviation as the movie itself. A nod of the pope and everything is forgiven, come on. The event that allows this movie to get some that are happy and that the authors expect from us is pathetic. Gary doesn't change and just by killing a dearest friend, his situation gets better. <br /> <br /> There are tons of good movies to be seen in front of this one. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br />
