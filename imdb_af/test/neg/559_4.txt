I thought this movie was a disgrace to the series. Finally, part 3 did not measure up to part 2, and this one does not have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humor wasn't quite as greasy in this one as in part 3, but it was funny enough to make the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The girl's part was pretty good. She is a lost teen who needs direction. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That the aunt simply goes to vote for her house and her cousin under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man she just met, was leaving. Of course he was a friend of her brother. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the monastery. One might think of some of my other reviews that I wouldn't want the dancing monks, but I thought it was amusing. It showed that they know how to have fun. Now if it was monks in ancient China dancing to pop music, it would be another matter. <br /> <br /> Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks didn't "kill a mistake. Miyagi told her that street gangs were murdering each other, being stupid, nations trying to destroy each other were stupid, but respecting all life was not stupid. Miyagi also expressed such wisdom in other films. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Sure, there were a few things I liked about it. It was not as funny as part three, and no character can ever live in Sato until Sato. This movie has no revaluation value. I can't imagine looking at it again, but it's worth seeing once.
