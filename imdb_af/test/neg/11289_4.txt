Ty Cobb is by far the most interesting and craziest madman to ever live. His baseball career was unmatched in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy and pure unprecedented violence. Every game he played was a spectacle of human ability and cruelty. Of course, the film is not about him, but focuses on writing his biography by author Al Stump. Now it's not such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb has even gone further in paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazy outbursts, even as a senior, are shocking, even according to today's untapped standards . But instead of focusing on these events, which I was just too interested in, the movie is a pseudo-fictional road movie with a click of a clipboard that will allow a knowledgeable Cobb fan to cry asynchronously. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones does pretty well as a crotchety Cobb, but somehow manages his cartoon supervillainy. Most stories about Cobb are hardly credible, but even fooling him seems impossible and unnecessary. Robert Wuhl, depicting author Al Stump, is a dark vortex of non-existent talent. He sucks life from every scene, trying to make this movie his own Nagasaki. There is a reason why we never see him as a leading man anymore (Arliss doesn't count. It's hardly a show). Even Cobb's and Stomp's inevitable "roll reversal" games at the end are made even worse by his inability to give words that do not sound like a poor book on the band's voice. <br /> <br /> For all the terrible writing and spectacular display on the screen, there is one sequence that stands out so far as the rest of the failure that it is accepted from the same movie is impossible. A hyper styled playback sequence that shows Cobb's overwhelming psychology and brutal athletics while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance. The camera moves bizarre and the whole event looks like a dream because of the Cobb's unique playing style. Every slide, hit and tackle is made even stronger by improved sound, and Tommy Lee Jones is the intensity of the master player. It leaves the viewer over the possibilities of a true biopsy of Cobb in his head with the same actor. It's worth watching the movie for this incredible few minutes alone, just to see what could have been. <br /> <br /> Because of my own knowledge of Ty Cobb, I want to be a little unfair for this movie and want it to be something, but being so boring is the neutral movie about this maniac nonsense. I'm glad Ron Shelton's career has since slipped.
