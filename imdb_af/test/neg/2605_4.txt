It could have been good. The voice remains exactly right and matches the characters at a T. One small problem is already; the appearance of the characters, mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. The same bored looks just on every face with small changes like hair lines or weight size. It seems strange to see a very large guest star's voice out of a lifeless shape like the characters here. If I'm not wrong, Kathy Griffin has a voice for this show, and it seems weird to be funny. <br /> <br /> There are some other issues, one being the family plot. The Simpsons did much better where you could buy most of the situations the characters could find themselves. Here we get too many annoying deviations, like someone who has a strange fantasy and then it's supposed to find it funny, but for some reason the delivery is slightly down. As you can say, it's hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show, because it's basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more "Married to Children." <br /> <br /> If I point a finger at what's wrong with it, it's probably repeated. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character, but neither of the others. Lois had to be called Lois Lame because she is kind of one-dimensional. Seth Green as the kind of delayed boy is the best of this show and it is the most stereotypical part of the show. <br /> <br /> So, the more I can say. There isn't exactly anything wrong with this show, but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons have done for almost two decades.
