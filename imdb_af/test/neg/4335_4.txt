Ben Stryker, an ex-green beet, stops at a small town called Agua Dolee to visit an old friend Tick Rand. Shortly after traveling in town on his Suzuki and settling in. A motorcycle gang known as 'The Savages', led by tyrant Pigiron, enters and eventually takes over. Stryker does not want to get involved, but it changes when he becomes friends with the real targets. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say about this scuzzy item? Hard call, as the only basic reason to watch this low-budget car wreck is for the tremendous b-cast the crew managed to get this project. While I don't think it's a complete botch job, it's not very good either. Now what a throw! Lance Henriksen (the main character, she doesn't have the funny bill, but the final), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsythe, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Now, what went wrong with this scummy low-budget bungle. The abomination of the material is too one-dimensional that it lends ideas of better movies (namely Mad Max) and comes with a complete mess of ideas that were not laid out and could be better thought. The cliches used can be manipulated to a good performance, despite being predictable, but "Savage Dawn" seems to make it hurry without sucking the viewer. The throw is usually not thrown into anything. A bleached blonde Henriksen is particularly solid and even with his prospective presence that gives a mysterious glow to his character. He does not stand up much from hell and sometimes gets in action. Too much sideline action, but when he kicked a biker's ass, the good times flowed. Karen Black's hissing performance is very strange and is about shouting and cursing. Although she comes in an unforgettable cat fight with Claudia Udy's flirtatious vixen character Katie. A wheelchair bound George Kennedy deliberately wanders to the final assault and Richard Lynch looks embarrassingly as a provocative priest / mayor in a very redundant role. On the edge, Bill Forsythe, it simply stretches as the head of the infamous biker suit. <br /> <br /> The junky story (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) has that cute comic book and many are influenced by the Western genre. Just look at the villains. How they got their names is mystery. Maybe they pulled them out of a hat. It is beautiful second class material that moves more often on one shining spectacle to the other. Indecent comic elements are sneaked in and also a little sluggish. Tacky exploitation that doesn't get gritty enough and death is pretty laughing. An awkward script is full details and unbearable trite. Simon Nuchtern's mocking direction was numbered and clumsy. One or two intense scenes can't make up for his tortoise-like pacing and also very handy stunts. The cardboard sets had a dirty appearance, but it did not have the organic sense. The gravely cinematography by Gerald Feil was better handled when the main focus was not on the town, but on the deserted background (such as the beginning and end of the climax of the movie) with some neat camera touch. Pino Donaggio's bunch of music choices are drowned by his own incompetence. <br /> <br /> "Savage Dawn" is an unforgettable fast midnight movie that is for the most part a definite devastation. There are better and more convincing exercises from the same ilk out there.
