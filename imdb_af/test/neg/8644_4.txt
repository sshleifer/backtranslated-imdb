William Petersen (that C.S.I man) has a small, unreasonable role, but that is the best part of the movie. His character comes across smart ass and difficult, and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. He has a series that allows him to play just about anything. After 5 minutes it goes from cool to nothing. It makes you hope his character appears in the movie again, but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The movie itself is pretty poor. Keep a watch on TMN or a collection at the library, but not much more. Too many of them remind you of L.A Confidential, except that the film itself becomes complicated, this one is so loose, it manages everywhere, but where it needs to. 2 out of 5 stars
