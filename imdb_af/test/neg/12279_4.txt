This movie is very violent but exciting with original dialogue and cool characters. It has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life. The movie begins with action star Leo Fong as an occasional police spokesman approaching the end of his career when he falls into a major case involving corruption, blackmail and murder. This is where the murder begins. From the beginning, Fong ends up delivering in this must action caper. This film is also co-star Richard Roundtree. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie as a child, but when I got older, I realized that this movie was pretty cute and not very good. I would not recommend this movie and the action is very, very bad.
