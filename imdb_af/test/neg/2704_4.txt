Although this movie is inaccurate, there are certain items that are true. Certainly, he was a wild character in his youth, played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at West Point, almost expelled several times, last in his class (out of 34), and often turned recklessly into his leadership during the Civil War. br /> <br /> But history made him a sheep goat of Indian wars. Surely he did his part of cruel things, but how much was he under command? There is also evidence that he testified before Congress (with great risk for his commission and order) that he argued about the fairness of treaties with the Indians and that if he was an Indian he would also fight rather than live a discussion! <br /> <br /> As a character in the play in 1776 said when asked what the British would say about the Revolutionary War, the character says history will do what it always does ... it will lies. Who knows how bad a man was Custer. Surely he was not the sympathetic character depicted by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt that he was completely angry as he was later portrayed.
