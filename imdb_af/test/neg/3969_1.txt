SLOOOOOOOW, low, poorly crafted 70's blocker made moore cowvincing because of today's news; Nevertheless, this movie is worthy of stink fever due to non-enveloping, absent-minded and stupid 70's clothes (unfortunately the MooCow remembers when Adidas's clothes were all the rage ...). It has the same feeling that some better 70's are sci-fi moovies, namely "WestWorld" and "Logan's Run". While the important (rich people diminish themselves to keep a direct delivery of body parts to keep their theory forever), the film makes the mistake of saturating us with Richard (Tim Donnelly), a clone that is immediately boring and irritating is. Hollow acting by Donnelly does not help, but fits in with the rest of the cast. Even such B-illuminaries as Dick Sargent ("Bewitched" TV series, "Ghost with 1,000,000 Eyes"), Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "The Dark", "Laserblast") and Peter Graves ("Begin of the End "," Killers from Space "," It has conquered the world ") offers only the most beautiful performances. Produced, edited and edited by a number of nobodies, it is no surprise that "Clonus" does not scare off much of the people any less a warning from someone! Truth is told, there is nothing in the bad movie that even the shock fans want to love. Want to see some bad, funny 70 movies, anything from Greydon Clark. "Clonus" is not a bonus, the MooCow says even the MST3K version is a yawner, so go at your own risk !: = 8P
