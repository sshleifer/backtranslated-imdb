This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit for some Russian soldiers based in Buffalo. He is also an angry alcoholic, and this has reduced his performance. After falling asleep in his car, his uncle sent him to San Francisco, where he would attend AA meetings and get a job as a GP's assistant. If you think it makes absolutely no sense, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not for much, much worse. Frank is becoming a master's degree, despite a complete lack of training, but his responses to people in the funeral home and AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to root for him if they see positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition to Frank's sponsor, although he has almost nothing to do (his character tells us he is gay, but it doesn't have any meaning at all). The film is mostly idiotic with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest for Frank flounders, as the two actors do not have chemistry together. Around the time she gets into the picture, Frank becomes much less exciting than a character. His characterization seems to be random; there is no consistency in his behavior. The comedy is low key and only funny intervals, especially disappointing in view of the comic pedigree of the cast. <br /> <br /> Problems abound in this one. Kingsley's accent is terrible and contradictory. It varies between Italian, Russian and Spanish. During the film, Frank tells many people that he is a hit (including a whole AA group), but no one seems to care or want to do anything about it. The movie relies on clich√© scenes to carry it through its final act, especially when Leoni's insatiable character chases Frank at the airport, just as he flees back to Buffalo. <br /> <br /> Although it has a strong prospect and an interesting first half hour, the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and is being transmitted in total nonsense. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates one year of austerity. I hope to celebrate many, many years not to see "You Kill Me". <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
