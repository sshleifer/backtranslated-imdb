I needed to know better. The clues were everywhere in IMDB.com. This movie is written and directed by the same man who has no record. The cast is a lot of unknowns with the possible exception of Joe Estevez, who specializes in bad movies. Etc. That's enough to say, I can't see any reason why anyone wants to see this horrible, amateur movie show. Turn on any broadcast channel at 03:00 and you'll see better movies. Nuff said.
