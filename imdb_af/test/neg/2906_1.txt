This is by far the worst movie ever made. I have no doubt. I saw such a crap like Manos, Space Mutiny, and what not, and I can honestly tell you they don't like Science Crazed. <br /> <br /> Science Crazed has no reprehensible plot. Something about a man who makes a woman pregnant through the turkey hybrid, and the child * born later is mature and ready to kill. Of course, as a newborn, it takes him about an hour to kill people. The director continually runs footage, and takes about fifteen minutes to set up an awkward death. There is about a page of dialogue for the whole movie, but the dialogue comes about a minute after it is spoken. <br /> <br /> Sample Scene: The monster runs into a hall. We know this because there are about ten minutes of foot of his feet. In between loops we are treated to two women who work out. Repeat the ad nauseum for about 20 minutes. When the monster appears, no one moves, and everyone looks like deer in headlights, because the monster takes another 10 minutes to kill them to kill them. At the stage of the acting, you would guess that people are already dead. <br /> <br /> I know my description doesn't look so bad, but trust me, I can't fully describe the pain that science is. CRAZED. <br /> <br /> Stay away and boycott all video stores that carry it. :) <br /> <br />
