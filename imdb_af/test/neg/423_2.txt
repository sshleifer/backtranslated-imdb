I think I probably won't hate this movie if I speak Polish. I selected the English version at the first menu, but it gave my Polish dialogue with English subtitles just as the Polish version did. Perhaps the dialogue is so degraded because the person who did the captions couldn't translate it very well into English. To aggravate the problem, some of the dialogue had no captions at all. The acting was pretty bad, especially the female head, who was melodramatic about everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman fell in love and when the gang was driving her around, her shirt opened and the director showed the next 15-20 seconds near her bare chest. I couldn't see how her chest added to the drama of the scene or the movie. Perhaps the director tried to increase the numbers of teenagers in the audience. Many of the films take place in an extermination camp released by the Americans. First, the "American" uniforms saw nothing like American Army uniforms. Secondly, none of the extermination camps in Poland were liberated by the Americans. I would think that a Polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an American born in 1966, that all six extermination camps were liberated by the Russians. All in all, it's just not a very good movie if you don't speak Polish.
