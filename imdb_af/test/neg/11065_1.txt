There was apparently some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a movie that was badly planned and executed if I didn't actually see it. <br /> <br /> To get started, as soon as we are In the cave with the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've met in horror movies since the early 80's), the film is almost completely shot close . As the actors wear helmets, this means everything we see is brilliant lights alternating with extreme darkness - we never see what the characters see; so when they cry out "Look there!" We were left to ask, "What?! Where?!". Eventually, the film has a confusing, confusing strobe-light effect, without understanding it until we come to the end. <br /> <br /> And I won't tell you what the end means, but you'll recognize it if you've ever seen the old '60s Arch Hall laugh "Eegah!" with Richard Kiel. <br /> <br /> But what crazy man ever wants a variation on a theme like "Eegah!" Make long remember as one of the worst movies ever made! But that's what we have here, people. Other than that, "Eegah!", "The Cavern" is no one's idea of ​​goofy fun. This is inaccessible. (I ran it at x2 the normal speed, just to convince it, hoping I could actually see something at the end of the movie, but when I did, it was just silly.) This movie has providing me with A satisfying moment, though; Since it only costs a few dollars, after getting it from the DVD player, I could hit it with my own hands - what a relief!
