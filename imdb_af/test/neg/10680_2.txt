As main character, Lillith Silver wants to point out - "you know f ** k all about vampires". Obviously, this statement was aimed at the cast and crew, creating an extremely bad image of everyone's favorite blood-removing undead. According to the misleading director, Vampiere is all chopped in white foundations and cut into latex, similar to a piece of meat in shrink wrap. Featuring patches that look like Bannana's and a bad case of asthma, our main character Lillith creates a slapstick caricature of the "contemporary" Vampire. <br /> <br /> The plot consists of a 9-year-old boy's playstation collection on a piece of paper, then mixed together to obscure this terrible story. Lillith our light protagonist is a Vampire Bounty hunter who makes a living to cut out members of everyone's favorite cult, the Illuminati! Instead of incorporating the classic stealth and accuracy killer methodology, Lillith sneaks through an open window and then continues to cut her targets before shooting. Shiny with a handgun (apparently not leaving bullet holes, thanks to the turbulent continuity). PC Plod is then assigned to solve the murders, but he comes to the grizzly, but strikingly obvious conclusion that Lillith is actually a vampire and continues to arm her with the usual vampire spreading tool, including a cross, garlic and a sharp piece of wood. Meanwhile, Lillith, who has got into the habit of exposing her boss, upset if an old nemesis disrupts him and requires a ransom to be delivered personally. As you may think, it's not going to plan. However, I'm not going to put myself through the pain of the following scenes, so I'll hit the end. Lillith and her "nemesis" have a showdown, and after Lillith wins, it is revealed, with all the exaggeration of someone who is said to have cancer, that the two centuries are old lovers and the whole plot " some kind of twisted game is. Yes, that kick in the balls was the real end of the movie. In my eyes, this joke of a conclusion is the icing on the latex dressed cake and sealed this film in the Never Ever Watch This safe. <br /> <br /> As far as movie techniques are concerned, the movie is simply not storing any style. The director tries to save his disaster from the edge, through a few close ups and some polygonal shots. However, this is not the saving grace that the film needs. <br /> <br /> You may be screaming, but it's a B movie, it's meant to be crap! "I'm not sorry. I've seen a few cracked B-movies, like Evil Death 2, and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, and so these shame cannot hide behind excuses. The budget was low, that's clear of the lack of location and good actors, perhaps, if the director was more creative and had less money to pay for make-up and fake blood, he could have done something decent with this disease attempt. No way and just thought to give me a few chuckles to obscene the acting skills, half of the budget has to be paid to the female fee, just to get their tops off for lesbian romps. wanted to see, I would have bought Muffy The Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad, the story is worse and the effects are paralyzed. This film had potential but its cunning undertone and embarrassment of a classic horror character has it only as a result g of his ruin. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at some friends, I encourage you to see this mockery. If you are looking for a more serious Vampire action movie, try Blade or Underworld to ensure your angry bloodlust.
