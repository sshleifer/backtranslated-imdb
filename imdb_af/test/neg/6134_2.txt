I saw the DVD at a store near my home, and since I'm a "horror movie / alien flicks" addict, I wondered how good it was. It even mentioned two awards on the cover (I don't remember what festival it won), so I thought "Hey, it might be good". So I bought it (for five euros) and I came here to look at IMDb for some reviews. Here either people based on the movie say it was bad, or people said the movie was a great show in indie movies blah, blah. I then played the DVD and didn't think of any review I read, with an open mind, and didn't expect anything at all. <br /> <br /> Man ... I'm not about to be critical, but the movie was really bad ... OK, I'm just going to give some tips on what I thought: <br /> 1 Act / Dialogue: The acting was so confusing ... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes where I couldn't touch them! The dialogue was even the worst ... I think it was probably the aspect I didn't get the most in the whole movie. The talking between characters was ... off. Not only bad, but far away from the real events in the movie. The monologues of the female character, although well-delivered, have become boring and annoying in a while ... But of course the most ridiculous aspect was the ... "aliens" or the "infected" ... I won't even comment delivering on that one will just say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took away the whole mood of the picture; 2-Visuals: the strongest aspect in the movie ... if you've forgotten the terrible FX and light flashes, they used to simulate explosions or what hell they were supposed to be. The aspect of the camera in the car was actually cool, but they didn't even use the environment to inspire fear or fear. They left it to cheap sound and video FX and the three "infected" characters. The movie is sowing in so many scenes ...; 3-Sound: Talk about editing ... this movie has no problems showing how badly edited it was. From the computer, the forest animals sound like the "alien dialogue" ... ah ... <br /> <br /> So what did I have in the movie ... (SPOILERS), the only thing I really liked and it was really frightening the sequence of two scenes where the car is still quiet and you touch something / someone who is far in the distance. Initially I really thought I was seeing things, but if the character realized that the "figures" were coming to her was his own reflection, I was amazed! Pretty creepy idea did well! In addition, I had a terrible time. <br /> <br /> And I don't recommend it to anyone ... not even "teenager" because you can't even laugh here. . <br /> <br /> I give it a solid 2. Only a few technical achievements have worked here ... apart from ... yes ... nothing
