The title of this documentary document is very misleading. At no time during the documentary did they show how the launch of the Pigs in the Lake Victoria caused any of the problems facing the town of Mwanza, Tanzania. The film is trying to put Tanzania's problems into an environmental cause, but the truth is that the problems arise from a parasitic outside force. The documentary is very slow, without any narrative. Instead, it relies on small blisters of text between no related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand the subject. There are only two attempts to discuss the environmental effects of the Nile pigs. One is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they survey the factory managers where the fish is processed. He mentions briefly how 50 years ago the Nile pile was imported into the lake and consumed the other fish species. The filmmaker makes no attempt to follow up or go into the matter. The second attempt is when, in this documentary, they discuss the performance of another documentary discussing the environmental impact of the Nile, and again, no attempt is made to expand on how devastating the problem has been. <br /> <br /> The subject of this documentary has nothing to do with the Fish Fish itself and more about the problems facing most African countries. The film is trying to link the launch of Fish with Aids, Poverty and Pollution in Tanzania, but never makes a direct connection. As any intelligent person reads well with problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania, but most affect Africa and do nothing with the fish. It would have been great if the filmmakers showed how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it was adversely affected by the introduction of the fish, but not. The fact of the matter is that many of the people they questioned say that the fish provided jobs and opportunities for many. Yes, things are BAD in Mwanza, but they are by far in other parts of the country and mainland. <br /> <br /> A documentary's effort to link fish to famine problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First, Tanzania is a very large country and the Victoria Lake is only a small part of the country. Many of the individual interviews say they can go to Mwanza, the fishing village on the lake, find work and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very poor, has no narrative and makes no attempt to link anything displayed on the Nile tree. It relies on people's emotions by showing images of the destruction of poverty, famine and Aids, and try not to show you any of these are unique to the Victoria Lake of Tanzania or directly related to the Apricot fish. The fact is that most of the problems are more concerned with War, Globalization and Christianity than and the environmental impact of the Fish Fish itself.
