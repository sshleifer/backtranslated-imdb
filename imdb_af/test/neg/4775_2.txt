I was really disappointed with this movie. I heard very good reviews about this and sadly missed seeing it in theaters. As a result, I was very excited to see it when it came to DVD. I thought it was going to be a terrifying movie with very frightening surprises, but it was rather a predictable movie. It dragged and dragged without a climax in it and after all the problems that those people had to try to escape, the end was totally frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for one reason. It's not your typical horror movie with a central bad guy who killed a lot of people. The story makes this movie unique and offers a change for people who watch many horror movies. Although I don't like this movie, I recommend that all horror fans see it at least once. You may find it surprising. As for this horror fan, all I can say is that I hope there's no sequel to this forgotten movie.
