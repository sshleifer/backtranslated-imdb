"Garden State" is one of these indie-type images that presumably hint at production values, for the sake of the audience for the audience a truly real human drama. Strangely, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly large names actors as well). Where the picture is missing, it is in Zach Braff's script, which is mostly eliminated from other movies. <br /> <br /> If you are as young as Braff, you have not really lived up to the experience as a filmmaker. Braff's experience seems to be watching movies, and repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie. In Garden State he plays Andrew Largeman, a semi-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his New Jersey hometown to bury his mother. She took her own life after struggling for years in a wheelchair. He seems to have no feeling about any of these; He has no relationship with his father, who is guilty of causing his mother's paralysis as a six-year-old in an accident and has no particular despair over the loss of his mother. In the fact that he attends a party after the funeral, which he is invited by a friend of his, who is a cemetery grave worker. It beats many of the "beautiful girls", also about a man who returns to his hometown to find himself and hang out with his old friends, with a little "ordinary people" thrown to the side. <br /> <br /> It's really a miracle. Braff can achieve anything in his life, given his father and his useless friends (I'm surprised he didn't kill himself), who still lives their "lives". as if they were still in high school, with dumb bimbos, drinking and drinking, etc. Neither of them even recognized him from his TV role as the "delayed quarterback". (Natalie Portman's character, the most conscious person in the movie, do) and say things like "Hey, I remember you from junior year". These guys are such losers, for them television will be a cultural leap. Even one friend, who made millions of silent Velcro, has no real reason to live, as his entire frame of reference is high school and party. And you don't need big money to celebrate like a high school's neighbor. <br /> <br /> Braff, it is revealed, is heavy medication, which likes "feeling" and dealing with anything, really like an adult. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) a kind of lost girl who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old in a bedroom that resembles a pink-throated house that is inflated to life size. Anyway, they fall in love, and Braff learns to feel again. The clichés come fast and furious. Braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk with his cold, distant father and tells him what it is and the name of the game. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in the home of the millionaire child. Playing feet are in front of a giant fireplace, and the bit is so routine, so standard film sktick, I swear, I half expected someone to walk and throw a sled in the fire. In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to refill his garbage, and Liebman tells him (in the worst line in the movie). "The body can play tricks on you. I once found my husband's cufflinks in my wife's purse, and I didn't have an erection for a year and a half." Obviously, no licensed doctor it will never say, but it is a garbage dump, a wink of Braff, to lose his friends, to let him know he is still thinking of them, just as the "37" joke in "Clerks" was. Kevin Smith's nod to his dirty knowledge. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Braff finds true happiness and gets the dope out; the story is predictable. But if you are going to have a movie that has wall-to-wall clichés, it will give you a beautiful show to catch up with a little bit of life. And do Braff. He has the right kind of vacancy, of accidental acceptance, to make his role as Andrew's extremely healthy and fair, and Natalie Portman (also of Beautiful Girls) gives the movie a big lift. With her small features and shimmering expressions of mood, she steals about the photo as his traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (although much better in "Shattered Glass") is striking as the grave digger. I would recommend 'Garden State' if you can't get enough storybook novels from movies, but if people start to fetch it as a masterpiece, they're just clueless. Braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot, write in a few "f ** ks" and "awesomes" and slap on an acoustic sound soundtrack and keep track of the material. That doesn't mean that.
