As a fan of almost any dramatic drama, with a huge Jane Austen fan, I was shocked by this adjustment. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I was constantly comparing the two and it became very short. It felt very rushed and very one-dimensional, making it very boring. It wasn't subtle for the relationships, especially those from Fanny and Edmund, and little atmosphere, despite being in a beautiful location. Despite looking forward to the Jane Austen season since Christmas, I switched it off after an hour and went to sleep. I will be interested to watch the adjustments of Persuasion and Northern War Abbey, of which I do not have a beloved version, to see if they can drill me in any way.
