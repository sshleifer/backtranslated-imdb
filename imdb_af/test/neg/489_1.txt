Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> But if you're not a kid on the head and then used as a football, you'll agree with me that it's one of the worst and yet hilarious series ever made. To circle a woman who was beaten as a young girl as a young girl, who also murdered her mother, she spends her time drawing, but waiting for it, she becomes her superhero drawings and goes continues to fight crime and is thus "painfully" so clever. The story itself is actually good, but that's just how it is done, Jesse the author and director has no idea how to write a script, just listen to a monologue that contains the 8-year-old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30-year-old man, while her father, who plays a big mustache, just walks through the house all day long looking angry. He shows just how bad the characterization is, especially the little bit he gets angry in the first episode and starts repeating phrase "no longer" while holding his wife's head before killing her with the marble work surface. The next sound sound effect and just his horrible action as everything he can transmit is just brilliant, including to where he is going to beat his daughter with his band, what is done to him, and with a sluggish luck and evil . The episodes themselves can easily contain a good clean 5-minute, but no, Jesse doesn't want it. Little Jesse, making postmodernism as if he had only eaten Donnie Darko and then killed himself. Pointless camera jerks, all at strange angles, repetitive lines, and even senseless rows, only occasionally lifted to fill the long episodes. Finally, the idea is not bad. That's just how it's done. There is also a good character of a fat guy on a couch that doesn't come up enough and is wonderful. I just want to kill his lips, because they look so soft. The character development does not exist, as the main character says only the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to mind, although they contradict each other. But overall, especially Indiana Jones 4 is much better, also tap "Jeeharv" into your tube, and the results can also weigh on the beauty of the world. You will hear very cheap sex jokes, mostly gay ones.
