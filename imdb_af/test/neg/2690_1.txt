I have long tried to understand why people like Shakespeare give so much and every few years to another. I was hoping that this play (my 6th different Shakespeare game) would unlock the happy coffin and marry the wealth of this literary Demigod with me. Bah, I clearly chose the wrong key. <br /> <br /> After the phrase "pound of flesh" was spoken 10 minutes in the film, the main parts of the plot were transparent, sharpened with a clumsy manuscript and lifeless. At each step, the plot is laid two screens at the time. The concept that a dying aristocrat will persuade his daughter to choose a lottery for her future husband is incredible. It's no surprise the wedding jackpot wins, because Bassanio is a main player in the play .... and he's the third man to try .... and there are three socks to choose from ... and she friend has paid his life to the bride and groom. The only real surprise that I watched this movie is that it didn't immediately end with the court case. But as soon as the ring treason started, it was immediately clear what would happen. <br /> <br /> Well, I know millions of you love Shakespeare, not for the surprise in the well-known stories, but for the depth and passion of the characters. But I didn't feel anything for the characters. Rather than being caught up in tension and admiration during the court situation, I have reluctantly put it and hoped it would be soon. <br /> <br /> One day I can only find a Shakespeare game that does something other than drilling. me.
