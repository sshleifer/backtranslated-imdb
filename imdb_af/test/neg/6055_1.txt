Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules in this TV movie, must also be the hottest thing on two legs. Wow. <br /> <br /> But this movie is a 100% distortion of the Hercules story. Like Troy, this movie has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What makes it particularly offensive is that they actually have a gay character, just so people could hate him and make him so deadly and angry as any character in the history of TV or theater. It is urgently offensive because Hercules might have had a wife, because it was the expectation of those old days, but he also had at least a dozen male lovers. So it's ironic that they have to create a gay royal opponent for this movie. No, not ironically. Angry. The creators of this travesty must keep their heads in shame.
