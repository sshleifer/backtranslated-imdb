poor direction, poor plot, unbeatable music, i wonder why Udita Goswami is in the first place in the movie world? She tried to reveal much of her talent (mostly skin), but failed to impress. <br /> <br /> Music wasn't too impressive, but just one song "Jhalak Dikhlajaa" was worth listening to. . <br /> <br /> Aksar, the title? Well, they eventually tried to justify the title of the movie, but it didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> There were many unwanted twists in the story, which made it more boring. But if someone is a Dino Morea fan, please go ahead and watch.
