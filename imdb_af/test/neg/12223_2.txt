The Ten Steps basically have a pretty good starting point for a little short but the execution is simply awful. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so frequent in Irish short films. Actually very embarrassing bad. The girl must move the 10 steps of the basement to change the blown cycle. She phoned her dad who entertained his boss at dinner. The mother, an "actress" with many dubious acting skills, answers the phone and in a harsh voice she tells her not to ring because Dad tries to impress his boss. The actress who plays the boss's wife successfully simulates the mother's poor acting when she tells them their house is haunting. The rest of the film consists of the father who walks his daughter on the phone. The Ten Steps use the inventory techniques in camera movement, lighting and music that you would expect in a below-average horror movie. Poor.
