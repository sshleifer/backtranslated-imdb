It doesn't take balls to make fun of delayed people. Listening to Mencia insists he is brave to make "retard" jokes, unbearable. Also, it doesn't take balls to hide at the chapel. The racial games, the racial games, seem like a lot of the sketches are just Chapelle Show sketch, which is just less funny. <br /> <br /> But the most unpleasant thing in the show is his insistence that he just marches to the beat of his own drum, when he is actually beating many overworking drums. <br /> <br /> I hate this show. I hate that it presents itself as a voice for Latin America. <br /> <br /> And no Carlos, I'm not trying you censorship. If people like it, keep it up. But I personally think it's a bad performance.
