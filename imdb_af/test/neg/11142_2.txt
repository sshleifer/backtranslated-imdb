I like underground movies if they have something to say or show. I tried hard to keep "Trash". I tried to see some artistic performance, or an interesting representation of life in New York City in the early 70's. Or at least entertained by it? But the movie stinks and cannot be called art or entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Trash" is basically an excuse to uncover Joe Dallesandro's naked body for 2 hours while meeting other uninteresting, annoying figures (I agree, it's a beautiful body but no excuse for a whole movie about it?). Holly Woodlawn, like Joe's girlfriend, end up with some good laughs, but then it's too late to save the wasted hours. Lou Reed's classic song Walk on the Wild Side is a better portrayal of those people and that time, even if it is fascinating than they actually were. 1.5 / 10.
