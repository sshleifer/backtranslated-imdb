This movie has changed my life! Hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible, and I haven't recovered from his negative from the 1990 Oscar nominations. And as bright as the Hulk star shines in this movie, you can't discount the brilliant writing and direction that this masterpiece falls into the highest levels of performance in film. If you haven't seen this movie, drop what you're doing and get yourself a copy. I guarantee it will stick out your mind. And if you don't like it, then I only have one question for you .... Watcha will do if the 24-inch pictograms and Hulkamania run on your game !!
