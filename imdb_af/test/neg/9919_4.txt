A comedy story about a teenager who rebel against the church and her minister in a small Norwegian town. The rural environment is picturesque, but the story is rather pretentious and plowing, with much of the film devoted to the quotation of Scripture. It's like watching a religious propaganda movie. Theisen, who just made another film, is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist, like Sundquist as her strict father and Riise as a woman whose Theisen is fascinated. The film aims to be fresh and charming, but rather feels proud and tired. Director and co-author Nesheim, who mostly worked on TV, is not up to the task.
