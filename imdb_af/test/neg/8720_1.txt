It's a total piece of crap. This is an insult to the wonderful book by Frank Herbert. They mutilated the story and characters. The acting is average to bad. The only character that has been done right and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies pretty early in the story and then it's already downhill from there (not that it's a very high hill). <br /> <br /> The 1984 movie was directed by legendary David Lynch. I wasn't too impressed with the movie, but given the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best. Surprisingly, the crappy mini series makes it so much better compared. That was at least true to the book, which I really love. <br /> <br /> They had the chance to do it right, unfortunately it was not taken.
