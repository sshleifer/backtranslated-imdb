I absolutely hated this movie. Although the film wanted to convey a kind of social message, it was done in such a clich√© and melodramatic way as a Mexican soap opera. <br /> <br /> Also the scene was terribly especially Charityn and her son. It's one of the problems with Dominican movies, they use celebrities who can't even act to attract the masses. <br /> <br /> I am even more ashamed of the positive reviews here, which unfortunately mean that the Dominicans are just patronizing what is being done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base on quality .
