Their PURPLE MOMENT <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> Sound Format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Film) <br /> <Two Happy Night Club lovers (Laurel and Hardy) cannot pay their bill, and the violent waiter (Tiny Sandford) is challenged. <br /> <br /> Typical L&H scenario, less significant than some of their best work from this period, yet worth a look. Stan is taking the middle stage this time, caught up in a financial dilemma after holding back part of his wage to fund a night out in town, just to find out - too late! - That his indignant wife (Fay Holderness) replaced his stash with worthless coupons. Some of Laurel's long-standing approaches while slowly becoming aware of the unfolding disaster reveal his genius for characterization and mime. The morality of 1920 is represented by Patsy O'Byrne, who occupies a busy body who enjoys much to warn L & H's respective spouses (Holderness and Lyle Taho) against their husbands' bad behavior. The end fizzles, but the movie still has a lot to recommend. Directed by James Parrott.
