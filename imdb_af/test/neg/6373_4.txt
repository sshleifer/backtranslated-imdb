It was something I was looking forward to seeing. The Ultimate Avengers movies have both exceeded my expectations and since Iron Man was one of my favorite miracle characters, I thought the same production team with the Iron Man solo title could do very well. But the final film was unsatisfactory. I didn't expect them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to Iron Man's gray weapon. The red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes together. Not a huge complaint, but not what I expected from the ads and the box. The worse thing, however, was the story, the acting and the celadu CGI animation for the monsters and Iron Man weapons that were not convincing. It didn't mix well with the cell animation at all. Even on its own, it looks sturdy and lifeless. Tony Stark's character bow, as incredibly slow as it takes, is so forced and unconvincing. I wanted to see this movie, because I love Iron Man, but after I forced myself through the movie, I wondered if they couldn't come up with something as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies.
