A frustrating documentary. Louis Kahn's son, who only saw his father at least during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families that his father created, is taking the task of learning more about his father by exploring its architecture and its life. It looks like a good idea for a documentary, but it ends up flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic problem is that Kahn's son, Nathaniel, is not just one of the film's lead actors, but also director, writer, producer, interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems to be both inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles. Furthermore, while looking like a nice enough man, he doesn't have much screen presence, so the fact that he is the only constant in the film. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel also appears as an unprepared and amateurist interviewer --- there are several points where an interviewer makes an interesting or challenging statement and cuts the camera to a shot of Nathaniel who has little more as an empty star. and a kind of rogue "uh-huh," as if he was a little panicked, that he had to say something to answer. At times I was ashamed to see people who had really interesting things to say about Kahn (or at least better things to do with their time) who realized they were in the hands of an interviewer who would rely on them to lead the conversation. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel's dual role as both documentary and lost son seems to do more to hurt the movie. One feels that some of the interviews are a little hesitant to really unlock negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, presumably because Nathaniel is not clear about digging the truth or just wanting stories about his father do not hear - preferably children who will confirm his hope that his father really cares for Nathaniel and his mother than are likely to be. His passive approach as an interviewer may come directly from this conflict. The only person pushing Nathaniel is his own mother, but the conversations tend to feel a bit like a bad teenage drama (Are you not a parent, mother?) And don't offer much to help us not (or Nathaniel) Kahn or the loyalty he made of those around him. <br /> <br /> What the film desperately lacks, is formed by an experienced and independent hand, not to exclude Nathaniel, but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. turned away from the material, gave more thought to what the interrogators could contribute, and hopefully, cut out portions of the documentary process that just didn't work, like the strange segment with the man claiming Kahn was dying (what made as if Nathaniel had just been overtaken by some loony) or the whole bit about Kahn's first cousin, who didn't want to add anything to Kahn or Nathaniel. or near a Kahn building node n strangers to tell them his father was the designer. (Ahhh, huh. Thaaat is nice, Mr. Umm, I have to go now.) I understand why these things might be important to Nathaniel and that the documentary process is important is sometimes interesting, but that is one of those examples of when a documentary can also be personal. <br /> <br /> Aside, I thought the score written for the movie was great! (But one of the strangest moments in the whole thing to me was when, during the Art Gallery Art Museum tour, the voice over Kahn was quoted as a comparison between architecture and Beethoven's fifth symphony. The music is also played Time "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. An Error? An Miscue? Who knows? It made me laugh." <br /> <br /> Kahn was a great architect and it is clear that he was an unusual man and An intriguing life had story. There is definitely a good documentary about him. One is sympathetic to Nathaniel's search for the father he didn't know, but I don't know if it's an interesting story. It doesn't work as well in this movie either.
