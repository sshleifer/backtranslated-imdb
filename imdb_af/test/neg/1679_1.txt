I haven't watched the first entry in this series yet, but fortunately I could still follow the complex and intricate plot with all its unexpected twists and turns to the authentic originality of the concepts in it. If there is any confusion, I have no doubt that everything I have just said is covered in pure, carefully cherished sarcasm, the species that thrives and grows exponentially when exposed to crap like this movie. A clear sign that it is unimpressive is that it is directed by a visual effect creator, of which the only other credit in the field is a Henry Rooker movie that is not well received. The acting is at its best average, and I testify to anyone not to find it. Scottish computer woman (come on, seriously, what's with that van?) His Russian accent is ridiculous and / or annoying. There is an attempt or two in styling here, and they are reasonable. The action is not terrible. Combatography and editing are good. The music is cool enough. Language is seldom, if so. Violence is pretty bloody. I only recommend it to fans of B-movies, and I will say that you can do worse than this. 10/01
