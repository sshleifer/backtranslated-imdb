Frankly, I don't know why this show lasted so long. ah good, humor is subjective eh? but yes, this show is incredibly unique if you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is irritating. the boys are annoying. All is irritating. The neighbor is annoying. It's just more annoying than funny. the plots are all the same, Tim makes Jill crazy and needs to fix things again. and the last seasons? less said about them the better, who the hell things cancer would be good for a damn sitcom? yes, good idea. if so, home improvement is not a very good sitcom. I would recommend going to News Radio or Signal. If I had to give this show, I would give it 1/10 as it never made me laugh. ever. if so, it's even better than the Nanny already.
