Poor second-string feature of Universal Pictures about a mum's boy actor doing a criminal investigation for the army, turning off the advances of the brash young woman he assigned to romance. Robert Montgomery director and stars in this adaptation of the short story "Come Be My Love", and his acting performances of this era are ceaselessly lazy. The plot is juicy, predictable, and author Robert Carson gave all the very funny lines (as usual for films of this time) to the festive black girl. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl, but they can't do much with this hokey material. * of ****
