This movie is nothing more than Christian propaganda. It started out as a good sci-fi movie and then worked out a syrupy sweet Christian theme in the story that is completely unrelated. I had to cross it halfway because I criticized it for renting it. The Catholic Church officially announced that strangers do not contradict faith in God. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the movie is slightly entertaining, but the dialogue is incredible, writing and acting are mostly rubbish and even though this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided. <br /> <br /> There was apparently some research that the filmmakers made in the phenomenon, but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose of deploying their own paranoid religious views in a valid interesting subject. If you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in devils and angels, you will love this movie.
