I'm all about the undead, but my thoughts aren't sure about the walk, dead frozen. Unfortunately, the CHILLING didn't help me. It is very slow with nothing happening the first 45 minutes, and I hit the "movie enhancement" button several times. By the time the well-designed zombies appear, it's too late and the director (two are rumored to have been filmed) has no idea how to shoot them. Haggerty, Blair and Donahue all seem tired / embarrassing / recovering in one way or another. I will give the film credit as it is the T2 that ends with villains being frozen by liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD offers an extensive promotional line from back in the day that lasts 8 minutes and I would actually recommend watching the movie as a whole.
