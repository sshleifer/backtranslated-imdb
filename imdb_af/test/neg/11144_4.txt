The core issues at play (God and Satan / Good and Evil) can be and must be hugely compelling (as demonstrated by thousands of works of art / music / literature / film). End Days, Unfortunately, is nothing but a 2D Cartoon.

It is both erotic and repulsive - the modernization of vampire themes, the seductive power of evil.
