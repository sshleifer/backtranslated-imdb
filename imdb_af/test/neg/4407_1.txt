It's not plot driven, OK; it is not a character study; there is no action; there is no point, hmmm ... Maybe it is supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of life in Palistine and parts of Israel today in a state of violence, small disagreements, deep-seated hostility, etc. But mostly it's been long, long screens of nothing happening - or things that seem to drop with meaning (a check tower falling to the ground, an Arafat balloon floating in Jerusalem, a curvy tiger woman who bullets bend a halo) You try to analyze something, there is no. <br /> <br /> Bonus: you can see this movie fast ahead and it will make absolutely no difference except that it may be slightly less boring.
