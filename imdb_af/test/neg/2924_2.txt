The most remarkable thing about Talk Talk is how bad it is. The callers' voices all have an ugly, read-a-script ring. An evening with an annoying loudspeaker at a Dallas radio station is told with the pain of a Sartrean glimpse into hell. Stone tries for an existential revelation and instead gets unintentional comedy. When a caller makes a "profound" point about something, Stone kicks the camera into one of his character's faces as they are hit with a traumatic realization that is never exposed to the audience. Bogosses constantly overwork in one of the most annoying acts ever smeared on celluloid. Underestimated classics? Give me a chance.
