INFERNO starts with a pretty impressive for a TVM star chart effect. We were also introduced to a scientist called Heller. Don't you get it? Rather, Hell's, Inferno. So I think someone on the production has some intelligence. However, this is becoming increasingly obvious, as the TVM is advancing the intelligence thrown away by the storyline to address an American TVM audience. <br /> <br /> The story itself is overwhelmed by excess plots with excess stock TVM characters such as the tough liberal teacher trying to save a home boy from a crime, the doctor who lost his medical license, etc. In fact, the story concentrates much more on these characters than the imminent disaster that all the potential tension and drama that the scenario might have, will soon rise into a smoke, and if a TVM, we just know there is no " a discount will not end <br /> <br /> There is a problem on the screen I noticed and that is every time there is an explosion there a massive fireball that seems ridiculous not to mention physically impossible . Look at the scene where the national guard is in a battle with a gang. A soldier burns a grenade in a tower block and explodes the whole building into a fireball. What a little greanade that doesn't contain more than a few ounces of high explosives can do it! No, it can't. There is also another scene of army engineers blowing a dam with plastic explosives and the same fireball effect. Can directors note that the high explosives are not the same as napalm <br /> <br /> Due to the fact that I found INFERNO many watches for a TVM and I did not find myself, I did not want to switch it off no. It had some potential and let me repeat that the special effects are pretty good in the light of the budget and it's not as bad as a TVM as some people do.
