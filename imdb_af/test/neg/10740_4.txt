homecoming; what a great disappointment !! After reading the plot summary (death comes back to vote - against George W. Bush !!!!!) I couldn't wait to see it. It started interesting and it caught my attention right away. Unfortunately, it slowly came down to a boring political satire I didn't need to see (I can only see some good old Aussie comedy for that!). There was almost one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even scary. I couldn't believe it came from Joe Dante, who could easily have pulled it off with an equal balance of excitement and satire. <br /> <br /> The worst episode so far. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
