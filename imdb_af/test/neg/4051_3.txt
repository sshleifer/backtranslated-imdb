The film is about a day in the life of a woman who goes crazy. To show that she is mentally ill, she persuades many and the narrator tells us she is "angry". Along the road she goes out with a thick guy who looks like he can be Orson Welles's brother. He later took a head of a building in one of the only interesting moments in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a strange little movie made very cheap - and it certainly shows. The film was shot without sound (probably 8mm or another cheap type of movie) and has a few sound effects and a persuasive narrative that was added later. In fact, the narrative was the most intrusive and unintentionally hilarious thing I have ever heard, and it is said in such a stupid and top way, you just have to hear it to believe it. Due to these cost cutting actions, it is not surprising that the movie is bad, although the idea of ​​trying this kind of movie was pretty original. Plus, it's VERY hard to make it through the whole movie.
