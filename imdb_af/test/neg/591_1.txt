I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I can never recover. <br /> <br /> I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate art. I love a good movie with profound messages, brilliant cinematography, and good directing. <br /> <br /> This movie is just not one of them. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about this movie is that It is so terribly slow, to the point of boring his audience to death. On the other hand, the order of dialogue goes too fast and there is not enough detail to know people who have not read the book, what is going on. (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I looked at it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /> <br /> Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) <br /> <br /> For the first two minutes you'll be treated to a black screen without music and waiting for the real movie to start. <br /> <br /> For the next five and a half, you see several photos of sunrise and savannah landscapes. As the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene, unless they saw the foundation shot three or four times. <br /> <br /> The next eleven minutes are grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight another, pummel things with a leg. Presumably they are prehistoric men whose evolution is influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you can tell if you haven't read the book. <br /> <br /> * Eventually we get into space. Only to undergo 12 minutes of ships, slowly turn to the Blue Danube Waltz (a beautiful fast waltz as I understand, but here it feels absolutely painful). Eventually we get an innocent dialogue and rather a cryptic outline of the government not to let people land on the moon. We've been wondering about this for fourteen minutes from the Blue Danube and wondering ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity. <br /> <br /> Next comes four minutes to travel a ship across the surface of the moon and harbor at a space station. We get a little more detail in a boardroom scene that follows. Then we are outside to travel with a snail over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, and our ears filled with the terrible ringing (I had no idea that it was a real piece of music!). The monolith does its small light show and then the plot jumps forward. <br /> <br /> * Seven minutes to watch the ship to Jupiter. By now my brain has become in the field. Can it move any slower? Perhaps it is realistic to portray it as such, but we do not yet have to see five or six different shots of the same to understand the concept of its "realism". Let me tell you about this "realism" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut died. Not because I'm a sadist and like to watch people die, but because I was so much annoyed after five minutes about the sound of his dazemem! I'm supposed to care about this character, feel like he's dying! Instead, I waited for happy silence, no matter how it came. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we now get the most interesting part of the movie - the sharing with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The true star of the show is that cold, impersonal, mischievous, shameless, relentless, merciless, bad man of a computer. He is wonderful. And the "open the pod bay doors" sequence is wonderful. But this is too short. And it's not long before the director goes back too long. <br /> <br /> Four minutes for HAL to die. And he dies it. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence with every minute, the voice is getting slower and slower, "Daisy, Daisy," all with low and constant hissing, just as annoying as the heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could feel my brain melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but an old angry psychedelic version of space travel, again with that three-time cursed chorus! We have the idea at the beginning of the row! Why drag it out for so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users, go psychotic and get flashbacks. <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to try to explain the end, mostly because I don't get it myself. He is thought to be in an alien research laboratory and they teach him deep and deep things as he looks older and older and then sends him back to earth as a sort of cosmic heavenly space baby. Not one of these comes in the movie. For everything you know, it's just a series of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. Much of the movie felt like that. <br /> <br /> The first time I tried to watch this movie, I gave halfway through. The second time I suffered from this horrible excuse for a movie, it was to help my sister time to see how long they had lasted. It's so boring. <br /> <br /> Call this crummy movie "art" if you like. I wouldn't. I saw more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I never again submit to this kind of suffering.
