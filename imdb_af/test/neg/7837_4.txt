Maximum risk is quite surprising for someone who has seen more than his movies. Director Ringo Lam made an average action movie, which can be compared to most other middle-class action movies, which is a special predicate for a `Muscles of Brussels` movie. It has a very stylish style, an interesting atmosphere and last but not the cleanest Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme does not make you cry through his acting, he does a relatively good job. Of course you should not compare the maximum risk (oh, what a creative title!) To `Ronin`, but after watching, you beat it is hell of a good movie ... of course, in special standards.
