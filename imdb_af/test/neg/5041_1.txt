There is only one way to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> It's so hilarious. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad, I laughed my ass throughout. The male lead in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous that you'd think he was trying to copy a toy action figure. I know it sounds ridiculous, but if you see it yourself, you can't help it. <Br /> <br /> The monster looks like a CGI man trying to recover the clay monsters you get in old Sinbad movies. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is good for just one thing, a very big laugh for how bad movies can get. <br /> <br /> If you want to see bad acting bad writing and special effects went wrong <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE FILE FOR YOU
