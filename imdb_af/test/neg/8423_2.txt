So what is one to do if you are a porn star with faded appearance? I know, become a pop star! This documentary - and I use the term loosely - follows Colton's trials and tribulations as he tries to turn him from a gay pornstar to a singer of electronic (reading: dance) music. I just wish Mr Ford's voice was as muscular as his arms ... sorry to say his voice is painfully thin. There is not much interest here, but Mr Ford and friends are eyebrows. <br /> <br /> Watch him a song that sounds just like any other thoughtless dance song. See him, travel to New York to "make connections". See him going back to L.A. with little success. See yourself looking in the mirror and asking, "Why do I waste time looking at this mess?"
