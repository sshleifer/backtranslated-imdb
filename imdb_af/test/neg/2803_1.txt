If you are in the mood for laughter (for sheer stupidity), rent this only movie as this movie won't scare a lot of toddlers at a Halloween party! The problem is, there are too many kids, so don't put it in your video recorder for the toddlers. It starts with a little promise and gives you the impression that the boxing artist actually started to watch this movie before the cover is designed, but quickly down into epic stupidity. The "killer scarecrows" are clumsy oafs that are as scary as the one in Oz's wizard, but not so clever. If they only had a brain ...? I got this movie for $ 1.20 at a local discount / close-out shop and even so I feel a little bit ripped off. I think with all the other comments posted here, if you actually pay to see it, you can only blame yourself.
