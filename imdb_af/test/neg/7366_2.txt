It was truly the most painful experience I've had in a kiosk for some time. I will give up such a fine criticism as 'maudlin' or 'historically inaccurate' or 'horse's crap's crap', because our sympathy will simply go straight to these words. If a director makes a great, grandiose love epic, it makes God's will a real DAMN SWEEPING GRANDIOSE LOVE EPIC! Why bother with such laughable, non-convincing harlequin novels and so many annoying pieces of characters that we can care less about when the most decisive battle over Canadian soil occurs? And for the pompous people think 'oh well, this story should center characters!' Well, you're wrong, dead wrong.
