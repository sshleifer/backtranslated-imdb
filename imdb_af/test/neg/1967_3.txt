Yes, in this movie you are being treated to several small snowmen on the attack. This is apparently a very hot climate. Yes, this movie is definitely not taken seriously. It's actually a much worse movie than the original, because at least one has the whole production look like it costs more than a few dollars and a video camera. It has its funny moments, but really plays the cheap of your movie and makes it your intended laugh. It's kind of bad movie making if you ask me. You can't get a good story, your effects are really going to be bad. Let's just make the movie as bad as possible with terrible one liners and we have our movie. The first one had at least a somewhat credible story as the snowman attacked in that one during the winter and not what caused a resort. It also had better effects, this one is just a step or two in front of "Hobgoblins" in terms of samples and you really want to be more than a step two above a lot of hand puppets. Yet it does for all these things with a super end that portrays a great seawater from the mighty frost. Actually I'm just joking, but really it was the funniest part of the movie.
