The only reason someone remembers this steaming cargo of faecal matter is because it is recorded by Pink Floyd. (Or as they were then known, "The Pink Floyd.") Stefan, a very annoying Eurotrash hitchhiker, stops the American model Estelle and continues to grow high and naked throughout the movie ... <br /> <br /> And the point of this is, what exactly? That drugs are bad? Or is only heroin (horse)? The problem is that you don't give characters about the characters and even Pink Floyd was not at their best. When Steffan overflows, you're almost happy to get rid of him because he was so annoying.
