The movie opens with a scene that simply couldn't be. A man wakes up and while his wife stays in bed, he starts his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. Morning blessings are quoted, but only the one who finds Gitai controversial. The rest is conveniently left out. then while in philosophies and a tallist his wife kisses good morning! It is not an accurate portrayal of Jewish prayer in any home, let alone a chassis house. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately portraying the chassidic life. He is interested in adding to his ever-growing list of melodramatic and empty films. The mikka (ritual bath) scenes are far from accurate and his Jewish wedding was laughable, as it did not even approach the atmosphere of a chassis wedding. I have a lot of problems with the chassidic way of life, but I don't use Amos Gittai's comment on these issues. He will think that the chassidim are all dense conformists with severe depression. I cannot agree with the chassidic lifestyle, but I admit that the chassidic life is very low. Amos Gitai is blinded by his own secularist pseudo-intellectual stubbornness and is therefore unable to portray an accurate representation of the chassidic life. Apart from his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of the chassidic life, Gitai also fails in other aspects. The plot is full of holes, the dialogue is loaded with silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and the acting while it is sometimes powerful is too often loaded with melodrama. The movie goes on and on and the end is not worth stabbing. see if you have to, but be warned. If you want to learn about chassidic life, go to the communities and talk to chassidim. Don't rely on Gittai's movie!
