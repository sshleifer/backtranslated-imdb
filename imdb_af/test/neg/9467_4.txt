The lines in the title of this review are the first lines in the theme song of this movie, a wonderful deadly parody of the (my opinion terrible) song "My Favorite Things" of "The Sound of Music". And this fun little detail is not the only thing that makes The Body Shop aka. "Doctor Gore" (1973) recommended to me fellow Gore / Trash fans. The film, which almost entirely by J.G. Patterson Jr., producer, writer, director and leading man as the eponymous dr. Gore served, is undoubtedly a fool, but it is also undoubtedly amusing and that everyone involved, probably Patterson, was especially aware. that they didn't actually make a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brandon (Patterson), a well-known but totally insane plastic surgeon, lost his beloved wife Anitra, a model, in an accident. Together with his brother assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey), he now deprives beautiful young women to build himself a new, perfect woman from their body parts ... <br /> <br /> "Doctor Gore" is undoubtedly a movie of the "so bad it is," but it also has characteristics above the ordinary ridiculous trashiness. Mad science has always been one of my absolute favorite Horror topics, and it is also one of the coolest topics for ridiculous Gore Trash flicks. Obviously it's shot at a minimal budget, "Doctor Gore" pays him a tribute to the Frankenstein films, especially James Whale's masterpiece "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), and resembles the early Troma / Herschell Gordon Lewis Gore flicks like "Blood Feast" (1963) - just that it looks much cheaper and harder. Obviously, J.G. Patterson's motif was not just to make a fun gore movie: a little ugly, strange colleague, his role of dr. Brandon gave Patterson the opportunity to make with a few hot, scantily clad young women (who would later end up as donors in Dr. Brandon's lab). <br /> <br /> Most of the gore is actually pretty good in terms of the obviously small budget. The dialogue includes some very hilarious lines ("Get it, it's probably the door ... and put on a dress so they don't see you are a hunchback."). Besides the aforementioned theme song, 'Doctor Gore' also includes a wonderful look of a country group called Bill Hicks and the Rainbows - my new favorite band, NOT. For the rest of the film, I wonder if Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who play the hunchbacked assistant, are twins or even the same person - the two look exactly the same, and have two unrelated, obese, red-faced guys who see it. Strange in a movie would be a great coincidence. Other than J.G. Patterson, most of the role-players have never done other films. This is the first movie I saw from the couple by Patterson. Unfortunately, the man died of cancer in 1975. <br /> Overall, "Doctor Gore" is a movie that is definitely not for everyone. In fact, it's total crap. But it's also amusing, and recommended to me fellow fans of strange and cheap camps. Dictionaries should show a screenshot from this movie under "Trash".
