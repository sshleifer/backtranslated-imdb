This movie is not worth watching the theaters, I did and I did not like it, the effect on the movie is really well done and you get a laugh here and there but the story is really look as if they have run out of ideas, and what is it about locomotive and odin coming together? It completely destroys mythology, and I think they have forgotten that loki's powers only worked during the night !! If you really MUST see this movie rent it out when it comes out, don't go to the movies! <br /> <br /> They could have done much more with it than they did, feeling that they just wanted to make a movie to show cool animation and effects
