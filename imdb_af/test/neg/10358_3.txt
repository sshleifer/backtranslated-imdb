Cruddy, innocent .. not smoking, drinking or cyclists, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make it moronally feasible for a bad biker movie, post-biker (mining) time. They knew it, we knew it. Adam Roarke and Slate were wasted .. but they continued. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY thing to catch the final biker movie to RUN, ANGEL, RUN (who also has good actors - such as Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it. They tried to live. But, Jocelyn Lane (of two Elvis bad movies, TICKLE ME and something bad) in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with J. Slate fighting for honor. It is worth seeing, but it sucks. But check it out. Non-biker, non-smoker, non-captivating, "biker" types with hot chicks are worth it.
