A couple of friends and I visited the video store a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent a few vintage non-sighted movie. My friend grabbed Head of the Family and we were greeted with a head in a wheelchair. Well, that laughed us and we decided to make a bet to see who was going to the desk and paying for the movie. Well, you guessed it, it was me !!!!!!!! I have never been so embarrassed in my whole life. We came home and switched it on and we walked across the floor for about 45 minutes because it was the funniest movie in the world. I can't remember much of it, but one thing I remember was the blonde girl who went with a guy in the back of a shop every 5 minutes. That head made me laugh and if I look at other people's comments, it makes me even laugh. The head of the family is so good and the head is funny and I still ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
