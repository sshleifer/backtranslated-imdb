Interferencia starts unemployed Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something strange on his phone, he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diana and arranging to meet her. Soon, Martin reads a local newspaper and saw the cover story about a prostitute being murdered and thinking back to what he had heard. Martin trusted in his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) & Aaron (Oliver Kolker), but they didn't believe him. Shortly after the same thing happened, the phone call, the man, the prostitute and her death reported in the papers. Martin decides to find the killer and put an end to his deadly spree, but who is it? <br /> <br /> This Argentine production apparently shot in just eight days (why so long?) on a budget of about $ 3,000 (why so much?) was written and directed by Sergio Esquenazi & I can't the glowing comments Interferencia believes on the IMDb. From 195 user ratings as I write these 113 of them, this pile judges crap 10 out of 10, it's a pity, but there's no way someone should give a movie so badly, a pretty literally perfect score of 10 out of 10. India A score for a movie on IMDb has been determined. That's it, I honestly don't think if you showed Interferencia to 195 average people, more than 100 would consider it absolutely perfect, no way on earth. The user comments are also incredibly positive, all by IMDb users who have only commented on one movie, this. The one user (except me) who actually wrote more than one comment, gave it a rock under 1 out of 10 that just sounded right. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but I will put my life on the fact. Most of the positive comments are from negligent accounts, which are purely too big, this piece of the crap-up. Where do I start? How on Earth can I adequately describe how bad Interferencia is? The plot is a mess that actually lives or dies through its terrible twists and turns, while most turns a plot on its head and changes the perspective of everything that has gone before in a smart and appropriate way and is true surprises here Interferencia, the strings destroy the first half of the movie and make it completely useless in a "it really doesn't happen" a way and the twist is so poorly handled that it puts you more questions than it answers. What made Martin angry? Why did he suggest the phone calls? Why did he introduce a killer? Why did he propose the newspaper headlines? No explanation is given for Martin's behavior during the first hour or so of the film. It's just this absurd revelation that it's all in his mind. That's all the outline there is. Then there's a story about Martin's missing wife and her lover before Martin, for reasons that are inexplicable, did not begin to kill his friends for any apparent reason. I'm sorry, but Interferencia is so bad, it's so boring, it's so badly written and thought I honestly can't think of a positive thing to say about it. Sorry guy, but that's how I feel. Interferencia is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is a complete debris both conceptually and technically. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb, Interferencia was hot in just eight days. To be honest, it doesn't feel that way at all. No, it feels like it's been shot in five days! The whole movie is a glance, Interferencia probably has the worst night shoot I have ever seen. It's as if no attempt was made to light the screens, it's as if the makers just went into a dark room or basement, or whatever and just shot the scene, whether you could see something. The screens that are set in the daytime have this terribly unnatural blue green tint for them, without any obvious reason, which just looks and becomes increasingly irritating. This strange tone is not repeated on indoor scenes, so they are also pretty bare and noticeable. There is no real terror or fear, in fact I would say Interferencia is more of a thrill than an abomination. As far as it goes, there are two stripping heads in a fridge, a knife is stuck in someone's mouth and nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb, it has a budget of about $ 3,000, which Interferencia is one of the lowest budgeted movies ever released commercially? Some people just think because a movie has a low budget, all reasonable display standards must go out of the window and we must accept any old shit, wrong! To watch it on DVD, you still have to pay good money. Personally, I think we have the right to expect a good product. If it can be released and praised as being worthy of Oscar, we can all release our holiday video camera recording (including the embarrassment of karaoke footage and scenes of total blackness, as we have forgotten to take out the lens kit) and win top prizes at the next Cannes film festival. ! The acting is terrible, though the female head Virginia Lustig is actually quite sexy and helps relieve the pain of the last twenty minutes, as she has a fair bit. <br /> <br /> Interferencia is an absolutely horrible movie, seriously, I beg you not to be fooled by all the false positive comments. There is no way someone is not involved or some kind of agenda will give it a 9 or 10 out of 10. An amusing mess that is really awful to sit on. by. Sorry, but that's how I see it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind ... you're warned!
