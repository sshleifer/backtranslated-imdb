Everyone raised a lot to live and there were many hype when this show was voiced. Now it's easy to explain why it didn't meet expectations. First, this show did not create a realistic world of pre-teens, as Rugrats captured the world and the imagination of toddlers. Secondly, the show's character is stereo-type (Angelica: white-devoured blonde as opposed to Suzie: colored girl of modest family, ...) or boring (Tommy, Chuckie) and irritating (Dil). Finally, there is not one gram of innovation or an original plot line. In summary, All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a sequel to a show like Rugrats. It's boring, without imagination, and the producers don't even know how 10-13 year olds act. To be accurate, should Angelica and Suzie bra sizes not be compared to fighting over who is better at doing their jobs?
