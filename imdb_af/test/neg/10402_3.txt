Fear and desire are especially important for Kubrick's obsessive people, who can blast this pretentious trap for signs of his still greatness. Kubrick immediately tried to ensure that the film was not legally written or made available on legitimate video. He considered it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his evaluation. It's a bad and boring movie. At 68 minutes it still looks longer than Barry Lyndon! It is of historical importance and has exciting moments. This is a tough movie to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), although it may change as Kubrick's estate expires and released on video. Only recommended for Kubrick enthusiasts.
