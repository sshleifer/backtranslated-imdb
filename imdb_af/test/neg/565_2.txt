Involved punishment and gloom Peter Watkins is slumbering about the dam to tackle the American legal system around 1971 with this priceless piece of juvenile paranoia leaning so far, leaving it constantly inundation. Watkins is a pure tourist, as he opposes this gang gang tragedy with clich√© freaks, hippies, and black revolutionary rapacious happy police and military and a kangaroo court tribunal consisting of disapproving calcified adults who make poor fashion statements. Talk about a revolution. <br /> <br /> In Penalty Park we have a radical youth versus corrupt system, since dissenters convicted of crimes get the choice of imprisonment or a three-day move over Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course, the law enforcement officers who are monitoring their voyage are not playing the right way and combined with the stifling heat that seems to seal the fate of our protagonists. <br /> <br /> Penalty Park features elements of Kafka in the environment as well as theme. Trials are held under a large canvas tent, where prisoners are held with a hardcore defense, or a group of inquisitors (such as members of Silent Majority for a Peaceful America) are left behind. No group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometimes look at a teenage parent's battle over the keys to the car. Mostly, this is just one side that says what's wrong with America, the other says what's right with no one offering solutions to change. Meanwhile, the Martyrs of the Penalty stumble across the dessert while police with rifles act like twelve year olds. This kind of class has the look and feel of some of my 70-year-old filmmakers when we were younger and knew more than we are now. <br /> <br /> Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he sees as a corrupt powerful couple. Culledon was a strong accusation of military atrocities in the 18th century Scotland which is still resonating. War team is a raw sobering look at the core aftermath that is required to look at everyone. Penalty Park also has its value, but for others than the intended reason. Watkins vision today is a handbook example of the left-to-side tilting culture 70's paranoia and given the times (Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7). Such a strong hysteria was not so far from the truth. But 35 years later, the fever dropped and Punishment Park with its unobstructed point of view is a beautiful, foolish ride.
