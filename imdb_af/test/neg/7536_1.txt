I think we should think of some wonderful salt-of-earth characters. Unfortunately, it is lame and laborious. <br /> <br /> As always with any production in Newcastle, there are numerous shots of the Tyne Bridge and regular efforts to show how big 'characters' Geordies are. The viewer may never forget where the movie was set, as if the rest of the world cares for Newcastle and its residents. <br /> <br /> If you are well observed, the literate and original work remains clear.
