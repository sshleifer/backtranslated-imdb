When Hollywood tries to understand what an "intelligent person" is, they fail so miserably, finding it difficult to put words into the mouth of the alleged "genius". <br /> <br /> Right, any genius runs around trying to rub its superiority in every case. Sure, they hang out in bars and choose battles ?? it is not like they are (made-up) autistic nerds that are never colored. <br /> <br /> Plus, if you are a genius, you know everything about Maths and History and Politics and of course you are constantly up to date with current events and thorough analysis. Coz these things, like, everyone is going together, you know? <br /> <br /> Plus, you're walking around all the time with a smirk. You're just a sly boy of a you-know-what, that's how it is. <br /> <br /> And of course you smoke, like someone who has never smoked, but you smoke together, it's like cool stuff, you know. And you're different. It is understood. <br /> <br /> And of course you can fight ?? you are a bully. A bully who finds time to study 10 000 books when he doesn't lift weights. And when he doesn't smoke or drink beer, he follows a strict health service. <br /> <br /> And are you dating a 30-something college student? Minnie Driver. Well, I won't even comment on Matt Damon. Team America has already hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> This movie is a daydream of a Beavis & Butthead-type student (ie 95% of them): "Yes, that's how I would be if I were a genius." Stupid people and stupid writers in this case cannot imagine the lives of genius.
