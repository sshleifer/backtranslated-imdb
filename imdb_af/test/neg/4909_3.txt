This movie is a third attempt at a compelling, ghostly thriller and failed at all three points. It almost managed to keep my attention, as the protagonist was slowly seen and predictably violated all the rules of life he had comfortably set at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> But it's in the last 25 minutes or so those things really start spiraling. A vague plausible plot line (and it is generous) becomes completely reckless because suddenly new characters from nowhere appear and random and bizzar events are never explained. <br /> <br /> It won't be as bad as the mini-dissertation 'It's so cute, the acting so wood (despite a strong British role) and the direction so uninspiring. This is not an example of good British filmmaking, nor if it will make a Tarantino eyelid, at least not in comparison with its previous work. <br /> <br /> My advice in this case, if it's hard to hold on, don't waste your effort. If you're a Brit like me and it's in your local video store, make it clear. Perhaps going to the video titled "American Beauty" - now it's an example of great British direction.
