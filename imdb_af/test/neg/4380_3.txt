It's just another bad Chuck Norris movie. Norris plays a policeman on the trail of a twisted ceremony of women. He drove the man away three years before, but the man somehow gets through the bars in the nutshell he comes into. It looks like dental floss. Then the killer escapes in a cleaning car and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater being undergone. Irish Jack O'Halloran is the best thing in this movie, but like Superman II, he doesn't say a word. Somehow it's supposed to make him more threatened. Ron O'Neal of Super Fly Celebrity and Steve James are wasted playing the city's mayor and Norris sidekick respectively. The film also contains the idiotic subplot of Norris and his girlfriend who has an illegitimate child; it is so 1980s. When Norris's "serious" acting turn is linked to the exaggerated musical clues, the predictable scene is predictably presented. The movie is an attempt to go through. The build-up while looking for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with Norris who crawls through the shadows to discover the hiding, but the final is disappointing after it has started in such a promising manner. It's another disappointment from Cannon Films, and it plays like a movie made for television. * of 4 stars.
