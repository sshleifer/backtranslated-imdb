The ruins are at Turistas, since Deep Impact was Armageddon, a worse version of a light entertaining movie, except much worse. One of the characters is supposed to go to the medical school, so why are they all delayed? "You can't keep cutting." Best-line form this movie. It's a horrible movie. I like horror movies but fully appreciate that most of them are horrible, but have some high expectations for this movie after seeing the reviews on IMDb. The situation they are in is stupid and how they handle it makes them stupid. It's awful, the one thing that makes it somewhat palatable is its cool Australian backdrop, despite spending the vast majority of the movie in one place.
