I still find it hard to believe that a fine - like earlobe - has transformed Dean Koontz's novel into these totals. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad, it's disgusting. Angry to all who participated. Shame on you! <br /> <br /> P.S. The fact that persecutors have appeared shows just how little taste and discretion remains in Silver Screen Land.
