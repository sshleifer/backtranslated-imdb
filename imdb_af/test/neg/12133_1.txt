Heh ... I'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, let it be available for rent! <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the very bad slasher flicks that just exist for the T&A and the inexpensive laugh. The story line crosses a little "Texas Chainsaw massacre" with a screwed-mom-centered back story reminiscent of "Psycho", and a bit of the good old women-in-chains, hard-as-nail ex- bro breeds throw in good measure - in other words, complete unoriginal in half-naked women seasoned with a bit of idiot! If the director tries to make the Qu√©bec wetland pass, it leaves South America. Bayou country is sad, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Funny thing for me is, I was actually at the forefront of this movie as I was part of Ratchford, the movie's "star" at the time. It was painful to watch while Jeremy sat down in his seat while the movie unfolded its spotted wings. <br /> <br /> I'm delighted to see Ratchford grow after this glimpse of a first movie into one hell of an actor. He can often be seen on Canadian copdrama "Blue Murder", featured on "CSI", not to mention his role in the classic Clint Eastwood movie "Unforgiven" - we forgive you, Jeremy! It was a rocky beginning, but you did well, man! <br /> <br /> ~ T.Paul
