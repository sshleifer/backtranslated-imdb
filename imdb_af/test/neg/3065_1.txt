The evil never looked so bad. They meant it. <br /> <br /> When a friend of mine chose this DVD at a half-price bookstore, I didn't know what to expect. I mean, based on the title, I knew it would be worth a laugh, but I didn't realize how legal it really would be. <br /> <br /> The first time I missed the dialogue (if you could call it) because we were all too busy making fun of the plot of the movie. It seems to have been written in less than a week, and they didn't have the budget to go back and fix some of the minor bugs. Wait, did I say "minor"? I mean exactly the opposite. For example, the main character is credited with "Ken", but a few times he is called "John" by the movie. <br /> <br /> If the plot holes are not enough for you, watch the play. No one seems to worry about the zombie attacks in their state, including the main character's mother, who is missing for days while sitting in front of a fireplace to read a book. <br /> <br /> The budget constraints on the movie are equally hilarious. Maybe they didn't have a permit to film wherever they were, because during the BIG MOTORCYCLE CHASE SCENE, the characters follow all traffic regulations. The zombies, who killed only twenty people, actually stop at a stop sign coming from a parking lot. I don't even do it, but then I'm not a biker zombie. The end of the movie seems to be running out of money. It ends so suddenly that it wants you more. At second thought it just ends soon enough. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a good time with your friends, look for this movie. This is a great unintentional comedy.
