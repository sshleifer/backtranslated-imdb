I thought id made this movie because I am currently making a film about a mysterious box. So it would be nice to see how this film took and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. <br /> <br /> Before going to the theater, I had a high expectation of this movie. With actresses, like Cameron Diaz, you'd expect the play to be especially great. the act was a kind of decay for the movie, the characters accents changed through the movie that made it incredible. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​a strange box that can make your dreams come true, but destroy others, is such a brilliant story, but I feel the director lets it down, this movie has the potential could have been better than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie had no means. It was too confusing and needed a steady storyline. no one wants to go to the cinema and think what I just watched, "I didn't get it at all." Sometimes it can be exciting and people watch it again, but this film never makes people want to hear from the movie again. continually watching I noticed that half of the audience left before the end. I feel every single person is lowered, watching this movie because of the high expectations and the slower parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> We can put the bad points on one side ... scene where the boy is in the bathroom. It was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was composed imagined me, and how devastating and scary it would be to be in that position. the relief and effects made it look good, this scene looks slightly more than 1990s than the 1970s this movie is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This movie was confusing because it had so many different pieces for it. parts you would expect to sum up at the end of it, but it didn't, it went completely against the expectations of the audience, although the film was left on a wreath pendant, and not the audience gave the reason why things could does not happen. work and do really well, but this one does not have, it was a creative, different unusual film I thought. It had the potential to be better, it wasn't disappointed. Don't buy it honestly on DVD.
