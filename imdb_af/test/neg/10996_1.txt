Bad editing, bad production values, bad continuity, unreliable, bad dialogue ... these movies are bad, bad, bad. However, if you want a movie to have fun on (a la MST3000), this is your movie. I won't predict that much money is being spent on it, but if you see this movie, make sure it is with many greasy, eternal friends.
