The film originally seized as a successor to the "The Slumber Party Massacre" series. This film falls flat on his face with a new title. First, if you include the word "massacre" in your movie's title, you'll deliver better. This one certainly doesn't. There are no gore, not on screen murders and no chain saw, as the goat art will make you believe. Instead, we get a paper thin, exaggerated plot of a group of cheerleaders stranded in an abandoned cabin heading for a soccer match, one by one. Again, this movie could have been good if the gore quotient picked up a bit. Why directors, especially those who make direct-to-video flashes, are afraid to show ANY Gore is outside of me. Now, I'm not a big fan of excessive gore, but come on ... why would anyone else have a movie called "Cheerleader Massacre ??" Rent? In addition to that problem, the film suffers from a lap-to-home video camera cheap. It looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren't that good. This is trying to find out what the killer might be, but even fail it. The end is a ridiculous mess. People, if you walk over this movie, walk away and go find the original "Slumber Party Massacre." 2 out of 10.
