This film definitely made me laugh, but that doesn't mean it's just funny. Well, again, my friends and I really enjoyed watching. <br /> <br /> I doubt there is something about this movie that wasn't done at least twice before, just like the plot itself. All the characters are overused movie ticket roles that don't even require acting skills; accordingly, such skills are not provided. We have the corrupt policeman, a relentless killer claiming his men and their families, giving nothing of people he shoots on the forehead at such a distance as spitting blood on his face. We showed the "exhausted policeman on the edge" so nicely in the discussion boards of this movie; We have the old one-day-retirement police spokesperson, who should be identified almost immediately as the most likely man on the inside, as he has the most to win and he didn't express a reliable word in the film. . Looks like a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gang king was a copy of all the previous great black gangster kings in film history (they could only have called him Marcellus Wallace), but just a little harder and more relentless, because something must emphasize that we also know actually good movies. Then we finally have the HIGH UPDATED doctor who can't think of anything reasonable to do once the situation of her normal life differs and which puts the majority of the movie into a corner that is helplessly trying to figure out how to fast stick to the weapon she was given. DO NOT USE. <br /> <br /> The entire storytelling story is not interesting, not original (used twice earlier), and this movie is absolutely nothing interesting about it. There is the initial sin, then the siege, then the assault, is then the escape attempt. Meanwhile, a bunch of tense, stressed, frustrated policemen and thugs succeed a police assault team with hi-tech equipment and the very important benefit of VISION. Then again, at night, with the power failure and with a snowstorm falling over, there is certainly a lot of light coming in, so who really care about night vision. <br /> <br /> But the best part comes right at the end. In the first scenes showing Precinct 13, we see it is situated on the outskirts of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. From this point on, the besieged walk might be a hundred yards in a sewer and where do they end? Some rose end up right in the middle of a forest! NUCLEAR! Where did the forest come from? Who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How is this bush in the last scene suddenly on a hill over the city concerned, while in the scenes in the woods, deceptive? <br /> <br /> From here I leave judgment to you and your common sense. Watch this movie if you are looking for an unintentional good laugh, I can really recommend it.
