I seem to be in the minority on this one, but I found that a real thing is skemalties, confronted and generally unpleasant. Not that the play was so bad, but the characters were no more than archetypes (the bad father, oh, but wait, maybe he's not irreparably bad, maybe there might be a decision ...). Admittedly, the woman I was with loved the movie, so maybe you will like it. But I didn't.
