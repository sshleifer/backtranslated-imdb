... If you've been laughing too much for a long time, take a break. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this view, I decided to turn it on and check it out. out for myself. Everything that each of the people said about this performance is absolutely true. Mind of Mencia is like a half hour version of Mad TV, but somehow jokes. <br /> <br /> One shit I had was the discontent to watch, "The Second Annual Stereotype Olympics". What's funny about black man struggling to swim, or a gay man named "Sparkles" who wins a banana game? Neither of these concepts is particularly novel, informative or amusing. Do we really need a joke about Star Wars for every episode? The film came out like 30 years ago. Mencia's funny stuff solution throws some of Hispanics in some stereotypes and throws in some "beaners" there; and call it a day to go home to roll around in its hope of money. Pure comic genius. <br /> <br /> Then he cut off Jeff Foxworthy on a second show I watched with a "Your gay as ...". You can only imagine the roaring laugh he had when playing in a Ryan Seacrest gay joke. It's not like one of those already killed. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big fan of Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer movies, please stay away from this show. Especially when there are authentic comedians like Dave Chappelle who can joke about racial and racism and still be informative.
