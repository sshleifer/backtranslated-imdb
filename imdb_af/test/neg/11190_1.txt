A man kicks a dog 2 'in the air. <br /> <br /> A woman kicks a cow out of her bed. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a violin in the pavement. <br /> <br /> A woman hits a blind man in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Jesus raped a young girl. <br /> <br /> There you have it. I just saved you an hour of your life. Certainly, there are those who would appeal to this "shocking vanguard of cinematic expression". But I have no different from the puerile, disconnected videos I shot in my 9th class with my friends. Except we never had a real cow. <br /> <br /> Having heard endless sermons from beard-soothing artists of how such an important movie is, I thought it would be worth my time. Don't make a mistake, it's a crap. If I still hear one more person, Buñuel calls the "father of cinematic surrealism", I think I'm going to bump someone. Anything, he gave a big step back 10 years from the surrealistic start of his seniors Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F.W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari). It made a joke out of the whole thing, as if Buñuel didn't have the confidence to embrace the art sarcasm, sans l'absurdité. It would take Buñuel another 40 years before refining his style in something admirable. Skip the early stuff and jump straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed with his work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure he'll agree. In 1977, Buñuel himself said that he would burn all the pressure of his old movies. In this case I would like to throw the lighter fluid.
