Well, it's a monogram quickie from the dreaded era of the 40's when poverty study studios released a whole bunch of "horror" movies that are almost unbelievably boring. So I expected the worst. <br /> <br /> The story relates to a doctor who somehow worked to restore life to the dead by using a room full of non-utilitarian electrical appliances that sparkle fine. There is a dog's heart that hangs under a bell and gets fit, which we are informed is proof that its method is perfect. <br /> <br /> A brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and the mention of an important plot point precedes the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a rather unrammable order - even with the sparks. The important plot point is that a convicted murderer is only executed at midnight, which seems to be when the young man is revived. It is no surprise that the young man is very different after his experience; apparently amnesic and with a strange desire to visit the tracks of the underworld and get acquainted with some gangsters ... <br /> <br /> It is difficult to explain why this is not completely incompatible, but maybe it's enough to say it is lightly interesting and contains several murders and some interesting characters. By the end, it even starts with a little real tension and a confrontation that is straight Hitchcockian. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to warn for a very, very bad end. A noticeable unnecessary pain in the ass sorta ends. After the plot resolved reasonably effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know the sort of thing ... It's all a dream. Never happened before.
