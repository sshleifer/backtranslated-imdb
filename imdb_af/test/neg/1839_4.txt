This relatively dark Hong Kong "minipiece" is the perfect desert island movie for video age groups (at least the first half of it). Every setup, every scene, every sequence is an excuse to look up a girl's dress, look at her breasts, look down at her, and learn about her tight cross. What sets it up is the main character's distorted promises, of course! Everyone involves slim-dressed, sexy Chinese ladies with nothing but sexual servitude on their minds. <br /> <br /> The plot is thickened by a murderous subplot, voodoo puppetry and some rape and looting. <br /> <br Some of the sex scenes are pretty hot and the gore is liberal, but the supernatural elements imported in the second half feel half-baked and the plot developments are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Clearly, manufacturer of garish garbage Wong Jing was in a terrible hurry to get it in and out of the theaters. <br /> <br /> The arty title sequence did not mislead this dressed dot.
