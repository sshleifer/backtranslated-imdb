It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen it has no plot and the plot it has is very scattered. The story line is lacking in both content, tension and captions, as it seems that story line is in Russian. The set seems to be just one room with different lighting effects. At the moment you think something is going to happen, you are dropped by the total lack of acting, drama, tension, horror, gore, story and mythology. The live style was killed (The Fisheye camera). It seems that the only action in this movie is within the last 10-15 minutes and the action is getting worse by the players' inability to correctly portray the tension. The only interesting thing about this movie was my dog ​​barking at the surround sound.
