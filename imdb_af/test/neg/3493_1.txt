This movie is bad. Not bad. In absolute terms, bad. <br /> <br /> The dialog jumps off the screen and cuts your face with its thorough artificial banter and then defects your ability to track even trace amounts of subtlety. <br /> <br /> Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be particularly bad. I live in the city of Angels, I can testify. What is so terrible about the bigotry in Los Angeles is its treacherous nature. It crawls to you with a look or a swallow word. Just at the edge of a full fist fight, it almost never comes straight and says, "Why he had to be black!" <br /> <br /> I can clearly see that the blackjackers are black, the detectives partner is Spanish, the DA is white. As long as the movie rolls through the projector, I can bring the footage, music and words to the conclusion without just telling me the conclusion. Characters emulate, and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a partnership and trust between film maker and audience. That trust is raped by this movie. <br /> <br /> A good movie pulls you in the direction of an audience, and it leads you with directions to drive to a point. This movie beats you with its point and insults you and your intelligence along the way. My unanswered question is, why did we as a society jointly say "thank you?"
