I have 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects! Plot is sloppy and very predictable. Most of the actors look like extras with no experience! Everyone has Scottish accent. It's like watching a Star Trek Scotties' crew without the personality or charm. Unnecessary scenes from people who set up tents! Tents with all the so-called high-tech equipment! Actors who seem to be unsure that the camera was on them. Nothing to worry about if these people survive or not! It looks like it's in someone's backyard and garage with low end equipment! Nothing looks original or even slightly entertaining. Don't waste your time!
