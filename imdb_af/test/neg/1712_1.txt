First, I would like to apologize for my "1" rating. The only reason I give this film such a high rating is that I can't dig in negative numbers. All this is a spoof, and I certainly tried to properly consider it, but left me with a certain idea, namely; "It's probably the worst movie ever made." At any level and in any probable quantification of qualitative measurement ... Before I tried, I am just like any born-for-cult video distribution movie as the next buff, but seriously, this movie has rhinos sinking balls. .. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I targeted this "movie", I would have seen it as a legitimate cause of suicide.
