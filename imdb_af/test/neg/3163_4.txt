Frankly, I meet the real Han Su Ying and see her portrayed by an American actress who has no parable of anything that makes Chinese turn my head while I watch this movie. Why can't Hollywood get Nancy Kwan instead. true to the story ... cos for the sake of the good ... Dr Han Su Ying is Chinese I know cos I personally met her <br /> <br /> and look at the whole cast .... so little Asian faces in a movie about an Asian love story also make me wonder. <br /> <br /> I think the play is good, but without the right Asian faces in an Asian love story, the plot is so hot and a whole load of Baloney <br /> <br /> it's just like ' another movie I know of 'THE CONQUEROR' thinks my eyes protrude when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan !!!!! <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse. ... On earth can a man born in MONGOLIAN STEPPES come a southern accent of Alabama? !! and a cheap imitation of anything asian <br /> <br /> good sadness <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised to see Dr Martin Luther King Jr play one of the boys of the black and white minstrel show <br /> <br /> See it <br /> <br /> and download the entire roof! <br /> <br /> Cheers
