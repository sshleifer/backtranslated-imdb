Lucio Fulci, a director who is not fully known for his subtlety, is trying his hand at black humor in Touch of Death, a TV movie about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psychologist who seduces and widows rich widows start with his gambling debt. <br /> <br /> Starting with a wonderful scene in which the deadly lothario uses his latest victim via chain saw, stocking machine and hungry piglets, the attack of death begins promisingly enough, but Fulci soon loses control of proceedings, the launch of a strange sub-plot that includes a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy-handed "comic" scenes. There are several graphic murders that are extremely violent and abominable in the real Fulci mode, but even the high level of blood loss does not stop it as one of Fulci's poorer attempts. <br /> <br /> As I found with many of his other films, an understandable story is not quite on the agenda when Lucio is behind the camera. This film has many peculiarities that left me more than a little confused: why didn't Lester destroy all his victims by dispensing the disinfection method from the beginning? Why are all his victims either hairy or disfigured? What is hell all over? <br /> <br /> Many are considered by Fulci as one of the "big ones" of horror cinema; I do not understand his popularity and find the majority of his films I have seen so far, generally lacking in both decent narratives and technical skill. Touch of Death certainly does nothing to change my opinion.
