In terms of historical accuracy, it's the absolute worst Roman movie I've ever seen. The list, not only of errors, but of plot ideas that are flat impossible, will last longer than the three-hour movie, but just to give you an idea. <br /> <br /> Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as Liberal Democrats, taking the side of the "people" against "the nobles." This is remarkably absurd. The emperors were as noble as you could get. Their interest was to consolidate power and stabilize a country destroyed by 150 years of civil war. There were reformers, especially the Gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years ago, and some advocated the rights of ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that are completely ridiculous if you know something about the period. "Cleopatra", along with Richard Burton, will give you a much better idea of ​​how events unfold, imaginative, though. <br /> <br /> Historical accuracy is one thing. Acting and dialogue is something else, and here this movie is dangerously close to a bad junior high school production. I laughed several times, especially when Julia, the daughter of August, met a lover. They link passionately, as she breathes: "My father ..." "Oh, your father, your father ... Your father would not approve it." Peter O'Toole is, at worst, forced to cut his way through many pumpkins and stupid lines. The actor who plays Augustus as a young man is so nebbish --- and the character is written as such --- it is impossible to see him as the cunning, clever, Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here he is just a shutter that has to be told what he needs most of the time. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Rampling manages to appear with dignity from an underwritten role as Livia, the wife of August. If she plays a bigger role, she can have saved this production of absurdity. <br /> <br /> There are some good photo and fighting materials that are helped by many standard edition CGIs. Strange, it's made for British TV (and seems to be a British-Italian co-production), but is marked with an "R" rating. <br /> <br /> The DVD picture is excellent and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice, although you only see it during the few action series, as the movie is mostly talked about. <br /> <br /> Almost any Roman movie, even "Cleopatra" or "The Fall of the Roman Empire", has more historicity --- to say nothing of compelling drama - than these bizarre classics, Jr. adjustment. This one gives new meaning to the commonly used phrase, "Based on a true story." In this case they could have said, "Suggested by real events."
