I really like this show. I mean, basically, everyone in that school is perfect and rich, and I doubt that a boarding school looks so cool. And why do they suddenly let girls go to school? Isn't it just a little strange? Anyways, Jamie Lynn spears can't act. She always has the same facial expression, which really irritates me. She is basically emotional, and all the guys look like her. <br /> <br /> Don't tell her he likes her? It's not that hard! really! None of these shows is real life, and she's not a girl like me, because the majority of regular girls are NOT going to boarding school, not having designer clothes and not living on the beach. <br /> <br /> False fake.
