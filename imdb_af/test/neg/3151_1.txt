Barney and Friends is probably the worst children's show I've ever seen. It teaches children nothing, the songs are skinny, it is not educational and the characters are just excited. I'm not one who disagrees with those who hate the show. Honestly, I've seen more negative than positive reviews for this show. 75% of reviews are negative and there are some very mature people. This display does not contain educational value or age-appropriate educational material at all. More reasons I don't like this show are due to the crappy plots, cheese dialogue, terrific special effects and the turbulent story lines. In addition, it says that you have to eat junk food if you are sad and that strangers are your friends. Saying it is a "model of what preschool television should be", as expressed by Yale researchers Dorothy and Jerome Singer, is a piece of shit. They don't know what they're talking about. I would never recommend anyone to Barney. For this reason, some children stop crying or becoming addicted to litter, so poisoning the minds of children everywhere. For people (parents / children) looking for real preschool maternity, switch to Nick Jr. and watch "Super Why!" farm. It's much better than this maze and Five TV once had the nerve to put it on "milkshake" but luckily it turned off. I recommend everyone to stay as far away from this show. Parents, I strongly advise you to keep your children as far away from this show as possible. They will thank you later. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Don't waste your valuable time with this stupid show. This is utter garbage. -10000000000000/10. Degree: Z. Avoid like the plague! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
