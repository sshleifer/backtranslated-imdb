My wife invited my son and I to watch cable TV on a lazy Saturday night and think it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. At this promise, the movie at least delivers: her character is ineffective, and meets almost every slasher-type horror movie cliche. Just like the movie. A cataloging of his graduated adherence would be an exercise in memory of something I hope to quickly forget, so I won't make one. Basically, it's a madness, heavy on the red herring: everyone looks guilty, rather than just the two suspects from the beginning. The "rule out of the logical and obvious, and what remains is" rule of bad horror movies works well on this one. The only surprise to influence me was the final conclusion of the indefinite final client: Jane will keep her appointment with her attempted rescuer, who will tell her (obviously) the audience's identity of the 2nd conspirator, what her in another round hysterical victim play. Most gracious I will never know.
