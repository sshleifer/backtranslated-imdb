When you watch it for a few seasons now and then, two things come to mind: One who wonders what kind of girl wants to be a model and two runs to the nearest ice cream shop and has a low-fat sundae. /> <br /> I was trying to be a fan because I liked the idea of ​​this reality competition. No other "familiar" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series is underway, I conclude that it is a pity that many people are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women shouldn't see it, teenagers should stay on it unless they do book reports on the subject. <br /> <br /> Many women are trying to play to compete for "Americas Next Top Model". They live together, cat fight together, cry together, get through useless models shoots with useless models people and fashion meals and are eliminated and almost everyone demands, "You'll see me again". Very, I'm trying to see what happened to those who really won. <br /> <br /> This is the dream of some girls, and good for them. When I see it, I hope the other girls who see it and like Hades like the college. <br /> <br /> I just watched more from this past season because of the "ploy" models that join the group. It even made me think of a pity many people. The "full figured models" were no more than average size women competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they have ever chosen. It will of course make it even thicker - a "ploy" modeatas has been using all the time. Bad, bad, Tyra and crew. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, "Americas Next Top Model" is not about full figured models, it's about portraying an imaginary image, a beauty that can be marketed massively and sell as the best in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the regret many judges, photographers, associations. So Tyra and her consistent "it was I" stuff every camera angle you can get. But then again, this is the one thing I like about this performance - the ex-model gives others who would not get the chance - a chance to enter the doors. But after that, everything else is status quo for that industry. Therefore, there are no surprises or week-to-week interest in the program.
