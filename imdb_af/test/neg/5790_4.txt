I have learned little of the meaning of this movie I do not already know from CNN and The New York Times. (And I didn't observe the Enron case obsessively as some others did.) The film did a very bad job explaining what "business" Enron was in there, perhaps before it started its debt hid in the entities created by Andy Fastow. It also played the role of Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins in the validation of practices that were subsequently found to be illegal. And it didn't go as far as it would have been possible to explore what the "investors" - all the prominent bankers - thought they were doing. With 24-hour cable networks, the Discovery channel and the History channel, documentaries have expanded. I saw a lot over the past year that was better than this one.
