The only reason I watched this movie a second time was to learn the name of the "second banana" girl playing with Katie Holms. Her name is Marisa Coughlan. Never heard of her. She is pretty. Fascinating. With an animated face and a nice bid, she is highly vigilant. She actually has 'Poisenality' ... More than a passing grace of Grace Kelly ... With a youthful exuberance. I think she is Irish in no pool (my favorite female DNA), so it makes sense that she will look the most beautiful Irish American. The movie is imperceptible, Katie Holms is classic beauty in the flesh. But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. In 1999, when this film was made, she was about 25 years old. It reminds me of another silly, worthless movie with the only salvation the Pretty Girl is in. It was "Career Opportunites" with the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly. Or "Spread II" the first time I've seen Michelle Pfeiffer.
