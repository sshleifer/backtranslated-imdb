I didn't expect much from this movie, but wanted to try something that I initially thought would be an early 80's teenage horror. Although three teens are somewhat critical plot, it is not at all a teenage horror movie. <br /> <br /> 'The Power' is about a small Aztec idol that exchanges a lot of hands if its owner (who needs to be mature and therefore, 'damaged') becomes the vessel to unleash all the idol's evil and often with deadly implications for not only the victims of the possessor but also the owner himself. After several exchanges on the control of this thing, three teenagers find it difficult to find it and they cannot figure out what it is, except that they find it strange and dangerous. They present the situation to a news reporter who doesn't buy in spiritual bologna. Although it is her producer who wants to investigate further, especially if it means he can gain control of the idol (I suppose the teens are not yet sufficiently damaged to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol). It's a story that's been told a thousand times, especially in the 1950s and 60s. The horror and science fiction prize. <br /> <br /> At least this one was able to keep me interested. Although it was a low budget, it was not so cheap or loaded with bad behavior, as much of the low budget had come-and-go frightening money from previous decades (nowadays they have the same cheesy qualities but bigger budgets). We are saving enough to at least give ourselves the opportunity to be at least a little absorbed with the terrible atmosphere and so on, despite a story of clich√©s. And although it's not a pity, the special effects were well done. <br /> <br /> Again, this is routine horror story, especially with the end (which, according to modern standards, has become a device that is annoyingly overused), but one that is not so embarrassingly bad. It can be worth checking out, even if it's just to laugh.
