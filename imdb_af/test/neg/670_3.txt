Compared to other "sand and sandals" rates, the Egyptian leaves much to be desired. The film is very LOSPELY based on Mika Waltari's well-researched novel, which centers around Egyptian doctor Sinhue's adventures at Akhnaton's court and his travels across Canaan, Mino-Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, the Sinhue story (which is largely with romantic and sexual exploitation), still due to the moral limitations of the time, remains on the floor of the cutting room. Instead, the audience is treated to roles and roles of Victor Mature's woodwork. Even Gene Tierney ?? a leading woman "staple" of the time ?? can't make her look the best in this movie and give a somnambulistic performance that can only be justified by the fact that the actress had serious psychiatric problems at the moment. There is a lot of rhetoric and theological work on the idea of ​​monotheism against polytheism, but Michael Wilding is as tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton. One is surely the turn of someone coming from him and restoring the old religion before the second rule. My advice: buy the book of E-Bay, rent something more entertaining like Solomon and Sheba and then call it a night!
