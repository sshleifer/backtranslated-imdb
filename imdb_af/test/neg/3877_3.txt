I don't care for follow up; Sometimes they are better than the original. But many times the originals are best alone ... Especially if you can't duplicate the cast. One of the great reasons "The Magnificent Seven" was such a hit was the most popular cast. <br /> <br /> It is hardly the "wonderful seven" when only Yul Brynner returns as one of the famous group members in "The Magnificent Seven." With six out of seven guys absent and replaced by many lesser-known actors, it quickly loses its appeal. In other words, except Brynner, these guys have no charisma! It's like a championship sports team who holds all substitutes except one. <br /> <br /> Brynner is good, again: fun to watch, fun to hear with that distinctive deep voice, but the story, not just The rest of the crew is lame. This movie should never be made. In the original we care about the seven; here we can not care less.
