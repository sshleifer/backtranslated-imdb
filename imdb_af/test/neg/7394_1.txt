A truck collection of Western tourists in Africa suffers the crash that their plane breaks down, so they have to travel on a bus to travel across the Namibian desert to reach the nearest exit point to civilization. Not surprisingly, the driver's compass does not end up working, and of course they find their way to a deserted ghost town that was a barracks during World War II. They find some kerosene (useless to refill the tank of their bus), a storeroom full of half-poisoned roots in cans and an indigenous hermit that they consider indifferent. The one fellow who appears to be on the ball in terms of survivalist techniques is going to get help. They must remove the tires from the bus and burn them if they do not return in five days. Hopefully someone will see the black smoke. <br /> <br /> Does this sound interesting? Well, sure, even if it sounds like * The Flight of the Phoenix * or any number of movies in the "deserted island" genre. That's why it's surprising that * the king is alive * number 4 (if anyone still counts) in the continuing "dogma 95" series that, if I remember the ridiculous "dogma 95 vow or chastity" correctly proclaimed that "genre films "is strictly forbidden. Oops. Well, anyway, you can say it's all good and good to compensate for being a genre movie. Yes, it doesn't take long for a member of the group, a former old stage actor, to start scratching - from memory! - the different roles of * King Lear * on, well, roll paper. The idea is that the performance of the play will help while the time goes away. All that really goes against the surviving advice of survivors to stay optimistic (has the old actor ever done a dinner theater show of * The Odd Couple * once in his life?), Quite apart from such activity that a colossal waste of precious time and energy. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad, I really don't know how to proceed. It's so monumentally stupid, so full of absurd situations and characters that it is significant criticism. It may be a timely moment to offer full disclosure. I reject this so-called Danish movie movement to an almost irrational degree. I think my face is even slightly red with the mere mention of Dogma 95. First, if the name of your movement has the word "dogma" in the title, you have already lost me; Secondly, in this particular case, the movement's insistence on the abnegation of individual artistic achievement is a recipe for hypocrisy if you believe the filmmakers have plundered here one of the greatest works of the greatest INDIVIDUAL writer ever lived. . (But the Dogma crowd is undoubtedly of the opinion that the works of Shakespeare are actually written by a consortium of Elisabeth bigwigs such as the Earl of Oxford, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and the Queen Himself.) Hell, I can do the whole business Forgotten if it played the scenario for dangerous purposes (the valuable Dogma attack - now it would be subversive!). But the film takes itself very seriously and quickly falls into the clich√© clerk on the genre in which it is unmistakable: people are facing each other; the bearded men; the inevitable deaths of some of the protagonists. All with a straight face. "Is this the promised end?" Well, not quite: we must also endure the excessive transfer of DV. For this is another rule in the Dogma 95 Gap Promise: Just Digital Video. Some friendly advice to the Dene: your "move" is in trouble if your finished product has poorer visual quality than an average higher education graduation home video. Professionalism is part of an artist's trick, right next to his own individuality. "Artisan" and "artist" are related words, Mr. Von Trier: Not every jackass with a $ 100 glove can be a movie maker. Send to. And incidentally, let your Dogma directors be credited for their movies while you're there. The fact that the author of * The King Is Alive * receives credit, while the man (or girl) who does not actually film it is just a little hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> Suspicious. 1 star out of 10.
