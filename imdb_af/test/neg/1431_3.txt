What starts out pretty well (and quite disturbingly) sinks quickly into a boring mess. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider (of Twisted Sister infamy) apparently wrote the script from his own idea and while the idea of ​​a cyber-stalking pierce freak has potential, they really blow it here on uneven pacing, bad dialogue, and one of the greatest endings you'll ever see. Despite some lifeless performances, the director manages a truly creepy first line. It really looks like it's going to be a good low budget effort. <br /> <br /> No such luck. The plot goes completely over the map, and Snider's character ceaselessly evokes witty psychotic fortune-making lines that are supposed to succeed in meaningful dialogue. Worse, the supportive movie is scarce, and the only half-way credible dialogue comes from a young girl helping a detective to navigate the internet. <br /> <br /> What a waste of good idea. Oh, and there's a new, twisted Sister song, if you care.
