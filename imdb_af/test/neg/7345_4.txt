The story is briefly about the faithful businessman priest, Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who looks closer at a case where another priest is suspected of murder. The priest denies being guilty, but at the same time he cannot discuss the case because of confidentiality. Enter Daniel Clemens who is starting to play cop ... <br /> <br /> While the plot is not ridiculous, everything else is different. Let's start with the visual side, cinematography is boring, it looks more like a TV series than a movie. The camera angles are boring, in fact there is not a single unforgettable camera angle in the whole movie. There are no interesting close-ups that reveal details. And the scene transitions, well, there is not much to say about those, they are not at all, there seems to be no connection between the screens and the real plot. Okay, they used a transition with music between two screens, but there are no interesting visual transitions in the whole movie. The times that were resolved were used. There was no visual connection between the screens. <br /> <br /> The boring visual part can be forgiven if the film offers something else. Unfortunately, the film only provides forced woodworking and clumsy dialogue without punch. In addition, the movie suffers from sound problems, the sound volume is lowered several times in the movie as if the microphones were too far. <br /> <br /> I didn't predict the resolution of the movie. It could be because the film never gave me the opportunity, or it could be because of the presentation, which was so boring, I never even tried to find out. <br /> <br /> Put two plus two together and this is equal to a B movie where 'B' stands for boring.
