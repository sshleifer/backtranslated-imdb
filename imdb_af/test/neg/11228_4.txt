"Crime of Passion" is a movie that is disappointing on most disappointments. Where do I start? The storyline? It is desperately simplistic and full of gaps. The direction? Remind a cheap B movie. The acting? John Laughlin is quite awful in his role as "well-known man of a frozen woman" Bobby, Annie Pots is not convincing as "frozen woman" Amy, and that is only Kathleen Turner (above average) and Antony Perkins (excellent) what get passive acting points. More specifically, Antony Perkins gives a good performance as the pervert honor. Peter Shayne, while Turner succeeds in portraying the roles of sexy China Blue and weakened Joanna Crane. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the performances of Turner and Perkins alone are insufficient to help get the movie a grade higher than 4/10. See if you want to see Turner in some sensational scenes (although even on this score the movie can easily match its competition - for example, "Basic Instinct"), otherwise avoid it.
