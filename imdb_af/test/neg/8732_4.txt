Rock Hudson's second business in the science fiction genre after seconds is Embryo a film that combines elements of the Bride of Frankenstein and Pygmalion into one rather strange movie about the lack of a better word a test tube baby that Barbara Carrera becomes. </p> <p> <br /> Hudson is a scientist experimenting in organic development and has the opportunity to first experiment on his own Doberman pincher when accidentally hit by his car. <br /> <br /> Some pituitary secretions of the female dog are given to a premature puppy and it grows remarkably into an adult. Raised with success, Hudson takes a victim of a victim's victim and gives it some of the same things. <br /> <br /> What he gets is Barbara Carrera. And she develops physically and intellectually at a great price. What she didn't do was developed emotionally. Still, Hudson left her as his new research assistant to friends and family such as brother-in-law Diane Ladd, son John Elerick, and son-in-law Anne Schedeen. <br /> <br /> Embryo doesn't investigate the real problems in this kind of science, but rather uses it. The special effects as it is are fairly second-rate. Hudson seems to have lost interest in the project about halfway through the film. <br /> <br /> Now, what would have been really interesting was when he got a boy and grew up as a harlequin new hero. Now something Rock Hudson would have sunk into his teeth.
