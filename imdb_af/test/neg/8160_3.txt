"San Francisco, oh, you, wonderfully devastated town, thank you, God, for it is destroyed, and bricks fall on our collective heads and in the thousands of careless obedient sheep, oh Lord, too merciful, who is so merciful in your heavenly ways ... "It had to be the lyrics for the title song of this oh-so-inspiring and totally bad movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off well, with Gable being a Cinderella with a highly annoying but much-appreciated operational voice, and she shoots quickly to the stars. One of the many problems with our Cinderella is that she is played by Jeanette MacDonald, who, if you take the time to look through all that make-up and glamor, realizes she is ugly. Too ugly to play this role, anyway. Nevertheless, Gable and everyone else seemed completely here as if she were a little beauty or something. Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is so completely humble, healthy, innocent, godly, friendly and generous - enough to vomit you for a full hour. MacDonald plays her (albeit one-dimensional) role with the kind of "ahhh", "oh" and "ooh" that rather calms down than make her sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Tracy is better and had better roles than playing this cliché, heart-of-gold, divine, non-child molesting priest (whose boxes in his spare time - as if priests have nothing to to do - how cute). Even the always reliable Gable is not up to its standard; he is too animated, and his character is too selfless for someone who has to be an ambitious Western "scoundrel" (although obviously the mistake of writing). The plot is basically that: Gable and his rival Holt play table tennis with Cinderella - use her as the ball. How? Well, she only works for Gable, sings for Holt Square, then she goes back to Gable, to return to Holt soon. (And of course both want her as a girl / woman.) And if the earthquake didn't interrupt this table tennis grave, it's a safe bet she would bounce back and forth another ten times, the wishy-washy little princess she is . <br /> <br /> There are many, too many, musical numbers. It's almost as if they were trying to make the first "disaster movie music" ever. How stupid. The stuff she sings in Gable's "joint" singing is good, but when she started obstructing the high-ranking, annoying wines during the opera segments, I felt my ears were unaware and unfairly attacked by the enemy its sound. In fact, there is an opera number that lasts 6 DAMN MINUTES. 6 may look like little, for those who did not have the first-hand Vietoperanam experience with such horrors of torture, but it is like dog dogs; a dog's year is equivalent to seven people. A minute of the opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or a dog urinating on your leg). <br /> <br /> I thought it was a disaster movie, but it's more like a nearby movie. (I read that some of the dialogue in this movie was written by a SILENT-ERA FILM DIRECTOR. Jesus ...) The melodramatic and sometimes amusing proceedings are interrupted by the real star of this movie (namely, the earthquake) only after more than one and a half hours. When Joe finally raises the earthquake, and our cliché-like characters in it, I almost felt like saying, "Thank you, death and destruction is finally here!". Unfortunately, Joe is late in the movie to save it from his increasing mediocrity; The screens of destruction are very good, but even the earthquake part of the movie is destroyed by a highly annoying, religious ending. You see, Gable, who claims to be an atheist (without using the word himself), finally finds MacDonald alive - after looking for days - and suddenly he's turned into a believer because Cinderella is alive !! How stupid! All that tells me is that Gable's character is a bad idea. <br /> <br /> The movie ends on a very stupid note. Gable, after thanking God to "save" his girlfriend (and he does his knees) "finds" God (see light), and the movie's little old devil Gable takes himself into a believer. How Much Godly American Ends ... <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody thought to ask this "God", why hell was there first and foremost an earthquake! The sad and unintentional irony is that Gable eventually becomes a "sucker"; long ago he made fun of "suckers" who fall for the holiest scam of them all - namely religion - and eventually he himself becomes one. Now I call it a triumph of the human spirit! Another irony is that the end was supposed to improve Gable as a person, but I see it very differently; On the contrary, it only took one big Joe to make Gable into a God-fearing, gentle, small, obedient believer - joining the world's sheep family. And as if this intellectual demise of Gable's was not pathetic and disappointing enough, this first "earthquake musical" ends with a real hair enhancement (take this word if you want), noble and hopefully inspiring beautiful mass choir scene: dozens (or hundreds) Survivors of earthquake and proud, proud citizens of Frisco spontaneously (or did God "arrange it?) all sing the title song in hopes of a better, brighter, Joe-less future. Hallelujah! If you are a" sucker "for Hollywood sentimentality, do not overshoot this movie.
