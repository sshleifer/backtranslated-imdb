In this Silly Symphony, a country mouse visits his cousin in the city. Most of the short are the two mice exploring the dinner table. The animation is good, where this short suffering is in lack of humor. Maybe I just saw this "evening table adventure" in too many Tom and Jerry shorts. Although it did come first, I just didn't find it so pleasant.
