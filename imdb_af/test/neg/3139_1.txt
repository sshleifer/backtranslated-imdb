This movie should be one of the most boring movies ever made. The only thing I liked was the use of Argento-esquire lighting in most screens. The music is terrible and the pace is so slow that you can see it at 2x speed and even then it will be slow. The story does not exist. It doesn't even have shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> It is classified (on this site) as an abomination, but it is not. It is a kind of art film that explores the dark side of human nature. If you are in that kind of thing and can stand the slow pace, then look, but I'd rather recommend something Japanese. I think the only reason this movie was never in theaters is a fear of hearing committing collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom that this movie generates. These 80 minutes of length would have become better used to dry the paint. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1/10 simply because there is no 0 in the drop-down list
