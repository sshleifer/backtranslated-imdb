Stylized Hollywood Westerns, full of familiar conventions, look like eternal life and it's an avatar. Everything in it seems to have been scrapped from the back of a drawer from 1939, applied a bigger budget, and production is the problem. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper has played these kinds of roles dozens of times - the displaced Southern, fast on the draw and fast with honor, although it's as easy as possible to go. He plays Blayde Hollister, who travels to Texas after the gang that destroyed his cotton plantation. He wears a bendable shirt and packs two pre-treated six shooters. He speaks with a terrible accent - a feller can hurt it. "(See, Sergeant York.) The gang is led by Raymond Massey, who buys and sells land, usually with handy means where possible. The gang includes Steve Cochran, who can't play a Westerner, though he is very good at the pockets. The required woman is Rut Roman, daughter of the Mexican plantation owner, who looks and speaks about Mexican as a brown betty from Boston. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'll save the plot too much. It is undoubtedly someone who has discussed it in detail and is no longer worth mentioning. As in any 1939 Western, it is labyrinths. Everyone except Cooper and his friends are subordinate and there are several double crosses and linked identities and hidden secrets. <br /> <br /> Everything is retro. The plot, the dialogue, the wardrobe, even the music. The score is by Warner's stalwart Max Steiner. He is the man who won "King Kong". It was 1932. This movie was released in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cooper's name, on the go - "Blayde Hollister" - asked me to look through the records of the RACA - the Real American Cowboy Associate - to see if the name was suspended in their archives dating from the beginning until February 4, 1911, when the last Real Cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a confused pickle. There has never been a Real Cowboy named Blayde. Hollister, yes, but not Blayde. In fact, there is no record of any Real Cowboy named Wade, Luke, Cole, or Matt. The most popular names for real cowboys, in descending order of frequency, were Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebuchadnezzar, Plautus, Pinchbeck and Hortense. <br /> <br /> If this movie was released in 1939, it would be routine. In 1950, it is a calamitous monument in the history of human reclamation.
