I wasn't sure where that led to the end. when it turned out that it was all a liberal conspiracy to transfer the world to European eyelashes and the United Nations. What a load of right junk! By the way, the little bit about Canada that joined the US doesn't have much to do with the plot and the idea has never been developed. The only point seems to have made it the main character to run for president (but they could only have made him American and did away with it). It was a load bull anyway and not worth it. If you don't want to see these things well, look at the brilliant BBC political thriller "State of Play."
