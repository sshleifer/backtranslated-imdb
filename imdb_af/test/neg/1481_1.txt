A trash classic! Basically, what we have here is a story about some American teenagers (one male, one female, both beautiful people of course) who seem to be psychologically linked, because each one of them falls asleep, they can live each other's dreams and expressing each other's inner desires ... think Mills & Boon meets X files and you'll be somewhere near the point. Actually, it's more like an unlucky hybrid between one of Ed Wood's famous bad B movies and a particularly dull episode of Melrose Place, so tough are the special effects and so amateur is the play. The actors who live (I don't want to say) say these lines say their lines are like reading cue cards and pout when they're supposed to show an emotion, and it comes as no big shock (or loss to the industry) ) which have since faded into darkness. The whole thing is just a ridiculously wrong mix of styles that don't go together. The end result is an intriguing curiosity that will undoubtedly be uploaded by suppliers of such good-quality movies over the years. to come. I will probably be the only person to ever comment on this movie, but if you read and have seen it, please come back, it will be here once.
