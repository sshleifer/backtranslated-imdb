It looks like you're going to post here, it's going to be a 10 star rating, no one ever looks anything but I'm honest. Some don't like it, but here we go, rachel ray display is just awful. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of the snl character linda, regardless of whether she had a cookie show. I have to say I kept rachel on the $ 35- $ 40 daily food network, but I'm sorry she didn't have enough life experience to make her interesting day in and day out, give me a ham on the street, anthony bourdain, interesting people, but most of all, I find her annoying, she actually heard a member of the studio saying "shut up" yes In a joking way, but quiet is quiet and who cares her pets stories, sorry, you were canceled !!
