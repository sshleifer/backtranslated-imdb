It is a pity to see so many talented people involved in what a lot of waste of talent is. The plot is clich√©. The direction is too self-conscious and the characters are almost caricature. One of the most disappointing aspects of this film is Gerard Depardieu's performance in the English version (this movie was shot simultaneously in French and English). Although he is one of the best actors in the film, he all gives the worst performance. I have to say that Bianca Gervais comes very close ... <br /> <br /> On a more positive note, the newcomer Juliette Gosselin has a tremendous performance in both versions. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing I remember about this movie ... <br /> <br /> By the way, I have to apologize to my non-good English ...
