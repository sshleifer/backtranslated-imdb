This movie endorses self-righteousness! It gives freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and eventually got scat-free! Despicably as it may be, there is adultery in this film as well. The Connaughey character has the whore for the Bullock character and the movie has some of the stereotypes of trial movies (such as the important news that appeared in court) that make every aesthetically demanding movie-goer like me sick! I really can't believe anyone had this litter. It's a movie so bad and holds fake ideas that I can't put my critic in an eloquent way. When will the American people wake up and find out that they are manipulated 24/7 by films such as those that change reality in some BS where there is everybody right if they just take it in their hands. This cowboy attitude just makes me sick and in my eyes it represents all that is wrong with America!
