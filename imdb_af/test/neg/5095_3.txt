It was one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in a while. I'm in my late 40's and watched it with my son-in-law (early 20s) and son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. We watched about an hour and shut it down. During the hour I spent more time on my iPhone than we watched it. I gave it a 3 because I enjoyed the landscape and cinematography; otherwise I would have given it a 1. I'm sure there are people who are really into the art of everything that dislikes my review, but we are all entitled to our own opinions, right? I couldn't figure out if it was a "chick flick" where the focus was on the mother, or it was supposed to be a movie for guys, focusing on the battle and adventure. In my opinion, it did not succeed either.
