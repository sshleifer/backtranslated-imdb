OK, if I say "wow," I mean, "Jesus, please help me." I have an old VHS copy printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The movie is about an alien crash landing on Earth to terrorize us with a gun that explodes people into oblivion. Passop !!! And with that I mean the special effects. There are an incredible number of errors. The acting is horrible, but I want to say the only one who's making any effort would be the Sheriff. The film itself is really granular and poorly lit. In one particular scene it is day outside and then the shot shows that the nocturnal shoots his gun behind him overnight. Then show it again day. * Shakes head * I usually like low-budget horror movies, but I had to force myself to finish it because I never watch a movie without completing it. The only achievement of this film was a stranger who was not stereotypical. So for that and ONLY for that ... I give it a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie if you had a bad day. You will be even more depressed at the failed effort this movie makes.
