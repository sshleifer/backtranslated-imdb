This is the hallmark of the bad 80's movie-making, unless you're a pre-pubescent girl. Drive on a big name like Madonna, a story line that attacks the intelligence and humor physically best suited to a nursery school. If ever there was any doubt, I think this movie of a movie clearly shows Madonna's absolute lack of acting talent and made me feel very shy. The only thing I can't believe is that they are ever leaving the director close to another movie. Madonna spends most of the movie moving like a baby doll and talking like a baby. It is painfully clear that the only reason this movie was ever made was that Madonna was a big name in pop music. Don't be immersed to see this right away. Stay away at all costs!
