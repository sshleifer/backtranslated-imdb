The movie has a good story line, the action is good in some parts, but not all. Some of the parts, I just felt like the bad guys wouldn't have knocked off my experience yet. Some are action long, as always mostly for the boss, but for the least important people they were killed or dosed with a few hits, but some were rather unrealistic or could have done better work. <br /> <br /> The least important actors or stunt people were the right pick for the movie, my girlfriend started showing them that she was going to watch the movie more than she was spending her time with me. <br /> <br /> The movie is good, that's all I can say.
