"The Vindicator" is a strange little Canadian B-Movie. At first glance, it's just another cheap (extremely cheap!) "Terminator" knockoff, but oddly enough, it also shares features with the original "RoboCop" that has not yet been released when "Vindicator" appeared in 1986). Coincidence? Who knows? Anyway, the story is: scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a pretty old man working for a super-duper secret government high-tech research lab. He reports to a bad boss named Whyte, who he early in the movie. Carl has a loving wife at home and a baby on the road, which makes it all tragic when he is suddenly killed in a laboratory accident. But wait! Carl is not really dead! Whyte has withdrawn Carl's brain and packed it into his pet project, some experimental bio-mechanical space suit. When Carl wakes up in his new body, he understands a little nuts, rubbish the lab, and escapes. This is a problem, because Whyte (for reasons known only to himself) programmed the mechanical suit with a "Rage Reaction" program, causing Carl to kill anyone who touches him for any reason. In the background, that little addition to Carl's psyche was probably not the best idea. <br /> <br /> So Robo-Carl wanders the movie for a while without killing any random muggers and other different background characters. He returns to his home and contacts his wife (this scene is saddening, I think, but seems comical because Carl's robot voice is so heavily synthesized that you can hardly understand a word he says). Of course, he tells her to leave the city and never come back because she's in danger, but she wants to stay and help him, Yadda Yadda Yadda. Eventually, Whyte handles a gang of commando thugs led by 'Hunter', a seemingly ninja assassin played by Pam Grier (!) To destroy and destroy his runaway creation by using Carl's wife as bait , and predictable (but lower cheap). <br /> <br /> I'm a B-Movie type guy, but "The Vindicator" was so half-assed that it came very quickly into a high comedy. I suppose a good hype of the budget went into Stan Winston's robo-Carl pack design, as it looks pretty good, but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap, bought-to-watch TV. The script could have used much more work, but perhaps the filmmakers got the wind from RoboCop. They rushed to get "Vindicator" out so they could not be accused of jerking them off. Anyway, by judging the other comments here on IMDb, I'm not the only one who noticed the parallels between Vindicator and RoboCop and of course, "Robo" is the superior movie, so you don't have to waste your time . put through this piece of nonsense, unless you consider a best described movie, at best, as a rough concept of "RoboCop" if made by an 8th degree.
