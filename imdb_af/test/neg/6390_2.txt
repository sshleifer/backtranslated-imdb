This movie just arrived in Mexico and since I read very good reviews on this, I decided to go and see it with my friends and girlfriend, but I was very disappointed. I don't understand how people can rate it. and the director was beautiful, but a big overall movie needed a good story. This movie was completely missing. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed several dramatic Asian and European films, but they had a good story, watching this movie at your own risk, unless you're Eastern European or Orthodox, I think you won't dislike it. <br /> <br /> Half of the people who left the theater, including my 4 friends who were waiting outside because they were really bored, I was but I always wait until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, it was very slow, with many time-wasting ringtones showing the full length of the story in just over. 40 minutes, but they made it longer by getting scenes from the monk that is coal like 15 minutes of the whole movie plus panoramic views and so on until they made it a full-length movie, a very boring one. <br /> <br /> I recommend listening to me when you see it, coming back and reviewing this comment as useful after wards to help people avoid this waste of money.
