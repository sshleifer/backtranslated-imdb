Unfortunately, producers do not know when to leave well enough alone, or in recycling to the point that any waste that is dirty Hollywood generates is playing in Alpo. Every sci-fi action adventure movie seems to have to endure a sad list of follow-up movies, and Robocop is a tragic example. The first film, under Paul Verhoven's direction, was a wild, attractive ride, even the time to comment on what the dark side of bio-technology enables us to do. This movie has nothing of it, except that we may tell you that drugs are bad for you and can make you do things you regret when sober. Robocop 2 lacks the vision, the deeply frightening vision of what we are doing, and instead we go on a cruise in how malicious drug dealers and their victims really are. Social comments are condemned. This one really bitten me the big one. If you don't mind anything other than the SFX, go to it, my friend. Otherwise, don't waste your time with this yeastless cake, and keep the first film's accurately measured, heavyweight pumpkin neck out of the oven. It's that simple.
