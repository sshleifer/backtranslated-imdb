First, let me start with the obvious: anti-Semitism was a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and the deaths of millions of Jews. The problem with this movie is that it sees the United States - probably the most welcoming society ever for Jews outside Israel - as a very different place from Nazi Germany. In 1943, the film is about a man (William H. Macy) who is confused with a Jew after wearing glasses. A lot of nasty things happen to him afterwards (he loses his job and he can't find a new one, his neighbors have avoided him, everything ends in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's self-pity, enchanting novels, the kind that liberals gave a bad name.
