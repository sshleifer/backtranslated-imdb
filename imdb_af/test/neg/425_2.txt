Oh, I thought it should be a good action, but it wasn't. Although Jeff Speakman stars there is nothing to watch. Just two battles for almost 1.5 hours, yak. Lots of talking and everything is so artificial that you can't believe it. The plot is clear from the beginning. If you want good action, don't rent this movie.
