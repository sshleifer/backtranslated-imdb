It was full of plot holes, inaccuracies (didn't keep the clock for injured players or helmet loss in Texas football games?) And not so much salvation (So, your dad is hitting the crap from you? Right for once and then he'll love you and all this worthwhile.) <br /> <br /> Make the movie about a team and its quest for a championship OR make a movie about a player within a team and his personal struggle, but this movie tried to do it all and reached a few meters short. The book probably showed the whole story much better; the movie had chosen one element of the story and held onto it. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie jumped from one character dialogue to flashy games and then another character dialogue months later without telling yourself who people were or why they were important - the QB has his brother and sister phoned to care for the mother - what happened to it? Because the mother was coherent by the end of the final game, does that mean she is no longer crazy? The one reason for quality was the soundtrack. Buy it and watch SportsCenter highlights while playing Iggy Pop in the background.
