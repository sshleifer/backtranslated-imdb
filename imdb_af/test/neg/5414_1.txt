Where to start? Some guys have an Indian pot he cleans, and suddenly Skeletor falls. He hit a woman in the neck with an ax, she fell off but got up and was apparently untouched. She walks in the woods, and it turns out there is the basement of a shopping mall out there in the woods. She again meets a worker and Skeletor attacks. Fortunately, like any good worker, he has a gun and shoots at the man. Not working, everything starts to burn. <br /> <br /> Cut for some people walking through the forest. Even though they've been walking for quite some time, they sit and suggest each other. Wouldn't they probably have done so when they first met? Anyway, they are "uncovered" Delta team members (shelter, I think, because they don't have to pay to wear them in uniforms). The cute girls are different things like a sniper school instructor and, oh, I can't remember the rest. It does not matter. Eventually they all take out their guns and start directing them with different things right away. ? Anyway, they meet an old Indian sitting in the woods. He wants beans. Do you know, like pork and beans? He mumbles things, I can only assume it's the assumption of the movie. I relied on hearing the prospect of advertising, because you can't really understand what he says. <br /> <br /> So, they walk around the forest a few more times. All the dialogue is a burden of quasi-military, macho BS. I mean it all, as in every single word. Like "It reminds me when we were in Kabul" or "It reminds me when we were in Laos". Skeletal attacks are being attacked again. Let me give you a basic attack. One of the female characters is hanging behind a tree and she is aiming her gun at the approaching man on the horse. For some reason she didn't burn, but shouted somebody else a few times. When skeleton comes, she jumps down from behind the tree so Skeletor can stab her with his spear. Then everyone starts shooting. The bullets cause sparks to fly off the trees. Apparently, the people who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet. They don't make sparks. <br /> <br /> Then Casper Van Diem shot a semi-truck trying to run over Skeletor. He misses, and the truck slips quietly. Van Diem was injured, apparently he slipped over the seat and knocked his hip on the window handle or something, so he crawled out of the truck and exploded. Later he died in the forest and everyone says a lot of quasi-military, macho BS. They meet some guys in the woods and blow their "shelter" status by identifying themselves immediately as of the army. <br /> <br /> Some other things happen, mumble people, shake the camera, etc. <br /> <br /> I think it comes to an end eventually. <br /> <br /> My theory is that the Sci-Fi channel is a little annoyed with everyone who bases their movies, so they suggest reminding us how bad movies can really be. As you think our movies are bad? Well, you didn't look bad. HERE IS BAD !!! Well, now that we are getting it right, the rest of our movies are pretty good compared, right? <br /> <br /> Well, that's just a theory.
