The movies use blue-black and vibrant skin zones to create a noir-ish feeling for this movie, unfortunately. In fact, it is very annoying because it hides the devil characters and reduces it to one dimensional creature. <br /> <br /> At least the original had a hysterical energy and the gore-set pieces were quite stunning. Black gore is scary, and the main female demon is not scary in her attempts to sniff on the screen in her best Lugosi style camp. <br /> <br /> The narrative is completely incompatible and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch' directed by Russ Meyer, you can appreciate the effort to be William Burroughs esque. Otherwise, this movie gives a wide outline. Bava and Argento fans - again - are bitterly disappointed.
