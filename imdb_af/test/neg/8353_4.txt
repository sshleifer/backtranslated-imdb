If I had never seen an episode of the original Avengers, with Blackman, Rigg or Thorson, I would have appreciated this series more. While the role-player did his best to maintain the script's action and interest, I was just trapped to compare the episodes to the original series. There was an expectation that Steed was more involved in fighting, and the continuity seemed as if the authors struggled to keep up with the actors. To be honest, I can't blame them for reliving the fans of the original series, but it just didn't work out, as evidenced by the fact that it lasted one season. By watching Steed's work through this series, I have a genl. Macarthur recalls when he said, "Old soldiers never die, they just fade!"
