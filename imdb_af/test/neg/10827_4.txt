I thought it was good. I thought it was wonderful. It was a little too slow for my taste. Lots of drama, but not much action until near the end of the movie. This movie was basically a dramatic movie, with the payout, if you could call it, not close to the end. To me the screens of the dam are bursting and the water flooding the town is okay, but very short. The movie itself is well done, The acting is decent, but it just didn't do it for me. In the long run, this had something to do with the fact that very little tension or tension was made throughout the film. At least, that's what I think. The other factor is that I recently watched '10.5 'and his successor '10.5: Apocalypse'.these two big budget event movies, which in my opinion is a very difficult act to follow, in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction. a result, I have to upgrade Killer Flood: the day the damn broke on 4/10
