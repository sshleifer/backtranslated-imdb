Talk about creepy. If you really want to sit and watch this episode where the girl in Firefly was kidnapped later, there is entertainment for you, but only if you like this sort of thing. I didn't think so, to be honest, this episode was terrible. Fortunately, this is one of a few duff episodes in Season 3, and the only Charles Grant Craig episode, so you're not getting much of this sort of thing in Season 3. So, overall verdict? Just read the summary at the top. It's a strong contender (Hell Money says hi!) For the worst episode of Season 3. But to be honest, I didn't expect much. I wish I could completely oubliet this episode. That's one thing they have right: the title.
