I do not recommend watching this movie. It is a movie in which a movie is filmed, with no attraction between actress and actor being played. The sex scene at the end of the movie explaining the reluctance of the actress (played in the movie) to work with the actor (played in the movie) is a blunt repetition of the same scene the Breillat movie Fat Girl. Everything there is played with more delicacy, if you can add delicacy to such a sex action. A typical French expression for the thing that happens in sex is the comedy, O la la! There is also sensitivity in Breillat's film Short Crossing. In Sex, comedy, I do not see real sensitivity and also a clear plot for the movie is not being developed, so there is a fairly loose story with the disillusionment of the end.
