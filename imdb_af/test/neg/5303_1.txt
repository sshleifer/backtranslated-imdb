This movie was embarrassing. Ulma Thurman seemed to have had a kind of illness and John Travolta seemed to have walked in his sleep. I expected it to be a so-so sequel to getting Shorty, not a half-baked remake of the same film (except some of the character's different names and clothes). <br /> <br /> I won't recommend it to movie after my worst enemy. I feel as if I have been torn and Hollywood cheated me again to see another terrible successor (I also suffered from Alien Vs. Predator). <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about this movie is that It voted for the worst movie of 2005!
