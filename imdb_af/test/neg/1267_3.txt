The film is powerful as a political statement on extraordinary performances, torture and the politics of the war on terror. Others have already responded to this and other aspects of the movie. My review may contain spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, you can't read beyond this point. <br /> <br /> Various questions are raised by this movie. First of all, was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfactory explanation why the NSA has decided to pick up and deliver it in the first place. Is there an innocent explanation why he got phone calls from what the NSA thinks is a terrorist? If there is, the movie doesn't seem to give one and it made my whole movie unsatisfactory. It is good and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong, but first prove that they have tortured the wrong person, then we will take it to the next step. <br /> <br /> If the protagonist was guilty, then what was achieved by releasing him? Perhaps we were well-trained to resist at some point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with some research and thereby lead the martyrs to believe they are a innocent man in confession without actually being guilty. However, there is nothing in the movie that proves he is also guilty. <br /> <br /> The various other loose points out there are: 1. So, a rogue CIA agent released him and flew back. What prevents the NSA from picking it up again? A little publicity in the Washington Post? Please give me a break here ... If a senator is not prepared to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf, what should Corinne Whitman fear? 2. If the NSA watches which phone numbers are being called, why can't they listen to some of the calls to find out if something is being discussed? 3. The plot is pretty stupid anyway. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells will take over his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell line, not on one that can be traced back to him and his home. <br /> <br /> The whole movie turns to drag on the viewers' heartbeats by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture. But if you think about it, there's nothing more in this movie, just many unanswered questions and the feeling of "what is it?" at the end of the movie.
