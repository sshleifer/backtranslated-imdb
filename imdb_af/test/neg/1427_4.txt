I watched it as a kid, but I wasn't much of a Jerry Lewis fan. I completely forgot it (not that it was somehow memorable). The movie turns to imitation (it looks like it is in every comic star's curriculum!) - in this case a German officer - and although it's not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims it's a BOMB rating, it's not exactly classic stuff either - definitely leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), even though it's comparable narcissistic! Ironically, before the wacky general's appearance, the scenes offer more happiness than the rather forced humor in Nazi cost! <br /> <br /> The movie was really Lewis's last wave during his boom; In fact, it seems to be his last vehicle released for 10 years (it is painfully clear here that his specific folly would not be in the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!
