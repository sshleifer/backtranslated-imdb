It's beyond me why two million Danish people sit down every week to see this terrible show. The dialogue is terrible and not realistic. The characters are hollow and simplistic. There is a difficult man, a hard woman and a sensitive man. The writers actually say they modeled the characters in Greek mythology! Give me a chance! Of course, all the characters are brilliant policemen. When I watched this show, I longed for "District Hill Street" and "NYPD Blue". These are brilliant performances, and "Reisholdet" is a common copy. This program is a symptom of the disease that Danish television is currently suffering from.
