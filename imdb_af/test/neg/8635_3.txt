George Sluizer's original version of The Vanishing aka The Man, who wanted to know, offers one of the most silent sociopaths of the European film and one of the most memorable finals of all time (stupidly stolen by Tarantino for Kill Bill Volume Two), but it has much more to offer than this. Playing around with chronology and reversing the usual clicks of standard 'lady disappear' plots, it also offers excellent characterization and strong, subtle but convincing performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can only assume that when it comes to remake, Sluizer was so determined that no one else would have the chance to destroy his movie when he was completely able to do it himself, but few people could have expected how extensively he destroyed his own work. His career never restored this disastrous mistake. <br /> <br /> Heady is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges, who was thought to be a truly disastrous level in every detail. A friend who made one of his earliest movies, noticed that Bridges was a great instinctive actor, as long as you stopped thinking about what he was doing, and this movie is proof of the pudding. Every movement is too mechanical in its accuracy, and lets it look like a rosy toy, while its voice is a bizarre mix of Tootsie, Latka Gravas of Taxi and a Dalek who all take elocation lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head and saying, "Please. Leave. But the debt must really be divided here. None of the gigs are good: often look not even good. Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a disturbed man in his mind ends up in the rushing scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders bad and Sandra Bullock doesn't make the impression of his obsession. that they receive any help from any director or writer Todd Graff, the essay is particularly weak to focus on Bridges at the expense of the couple, the worse is the speed in which the film is, the life and character from every scene in his race to come to the next. / low mindedness in the couple's relationship or the seemingly casual but careful to determine the feel of the place, we just get a few arguments that give you the impression that he probably is better off sin there her. As for the new and improved happy ending ?? standard woman chased by nutter in the forest threatened stuff complete with lame 'Let's end up joking like a TV cop show' moment ?? best not go there ?? what is the advice for this whole train wreck of a movie. Even a shocking blind and uninspiring Jerry Goldsmith score can do nothing for this one.
