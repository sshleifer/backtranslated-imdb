It's a nice run of the flour family move that I'm sure most kids will enjoy, but not really so much to please any adult watching the movie. The prospect of the film is that Belushi's policeman takes his retirement, but is drawn to a case that causes him to become a private investigator. The movie's plot is so obvious, most of the kids will definitely choose the end before it happens. But in addition, it seems there are books and subplots that are forgotten when the film progresses. This is accompanied by a subplot where the titular K-9 is pumped by Belushi. One who needs to be avoided is I afraid.
