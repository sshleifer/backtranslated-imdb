I won't spoil it for you. Though you can probably care less if it is spoiled (you will know what I mean if you see it) Poor story. B-rated film quality. Typical horror-stupid situations-scarce timing. I have to be known when trying to print many hype in their ads or even add "quotes". Just tell me the movie has been bombarded for a long time. And they are all trying to get in, so they can even break the cost of the bomb. I wish I could take back the time I spent. I was stupid and thought that there was just something right around the corner. But I still dropped. I usually don't waste my time commenting on any movie. In fact, this is my second post. I just felt I could save some of you from wasting money on something that had a lot of hype about it.
