Don't tell me this movie was funny or a little funny. It was a complete disaster, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ali G is just funny on Channel 4's Ali G Show. After watching his performances, all I can say is, he's not made for Movies. With a Daft script, or more like no storyline, there's nothing to entertain you. Full of annoying, unrealistic character, this movie is a complete rubbish completely. At the end of the film Ali G gives a speech. He called, if you hated this movie, tell people it was good. Not even the speech can save the movie. He probably knew she was going to be a stinker. I would have given this a 0/10, but the minimum is starting 1. Overall, don't even waste your time on this junk.
