I was hoping that Pulp would be an interesting movie, but was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pulp has a very small storyline, and what's never there keeps you interested. It was a real struggle to keep it going. If it's about you, say yourself "huh? That's it?!?". It's one where you think after watching it - why did they ever bother? <br /> <br /> It's bad because Michael Caine is a good actor. I also hoped to see the great Lizabeth Scott in it, but she just appeared on the screen for a total of maybe one minute. Scott is one of the best film noir femme fatal girls and it was her last movie. <br /> <br /> Oh well ...
