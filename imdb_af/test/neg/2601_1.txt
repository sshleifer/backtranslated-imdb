this is the most overlooked show on television. I believe people keep watching it because they feel they need to, because it has become a bit of a "cool" show to look at work or school the next day and talk to your friends. rarely does it make anything more than a bell and never causes a sense of irony or thoughts of the audience. Each joke is interchangeable with "punchlines" that are apparently pulled out of a hat. The complete lack of originality combined with somehow the rubbish that rinses out of it (see: American Dad) raises a question about the expectation of an audience that remains this spectacular show on TV. I do not know any of my family, and may God have mercy on his soul ...
