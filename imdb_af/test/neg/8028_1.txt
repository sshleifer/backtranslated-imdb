<br /> <br /> I rented this movie on June 20, 2001, and watched it for about 45 minutes. I concluded that an empty screen would be a beautiful display. There was not a single person in the throw for whom I would have torn if hell opened and swallowed them all. <br /> <br /> So, I've sent all my friends emails and family members warn them, and I take the time to encourage anyone who sees this note to avoid this movie like the plague! I saw some very bad movies in my time, but never as bad as that.
