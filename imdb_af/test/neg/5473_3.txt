Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing join in a horror movie; It always sounds like a great plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who have previously teamed up in tremendous genre outings such as "The Flesh and the Fiends" and "From Beyond the Grave", have in the midst of the 70s satanic theme exploitation movie paired. How can this possibly go wrong? Well, unfortunately it can. To my great regret, "Land of the Minotaur" cannot even be called mediocre, despite the cast, the exotic setting, the attractive title and the potentially good sounding premise. In a remote small area in Greece, especially near an archaeological site, several tourists disappear because Baron Peter Cushing and his brave followers feed it on a fire-breathing Minotaur statue. Cushing, who was never bored and uninteresting in any role he had previously played, owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek it also has the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground cave network. This is of course pretty handy if your hobby is kidnapping random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends also mysteriously disappeared in the same area, Father Roch - the priest of some towns previously - decided to investigate. "Land of the Minotaur" is a boring and extremely slow horror effort that never really made a great effort to generate a satanic atmosphere and did not bother to expand on all the possible fascinating elements and pagan trivia details no. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an intriguing being of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a human being, but for an inexplicable reason the meaning of the scripture is never deepened. Instead, the film focuses on boring and transferable sequences and loud inappropriate music changes with experimental sounds. The only reason to even consider giving this great disappointment to a movie is a chance to get Donald Pleasance. His depiction of rude, evil and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that modern youth represents is powerful and reliable as ever.
