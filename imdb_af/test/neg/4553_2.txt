It may well be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I don't usually watch that movie, but I was forced to watch it at school. What a torment! <br /> <br /> The story is as average and boring as it can be: Boy meets girl at Spanish coast, boy and girl fall in love, but love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is against their love . At the end of the movie, the film becomes a kind of strange kung-fu movie, while the guys in white fight the guys in black. Terrible! <br /> <br /> The action is so bad it makes you laugh. The dances in the movie I think should be cool are so simple and laughing that even I can do it! And Georgina Verbaan is probably the most annoying person I've ever seen on the screen. <br /> <br /> Johan Nijenhuis is on his way to becoming Dutch Ed Wood. His movies are so bad they make you laugh. <br /> <br /> However, Victor LÃ¶w gives a surprisingly good performance and Daan Schuurmans also performs OK. <br /> <br /> So, please. Don't look at this movie. But if you like to look at soap, it can be worth your time. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
