I just found out before writing this review that 'Komodo vs Cobra' and another movie, called 'Curse of the Komodo', were directed by the same man, Jim Wynorski. This can explain why their films are almost identical. They both have a military government, a colonel who is more concerned with covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people running to get a helicopter lying on a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragon created by genetic experiments. What are the differences? Well, the island's invaders are now capitalists who want to uncover government secretly and there's also a huge cobra on the island, hence the title "Komodo vs Cobra", although the conflict between the two monsters is almost relevant to the " story. "Komodo vs Cobra" is more or less what you would have expected given its title and its channel origin: the Sci-Fi channel, although you will occasionally find one that may appeal to you for some reason (I had a movie called "Komodo") I doubt so much about this one. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs Cobra" is not just a boring movie, but also one of those least enthusiastic sci-fi movie I've seen for a long time. In some of these movies there is an air for them that suggests that the filmmakers give at least a certain level of effort, but I see very little here. is shown by being just a rehash of "Curse of the Komodo." The CGI for the monsters seems to be coming straight from a two-day video game, the cinematography and misc and scene are poor, the acting ranges from passing to poor, the action scenes are dull and then there are parts that are, frankly, unforgivingly bad, I see many movies where one will often shoot a gun r to reload and I can handle it. But in this movie, Michael Paré takes a thirty-eight handgun and stops it for about fifty times without reloading once. Well, I first laughed, but even then it just got tired. That would be the 'action'. A monster appears, people scream, Paré burns without reloading his weapon once through the whole picture, and someone is eaten. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs Cobra" is a very bad movie. The only thing worth mentioning in the movie is an actress, Michelle Borth, who is not only beautiful, but also a surprisingly strong artist. Even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the script she was given, Michelle Borth managed to draw a surprisingly good performance and it made me just like an actress doing as well as her in a movie. rude can stand. Of course she took it for the salary, but it won't improve her career because I'm scared.
