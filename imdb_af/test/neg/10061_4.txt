It is indeed one of the worst films based on Agatha Christie's work, a lifeless, obscured mystery that clearly illustrates the grace (and budget!) Of its predecessors ("Death on the Nile", "Evil Under the Sun") ) and Donald Sutherland is a light shadow of Peter Ustinov as far as screen detectives are concerned (of course he plays a character that is less interesting than Poirot). The movie hits as far as possible on the coast of Christie's plot (all her plots have some degree of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat. (* 1/2)
