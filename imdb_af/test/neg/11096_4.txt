If you thought it was French The Mummy and if you were hoping for another "Vidocq" ... look elsewhere. It has the same kind of story as The Mummy about this book of death and a soul that has to find 7 missing pieces scattered in the Louvre. I found that the movie was a bit entertaining, boring. The special effects aren't bad, but it's not spectacular, as I expected huge explosions and maybe the eiffel tower broke down until I realized that such scenes were in The Mummy and that is Belhpegor. Apparently based on a French cult TV series, Belphegor could have been so much better. I voted this movie a 4/10 for the lovely Sophie Marceau ... she should be almost 40 and she looks awesome!
