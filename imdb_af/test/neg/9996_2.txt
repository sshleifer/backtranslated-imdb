It is an urgent, inert, self-important drill. If the only thing that suddenly gives a movie life is a hang, you know the business is seized. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic, typed, self-supporting, cartoon-spotted, insect-like caricature. Why he is so is never explained and we get scarce background information. The writing focuses on Capote's writing of "In Cold Blood" and his attachment to the damaged brothers who killed a family of four. The award-winning author of "To Kill A Mockingbird", Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), guides Capote in his initial inquiries into the crime, and her presence instantly presents a much more interesting subject for a biopsy. Unfortunately, Lee is rapidly gaining in favor of endless Capote scenes that make his painful existence. To look at him is to see how Dr. Smith of 'Lost in Space' complains about his "delicate back" to someone who will listen for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote was not. The film's precious self-interest kills it, as well as director Bennett Miller's reluctance to add any form of shadow. Like the morose piano score, the movie is a one note wonder, no contrast, no emotional color, and no intimate drama. If Capote was really annoying, why was a movie about him expecting audiences to see it? Although the supporting roles are well done (Chris Cooper is his usual stall black himself), they serve so little dramatic purpose because eventually it is all about Capote (!) Director Bennett and author Dan Futterman fail to engage their intended audience emotionally because they clearly overwhelmed by Capote's cultural baggage's "legend". Their product is a stillborn Oscar-bait ... and is more evidence that one great genre image has more truth in it than a dozen of such-so-genuine shit like this.
