Certainly, one of the lambs has ever produced on these shores and it says something. Even many of the lead actors did not stay for the duration. The fact that it ran for eight years is a sad indictment on the average intelligence and cultural nos of the Aussie viewer. It went in and out in circles, with repetitive gags and badly drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur, for the sake of God. did they actually pay the writers of this show? I wonder if anyone checked their qualifications. There were tired gags about rural people and bisexual farce situations that were poorly imitated by a thousand English and American sitcoms who had gone before. I think that's what I hate so much about it, it seems that nobody was involved in making it memorable, original or clever, but rather choosing the lowest common denominator.
