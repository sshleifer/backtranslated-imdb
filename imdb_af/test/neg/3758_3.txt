I see a pattern here. If you see a movie at Mystery Science Theater 3000, there are chances to watch IMDb.com, there will be horde movie lovers, but it has been chosen to be on the TV program because it was so bad. I'm sorry, but I've read a lot about Rocketship X-M as a remarkable sci-fi movie that emphasized realism. Well, if that is the case, then I can write about several paragraphs about how even this 1950's, this movie is completely erroneous. Gravity can be the first obvious sight, or like MST3K as a cake "selective gravity", also how it goes when they wander their death and they just stand there looking out the window, and the ship will not don't be. finishing the scene? I would have liked to think that they started out with good intentions and that it ran over the budget or something, but I think this movie was just plain cheese as in the underpay. Just compare it to "When Worlds Collide" released in 1951 to see the right place where this movie is, there is no comparison. The movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own, it's not even funny to look at itself. It's about a 5 or 6 as an MST3K episode, because there's no action or much to make fun, just bad, bad, bad, oh I said, it's bad.
