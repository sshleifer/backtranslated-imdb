Of the thousands of movies I have seen so far, this is the first one to remind me of the expression "wasted talents". I have never seen so many good actors giving such terrible performances (Frederic Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein, etc.). The "aging" makeup is rather awful, and to make it worse, lightweight. The use of music (for example, love at first sight for the young aide the camp) is sometimes so caricature that I can smile at most spectators around me, smiling uncomfortably. So far Antoine de Caunes has become quite a good actor, but I think he should start considering acting, seeing this one and "les morsures de l'aube". Please Antoine, give that "master of balance tree" project; I doubt you deserve it.
