Buy for Â£ 1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Woodworking, lambing and a horrible story make everyone a movie you have no reason to even see. PV is one of those movies that doesn't even have the good grace in a pleasant way, but it looks as if this gall is so extremely dull, stupid and slim as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> A vampire has created a serum that he sells to old people as a lifesaver, and those who take it fall under his control. A former lab coach boasts a nurse to stop him. Someone had to stop the makers of this litter. <br /> <br /> No one has any reason to see this movie, and I'm actually shocked by mankind based on the fact that 2 people wrote it in horror 10 out of 10.
