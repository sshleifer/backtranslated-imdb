A post-apocalyptic warrior is going to save some kind of Nun and on the way some cyber-punks meet skaters who want to kick his ass. It's one of the most difficult to ever watch movies. There are scenes with silence that seem to last for hours before someone comes out with the next poorly written, poorly acted line. There are action series that continue to repeat - and we're not talking about the quickfire 1-2-3 action repetition on a particularly good kick made by Eastern directors. We talk a lot, many repetitions of long, bad battle series. It is incredibly confusing at first, but then it quickly becomes annoying as you watch a 30 second order for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th times. Any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity. The only thing that keeps this movie in the video player (apart from the commitment of a friend I couldn't see all the way through without pleading that it should be turned off and it's done away safely so it can't harm anyone else) is the fact that although painfully this movie is inadvertently hilarious, I was not a fan of the "so bad it is funny" was in tears. Other points to note are the quality of the sound and the picture, but this is comparable because it is clear that money was a big problem in making this movie. Final verdict - King of the "so bad it is funny" genre, anyone who has that kind of genre video night, must get himself a copy. Let's not forget that it's actually the worst movie I've ever seen.
