Seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondering how it could be in the Oscar shortlist. The most sad thing is: <br /> <br /> 1. It's very slow. <br /> <br /> 2. How can Ghengis khan, cruel and powerful Asia emperor be played by a good, good actor with warm and sweet eyes - during all the movie except one scene? <br /> <br /> 3. Many holes in the plot: there is nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about spending 20 years between childhood and adulthood. We see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home. Click! - The next second he leads the great army, without any reason to be a leader. <br /> <br /> 4. The magic of Ghengis-khan originates, is kindly explained only by the help of one wolf / god / who it was. <br /> <br /> 5. Can a man love his wife after not seeing her for years? <br /> <br /> 6. Is it enough to win the sword battle if you just drive your horse through enemy lines, sit there with two swords and die all around you? Ken Ridley Scott so? <br /> <br /> 7. Why doesn't Khan's mother look older after 20-30 years? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation for the main character? (No literally.) <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Really. Combatographers' work is good; Nature is outstanding - but the movie cannot be made without director and screenplay. The real Ghengis khan will perform in a second director. <br /> <br /> Kind regards.
