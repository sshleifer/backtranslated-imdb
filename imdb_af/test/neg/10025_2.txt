Oh yes, this one is definitely a strong contender to win the dubious award of "the worst 80's shooter ever made". "The Prey" has everything you usually want to avoid in a horror movie: a routine-derived plot that you have seen a thousand times before (and better), incapable characters and terrible appearances, a complete lack of gore and tension , fuzzy photography and unoriginal places and ?? most annoying of all? the greatest amount of useless padding you've ever experienced in your life (and it's not an exaggeration, but a guarantee!). Apart from the seemingly endless amount of National Geographic stock that I later expand, this movie is scandalous enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) And include two occasions where characters are dillydally telling jokes that aren't even very funny! The setup is as rudimentary as it gets, with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with OTT voice over human screams. Fast forward almost forty years later, when an elderly couple camps in the same area, the ax is struck by something breathtaking on the screen. It should be enough information to analyze that someone has survived the fire for many years and has since moved on. Give up three unbearable twenty couples to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds. Unconsciously, of course, they put ducks for stalking and armor. "The Prey" is an irreparable boring movie. Apparently it's been shot in 1978, but no one wanted to distribute it until 1984 and it's not too difficult to see why. If you filter out all the content that is really relevant, it would just be a short movie with a 30 minute run time; possibly even less. There is an incredible amount of wildlife and wildlife, sometimes of animals I don't even think live in that area, and they seem to be going forever. The only thing missing is the typical National Geographic narrative that provides educational information on animal habits. Animals in their own natural biotope are undoubtedly nice to watch, but not in a so-called boring and cheesy 80's treasure movie to cry out loud. The last fifteen minutes are finally worth anything, with some powerful lethal sequences and delicate makeup effects on the monster (which seems to be Lurch from The Addams Family movies), but still silliness overrules ?? The vulture scene is too stupid? and the last shot was only delayed laughingly. As mentioned above, "The Prey" makes my own personal list of the worst 80's slides, next to "Appointment with Fear", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Do not Go in the Woods", "Hollow Gate". "The Stay Awake" and "Curfew".
