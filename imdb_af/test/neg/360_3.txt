This is the story of a maniac cop who for some reason has it for a young college stud and his friends. After reporting to his supervisor, who paused him in anticipation of the psychiatric evaluation, he found the opportunity to torture psychology when the children in a storeroom's security hooked up the security and opened the door. First, they are locked in the shop, along with the weirdo. Murder and abuse are underway, and the children are running around trying to survive until the morning when they may escape. <br /> <br /> 'Dangerous game' would have been a successful cat and mouse psychotriller. if it is set elsewhere. The thought of a psychotic cop who was chasing behind a lot of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work. Especially when he faces his flaky prey quite regularly and yet, it doesn't get very serious. There was no real confrontation, as it would be sufficient for this kind of story and could have worked better if, for example, the teenagers were released nearby, and to defend themselves against this wonder (especially if it was a few days while he making them more paranoid ... even though it is granted, even it is clich√©). <br /> <br /> What a shame too that it couldn't be a better thriller, taking into account a joyful young Australian character. Even a light-hearted adventure despite the madness of the villain hit by the picture could have made it even more satisfying. Instead, it started fresh, and surely he had many action sequences, but erected in the ridiculous way.
