Robin Williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity that the material is not enough for a match for him. It can work if you buy in the "U-S! A Number One!" mentality, but story shows nothing much happens. Very sorry, as the movie really tries to say something, and says it sincerely. It just doesn't take enough emotional punch.
