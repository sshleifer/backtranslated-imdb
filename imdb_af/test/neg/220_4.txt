There is not much to add to what others have already commented on, the movie fails hard where it should not be, it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing It made me think, it was while the rest of the gang was trying to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck because there was no other way to open it. don't make it easy for the man in the truck to remove the floor of the truck that has a hole in it so that it can come out and then return, without being noticed by anyone, because no one else can think of it. could come or even better, that they could have come in from there. <br /> <br /> Promising but not quite there.
