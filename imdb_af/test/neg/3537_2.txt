I really loved the Millennium series, with Lance Henriksen, so I bought the movie. It was obvious that it was a mistake at some level. Mutant / sample films are usually very bad and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> The basic idea itself is not completely judged to fail (though, but this movie would never have been a success, even with good directors & actors), but the way it did It seems this is just a B-class movie. The screens that are supposed to be frightening seem more funny to me and the critter is not credible at all. <br /> <br /> But watch this movie with a group of friends in restless mood, make this movie shine as it is unintentionally hilarious.
