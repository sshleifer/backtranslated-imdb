Actually, I don't tell the main plot in these comments, but with just 2-3 sentences I can make it a spoiler. OK here it is <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is just an 85% success of Hollywood Flick Cellular in Bollywood using the software Vikram Bhatt. Title doesn't match the story, but it's just in the thriller direction. Just that! It doesn't even deserve a single star for its imitation, imperfect decisive, poor standard and predictable story. Undoubtedly, I can now say that Viram Bhatt is disappearing slowly from his director's status, as no adult audience will appreciate his recent works, including this one. Besides him, Aftab Shivdasani also makes his prospect as a cartoon comic type. Who knows how long will he be in the movie industry? Sometimes the standard appears in performances and movies as lower than a C-grade movie. But the most supportive role was played by Zayed Khan, who was somewhat identical to Chris Evan's role as Ryan in Cellular. With innocent face, Sanjay Suri made no contribution to the movie, as he didn't impress. Therefore, those who have already looked at Cellular I recommended never to waste your time with this imitation bag.
