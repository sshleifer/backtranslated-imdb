the acting is good. it's the positive out of the way! SOSN is flat and superficial. Almost all characters are middle class and English. The gay men are portrayed as capricious sexual predators aimed at using children in their empty lives. This movie can only appeal to people who know Hampstead Heath and will be less satisfying. of pointing out any landmarks. There is no time to engage with the characters and have a result you really don't do, don't care about them, Catherine Tate informed of her comic celebrities as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on the screen. about the same time as her Nana sketches did not convince, but if she said "what about ****** freedom" I would have agreed. <br /> <br /> I'd rather be in the Park; unintentional junk!
