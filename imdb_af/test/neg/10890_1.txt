I only comment on really good movies and on rude garbage. My goal is to help people who want to see good movies to spend their time - and money - show. <br /> <br /> I also want to stop people from wasting their time on garbage, and want to announce that the director / manufacturer of these garbage films can't get away for that long. We will find out who you are and will vote with your feet and purses. <br /> <br /> This movie is clearly in the garbage category. <br /> <br /> The director and author is John Shiban. It's always a bad sign when the author is also the director. Maybe he wants to pay two checks. He shouldn't get anything. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see something else, forget it. <br /> <br /> I won't say anything about the plot - others already have. I'm a little worried about how much the director likes to zoom in the poor girl's face when she cries and screams. These long-lasting shots are a little worrying and can say something about the state of mind of Mr. Shiban. Maybe he should get psychiatric help. <br /> <br /> Enough already. It's a crap - don't waste your time.
