This movie is terrible. The acting is cheese and laughter. If you know about Rugby at all, the game action is boring. In fact, any episode of Power Rangers contains more realism than this movie. The "action" consists of no more than one pass and a shot of the man who landed on the test line or without the ball, and witches hand photos of who knows what. It is impossible to tell. There is nothing about the excitement, skill and construction of the real Rugby Test. As for the haka, it's a bunch of yanks trying to imitate a tradition they know nothing about, much like the white rasta character that had to be left out of the movie. The next time a Rugby movie was made, we can only hope that people who know Rugby make it.
