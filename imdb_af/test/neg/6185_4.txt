Does anyone know BRAVEHEART? It was Mel Gibson, who was also written and written by Randall Wallace. The movie contains more than 200 errors. Does anyone know the GREEN TALK? This is the John Wayne western where the Duke saves an apartment called Vietnam from a bunch of communist tribes. If you look, we were SOLDERS, you can't help but are reminded of these two movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, what about the Scottish lament that was played three times in the movie, four if you count the final credits? I mean what is the relationship between Scotland and Nam? Perhaps Wallace is eagerly hoping that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - unconditionally, I could add - with several Oscars, might it be this movie? Whatever it included, it really made pots. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I expected him to do something like "They Will Never Take Our Freedom - Hell They Will" and it is impossible not to find other agreements with the GREEN TEST not see. like the subplot of a journalist who picks up a gun and becomes a warrior, and Moore tells the journalist about blame in a scene, almost identical to the one seen in the Wayne movie. <br /> <br /> When the audience of others is not reminded movies WWS also fails to stand on its own, it is based on real-life events in 1965 but needs a lack of integrity to correct the story to make. It never feels like 1965 and probably has a sense of time and place because it was filmed in America not Asia. Hal Moore may have brushed the French experience in Indo-China, but if that was the case, he was unique because the US army went out to read the French Indo-China war. the previous conflict Westmoreland replied that he had nothing to learn from the French. "Who has not won a war since the days of Napoleon", so I was confused about the portrayal of the NVA in this movie then in 1965 the US High Command, full of hubris disdain North Vietnam and VC . It is as if history has been rewritten to show the rice farmers of Vietnam, are superlative warriors. They are, but very few Americans believed it in the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> There are some other things that confuse me like how the women come back home, get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead? No bodies are shown to be flown to the base and no one is seen on the screen referring to whose death was killed in the La Drang Valley. Similarly, we do not see reinforcements coming on the screen, how do we suddenly see the Americans the NVA number? I put it down as director / editing blunders on the side of Wallace who doesn't hit me so much with a director, and his biggest problem seems to be the horror of the fight. Take the scene blown away by the American to a sharp fire. "Tell my wife, I love her." It should have an emotional impact, similar to that of PLATOON's death scene, but there is no impact here. In fact, I clicked the scene and found patronizing, and he is not the only character to give the words "Tell my wife ..." while it is mutilating or dying, and I have used at least two other characters . Did characters actually say it during the fight? I have no idea, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script, I have a discussion. <br /> <br /> I sit in shocked awe, watch APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes water, I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET, I watched my watch with THE ANIMAL HUNTER, and after I seen that we were SOLDERS, I felt completely unrelenting
