I rented this movie with Netflix, I think I would receive the 1972 version. I sat clueless, watch this new version, think: Give, the production values ​​were spectacular! I was convinced that the soundtrack had a slight 70s sound. I was even more convinced it was a 70-year-old movie when it appeared almost every five seconds that one thing missing between Gene and Finney was an intense hug, a charged stare, a passionate kiss. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, although John Knowles himself said it wasn't a homosexual relationship, it's painfully clear that yes, that's exactly what it was. When people (usually adolescents) of the same sex have "intense" friendships, it means that the longing for love, togetherness, the desire to express themselves sexually, all overflow. These boys had to join, but they were never allowed. <br /> <br /> Also, despite a healthy performance by Toby Moore, I never felt any of the emotions really were. I never linked to one of the boys, so their relationship was not really honest. <br /> <br /> People want to live in a fantasy and think this because it happened in the 1940s that these boys didn't "I had these sexual feelings for each other. But I say they have - at least in the book they did, and in this movie Finney had them, almost painfully, for Gene. The "intensity" suggested by John Knowles existed between them, was a closet of homosexuality, a heroism, an idolatry - it would be sexually expressed under normal circumstances. Even if these boys suppressed it, it had to be crystal clear, but this movie doesn't even look like it. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is an incredibly bizarre moment when Finney, who broke his leg, is played by a ball game by all the other boys. Unless they were just a lot of nincompos, they would know they couldn't throw their bodies against him. It was clear that this bottling moment was lost to both the director and the producer.
