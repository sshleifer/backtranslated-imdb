In my opinion, a good documentary - especially one that deals with controversial political issues - should be informative and so unbiased. The point must reveal the truth. This means in particular among the interrogation experts on the subject and representatives from all sides. This movie is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of "street men" outlining the issue of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is not completely treated. For most interviews, the interviewer simply waits to be approached and asks general questions such as "what do you think of the wall?" - She doesn't fall random people near the wall and asks them how they were directly affected. Outside of one interrogator, the Israeli general in charge of the wall's construction, we have no "experts" on the subject to provide us with the wall's context (eg, how and when the project started, whether it was successful, what groups are and what is against the project, etc.) <br /> <br /> Outside the interviews, a very large portion of the film consists of extensive shots of inevitable scenes, such as wall shots, wall construction , and people go out of a bus. These shots take too much time in my opinion. It is nice to see what the wall looks like, but the 20-30 minutes of head-on-and-shoot of the wall (and just the wall) is excessive. Obviously, these shots (accompanied by Arabian music depicting a sense of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of arousing viewers' feelings of dislike for the wall.
