This movie looks fun on the front page and I honestly thought "how bad can it be?" Little did I know. Out of the gate, the dialogue was unbearable. It was confronted, unrealistic and not even interesting. Dialogue on UPN syndicated television programs is more natural sounding. The story was unreliable and played almost nil at the end. The end with the snake is almost confusing and has occurred. The only distant character is Rose McGowen, who is dumb who prevents her from destroying with the Clich√©-ridden garbage dialogue (well, at least until the end even she has to speak). The only thing that even gives it a 3 over a 1 or 2 is Rose McGowen's latest scene. Actually terrible. Save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting like a Barney Video.
