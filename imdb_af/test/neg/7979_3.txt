It was my very first "Bollywood" movie and I found it just like many other recent viewers have done - through "Ghost World". After reading this week a bit on Bollywood's film industry, I understand why there are apparently unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror movie. But "Something for everyone" does not always add a coherent product. <br /> <br /> The ultra-ravenous musical dance number "Jaan Pehechaan Ho" captivated the world in a way it probably couldn't have done in 1965. It's all over the Internet, with many people coming for scrambling good English translation. Laxmi Chhaya does a great work dance that takes, making it all fresh, new and fun, even when any normal person will be exhausted! She rules! <br /> <br /> On the beach with Miss Kitty is a lightweight fun and beautiful tune in total contrast to the horror plot. Yet I found myself in Hindi a week later. I found a rough translation: <br /> <br /> If you want to live in this life, then listen to what I say, leave you sad and come to the party, take my advice <br /> <br /> those who want to live with laughter and sing, let your hair down and relax people of this world who do you know? come to me and i will explain <br /> <br /> whoever who will see me will stop worrying in this world. fish swim here and there freely <br /> <br /> My second favorite number in the movie is The Butler's Dream where Mehmood is captivated by Miss Kitty's dance. The electric tiki-like idols are just wonderfully sweet like the whole set of this number. Online, I saw it as what would happen if "Liberace throws" !! Fun away. <br /> <br /> Gum name is not a good movie as a whole. That's why I gave it a score of 3. It's actually a real stinker of a movie with some fun, kitschy musical numbers that have nothing to do with the murder total.
