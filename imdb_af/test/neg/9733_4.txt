Basic Summary: Ipswitch was a community of witches and escaped the witch dogs of Salem by forming a covenant of secrecy. The first born men who come from these families have supernatural powers and must speak with the seductive, addictive nature of using those powers. <br /> <br /> Well, I usually give movies the benefit of the doubt and start from a 5 that goes from there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 for many obvious audio from the synchronization, +1 for nice special effects, the dark actually gave me cold fever, +0.5 for nice coloration the dim blue), -0.5 for the silly soundtrack, +0.5 for the opening sequence - I'm a sucker for stylish composition and flashing title design. / for dull, predictable ending, -1 for free-to-play, both as words across the screen and as a mere monologue <br /> <br /> Acting / Characterization: -0.5 for bad bad acting, although it gets a little better as the film progresses, -1 for lacquered character development, especially among all females. <br /> <br /> Other: +1 for priceless male and female nudity, nice to watch, and +0.5 for no sex scenes usually done for this genre. very bad and gets boring rather than hot, +1 to hit his target audience, teen sci-fi / horror / thriller fans, although this movie is not just any of those genres. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not a "movie", it's a movie. There is really nothing to analyze, it's just good, relatively clean. Many really attractive actors and actresses. Many boys are fighting in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects, and / or sensible plots, this movie is for you. If you prefer Oscar-worthy, beautifully-crafted movie masterpieces with tons of multi-layered, allegorical plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques, you probably won't like this movie. <br /> <br /> With my twisted logic, this movie gets a 4/10.
