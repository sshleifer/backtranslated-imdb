It is important to keep in mind the true meaning of the phrase "Inspired by a true story" when looking at Pride. It's like "You can save up to 50%," which can literally be translated into "You can't save more than 50%." It sounds good until you realize that the bottom part is from "to" zero. Likewise, "inspired by a real story" means someone has heard a story and it reminds them of this one. The only certainty is that the true story and the one you're about to see are not the same thing. <br /> <br /> There is a real Jim Ellis who started the swimming team at the Philadelphia Department of Recreation in the early 1970s, but I have a feeling that real Jim Ellis doesn't feel the disappointment of that way. on which the movie was able to hide. Obviously, it increases the freedom of freedom with the story of his life, and I just showed him how he responds to the strange appearance of his friends wondering why the movie is so different from the man they know. <br /> <br /> One thing he will surely be proud of is that he is portrayed by Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who played alongside Bernie Mac, which despite the lack of an original and powerful story still gives a sincere and moving story. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1970 Philadelphia, a time and place where racism was the norm, not the exception, and the educated and professional Jim Ellis, who is also an adult swimmer, has trouble for a valuable teaching position until it eventually fell into a separate recreation center, which it assigned the task of clearing up before its demolition. We can definitely understand his sense of promise. <br /> <br /> When we meet Elston, the interviewer (Bernie Mac), he is a disillusioned bunch of people sitting in his office, surrounded by heaps of scrap that hit the ceiling and watch TV on a day, dusty television set. Needless to say, if Jim arrives to clean up and erase the place, Elston is not very friendly with him. He knew his rest center was closed, and all his anger over it conveyed over Jim. <br /> <br /> Given his past as a college swimmer, Jim takes a special interest in the pool, which he cleans and fills and brings to the top. A group of black teens who play basketball just outside the center take an interest in the pool when their basketball sheet is taken away and the heat continues to choke and soon the group has a developing swimming team on their hands, which will swim into a city-wide entry . Of course, to call their underdogs would be something of an understatement. They are disorganized, unprofessional, inadequately trained, and have no idea how to act during a swimming meeting. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, of course. The movie is your standard undercover sporting story, so the first athletic outing is totally unimportant as something other than a learning experience, a catalyst to manage their much harder and much more focused training that will lead to the final athletic outing, the one that issues. The only thing a sports movie goes for is that the protagonist (s) don't have to win on the climax. We just need to understand the meaning and meaning of their effort. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie has all the character development of an old Seagal movie. The good guys are the good guys because they are just supposed to be, and the bad guys are the nasty white swimmers who laugh and pity and make racial jokes with our team. Oh, and there's one scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys underwater while they're in the middle of a race. I didn't know it was really possible to kick someone under water, but you get the idea of ​​how deep the character development is. <br /> <br /> We understand that this is the group of children that Jim Ellis turns From children walking around the streets, doing nothing about their lives and in an organized and competitive team of swimmers, but otherwise we learn not really who they are. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that the only real statements the movie makes, that effort and organization lead to success and racism is bad. Both of these are so clear that when a movie is made with them alone, it eventually feels empty and unnecessary. Racism was so much more powerful in America in the 1970s that it felt like it was a huge loss that the movie dealt with the problem directly, but didn't really say it. It's kind of a good movie, but if it's over and you realize how much it should be said, it's much bigger than it said, the feeling-good sensation becomes a sad disappointment.
