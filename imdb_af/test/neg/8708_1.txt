This movie deviated from the Bible and fell under the bar of the 1956 movie. I hate replacing the 2006 film about the traditionally seen 10 commandments. Moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the kind of watchman Charelston Heston in the 1956 movie. I won't waste my time watching this movie again. They tried so hard to modernize this movie to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera (and not a good one). I am pretty sure that boys out there who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments may disagree with me, but for each one their own. Also, it took them 10 years to make the first 10 commandments. It probably took them 2 months to make this one. The special effects were not as incredible as the first, and after all those years with so much technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.
