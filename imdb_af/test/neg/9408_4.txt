Al Pacino was once an actor who was able to do a role without constantly making use of profanity. In other words, when he can act, he doesn't have to talk like a street junkie. McConaughey had to be impressed by Pacino because he also became a promoter of the F word. This may be the kind of society they actually live in, but most of us have the general decency to see what we say in mixed business. I don't remember the exact words a professor used to explain the constant use of curse, but it was. "It shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and a lack of respect for everyone who needs to listen." Perhaps it's time for Al to take courses again to strengthen his talent. Oh yes, the movie ... Probably the worse thing McConaughey played. Hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo was as always warm.
