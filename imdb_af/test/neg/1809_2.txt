A television version of the Heart of Darkness looked like a great way to get more insight into the book, well, that was the wrong assumption. The movie made it even worse. I was very disappointed with almost everything in the movie. I was hoping the movie might help put the pieces of the book together that I didn't understand, but it didn't do that. It still confused and hung me. This is one of those movies that makes it feel better to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie. Not exactly someone's cup of tea. It was a totally horrible, boring and slow movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Nicolas Roeg had to be quite desperate when he decided to make the boring book a movie. . This is a guaranteed loss. It's like going into a knife fight, but forgetting the knife on the kitchen counter. The blunt person will lose; And in that case the knifeless person was Roeg. All I heard from the movie is bad, and the movie deserves the bad things to say about it. From the look of the movie I got the impression that the people who made the movie just slumbered over the book to get the key points. <br /> <br /> However, the movie followed the main story of the book, which left a few details, and it also changed the end. I'm not a fan of it. Roeg ran out when Marlow and his crew came over the Russian sailor's camp, and at the camp they found the book. It didn't show when they got to the camp, they said, "Wood for you. Hurry up. Be careful." (Conrad 110). Also at the end of the book Kurtz dies on the boat, not at the inner station. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Nicolas Roeg did one good thing while making his movie; He managed to hire some pretty decent actors to play in the movie. For example, he obtained Tim Roth and John Malkovich, who will both later have successful careers. Thereby he added a little something to the terrible movie. Also, although I rip his book, I have some respect for him, because it takes a lot of courage to try to tackle the heart of darkness. It's not exactly the easiest novel to portray in a movie. Twus a brave effort, though! Finally, if I want to, for whatever reason, I want to read the Heart of Darkness first. This way, you get all the screens left out of the movie and you won't be completely lost when you see it. But I really suggest you not read the book and you don't really watch the movie; both will be a total waste of your time. Trust me. I was forced to do both by my English teacher, and now I wish the book and the movie didn't exist. If the book or the film is pursued, good luck!
