Enjoy the opening credits. They are the best thing about this two-day but unofficial killer that includes passive performances by Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. However, the lead goes to newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas, who is a bit slow for this kind of action, but who sometimes plans a banty-cock type of crisis. The first time we see him, he is bare, cold, sweaty, and involved in the favorite "beefcake" activity - carving. Then he had seven more scenes without his shirt, including one in which he was hung at his wrists and a la Mel Gibson with electricity in 'Lethal Weapon'. However, he can use a better writing, as the way he exposes the truth about corruption and violence within prison is never very convincing. There is also talk of millions of dollars apparently linked to this investigation, but never explained. There are, however, some pluses. Sending "John Woodrow" as "John Wilson" is a wonderful game on a presidential name, and co-star Jody (Ross) Nolan shows promise as a prisoner who is hung up and beaten by his joints early in the proceedings be. by a burly guard. One final note: the film's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras". Despite the impressive size of the prison, it only seems to hold about 12 prisoners! (Note: the awards are not helpful. For the record, the fast-paced bailiff, using Jody Nolan as a pouch, plays by Bill Fishback and the young, fair guard who administers electric shocks to Tommy Lee). Thomas is played by Marc Chenail.)
