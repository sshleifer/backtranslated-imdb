Well, we're starting to shrink in the office, and apparently not a very good one. The chief hero of the first Jack Frost is in the shrink office that eradicates random rhymes about Jack Frost. Give, well, call my brother '' Switch it off! ''. Anyway, back to the cartoon. <br /> <br /> Shrinking his speakerphone and letting his secretary and her friends listen to this heroic insane sheriff. I suppose he must be the hero of the first movie, but he doesn't look like him! Yadda yadda yadda, they were lying at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. Now some people are digging the anti-frozen snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some kind of doctor people. I don't quite see how it should do, but they make the anti-freeze / evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heat it, shock it, add strange and bizarre chemicals to it, all nine meters. Nothing. Well, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. One of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank. The lawyer walks in, cleans up, throws the fish bowl and the coffee pours the tank that makes Jack live. <br /> <br /> Look at the power of mocha! Now he's somehow. I believe the Bahamas ... but it looks more like Hawaii. But it can't be Hawaii! Unless they spent all their budget on the airplane tickets. Bah .. I will not spoil the rest of this rotten movie, so you have to rent it and see it for yourself .... I will not imagine ... Sheesh ..
