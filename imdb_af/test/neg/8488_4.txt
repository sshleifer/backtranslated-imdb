Actually, Son of the Mask made me laugh, laughed a few times ... mostly because of the cartoon jokes that Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner made so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie. Garfield, for example, is not true to CGI, but I will give it the same voice. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows the story ... which wasn't so bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it is a KIDS movie ... and therefore it should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good at his role. His attempts to act "crazy" are not very good, and overall acting is poor. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is not bad. <br /> <br /> Basically, my 2 and 5 year olds look the whole thing without complaining. At least I could sit through this. <br /> <br /> There is no way this movie is worst than ** shake ** Class of 1999 <br /> <br /> 4/10 for CGI and a few laughs.
