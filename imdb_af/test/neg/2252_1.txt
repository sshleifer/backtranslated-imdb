I have deliberately read no reviews of this movie on IMDb before I watched it, because I really wanted to see it and make my own thoughts. I was a big fan of QT in the past, I think we can all agree that he has made some good movies, but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mysticism and has lost his own foundation . This "movie" proves it. It consists of several scenes from the Basterds at work. It consists mainly of long, boring, boring conversations between people who after a while realize you are just giving nothing. It is long-winded and has none of the great sparkling dialogue that QT was responsible in the past. The whole movie is anticlimactic. There is no tension - what is going to happen in every scene is so pre-engraved that by the time it happens, you just don't mind. Honest people, don't believe the hype. It's a very boring movie and you won't miss anything if you don't see it.
