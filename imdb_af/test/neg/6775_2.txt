Let me say that this new He-Man cartoon does not destroy childhood memories, because I also did not have the old He-Man cartoon. I loved the action characters, but I got the cartoon, and I hated the storyline. (The He-Man I liked was one of the very early pre-cartoon mini-cartoons included in the figure boxes, where He-Man was a Barbarian, the Sword of Power was divided into two pieces , and there was no Prince Adam, no Shazam ripoff premier, and no Orko). Anyway, let's leave the old stuff alone. <br /> <br /> The new He-Man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is a shame on its own. This represents both the worst cheesiness of the old show and the worst trends of today. I watched it, because I heard that the old face of the old show was (fortunately) gone, and this one had more swordplay and character development. But I got a terrible mishmash of the worst genres of the genre, characters I couldn't help but the unfortunately inevitable Matrix-esque visual style. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good idea to give some of the background to the characters, as it shows a skeleton-skeleton, but that's how far the character development goes, apart from the ordinary deviant garbage I see in subsequent episodes, where it teaches Teenieboer Adam the responsibility of his newly acquired powers, blah blah. At least in the old show, Adam was not a spoil! I found myself hating his bowels. This is what we get when they send out an adventure show aimed at pre-teens: pretty faces and wild-be-cool-and-look youthful clothes. I need to check out new episodes to see if N'Sync makes a special look. Man, show this show me the 1996 Flash Gordon stinkbomb cartoon! <br /> <br /> Dialogue? Ha! It follows absolutely every clich√© in the book, from the well-lil two-Randor shoes in the opening scene to Skeletor's immortal "Oh, and He-Man ... I lied!" in the end. And Skeletor's voice is still the same high-level as in the old series. 20 years, and nothing we learned. <br /> <br /> And sure, there's no remote connection today, it's not Matrix style. Leave Anime to the Japanese, people, think fresh ideas. And if we see the characters as they fight, it didn't help either. <br /> <br /> Of course we have our usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I think about it, who's going to name hell?) now has no yellow skin, but gray-ish. Oh, so no Asian people will offend. I bet Jitsu won't appear in the show either. Shades of the 1996 FG, where Ming the Merciless was a green, frog-like stranger! <br /> <br /> People are complaining about Cringer's lack of speech. I don't think I would have liked it more or less if Cringer had spoken, he was so grumpy enough. And you have your extra ration cheese with Orko! The shocking thing is, probably, many of the people who Jarat Binks (rightfully) hated could be great Orko fans ... <br /> <br /> I watched the long-term pilot and I have enough had. Leave the series alone. 2 out of 10.
