This version of "The Magic Flute" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great opera I've ever seen, it's also the worst video production I've seen of any opera. <br /> <br /> I am a great opera fan and I have more opera on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno doesn't even have a bird suit. He was dressed like an old man. That sound is mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated in orange. Most DVDs of this period have digitally recovered the color, but they did not bother with this one. Also, the language has changed in Swedish instead of the original German. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie version of "The Magic Flute." It is a filmed performance and it is not a good performance and it is not well filmed. You can choose any other available DVD from this opera and I guarantee it will be better than this. My preference is for the version performed by James Levine with sets by David Hockney.
