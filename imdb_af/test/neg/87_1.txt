I can't believe the high points people gave this movie on this site. The writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is trying to escape. (Don't you just hate it if it happens?). And the play is so very, very bad, that you can get a splinter in your eye from all the views that are chewed. <br /> <br /> A nut keeps her hostage, children are outside the open screen, so she falls for help instead of shouting when she was just brave enough to scream windows to scream at the same children . <br /> <br /> Finally, she is free and alone in the house. Her chance to help, so, what does she do? Wanders around the house and lying down. She's in the basement, shut down. So what does she do? Take a little swallow. Come on! Most of the movies are the nut that moves away and finds her sitting there slumbering when he wakes her up. Four times! What? If the author is bored to actually write a real plot, why should we pay attention? I think the key here is that it was originally a play for the radio, so they filled in with the heroine, but just to sit around as if they were writers and actually do something. <br /> <br /> And the end is terrible. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was completely unrelenting, terribly written and almost comic. Beware of this movie at all costs!
