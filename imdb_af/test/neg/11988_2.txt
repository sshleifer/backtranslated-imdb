I don't really think about the creative ideas that have come into this movie, but seriously. There is not one coherent part of the game in this movie. It seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want. These victims are almost entertaining because you know you're hiding behind a lack of skill and control of money (not yours) with which you can do it. Play a game or hire someone, and please make a real movie, or stand in the boxing ring and hand your butt to you, as you say, will not happen. <br /> <br /> Wow, 9 lines of text and I was done. had to add blah, sorry
