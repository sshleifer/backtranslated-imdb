The series does not start as it means to continue. Although it is the first two seasons, it is full of incredible average episodes, as well as numerous dudes, after which the pass is picked up and one of the best space operas is born. The first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is noteworthy for two things: these are very enjoyable introductions to all the main throws, and Marina Sirtis's particular accent that later disappears. To see how it all started is very satisfying, and taken into account for the rest of the series, but rather moving. Otherwise, it's a very mediocre episode with Q, and some giant jellyfish. That's right.
