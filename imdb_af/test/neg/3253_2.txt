Have you heard the excess cloning theory, where a copy is weaker than the original one? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of this. They are trying to duplicate everything from the first movie. Now, in a few cases it works. Robert Stack is actually a bit better than Ted Knight, when they essentially play the same character. I actually like Randy Quaid, who is no longer or less offensive than Bill Murray in the original. But Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield, and worse, C2 once and for all showed that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time. There is very little I like about him, and C2 nailed me the coffin on his "comic" career for me. He looks as though he is feeling the same, holding firmerly like Driving Miss Daisy and Psi factor. Other than that, it's mostly, "it's done," for Caddyshack. 2. View the original twice rather than each version once, and you'll get more for your rental.
