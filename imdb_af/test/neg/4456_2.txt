Of all the adaptations of books by Alistair MacLean, I feel that it qualifies the worst, but don't blame MacLean!. It seems that everything this movie shares with the novel has the same title. We have no tension, no sense to prevent mystery, no chance to really empathize with the main characters. We spend the whole time (or at least I did) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to shed her clothes. (For Charlotte, it looks like a remarkably long time!). Still, a look at Charlotte Rampling's tits can't really save this disastrous movie. MacLean was once again kicked in the gutter to endure the sniping of those bitter hacks and nit pickers that would blame him for all the injustices that attempted to film his books. Poor old Alistair should have crept into a corner and whispered when this one came out. At least "Bear Island" - which also uses the Maclean name, but apparently not one of his novels - was a LITTLE thrill. The excitement here is waiting for the final credits.
