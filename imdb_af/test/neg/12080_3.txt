<br /> <br /> This film was produced and released as a sequel to a horrific - though fairly popular - slapstick California's Hardbodies beach comedy, but has little or no connection to the previous movie and is better assessed fully in its own right. It is definitely better than Hardbodies I, and is more closely related to films such as Venus and Summer Lovers that were also filmed in the Greek Islands during the summer. The combination of happy beaches on blue jackets with beautiful bare bushes allows for seductive views, but (except travel stories designed to help you plan your next holiday), even such films require an adequate line of storyline if they pay attention to viewers. more than a few minutes. Venus was supported by the legend of the reincarnation of the goddess, and Summer Lovers had the feasibility of a "menage a trois" theme. In my opinion, both of these films were much more successful than Hardbodies II, which has a very turbulent storyline and is too much dependent on the simplistic semi-slapstick comedy. The use of slapstick becomes boring quickly. This usually leads to a series of very short, self-constructed sequoia that is difficult to integrate into a continuous story line. Mel Brooks made it brilliant with Silent Movie, but few other films did the same, and Hardbodies II did not. There is also the problem that the slapstick rows are not happy with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the movie is set. The last airport sequel was undoubtedly meant to make a hilarious end to this movie, but I think it's an example of the worst kind of surviving slapstick pseudo-comedy. They are also very long, so I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth. It's a movie that could have been very successful with a stronger storyline and cut most of its slapstick series. As it is released, it certainly does not guarantee a viewer rating that is higher than 3. <br /> <br /> There is little memorable acting, but the throw is doing its best within the constraints imposed by a meager story line and weak set direction. - It is in these latter areas that failure occurred. <br /> <br />
