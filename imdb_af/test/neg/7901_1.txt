I gave Soul Plane the benefit of the doubt and thought there would be something comical value in it. I'm not black, but that doesn't mean I can appreciate black comedy. I know this because I enjoy the Wayans Bros, Good Times and other series. <br /> <br /> I have seen shit films and are not easily repelled. As for Soul Plane, I didn't even bother it. Don't know if they could land the plane and I couldn't care less. It would be unfair to say I didn't get some funny as I laughed, but I also laugh at Youtube videos of skateboarders who fall on their nuts, so it doesn't say much. The men in the movie were like a lot of screaming hyenas in mating season, trying to get a little when and where possible. And we wonder why all the stereotypes do not disappear. To sum up: Soul Plane makes the Harold and Kumar series like The Godfather.
