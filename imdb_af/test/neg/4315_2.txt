It's total swill. If you take the devil's rejections and suck all the good of it, then add quite a few twisted, kinky bondage parts, a few rape scenes, and like one or two sincere terrifying scenes, and you'll get this movie. People call it a ripoff of '86's The Hitcher, but I don't see it at all. Even the worst Hitcher ripoffs are even better than that. The main problem presented here is that there is actually nothing here, except that some of the directors' fetishes are displayed like circus exhibits. Is everything you need from a movie shot of girls being abused and tied up in fear? Well, then rent this movie! <br /> <br /> But I'd rather just watch a good movie, that's not clear. The sad thing is, there are some very good excitement to discover here, but just a few. For example, the tension at the beginning before slavery started ... pretty damn good if you ask me. And the scene where the hitchhiker kills the nimho girl (can't remember names) is a cold, very cruel way, and even the devil's rejection of rampant anger. How can the rest of the movie not be so good? Huh? I really need to stop renting deadly crap. Closing message: Let these troughs just die and forget it forever. Not recommended.
