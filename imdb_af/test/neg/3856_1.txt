A friend of mine who has a mysterious attempt to find and - horrors! - Like bad movies I recommend watching "The Pest." At the moment not aware of how truly pathetic his taste was in movies, I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> Bad error. <br /> <br /> The story, although torn straight from any six-degree English textbook as far as the theme of the manhunter is concerned, will be amusing under the right conditions - good actors, writers, directors, wardrobe, etcetera. almost no end. Obviously these factors are absent. <br /> <br /> 'The scourge' is supposed to be funny, I think. I say "think" because I don't crack any more than a slight smile in the whole movie. Not a lick, not a laugh, not a sly, not even a smile. A nice, at best. And this happened so rarely while I watched this movie. I even remember how often I laughed - maybe 3 or 4 at best. <br /> <br /> So do yourself a huge favor. Never see this movie. Avoid at all costs.
