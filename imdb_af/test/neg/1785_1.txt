Why do you ask this man to have the truth behind the almighty existence? Well, his deductive logic my friends, you see I know that God exists, because Satan does, how else would my poor eyes be shamed on such a horrible film? Yes, there is no doubt about it. On a cold Friday in 2006, Satan owned me and forced me to watch this movie. He what? You wonder; The devil spits up little ones and climbs ceilings, why should he waste his time watching this movie? My only conclusion to the query is that Satan believes that Camp Fear is the worst form of mortal punishment, doesn't sting your eyes or let you speak in tongues, but makes you one and a half hours of the most horrible film ever made . Can this movie be as horrible as he says? Yes, my friend watching this movie is the equivalent of kicking about fifty million times in the bag, maybe more. But maybe I'm too hard, this movie has a few moments in it, the beginning, for example, in a girl's house with many topless girls. I'm not sure if girls really do it, but they can always pray. Now that the five minutes of the bobs and the tail cheeks have ended, we are presented at a campus on a girls' school. The girls themselves (about eight in all) are in an archaeological class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient hills. Blits ahead the class professor (who is apparently the only man at this girls school, apparently) takes a handful of his nubile students, plus girl, to a remote lake in the mountains, their quest to find ancient Indian artefacts ; yes right professor, we know what angle you raise. Now it's where the movie goes, the group of five, four girls, one man stops at a petrol station to get directions. But look, look, draw a bend and struggle with the girls to leave them alone and go their separate ways. As they move, they come to a "campsite" that consists of four logs and trees and then things start to go awfully wrong. First the prof. and his girlfriend walks away to have some time or another when one of the girls takes it on herself to find them, just to be trapped by an unknown force. When the other two girls start, they look for the missing girl when the bikers, plus one drunk, look for their plan, rape the girls and do horrible things to them. The movie continues with something about a grape that needs four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world a kind of water sample before the year two thousand. but they dislike this plan. Mr Druid, one of the girls is justified before us, so the plan goes away. Since I said, there will be spoilers. I will destroy the end of the movie, the four girls will be taken, with a few green throats and then ready to be sacrificed after one of them has been killed. remaining cyclists and the prof. come to save them; they are standing on an edge where the unfortunate motorcyclist says, "I think I can make it down there!" just to jump and break his leg. The prof. Run to the man and be patient, leaving just the one-time rape-now-fortunate cyclist to leave the 6'3 "giant druid. First, he makes a pathetic effort with a stick, then pulls a knife, the knife reflects a few laser beams in a golden snake mouth and lifts the drop at the same time, after they have carried the wound through emergency sticks, they think everything is really over, just to show the multiple tube where the sample is inside is the movie and this is my review, which unfortunately will be unread by most eyes as it is only the fifth posted review for a movie that was out of fifteen years. Judge would like to apologize to the poor girl at Circuit City, and I will borrow this movie: "I'm sorry Sheila, please don't hate me to show it."
