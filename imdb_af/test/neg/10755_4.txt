What we know about Caravaggio is a sharp brawler with a sound legal mind who lived and hid on whores and thieves and hustlers. His works included sex, death, salvation, especially the saint in the profane. He lived at a time when homosexuality bore a death sentence, and political intrigues usually defined deadly deaths in a society that was riddled with the riddle to strangle the boy for the purity of his scream. <br /> <br /> You can't make Derek wrong. Jarman for his cinematography, or his recreation of Caravaggio's paintings and you certainly can't accuse the man of chasing homosexuality. But honestly, Jarman never rejects more than 80's caricature. Italian patronage becomes the 80s London art scene with beautiful waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a sexy little bit of the Northern Raw Oil of his motorcycle. Tilda Swinton is worthy of a Mills and Boons transformation ("Why, Miss Lena, without the gypsy headscarf, you're pretty ..."). Jarman gives Caravaggio a particularly urgent motive for the murder that ignored him. <br /> <br /> It could have been a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous, exciting, violent and decadent but watching the lives of ordinary people as Renaissance masterpieces. and kings. Instead, what you get is Pierre et Gilles, Italy. The beautiful bodies of young boys are shown to perfection, but never the men they inhabit. Jarman apparently satirises the London art scene and shows it level and pretentious. Using Caravaggio and Renaissance Italy to make the point is to use a silk handbag to make a pig's ear. In fairness, this film remains visually astounding, but ultimately as two-dimensional as the paintings it describes.
