I was also disappointed with this movie. To begin with, the things that happen to him do not seem to me to be too terrible. (Sorry male chauvinist PoV). As one of the lady prisoners said, "Most men will be in your position." To whom he replies, "But it's not my choice." OK, OK, fair point, so, how bad was it really? Please let us know. But now the kicker: He doesn't know until the movie (invisible). Not his girlfriend, not mentor, not police, not someone. Instead, he comes up with the brilliant plan of every girl he knows so that he can recognize the tattoo (or something) of one of his prisoners. I thought he had just enough unpleasant sex during the 12 days of his imprisonment? Isn't it time to take a break? For me, to put it mildly, badly touched actions have broken the "suspension of unbelief" of the movie. I took out a book while watching the corner of my eye for the last half hour.
