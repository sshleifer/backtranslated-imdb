It was argued as a successor to Crash Dive, who was a very good film in the low budget category. I believed this movie would be fine too, but I was wrong. First, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive, except that they both are on submarines. Secondly, the plot can be slow, boring, and in some cases completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie does not keep most people's attention. (I remember remembering to read a book during the slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes supposed to use dramatic effects that make the viewer laugh out loud. The corkscrew scene is definitely one. After finding out about my initial shock that anyone would take it and not know, people would not just believe it, but to laugh at it, I could find humor in it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the MD in a good subflick, watch Crash Dive and leave this lame movie on the shelf.
