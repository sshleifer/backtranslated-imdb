Daniel Auteuil's Bruno in Petites Couperes is a middle-aged model of his Pierre in Christian Vincent's La Separation of 10 years ago. In both films, youthful trust in leftist ideology and love (mutual metaphors) diminish in paranoia - manifesting itself as trapped aggression in Pierre and desperately comic women in the more recent Bruno. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for Auteuil fans, the actor relied on a uniform world power (unlike fellow countryman Johnny Hallyday in Leconte's recent Homme du Train). To do this is rather frustrating as the film progresses. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as author / director of the project. His succession of episodes left with the connecting symbolism fails to mask the film's lack of rhythm. I was especially angry that Grenoble's impressive dramatic / romantic backdrop was made virtually redundant by a cameraman who apparently shook in the cold. <br /> <br /> Krisitn Scott Thomas almost saves the performance with her female counterpart to Bruno, Beatrice. She dramatizes the dizzying contradictions meant by Bruno in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surrealistic. However, Bonitzer cannot sustain it, and the flag plot requires Beatrice to even come into another bourgeois fashion model. By doing so, Bonitzer shows show Scott Thomas the Oscar cabinet. <br /> <br /> All the characters' immersion in the bourgeoisie can be a viable and indeed tragic outcome, but in this case it is a copy of a cadence (as opposed to the cruel, painful disruption of La Separation). A serious disappointment, 4/10.
