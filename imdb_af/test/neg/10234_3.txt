Wow, this version of THE RACKETEER was hard to watch! While none of the other reviews mentioned it, the public domain version I watched was seriously flawed. The soundtrack was about 10 seconds, which meant that the dialogue and action never came close to the fit. So, you hear something happening well before you see it - a very confusing suggestion! The worst is where you hear a gunshot and only later is the man hit and dropped into his taxi in his death. <br /> <br /> While captivating the movie, it also focused on dialogue more easily - and it also showed its serious shortcomings. The dialogue was simply awful - often delivered with almost no bow or feel. As one review said, it was like watching a high school. Part of this is understandable, as sound was a new medium, but the movie's dialogue was bad even compared to other 1929 movies - really bad. And like many of these early sound films, the film was just too talky - with juicy and excessive melodramatic language and just not much action. And you will think with a title like "The Racketeer" that there would be action !! However, this is really a juicy romance - with very little action. <br /> <br /> The movie finds Carol Lombard with an alcoholic musician. She ends up stealing to try and care for him - and the villain, Robert Armstrong, comes to her aid. When Armstrong catches her deception on cards, he covers her and then helps the drunken brother to get on his feet - and of course he falls to her in the process. The problem is that when the drunk sobers want, he also wants Lombard and she has to choose between them. Wow ... a recovery drunk or a mobster ... talk about some great prospects! Overall, it's a little difficult to judge, considering the common pressure I have seen. But even if you ignore it, the movie has a lot of problems due to its poor dialogue and over-talky nature. And ... it was juicy to boot.
