L'Auberge Espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis. Where are they Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dwayne Hickman? A French man moves to Barcelona to attend classes. He moves with other students who are no more interesting than himself, and they do and say uninteresting things. This movie is incredibly slim. The only light spot was a pretty French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. She puts her hands behind her head and reveals cracked forearms, not the usual tufts of dark, stinky hair. But naked armpits do not make a good movie. L'Emmerdeur was funny, so was La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard make you wonder what goes wrong with the French comedy.
