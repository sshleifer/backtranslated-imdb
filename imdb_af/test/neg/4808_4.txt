When I first saw this movie, I said to myself, "Hey, how completely, it looks like a good movie, why not rent it?". So yes, I rented it and came back to see it. When I put it in my DVD player, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, nobody told me it was a Mexican movie and was played in Spanish, good thing it had subtitles. <br /> <br /> SECOND, it was naked, nude NEW! Since I have no background in Mexican movies, you can see my shock when I see it. * Sob! Think of Virgin Eyes, NO * <br /> <br /> THIRD, predictable to say the least, but it was actually predictable, was no excuse for me in keeping movies, because I don't seem to care if It is not predictable unless it is on top. <br /> <br /> FOURTH, how Heidi and Kike are reunited, so cheesy. <br /> <br /> FIFTH, how the movie ended. It was a BAD, BAD end. How mr. Van der Linde's sudden approval to the mayor's election was because her daughter knew how to throw the party ... BLAH, Blah. I was hoping he was not that easy to accept, but the director just could have rushed it. <br /> <br /> After all this bashing of the bad things, the good stuff is here to come. The film was actually hilarious at some point while Maribel was clumsy in the kitchen and everything, Heidi's attitude, Valentina is poetic with words. What I really like was the song Valentina made with her girlfriend. That's all, and for the other things I didn't mention, they were just like that.
