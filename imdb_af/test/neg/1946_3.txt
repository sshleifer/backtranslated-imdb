The movie had an interesting surprise. Something psychologically gripping. And the creators could have finished it tastefully without making it just one of a result of Hollywood films that promote homosexuality and / or other sexual disorders. It could have ended with a "discount", but there were other motives behind the pen. What turns me off is that the mud slipped into your face after you saw the whole movie. Like the disappointing "The Talented Mr. Ripley". Yes, I'm just another Puritan. This gay content decorated the whole movie. I would not judge a movie for art or entertainment favorably as its sole purpose to promote greater political motivation, more so for this.
