I saw this movie some time ago because some of my friends wanted to rent it and I voted. I tried so well to get the story, because some moviemag said it would be a movie for Rob Lowe, that pulp fiction was for John Travolta. Well, we can all see that he not only failed, but he has fallen on the road. It's actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. It's not even worth watching for free on television.
