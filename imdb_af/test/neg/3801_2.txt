Successes, well, there are many reasons to do so, but what Irwin Allen's mind has to do with such a boring idea is beyond all logical issues. There are so many open responses to this movie that it is ridiculous ... like The Poseidon who is a constructing ship with passengers, floats on the sea and just Michael Caine with his minibot and an evil Telly Savalas discover the boat. Well, in the beginning the French marine circles above the wreckage with their helicopter, but if a sinking cruise is a daily thing, they just fly away. What am I trying to say ??? Hmmm, Michael Caine deals with Sally Field and he can pick up everything he sees (diamonds) if there isn't a Telly Savalas looking for weapons ... my God, why am I really wasting my words here? It is ridiculous to know that both Field and Caine were involved, so you think what went through their minds when reading scripts .... definitely not diamonds.
