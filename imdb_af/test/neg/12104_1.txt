... from this movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry to say, it showed at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have captions, so I asked the festival crew if there was a problem with the print. "Not so ..." I said. "the director wants it that way". <br /> <br /> Again, sorry to say, my French is barely high school (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the initial dialogue is in French, so I'm sure I missed the nuance and many details between my understanding of some keywords. <br /> <br /> I rated it a "1", mainly because of the irony of a director who once worked with subtitles who refused to put subtitles in a movie by a American audience can be seen. Excuse me, even though most Americans would not know where Europe was on a map, even a film festival should not be accepted to know the "native language" of a given movie. Even if some of us do not know Finnish, I will still expect subtitles for the few "dolts" that are not sophisticated to have expertise in the 37 different languages ​​offered. I will not get this ego from David Lynch, not from Litvack.
