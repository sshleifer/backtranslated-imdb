this show disturbs me. It takes nickel slots at night that can be reserved for the fresh prince or George Lopez. even full house and Roseanne. they are all better than home improvement. First, the mother Jill irritated me so much. she is an overly bright baby and I really despise her. Brad is a thick road, and he's also annoying. and the youngest brother, I don't even know his name! I don't see him at all! It's probably not the actor's fault, it's probably the authors. Tim is just a stupid ass. Although Jill is definitely my least favorite, I don't like any of them. The only reason I gave this dull performance three stars is to star one star. As the middle child, he is still a troublesome little brother, but an older brother, and I like his fun character. The other star goes to Al. As the fat friend, his character is nice. Unlike Randy and Al, this show sucks.
