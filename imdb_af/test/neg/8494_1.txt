What the hell is this movie about? Well, if I didn't know that the "boy of the mask" is categorized as comedy, I will never have an idea! A comedy? A tragedy, this is the real genre for this yet-so-called prosecution. <br /> <br /> Yes, I watched "Dumb and Dumber" but I never believed anyone would ever make the title really in Hollywood. . Yes, you see "Son of the mask" and you think .. 5 minutes - silly ... 10 minutes - Dumbbell ... 15 - minute Dumbest ... And then, after 16 minutes, there is only one thing to do says: / I'm away here ... <br /> <br /> Sorry, my nominee for Comedy Crap of the Year 2005.
