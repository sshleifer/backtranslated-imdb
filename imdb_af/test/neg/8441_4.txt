Piranha starts as expected, dumb white people discover and exploit new lands. I thought it could be a cannibal movie. It starts like many others, showing nothing but shots of untouched Amazone rainforest. For everything I know, it can be Florida. At this point there are some animal mutilation or natives will appear. Instead, you get the acting talents of William Smith, who is in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard played. He plays Caribe, a well-known hunter, whom I will describe as Jack Palance Light. He is bigger in stature, but not quite the Jack Palance goodness. As for natives, you don't really get that much. Where's the piranha? Should I even ask the question? Caribe is chasing people, I think. However, he does not really strive for the end of the movie, but just stares at them. Caribe race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in an over-dramatic Smokey and Bandit kind of way. The motorcycle challenge happens for no other reason than an action series. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a tourist challenge, a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle. Never really. Do they live, do they die? Will you care? Anyone want to ride on motorcycles? Note: This film contains extreme dry appearance. My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic like Craze.
