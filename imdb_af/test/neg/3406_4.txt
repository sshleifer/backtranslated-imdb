Leave my foreword by stating that I lived my entire life in Louisville, Kentucky. I grew up about a quarter of Waverly. In winter, we will pull our sledge along Maryman Road and cross Dixie Highway to ride on Waverly Hill. Many times during the winter of 76-77 we climbed into the Tunnel to warm ourselves. The site was still managed as a "Geriatric Center". We will go all the way through the tunnel on the hill to fear what we have thought of as the "Door to the Morgue". I must be honest. The only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we shouldn't do. I should say that we went up the tunnel more than 50 times in winter. No stranger or teenage boys who are stupid have ever happened. I love the fact that it has been receiving attention for years. One night when I was young, we looked out of our foyer and it turned out that the whole hill was on fire. There was an older hospital on the hill that burnt down. It burned for hours while the whole area sat and watched outside. The thing that is lost about Waverly is that many people survived TB there. Let's look at it? The doctors then did everything they thought was right to save people. It made a lot of effort for people to work there and to know how infectious TB was. Too much is focused on those who suffered. I also traveled several times in the building in the early 70's. We are going through a church youth group in the Nursing Home. By the way, the doors were not prison like steel doors with chains and padlocks depicted in the movie. They were wood and open? Sometimes too open. It has a smell of urine and feces and you have sometimes seen an open gown related to patients with dementia. It was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's. Many may have to deal with the age of the building, or the real guy is not paying. It's Kentucky, after all. The part of the documentary that forced me most from me was the accumulation of bodies in a car. If I'm not wrong, it seems to be Holocaust footage. It was added for dramatic effect. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker. I'm skeptical when it comes to "Ghosts". I believe many people here really think the place to be ghost. Waverly for me, however, symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled.
