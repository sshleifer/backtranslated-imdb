'Carolina Moon' is an adequate TV movie about a girl with psychic powers returning to the town where <br /> <br /> she grew up and murdered her best friend of her little child. It appears that every year on the same date another girl is murdered and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, has to solve the mystery before she dies. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female head and does a pretty good job of it, and is supported by the nice Oliver Hudsom and a still light Jacqueline Bisset. The writing, adapted from a Nora Roberts novel, is bog standard and the plot <br /> <br /> is boringly predictable. However, it is reimbursed by, as I said, the nice Oliver Hudson.
