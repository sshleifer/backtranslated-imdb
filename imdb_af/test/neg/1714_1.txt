This movie (even if it's a movie is an overstatement) is ridiculously horrible. Usually a big fan of Eric Roberts in "B" list movies, this tragedy of a movie makes me question his real B list clout! And Charlie, please go back to the hope of a Diagnostic Murder Revival, rather than that ..... you can't blame the nameless eyebrow (uhhum ... beauty college members) for joining this poor movie, but you are a former TV star man! Get rid of yourself. Don't even start on Stuart Pankin. For the sake of all that good Stuart, you should have seen it wasn't necessarily a real movie! Bryan Michael Stoller illustrates only absolute genius in the fact that he enabled someone to invest in this photo (money or time). It was not really a parody or show movie, although it was on a 2nd grade level. Mostly it is poor writing and acting and camera work and editing and .... well poor everything. I watched it because I read an article in some powers about agent MJ's involvement and my interest was raised due to the lawsuit in which he was involved. I wonder now if the only reason they show him the shoulders in the movie is because, as at the trial, he stayed to wear pajama bottoms and barely lucid (wait a minute, he really is really considered) ? digress). An Agent MJ? Is it the best they can find for a name for its character? Sheez. What a surprising piece of originality! Or maybe it should be funny? Placing Marriott in the movie was a good touch in the beginning, but exaggerated and annoying was said. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the sadness to look ...... don't say I didn't warn you.
