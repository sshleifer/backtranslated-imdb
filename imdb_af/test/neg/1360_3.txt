Not much happens in this movie. There are a few turning moments, and everything is about an important moment that takes place before the movie starts. The primary mechanism used in the story is the jump-back. Flashbacks can be used very well, but they are not here. There is a zero indication when you flash back or forward, and there are only weeks separating the events. Context like a scene unfolds is the only way to know when something happens. Perhaps it was meant to add a sense of mystery to places, but it was mostly annoying. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in a 100 minute screen discussion of why things enjoy and a lame questioning of good versus evil. If you look close to Ryan Gosling's face at most of the movie, this will make you happy. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this movie. Oh, and as another review pointed out, Spacey is just here in a cameo role, playing with an unobstructed debauchery you've probably seen. <br /> <br /> *** The rest contains spoilers although a few major points are retained. <br /> <br /> First, the death of the so-called delayed boy before the film opens, and we never learn what exactly happened. The implication is that he was murdered to stop the deep sadness communicated by the boy's eyes. There are not many other unanswered questions, since the characters outside the boy and the lead are very one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> As for the main character ... Another review suggested he was crazy. I agree that he is not 'right', but I do not know that I will call it crazy. It seems that the movie is trying hard to convey that it was somehow autistic or delayed, for he was probably slow and could not understand the obvious. Either it or they were for a neglected youth with some disorder disorder and / or heavy medication. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at wearing something for the audience, but it looks exactly what has aired in the air intentionally. This movie has no answers, just questions, but it was a bad movie I didn't really care about.
