11 years after this movie was released, only 5 people reviewed it here on IMDb. There is a reason for this total lack of interest in the Moon. It is coherent but lacks all the film. See this movie for examples of terrible production in all respects. For example, the opening credits are white letters that come mechanically from a red background. The finisher knows Michael McKean and looks out of a prison window and says, "There are many mysteries out there." followed by a clip montage / music video of all the lifting moments in the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything in between is terrible. I struggled to find any value in this movie and went empty. Although it's hard to believe, even a cameo role of Burgess Meridith (always a crowd) just disappointed me. This movie is like a mockery of what's special about movies. On paper, the film is below average. Women living together in a trailer. But what was actually produced was almost immovable. The movie attempts to tackle in many directions, but never follows any. The inaccessible conflict to have their boyfriends in jail is never solved. No conflict is ever resolved. There is really no conflict. The women are trying to become hookers, but this never happens. Instead, they work as a bartender and a shelf stock. Sound exciting? It wasn't. It was stupid. And most of the movie is the two women who talk and generate conflict. The women are able to have actresses, but the writing is above the poor. Useless. It was a terrible movie, but it's even worse that they leave Burgess Meridith from his retirement home to make it. Bad from start to finish. Like the lion without teeth, this movie has no bite.
