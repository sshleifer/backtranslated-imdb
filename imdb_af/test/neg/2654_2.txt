I'm climbing into a video store, so I'm trying to see the movies we're about to spend each week. I don't have a problem with that; In fact, I feel it's a privilege. Not so with this movie. . . After an hour and a half of our hero who rocked the scene to the scene, I really wondered if they were planning to get there. I felt like I had to be paid to watch it at home in my spare time. And if I knew there was another hour to endure, maybe I was right. I didn't care about the characters, the filming was imperceptible, and Ford made kisses look like a chore. Even the score was uncomfortable and mutilated. What a waste.
