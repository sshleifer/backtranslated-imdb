This movie follows a very similar storyboard to The Warriors, only with less intensity and rather poor acting. It's nothing to write about the house. <br /> <br /> The story in general is not so bad, based on a small Aussie gang trying to get out of town when one of their members is estimated to be raping another gang's girl. They then have to fight their way through the streets while being hunted by a number of competing gangs. It can be assumed that the writers took a page from The Warriors' book and wrote it again, but as mentioned above - with no more intensity. <br /> <br /> The acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion and it is very clear that they are indeed acting ... the battle scenes, however, do well, but then the poor sound effects associated with them go, bring back. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing on Once War Warriors. <br /> <br /> Low budget, good story, poor acting, nothing to write home.
