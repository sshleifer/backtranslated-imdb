There was nothing funny about this movie. It makes fun of various sports movies and clich√©s, but none of it is remotely funny. Most of the movies that fit their parody don't even fit into the movie and are actually just them, so they can be in it. Not the main actor was well thrown, but it's really the only good thing about this movie. Also, the different comos in it were nice to watch, but I have no idea why they would waste their time in this piece of garbage. Thanks, I just spent $ 4 on it, as it is not worth spending money. Just check if you have absolutely nothing to do or just waste an hour and 30 minutes.
