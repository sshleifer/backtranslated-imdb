I saw it at the Fantasy Film Festival in Cologne and left the cinema halfway through this movie (with a lot of other people). Maybe I'm not the right one to comment on, but I think the fact of leaving "SC" is reason enough to do so. "S. C." is another movie. People who need a coherent narrative, characters or plot line, find nothing in this one. It's supposed to be an experimental movie that relies on the power of images. But these images have no power. They are so forced into their intention to simply take people out, that they have nothing else to say. The gibberish of the off-narrator is simply boring, the footage is cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if that's the only thing, why do you care? Hussein's film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead it is boring and annoying in its non-creativity. Note: Not every movie without a story is art and there is absolutely no creativity to break taboo - especially if everything is done so badly than in "S.C". I suggest that director Hussein visits a psychiatrist or a film school before making another appeal to art. Note: I never want to see a baby cut back during birth.
