My friend recommended this movie to me. I had to know not to see it because my friend is kind of a video game. But the name and the cover made it look good for some reason. I was so wrong. I mean first of all, how about their packs? And the acting! They seem to get the people from Barney. Except for Ben Kingsley. And why was he even in this movie? Did he think it was a comedy! But I have to say the special effects were pretty good. But that was the only good thing in it. I mean seriously, the movie is worse than Pearl Harbor. And it's actually an understatement. Everyone should have thought "Oh, I'm being paid, so it doesn't matter if it's the worst movie in the world." I will understand why someone would make this kind of movie if they are filming and editing the best friend, actor, production, writing and their hopeless life. Probably one of the worst sci-fi movies ever. A really rolled up film
