Carlos may not be the most original cartoon, but the first series was amusing, his remarkable comments and observations were fresh. I missed a few seasons, but after all the allegations of stealing material I caught a few episodes of the Mind of Mencia at the end of July 07. A bit of a change I see! Carlos is much more in toilet humor and sex jokes than the race observations. In one episode, he was similar to being in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I do not think so. Perhaps Comedy Central will give him another season, but episodes I've seen have grown tired and the same with more words than the Osbournes. Carlos, get up again for a few years, get fresh material and try again.
