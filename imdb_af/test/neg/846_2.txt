I give it a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be. 1. When Nicholas Cage entered his first line, he thought he was just joking. Cage as an Italian? I'm sorry, but very wrong actor acting is also BAD, not to mention his Italian accent. The story is very loose, it could have been good, but with other actors and of course with other script. The camera is fantastic, including photography, but why you cast Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Cage, he has a few movies, but of course he's not for every role. It is a pity that the cast is not better, because the story has potential.
