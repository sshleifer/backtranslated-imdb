Flip through the TV and see that The Secret Life or was on; gives George Duran a shot to be the host. I know Jim O'Connor was very energetic and no one could be as much as he could, but George was very dull. He didn't really want to be; his voting rights were monotonous, did not get involved with the guests. He seemed to have had an interview with guests for Unwrapped, and he just happened. I don't know if George will offer this show better. I doubt it because he has now presented his own show. The show apparently has more information, but only because we have seen less of the host. The formula of this show was very delicate, and I fear it has now been disrupted for good.
