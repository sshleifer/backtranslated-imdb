For years, I hesitated to watch this movie. Now I know why. Not only is it a comedy that fails to be funny even remotely, but there's nothing to download about the movie either. It was even worse than I expected. I rented this piston and still had more time than money. I've never seen a movie that made me so annoyed. It's a movie about stupid people doing stupid and horrible things. I also don't really know how anyone with common sense can actually act in this kind of movie. I've been using IMDb for some time, but I was obliged to register to help prevent poor people who do nothing, rent or, worse, buy this stinker !! Really a waste of time and money. I must say that the plot line is terrible.
