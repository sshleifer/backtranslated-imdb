I'm waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting. For someone who comes from such a talented family, it's a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda to play someone else. And this is the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of The Tempest. A string of disconnected ideas that merely represent a relationship with Bard's great game is what we serve. The institution is the Civil War and Prospero's (here's Guideon's) evil brother looks like a melodrama villain of 1890, complete with Snidely Whiplash mustache. I was waiting for him to go "Uh ha hah!" which would have been a highlight in this urgent presentation. None of the supporting role-players were memorable and Peter Fonda's lack of expression and wooden body movements made the missing story over and over. <br /> <br /> The Tempest is the Bard's statement on the rage of man's unfair treatment of man. The only credible character was the Gator man, the Caliban counterpart. The transfer to the swamp has possibilities, but the Civil War institution just didn't make it. All in all, a very disappointing production. I watched it on video and would guess if you want a Willy Shakespeare solution, save your money on this one. Rent something different, like Branagh's Much Ado about Nothing, or Kevin Kline in Midsummer's Night Dream.
