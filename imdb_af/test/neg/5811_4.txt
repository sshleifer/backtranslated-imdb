I totally agree with the previous reviewer. There is no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr, and the focus of the film is on their relationship. Hedy Lamarr is not at her best, and Spencer Tracy seems to be naive, simple and overly hopeful - both in love and in life; an idealistic role that played best in 'Boys Town'. If you can make it through the train station through the ridiculous crowd scene ... who ... it is rather slapstick and not an actor in the cast. Not the best that plays on someone's role. Miscast and mismatched. The story is empty and various and unimportant inputs are clear. Hedy Lamarr is her absolutely stunning self, which is really the best part of the movie. Spencer Tracy can't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the film doesn't come out as credible.
