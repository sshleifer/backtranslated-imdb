Another film to punish us for the crime of "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> If you like to see if people are killed by the machine gun for half an hour, it will probably fit the bill. Fans of the debut episode of "Aeon Flux", in which the title character literally kills thousands of seemingly sightless soldiers, will really go for it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not exactly a clever movie. In fact, all it is is an excuse for a lot of young people to be rude and shoot people. Sometimes a whole scene goes by, and the only thing that happens is that you guess it! someone is shot. Or to get doubts, twenty people are shot. First, they just sit there, the next moment they die there. Yahoo! <br /> <br /> Rough plot: A young American goes to Paris (an American in Paris, gets it?), Rent a prostitute (the ethereal Julie Delpy), get in touch with some old French friends, one of whom has AIDS, plan and try a bank cage. Of course, the film convention says that no bank robberies on films are violent, and it takes about three quarters of the run (it's like "Dog Day Afternoon" without the Sidney Lumet's white, patience or humanity). While at the bank, things go wrong (surprise!), And the Paris with AIDS goes wacko with his Uzi several DOGS times. No pampering here, but enough to say you're so emotional about these characters is that you probably won't mind who lives and dies at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some call it stylish. Maybe it's, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that's already been done, and 'Killing Zoe' is trapped by convention. Nowhere in the movie does the director (Roger Avary, co-winner of the "Pulp Fiction" player Oscar) do something really original, stylish, funky or outrageous. Unless you see the fact that no film that has taken place in a bank has such a high body number, there is nothing else to set this one apart from the crowd.
