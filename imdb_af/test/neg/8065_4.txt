This film is very similar to the Cannibal Holocaust. If it doesn't kill the unnecessary animal in the name of 'shock' ("Ooh looks at us, we're hardcore, we've added the real death to our movies"). These movies will be their way on my dusty classic shelf - I'm a huge fan of cannibal movies and zombies. But as it stands, it is another example of shock-rapture that, at the last backs of the pile, is desperately trying to get a poor movie generated. In summary, a crunchy movie with limited appeal. A fan of 70's must try it, but someone with modern ethics and taste should choose something that is a bit better written for their popcorn festival.
