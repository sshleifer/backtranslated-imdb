Although set up to be a showcase for some kickboxes and sword games, "Vampires: The Turning" (VTT) could have strived for it. Because it's not even a good vampire movie, VTT fails to deliver a punch that could possibly do it. <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​an 800-year-old Thai vampire was interesting. but the story about the offspring she has wrongly established (and now has to erase) actually reminds me of Gizmo and his fate in "Gremlins" and that is not a good thing if it is a vampire movie. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Chao is attractive and serves as the "good" vampire very well, but her lack of accent stirs when you realize she is an 800-year-old vampire. In addition, when she tells Connor, he is a young soul, she doesn't deliver the line with much of the weight you'd expect from an "old" soul. Attractive but not credible. <br /> <br /> Meredith Monroe was more credible in her role, but for a Dawson's Creek alum you'd think she would have more screen time. The question of whether Amanda sucks and "turns" is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie, and you never get it. You get a scourge from it, but you never get any kind of development from the characters for that plot device. It's an inexpensive way to play your audience, people. <br /> <br /> If you want something that is a good vampire movie, look for Lugosi's "Dracula" and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of flashes of hammer with much more power than this one. In the end, if you want good or sexy, this is not the place. It's just forgotten.
