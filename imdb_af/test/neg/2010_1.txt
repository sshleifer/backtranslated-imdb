My original comment on this particular title was removed by an IMDb user or staff, just because I just disregarded this movie to the point that I had to write sincerely what I felt after this poor apology for a movie seen. where is my freedom of speech? <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film is made by students, so cos and amateurish it felt. Of course, should they start from somewhere? The writing was disjointed and so was the play. With low budget and b-class actors, what can you expect? There are some CGIs in place, so poor, it looks like done with an old computer. Some may say it's kind of an "Alien" clone, but this time it is Dracula (in a cute costume) that drives the other one dry. The sets are inconclusive, inexpensive and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large spacecraft. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know what stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) thought about the movie after it was released. Coolio must be the worst rapper the actor has ever been. ! <br /> <br /> It was a total waste of my time and money, not knowing why I even bother to rent this movie. Honestly, I just hate this movie. With Uwe Boll's House of Death, Dracula 3000 shares the dubious honor of being the worst movie ever. (Well, I've seen worse than these two) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Any other movie will do better.
