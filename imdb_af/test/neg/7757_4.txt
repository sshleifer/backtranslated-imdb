From what I understand, Mr. Bava leaves this project before completion ... AND RIGHTS SO !!! If I were him, I would have made sure every copy was burned and someone in the future ever asked me about this movie ... it never happened and it never existed. End of story. <br /> <br /> Despite some good sets and good photography, is this one horrible movie ... should it be scary? (not least) is it supposed to be funny ?? (puh reading) An overall waste of time ... and I really don't like to say !!
