I actually pulled through the whole series of reviews, looking for those who gave this movie less than 5 stars. They were few and far between. What is totally astonished! Yes, I know it's a Disney movie and it's not being directed by Christopher Nolan, but good Lord. It is straight-to-the-bargain bucket nonsense. They had to do that and animate the bloody thing. <br /> <br /> What's even worse is the fact that IMDb won't allow me to complete my rant there because my review needs to be longer! <br /> <br /> The "Awesome" in-game camera shots are taken LITERALLY from Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the story flows like such a schoolboy. The multi-stranded character and plot development impoverishes an already poor setup, and the big finale is boring boring. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's really the biggest movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Good, authentic kinds of costumes, sets and sports equipment. There I said it.
