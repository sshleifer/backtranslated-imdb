Engaged stars (Heather Graham) with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). This is the story of Joline who is determined to find her ex-husband in the process of a middle-life crisis. <br /> <br /> Involved were not at all what I expected it to be in comedy that was ultimately the genre. It was beyond foolish and unrealistic. Casey Affleck delivered a reasonable performance, Graham's recent roles were lacking in glory and it's not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Graham's most recent role was fortunate that I also found misleading. and didn't call me at all. <br /> <br /> Pros Affleck <br /> <br /> Disadvantages, predictable, unrealistic, poor acting and not a comedy movie!
