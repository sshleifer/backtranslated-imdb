Unless there was a big ironic conspiracy, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this movie. I can't believe this movie has even been released. It's so bad. I admit it is not my kind of movie, but I tried to observe it anyway objectively, you know so bad it is funny, and was still offensive to his terrible terror. <br /> <br /> The play is horrible, they can't watch the rush and I guess there was once a scene, it's really that terrible. It's the worst movie I've seen in many years, in fact, I don't even call it a movie, it's a tragedy. The gay black friend, who no one actually calls 'gay', is just implied because he's so crazy? Homophobic. It's not good, in fact, it's vomiting straight. The jokes die on their pathetic asses, the music is so bad that it convinces faith. The person who set up the soundtrack has, in essence, chosen the most superior bad songs they ever heard and put it into the waste of movie supplies. Oh my good Christ, I can't believe that the 80's had caused such a great rubbish, I grew up by them and I can't find one thing about it, it should have been a dark time to be a theater . /> <br /> If you even watch this movie look at a psychiatrist, he'll hit you, you sick, sick person.
