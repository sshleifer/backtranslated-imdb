It's really just awful. Quaid surpasses more than Shatner. The part where Elvis comes in and says, "You can have it all" just kill anything that might have been good in this movie that's bad enough as it is. Drug use was completely snow covered, the only thing that had to do with his life was the bit about him who was his cousin. Quaid also looks nothing like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish it could be made again in the future with someone not trying so hard. A bigger budget won't hurt and maybe more about his real life. I was very, very disappointed in Quaid. Don't see this movie, or you'll be too.
