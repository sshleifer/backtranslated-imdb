I watched this movie, or part of it, hoping it would be nice to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that it was just stupid. For one you have the worst acting ever! The main actress Birgitte Nielsen is terrible, uninspired and hardly even attractive. And she certainly doesn't look like the female fighter who can easily kick some veteran warrior heads, but she does. And what about the feminist attitude is simply hypocrisy. Because a woman is murdered by a woman, then she joins a military school or something, so she can learn how to fight men. She then closed a thick servant and his child's king, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. The two characters are just stupid and destroy the small atmosphere the movie has managed to create. After that I could no longer follow Nielsen's painful acting, and the stupid clich√©s and the lack of real action. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this movie that actually saw it at a distance. <br /> <br /> I love the Conan movie, but it's pure crap!
