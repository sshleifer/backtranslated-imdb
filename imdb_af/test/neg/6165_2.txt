I'm sorry guys, anyone who thought this movie might be something good, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The standard that the movie wants to set is completely ruined by a very simple plot. So simple, the movie doesn't develop to the end. I asked if the plot was not about the action, but about the main characters (played by Mickey Rourke), but I found that the character was not inconsistent - whether he was a professional killer or a guilty brother. But both do not go along, because the child he is trying to lead him to dangerous situations where no professional killer would set himself. Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a good player, but he played his character a little unnaturally. I didn't believe his actions, it seemed as if the director was trying to pull someone out of his favor. And he didn't need it, because his less crazy behavior was scant enough. The only one whose play was great was Diane Lane. If it's not her, I'll give this movie 1 star. <br /> <br /> Finally, I expected to see some well-played movies and some interesting plots. And I blew it all up with my high expectations.
