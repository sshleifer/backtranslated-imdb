Apparently I swim against the flood of glowing remarks on this movie. I haven't seen it since I was 4 or 5 years old, but there is one thing I remember clearly ... <br /> <br /> The Bunyip was TERRIFYING !!! Nightmare causes frightening. With the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo running / moving away for their lives ... <br /> <br /> As a kid I also remember the animated Hobbit ... no worries. Watercraft? Didn't mind. Dot and the Kangaroo? It still haunts my dreams. And I have some friends of the same age who also think it is massively creepy. Maybe we can get a growth rate over therapy. <br /> <br /> In short: one freaky movie for his time.
