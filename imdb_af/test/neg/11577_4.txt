Jim Wynorski hits the very literal KOMODO USA again. COBRA. No guesswork here. A giant CGI komodo dragon - it looks like a dog without fur - takes on a human CGI king cobra, with a lot of tree crawlers and others in between. The tree crawlers get the charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) To take them to an out-of-town federal island. An experiment by a crazy scientist in the growth of very large vegetables has become an experiment in the growth of very large bitter, thank you to our fiery military. Now all that remains on the island is the very large insects and the mad scientist's small, beautiful daughter. The group walks into her at the old plantation laboratory, the monsters come and the chase is on. Watching enough Wynorski / Sci-Fi Channel flicks will recognize the sets and locations of many other movies. Acting is non-existent, just like the plot. At least you can enjoy watching the bad animated combo / dog bump into the intended victims just before tearing them. The cobra only swallows and swallows. No imagination.
