I found the movie at my local video store and I was surprised to see it on DVD. I heard of the explicit sex scenes, horrific violence, and the infamous debauchery. I sat watching and I started laughing! The decorations and artwork were cheap and false; the nudity was sardonic and incredibly unseen; the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! The turbulent relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his beautifully beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) cannot be taken seriously. It's not even shocking or repulsive! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were obviously held hostage while making this movie happily dying in the first thirty minutes of the film. The cinematography was a joke and I was even more amused when they used a quote from the Bible! The book of Mark no less. If you are looking for shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for camp culture value, you will be even more disappointed. I know I was. I've seen shockingly and it's two hours of your life that you will never get back.
