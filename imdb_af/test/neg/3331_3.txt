This extremely low-budget sampler centers around a group of my surveyors investigating an abandoned gold mine to see if it's worth re-opening. They are trapped in a cave and find they are gracious to a strange, clever creature that seems to be beating them once. The word that most thought to me when I watched this movie was "desperate". The screenplay and acting are terrible, the stop-motion-monster effects were unintentionally funny, and since most of the movie's underground lighting is happening, the sets seem convincing as a logistical nightmare. All that is said, for one reason or another, felt that this movie did not fail, but perhaps lacked in budget, experience and / or lack of creative inspiration. The whole thing came down, whether it was a college project or a first movie made by amateurs. I have some love for movies like this even when they miss the point altogether. I think what I say, I give it a B for effort and a D - for real results, not offensive like some low-budget monster movies I've seen, but still not worth seeing not unless you have a lot of free time. on your hands. I agree it a 4.
