Rent this direct-to-video movie, I didn't expect a wonderful piece of cinema. (Not only to say, because a movie is in the theater.) Very loosely to the story recalled in the epic poem, this film offers a unique quote of the story of monsters and super-people. General photography can be summarized as conflict, with its mixture of medieval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max). With a rock and techno soundtrack to start, one gets away and feels a bit down. The combat scenes, though incredible, are entertaining, and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting weapon combinations I have ever seen on film, although it is often inefficient. The special effects used for the sample Grendel are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert's average performance is Beowulf. It won't be as memorable as Highlander anywhere, but at least it wasn't as poor as Fort. The supporting role is fairly neutral. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good action adventure story with a complex and engaging plot, I will not suggest this movie. However, if you want a movie that is a little dusty, full of camps, and a somewhat predictable plot, you will find a copy of this.
