I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience. <br /> <br /> It is a film rich in visual but slow-motion, poor plot line and two-dimensional characterization. <br /> <br /> I knew, however, when I went in. I was willing to trust the two men that I went with (famous comics) that the visual arts would be out of the ordinary and so were they. Unfortunately, inexperienced direction has overtaken the scene to the scene with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict. However, this is a comment that can be made by many artists whose work is being transferred to the screen and to whom guidance is given. The pace of the story is lost because the camera is lovingly kept on the beautiful photos. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have gone without the reassurance that the style of the movie would be worth seeing. I tried with Neil Gaiman's work, but I always felt with the "emperor's new clothes". I live in hope, but last night was no exception. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can go ahead and analyze Gaiman's work without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all his mistakes are described eloquently. However, I can't understand how he thought he had an understanding of the minds of a fifteen-year-old girl. And what he said did not add anything to the sum total of human knowledge about growing up and accepting adult responsibility, or the changing relationship a girl could have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film and they are ceaselessly treated, stereotypically and without depth of imagination. All the beautiful pictures in the world cannot make a piece of work that is flawed in the core.
