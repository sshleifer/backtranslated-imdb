It's too stupid. <br /> <br /> Two high school graduates travel to Nantucket for the summer and find situations there that are absolutely rebellious. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore co-stars in this one. If the movie was in 1986, Ashton Kutcher was just a babe in the bush at that time? <br /> <br /> Moore's grandfather died and his home is on the verge of selling to relentless people with a father and son. meaning a new meaning to the term. <br /> <br /> Bobcat Goldthwait, with that silly voice in the movie, as well as two stupid and dull brothers, is becoming more and more intelligent. <br /> <br /> Writing is absolutely ridiculous. Highlights of the stupidity are where one person says to the other: "Have you ever noticed that when people die, they go alphabetically in the newspapers?" <br /> <br /> I rest my case.
