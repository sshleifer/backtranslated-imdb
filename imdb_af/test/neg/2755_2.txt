This movie reminds me of a song by Dead Kennedys called "Straight A's." Unlike this film, the hero of the DK's song turns suicide. You would wish this bozo had used him to kill himself instead of doing the crime he did. The whole thing was over and in the beginning, you sympathized with the hero of the movie, then he quickly surprised your sympathy. The long lines that just show the hero's face while delivering a monologue, drag the film off a bit. Avoid it if possible.
