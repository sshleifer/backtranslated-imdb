It's about one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not the worst - Manos the Hands of the Level honors. <br /> <br /> This movie has many problems. To start, this whole movie is a cheap rip-off of the Conan movies. There is the baby in a skirt dress wearing a hubcap, the silent Asian fighter, the cookie cutter bad man, the almost fearless soliders, and so on. There are many continuity errors in this movie. Some of the stupid mistakes I've ever seen are in this movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, when I watched this movie, I saw the MST3K version. Joel and the "clash" watch the movie, otherwise I would probably have been in the movie for five minutes.
