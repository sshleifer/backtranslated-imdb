This movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi movie "Doppelganger" (an astronaut of our Earth crashing on the opposite side of the Sun and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on the world) and trying to turn it is a pilot for a TV show. The whole thing, however, sank without traces, and TV is probably better for it. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is perfect enough in a TV way. Cameron Mitchell turns in his regular solid performance. So also Glenn Corbett (who is a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist, whose existence is a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order' on the opposite side of the Earth. <br /> <br /> But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent writing and the lack of any imagination in set designs and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly attached to the launch pad. <br /> <br /> I will give one example: In the original template for this pilot ("Doppler"), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm and put their ship in a truly horrible order ( it was clear that their ship would never fly again). Then the two astronauts stare helplessly out of the smoking accommodation of their vehicle in the middle of crying rains and winds, just to be beaten and attacked by faceless men shouting through loudspeakers. <br /> <br /> In "Stranded in Space", the astronauts sit in their seats when buzzers sound, start shaking things, and the camera extinguishes in a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was reasonable clear that the actors just shook themselves on their seats, the director wasn't even shaking the camera or the set even). I saw episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits" that made more effort to determine mood and institution than this medium-sized TV. <br /> <br /> And that's essentially what's wrong with 'Stranded In Space'. No budget, no time, no imagination, but the tapes and hope that the imagination and enthusiasm of the Sci-Fi builders will fill the rest. Sorry, guys, it didn't work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone here just completed their work on this one and walked away and never thought about it again, except as a listing on their C.V. And that's what you, the viewer, will do. You will remember, once you have printed, that you once watched a TV movie called "Stranded In Space", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can't recall it too much.
