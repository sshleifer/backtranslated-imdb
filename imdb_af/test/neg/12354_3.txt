Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. Contest Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio, of course another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to hear Chaplin's action at the studio head, "Next!" However, Chaplin manages to walk over Turpin. Charlie is amusing to master job opportunities as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he succeeds in getting a big break, but will a star be born? <br /> <br /> There are many jokes about the butt. The initial scene involving Slapstick of Chaplin and Turpin is a relative highlight. Note that Gloria Swanson is on the screen in the distant background, opening the movie. Agnes Ayres also appears. <br /> <br /> *** His new work (2/1/15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
