With this purchase I severely cut down. The other posters very well cover the failures of this poor poor movie. My DVD I bought actually had the 1978 Piranha poster art on the cover with the credits for the front-facing movie "Directed by Joe Dante". I was really disappointed to find the wrong movie on the disc. I'm actually a fan of very bad movies. There is always something funny or almost amusing on most of them. Now this movie! I'm actually going to spend the three dollars in gas money to give back this two dollar DVD just for the principle of the thing. Blatant false packaging here. Easily the worst movie of all time. No reasoning factors. BORN! Not even worth checking out, just to see how bad it is. Seriously.
