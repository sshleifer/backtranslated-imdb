I bought this movie face unseen at a science convention and I have what I deserve to do something so stupid. Simply put, this film is unreliable, boring and incompatible. <br /> <br /> I was so bored and frightened by the lack of plot development that I turned it off to watch a repeat of Mythbusters. I understand it was a very low budget movement, or at least it looks like a very low budget movement, but it doesn't excuse the horribly acting, horrible plot and even worse camera work. It looks like something a group of college students did between classes and got drunk. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the villain wasn't so lazy and the plot was something that actually happened in real life with regard to law it could get so bad it was funny. This movie is not funny, it's just bad.
