"I suppose you're here for damage to your main circuit." - VAL <br /> <br /> Mike Nelson made me look ... he called it in his book, "Movie Megacheese". I asked myself, "Why would Mike Nelson send me wrong?" I now know why the collision Mike Nelson never trusted. <br /> <br /> The music is by John Williams, who is probably part of his payment to the devil. In fact, I'm sure anyone who worked on this movie was probably in a league with ols Slewfoot, or now cursed, from the Executive Director to the man who ran the crew outside the studio. Don't look ... for the love of God ... don't look !!! Not even making a copy and showing someone else will curse you ... I'm now doomed, I understand. I accept it. But save yourself ...
