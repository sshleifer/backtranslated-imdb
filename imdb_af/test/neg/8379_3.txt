The two most notable things about "I will not play" are: It won an Oscar as the best two-wheeled short film of 1944; and it was proposed by leading man Crane Wilbur. The plot of this milestone map is inconspicuous. The dialogue did not spark, while the play is no better and no worse than that found in most 1940s war-torn Hollywood films (so it's terrible). There are moments when "I'm not going to play" is funny - Janis Paige's completely artificial appearance and line delivery is precious - but one laugh on the picture, not with it.
