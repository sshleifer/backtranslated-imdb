First, the first thing I remembered after I finished this movie was "Why the title of 8MM 2?" Because I saw the first one for granted and what did it have to do with the first movie's plot? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porn industry and it wasn't even necessary in the plot, because after seeing the end I won't spoil, it just didn't make sense not. <br /> <br /> A diplomat and his fiancee are in Hungary and see a woman lying in the pool naked, she is very attractive, so when they see her at a club, they decide a little have fun. and has a steaming trio. But things become extremely intense when the diplomat is posted of photos of everyone who has the affair, fearing it may become public and endanger his career. They pay the man who sent the photos, flash the diplomat and kill the man. leading to a murder case. He and his wife decided to find the girl they had the relationship with, but things just got deeper and darker, as they went further to what they had entered. <br /> <br /> What could have been a good thriller, in an inexplicable and not thorough film, was sad. As I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first one, so don't fall for it. It's just a sexual excitement that doesn't make sense, but it's just fine for those nights because it's honestly said, it's one of those movies where it's so close to porn that it can also be labeled as a soft core. <br /> <br /> 4/10
