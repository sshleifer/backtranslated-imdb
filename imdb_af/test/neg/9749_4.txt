This is probably the only movie I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Dupids" is a horrible, dull movie with absolutely no artistic merit and is a deviation from a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it good. <br /> <br /> To appreciate the "Stupids", keep in mind a little-known but very true maxim said by director Abo Kyrou: "I encourage you to learn to look at bad movies, they are so often sublime. "In order to work for any movie, the film has to set up and follow its own logic. If it is so convincing and sincere then it is actually possible for the film to work. For example, if you look at 'Freddy Got Fingered' as a traditional eradic comedy, it's complete and complete rubbish; when you see it with the mind that it is actually a neo-surrealistic comedy, it is brilliant. <br /> <br /> It also works with good movies. If "Jaws" did not accept the reality it created, the explosion of the air tank would not work. But many people think "Jaws" are overestimated for this kind of reason, and they're not wrong. But it has strengths or not? The point is that making a movie like this makes you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others will never matter how often it is explained. Jim Jarmusch once made a compelling defense of "Showgirls", and even after that, I still can't make it from his P.O.V. don't see. That doesn't mean he's wrong. If you have the right mood if you watch this movie (and NO I STOP, I'll put it on the bed now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the stupid, cheap, useless slapstick late-80s / early-90s style-farce what it is. <br /> <br /> The defenders and haters of this movie are right: it's blunt, and that's the point. The movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way. "The Jerk" accepts Navin Johnson's idiot. And because it takes it and runs with it, the movie focuses solely on using it to send the characters and to define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do it and fail to properly use that logic; bad movies are bad because they make it as they go, while movies like "The Stupids" know where it's going, what it does and why from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I can't defend the movie. From an artistic point of view, therefore, I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes very superficial, and the vibrant quality probably ruins as a cartoon. But I cannot deny that it is entertaining on its own, and so I defend it. I got it right away, and I'm sorry for those who don't. <br /> <br /> I would admit that I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's glorious cameo look (hear him say, "Leave the ride!" would have been the rent even if I hated this movie ), but was surprised to find that, apart from the TV Studio Applaus sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes were hilarious because of their cartoon context (especially the airbag cigarette explosion). They were stupid, but they were funny. And the movie does not pretend to be anything else: a STOP comedy about STUPID characters and instead of asking, enjoy it yourself. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly why it works.
