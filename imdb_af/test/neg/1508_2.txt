Granny, directed by Boris Pavlovsky (who?), See eight friends who experience a night of terror when a soul killer is dressed in an old hag rubber mask and a nightcloth interrupts their party. <br /> <br /> They say you can judge a book, but it seems that the same is not true for DVDs: I was in the mood for a VERY bad horror movie last night, and since Ouma's cover a slender photo-driven image of the titular killer swinging an ax, terrible typography (they even use the font font Sand, a definite design no!), and credits with absolutely no one I heard, I thought It would be pretty common. <br /> <br /> It was! <br /> <br /> When a movie clicks in just under an hour, it shouldn't waste too much time before it gets started; However, Granny spends the first 20 minutes or so with his unlikely group of friends taking part in the useless games and extremely banal conversations. Anyone who actually stays with the movie long enough to start killing (and I doubt most healthy people would bother) will be treated to various terrible deaths with amateurish gore, very horrific acting and a surprise that is not surprising. (If you've seen the April Fool's Day, you'll guess what the turn is before it is revealed.) Grandma is uninspired, unaware, and almost unshakable. Avoid.
