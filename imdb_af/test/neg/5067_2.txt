This music is totally out of touch with the film, which occasionally appears as wagnerian bombast and Lone Ranger hurriedly, otherwise inconsistent. The acting, outside the two principals, is non-existent. It would have been an excellent student movie. The Russian soldiers are just models trying to act. The constant interruptions with wow explosive camera angles and monochrome clips of people were quite annoying, but it was just a personal touch. The story line is no worse than others, actually not worse than most, ignoring logic and reason and reality altogether. At least no one walked three minutes before a machine gun without being hit. The three top bad guys were champions.
