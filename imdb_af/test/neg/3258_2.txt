Caddyshack II is one of the photos that asks you why? As in; "Why was it funded?": "Why was it made?" and "Why is it released in the public domain?" <br /> <br /> To say the least, it's a bad movie. It serves little purpose, but to underline the better she predicted to put an almost identical set of characters in a similar story. A new money developer is trying to buy the establishment's golf reserve. <br /> <br /> To the right of the bat, the succession bizarre 8 years after the original bit bizarre. I mean if you go on a very successful picture, like the first one, then you have a window to do this for a few years. But if you leave it for 8 years, it means that the formula is scarcely enough to do just a follow-up, or a poor imitation, as it is, so compelling you to reward fans of the original by at least refers to if it is not actual contributions. by the actors who made the first one so memorable. But there is little or any of these. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get cheap mimics. Okay, the death of Ted Knight in the interim years would have made it impossible to bring the memorable Judge Smails back, but Robert Stack's inclusion as "Chandler Young" (a fellow WASP elite related to the Smails character) is unattractive and lacking in the sort of anarchic frustration that Knight's turn woke up. Jackie Mason's 'Jack Hartounian' is a poor attempt to recreate the non-stop wisecracks delivered by the Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) character of the first. While Dangerfield's role was endlessly quoting, Mason's was completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray's legendary ridiculous land maker, Carl Spackler, and his reconciliation war with the tough local gofer are being replaced by his Ghostbuster co-star Dan Ackroyd's role as militant Capt. Tom Everett 'whose high conversations only agree with your frustration as opposed to the intended laugh. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid, brilliant as Nous Ed in the National Lampoon's Vacation series, is rather the opposite here playing Hartounian's unstable game. attorney. The appearance of unbelief shown by the actor is based on Quaid's character to be hilarious acts of inappropriate violence. You're not laughing. You just ask, "What is hell?" <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase points out, sometimes and prudently, to consider briefly what the disaster is doing around him as club pro Tye Webb The movies refer only to the original that is not the golf course itself what it is not. With its deeply tanned skin and loud Hawaiian shirts, Chase looks as if he has just returned from a long summer vacation and needs a salary. He distances himself from the events in the real picture enough that he takes little of the debt and leaves with some, albeit little, credibility still intact. <br /> <br /> Jessica Lundy as Mason's daughter "Kate" takes over from the "Danny Noonan" role of the original as a teenager struggling with class divisions. Sounds ridiculous, isn't it? At least in the first Danny (an Irish Catholic of a blue collar family) and his astonishing efforts to enter the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant dominant world from the golf club, mover and shakers have been played to some memorable pieces like This dismissed by the Lutheran Bishop resident and mocked by the offspring of the local hunting club. Lundy's embarrassment about her father's inability to fit in was indicated by his Jewish roots. In addition, it can also be with him who is a classless moron, but such complexity is scrapped, though I have ceased to care long before they were resolved. By the end of the day, Noonan was trying to continue living. Miss Hartounian's biggest problem is getting the hob nobbers at the local golf club to keep her multi-millionaire dad so she can make an appointment with the club's lost white child. Or so I got together. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the summary, it was poorly written, badly written with lame pieces and wasted a lot of talent. Indeed, kudos if you could sit there. It's really fine. However, there is the question mark why so many of the original actors did not return, instead of being replaced by artists who at least chose their equals on their paper. Maybe they just weren't asked. Or maybe I suspect they actually read the script. Stick to the original !!!
