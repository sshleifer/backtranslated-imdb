Now, let me see if I'm right, an insane serial killer is about killing estate agents ... okay ... what's wrong with that scenario, I can live with that. Next, a treasure with tax inspectors slaughtered? Traffic guards cut dead? Do we have to feel sympathy for empty head and level, money-obsessed property people? There ... no. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's joking, it's not just a very well-made movie with bad acting and coarse effects, the climate is particularly stupid. You can almost see the director screaming, an action 'to the stuntman as he falls through the glass of the window. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer rightly said, following the lead in 'The Fog', it was the aftermath of Adrienne Barbeau's career. That's why I was glad to see that she sustained it again by becoming Katwoman's voice in the Batman animated series, watching the extras on the Catwoman movie. NB: It's not really the horrible movie it made. <br /> <br /> However, it's a bad movie, think of a poor episode of 'Kojak' or 'Streets of San Francisco' and you'll get an idea of ​​what is being offered here.
