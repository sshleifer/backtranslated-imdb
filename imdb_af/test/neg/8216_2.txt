Okay, don't make a mistake - it's a beautiful horrible movie, but I actually thought it had some creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every year. At least it is unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face-burning scene, the part with the deceived bride). <br /> <br /> This baby falls in the "so badly entertaining" category, and only for that will I give it a star. The consequences are terrible, the acting is uncomfortable, and the whole thing looks as if it was shot in a day. You must also love the toy ship at the beginning! It brought years of memories to see it on late-night television many years ago. Although the Alpha DVD picture looks bad and as if it was recorded directly from an old television broadcast or something, I actually liked it!
