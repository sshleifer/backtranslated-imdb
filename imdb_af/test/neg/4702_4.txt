Five years after the American civil war, the Western people are more concerned about the age-old war between homesteaders and cattle farmers. The cattlemen flock their goods, from Texas to the route town of Abilene, Kansas. There the cowboys not only find great money, but also a big confrontation with homesteaders. Along the hall Marshal Randolph Scott (like Dan Mitchell) is trying to keep peace in the village. Mr. Scott has experience in mediating between hands and route clubs. He also juggles the city's most beautiful women: sexy salon singer Ann Dvorak (as Rita) and beautiful church lady Rhonda Fleming (as Sherry). Boozy County Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (like Bravo Trimble) offers more comic relief than shooting shots. <br /> <br /> "Abilene Town" starts with a promising symbolism and contrast: shots interrupt Scott and Mrs Fleming sings a song in the church; Then switch the camera to me. Dvorak, who sings her saloon number sexually, causing a man to fire his gun in pleasure. Then it really becomes a standard western; It is somehow duller than it should be, but not quite terrible. Young Lloyd Bridges appears as one of the homesteaders. Dvorak's leggy costume is the movie's biggest asset; In it she is a true mover. <br /> <br /> **** Abilene Town (1/11/46) Edwin L. Marin ~ Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
