OK, let me start by saying it's not a terrible movie at all. It's just not good. I remember one poster that says the acting is not camping. This is just nuanced. No. I saw animated Japanese and Asian plays. I'm sorry, you're wrong. This is camp. <br /> <br /> The characters are totally impersonal, the deaths are completely random and completely meaningless. Writing is bad. I'm fine with the suspension of unbelief, I'm right with the fact that I didn't hand over everything handed to me. But this movie has no plot. One reviewer said: "This movie is in a small town where people go nuts over vortexes and spirals." It's not a blurb, it's the whole freaking movie. Congratulations, I only saved you almost half an hour. There is nothing left. No character development, no plot development, no explanations, no resolution. And not even the "Acceptable within the kingdom of J-Horror" lack of resolution. Just nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the musical score is done by someone who obviously didn't watch the movie at the moment, because it's random enough to cause whiplash. Cognitive dissonance is one thing and well done, it can be brilliant (see Dark Water), but here it seems the score is designed to go with another movie. <br /> <br /> The best example I can give is that Japanese Evil has made Death without any of the clever pieces or good acting. It just falls flat. It's j-horror without the horror.
