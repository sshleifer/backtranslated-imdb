Nothing special to see here, the animation is outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This movie has an original story, but if it doesn't have an original plot or characters, it's not worth seeing. I'm not saying the movie was bad, it was just a typical animated story and I thought I watched this movie a thousand times. So if you're looking for something original, see another thing.
