(Really contains bad Spoilers) So, what can I say about this ... It's a LOVE and AWFUL movie !! Too much CGI and special effects .... you can tell how fake the ridiculous baby is !!. look at at least 'Dungeons and Dragons', which is another terrible hope TRASH. The mask makes Dungeons and Dragons better! Owl !!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap !!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this trash !! I would also like to say that "Superbabies: BabyGeniuses 2" was also a very silly movie. Not as stupid as "Son of the Mask". "BabyGeniuses 2 was just as fake as" Son of the Mask "and also contains way too much CGI !! <br /> <br /> Anyway Yes ... it was a BAD BATH BOTH BATH ... Please avoid it ... Don't recommend it to anyone ... please just make it ridiculous .... don't make sense and really bad plot. The baby floating on his dad was just lame!
