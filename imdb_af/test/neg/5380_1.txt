Why ???? What a disgusting joke of a supposed movie ... of the poster it looks like a cute movie. What a disappointment .. Who is the male leader? He looks like an old, delayed, retired, retired policeman. I'm a policeman and I can say it. The man can't act ... go back to a policeman .. no screen presence .. why did they show his naked ass like he was Mel Gibson, hey no ... put the filmmaker out of business. This man has no business to make a movie. I seriously doubt women or gay men find him attractive ... whoever throws the movie is a talented hack that doesn't throw a talent hacks. It's great that our white guys get all the Asian women, but why an ugly white guy, why not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt as the white boyfriend .. why to keep Asian women in ugly white guys or black guys in what I see ??? Don't get it. Must be low self-esteem. <br /> <br /> The only hot girl in the movie was the Kate Holliday .. why was there one hot white chick among the rest of the ugly Asian chicks who think they are hot and can act? ?? <br /> <br /> Only two actors in this movie host poetry at the end of the movie and one hot white chick in mass home TL Young and Kate Holliday should have been the leaders in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Asia Character was ridiculous, seemed to have tried too hard to be a kind of ghetto / sexy black girl ... keyword here is "try". <br /> <br /> Gina..you can't act and you're not physically fit enough for this kind of role. you must play character roles and be humble in your self-image. <br /> <br /> I think the actress is Gina Hirazumi ... I watched her on the IMDb and she's a great Asian actress ???? If so, I don't want to see what the bad Asian American actresses are. <br /> <br />. No wonder Hollywood doesn't have Asian American actors !!! if it is the best, they have !!! they probably won some sort of Asian movie award? give me break ... it just seemed like they made a movie for a bunch of Asian girls in them. They're not even hot. Gina ... you're not hot. stop trying .. play character roles and improve your acting. You are not a leading female type. <br /> <br /> If these movies make money, pigs can fly there. Make it so blunt, but I feel that these actors / actresses need to get better or work on their craft: for the exception of the two actors, I mentioned who had to play the leaders. I say it's in love with all the Asian head girls in the movie, please do what your parents say and go and be doctors / lawyers / and engineers ... and do some fun ... that's what you're doing right now. I'm not trying to make sense, but I hope it will be read and your people will either get better or do another business. There wasn't even a message ethically in this movie. <br /> <br /> I will not be surprised if "Soap Girls" is secretly funded by members of the Ku Klux Club a special department of the Asian American hate propaganda of the <br /> <br />. Otherwise, Asian people must hate themselves. To see this movie, make me as a viewer grateful that I am not Asian. Your people are pathetic. . They have some self-respect for your Asian people.
