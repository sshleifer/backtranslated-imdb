I understand that the budget was low on this movie, but come on this is very horrible movie-making. The writing is just awful and it was the free part. The effects are not bad, but this film plays like a conventional R-rated movie with lame scares and cut-off violence, rather than a non-stuffed unprecedented gore-fest that's been made for video. Who was this guys joking? As this would have been released in the theaters. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible. The editing, another free aspect of the film, is beyond amateur, and the plot, as I have already said, leaves little to be desired. There is nothing original about the movie. Gore fans, avoid this one. For the filmmakers: try something original next time, or stop making movies all together. You're not good at it. People hate a trashy rehash, especially one of such a low caliber. AVOID! It's not even worth making fun.
