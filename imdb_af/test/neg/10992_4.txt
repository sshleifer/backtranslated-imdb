You know, this is one of the movies of Emperor's New Clothes. It's like, so off the wall and weird that you're provided to enjoy it when you're really in movie. Well, I think it's a bologna. Movies like these that hide under the cloak of Dada or surrealism make me nut. Some people have this bad dream, perhaps argued by eating the bologna before going to bed, remember most of it (unfortunately) and then put it on film and we are all supposed to marvel at their creative genius. I also have bizarre dreams, sometimes it makes absolutely no sense, but I don't feel the need to put it on film, expose it to them and call it art. Weirdness doesn't mean it's something interesting. True Dada or surrealistic expression has some sense and intellectual thought for it. If other people don't get it, don't make it deeper, it just makes it incomprehensible. Bitterness for bizarre, for me is not good, let alone great, art. And the comparison of "Tuvalu" to "Delicates" is to compare the "Godfather I & II" to "The Godfather III" --- the same genre, NOT in the same league.
