Another entry in the Pacino-As-Mentor subgenre. You know the drill: a young hotshot with a hubris error (in this case, Matthew McConaughey, trying to start a flight career by holding onto Pacino's medals - hey, it worked for Keanu and Colin, did it not? Discover through glamorous and beautifully corrupted father figure (Pacino, natch). Young Hotshot learns from Father Figure all the ins and outs of a lucrative but humiliating career (this time it is football handicapping). Father Figure holds Young Hotshot with money and hookers and power, but we all know that this decadent situation is on a collision with decomposition and despair. . . that is, until the Young Hotshot finds its moral center by rejecting the Father figure and everything, or almost everything he stands for. (Clearly, Stone's * Wall Street * contains the ground rules for the Pacino-As-Mentor subgenre.) <br /> <br /> We are also meant to adopt these latter Pacino movies as a parallel. reality. Again, you know the drill: Living-Legend Actor demonstrates his undisputed superiority compared to an inferior young actor. The latter can carry and grab the process, but he must admit that he will not get the good lines, but much less gets a chance to chew big landscapes before the unbundling. Now it has to be said that there are actually two good movies in the Pacino-As-Mentor canon: * Smell of a woman * and * Donnie Brasco *. In the previous case, it was in any case a one-man show. In the latter case, Pacino met his play as a play counter in the person of Johnny Depp. However, these two movies were serious, not just a showcase show shelter. Pacino has made sure that her younger co-stars in the movies since * Brasco * are nowhere near as charismatic as Depp. By the way, nothing of this is very good about the Living Legend actor. Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino has remained on his laurels for the past 10 or 15 years. * Two for the money * is the worst example yet, worse than * Devil's Advocate *, who at least had the virtues of containing a naked Connie Nielsen and chronologically ahead of this movie. Well, that's what happens if you were crowned earlier - just ask Marlon Brando. Frankly, I saw one too many Al Pacino movies with the same plot - and the same overwork of the star - to love more. Did I say, "None of these speak well?" In fact, it is humiliating for everyone involved, including the paying audience. Nobody is going to accuse Matthew McConaughey of being a Shakespeare actor, but he doesn't even deserve the role of the second violin for this unbearable old performance, with the added implication that he, McConaughey, will never measure up to the Greatness . This is Al. <br /> <br /> I have not wasted space on the plot details. If you want a summary, IMDb provides a summary, but I think I've set out a fairly comprehensive summary in my first paragraph. Actually, you've seen this movie before. Many times. The special environment in * Two for the Money * is the difficult world (underworld, really) of sports sense. Pacino runs an office of "bet advisers" - these are intermediaries between you and your booklet - and even a cable TV show program that is held together with several of his best guys. One thing the movie did was the slackness of these shows. . . but one detail they were wrong was the constant use of the words "gambling" and "gambling". If you've ever seen ProLine or other similar ilk shows, you'll never hear Jim Feist and his cohorts say the word "gamble". They ask you to call their 1-900 number to get their pick up. . . But if you say, Mars, you have no idea what to do with that pick. "Gamble" is the F-word on sports-enriching TV shows. This is strictly forbidden. <br /> <br /> Gambling is against the law, you know. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10.
