Now, this movie is the worst I've ever seen !! It's just a disaster. I think it's really a sick movie, I just wasted my time watching this cheap shit. I can't believe anyone will produce such a disaster. Such a waste of money and time. Nothing to learn from this movie, it's just a hollow sick evil movie. I don't think they can make it worse, this movie just deserves the title as the king of the lowest crap. The play is a disaster, the meaning ... Oh, there is no meaning, just a sick pain and sadness introduced by the suffering child at the end of the movie and the murder of the woman who is another dumb blow was for this movie. Do yourself a favor, if you actually have self-respect, keep away from this horror !!!
