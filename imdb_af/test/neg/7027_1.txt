"Mame" is a disgrace to many things - to Lucille Ball, to a story that has been told much more often, and to the musical genre altogether. Me. Ball doesn't understand her character at all and she looks heavily saturated. Bea Arthur is good, but that's not enough. The production is very clumsy and cheap, the songs are sub-par, and almost every joke misses. Lucy couldn't dance well either, so the music had to be delayed to a funeral pace. Avoid at all costs, but see the delicious "Auntie Mame."
