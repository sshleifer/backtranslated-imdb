Tim Curry was the reason why I wanted to see this film, and although his appearance is always entertaining, he was basically wasted. The rest of the film doesn't fall too well, in this repetition of an early zombie film containing many graphic effects that are completely unnecessary. To quote a popular axiom is sometimes less.
