OK, about 11 years ago, the wonderful, funny movie, The Mask, came out and everyone loved it and now, 11 years later, the mask is brought back to this wonderful movie right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! this movie was the stupid movie i've ever seen! I mean when I rented it, I thought I'd laugh so hard that I would pull off my pants almost from the first. but after I saw this sequal, I left barley even a rogue. I don't mean the director or the movie of this movie, but that wastes time and money. so the plot of the whole story was about this little baby who has part of the mask in it and this evil person is after him for something, because that is all i really got, i would have least added something to it so it will be higher than a 2 out of 10 star.
