Wes Craven presents a 1995 film, led by Joe Clayton and lead roles Lance Henriksen. A group of scientists rescue a dying man who finds them by their desert stranded government outpost by spraying him with their experimental virus, of course, one of their colleagues going overboard and the virus changing the man into a nearby unstoppable monster trapped with them inside. Lance Henriksen plays the morally offensive researcher who leaves the project before it all, but returns after receiving a call to rescue aid to save the man (unstoppable death machine mutation). <br /> <br /> Deciding to combine two journeys He brings his family with him (they go on vacation) and gives them access to the top secret government facility, allowing them right in the middle of the chaos. If you can't say, this one rests on the viewer to work with it a little and put a little bit small (see: big and blatant) details. <br /> <br /> Overall overall: Watch-able with mild pieces of enjoyment. Note: The outpost is commonly known as 'Mind Ripper'
