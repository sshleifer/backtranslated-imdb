I rarely give less than 5 degrees, but in this case I should weigh. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, sharp dialogue, refreshing plots. Movies based on his books go back to Hombre (Paul Newman), Mr Majestyk (Bronson) and Out of Sight (Clooney / Lopez). Even when done like that, the movies have at least some story essence that comes through. This one, .... it's simply not a worthy addition to the catalog. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad (I don't know why, because it is very capable people here) and the story is dealt with with stupidity. The characters are rearranged, the chemistry is missing, the actors and actresses are discarded. Because Elmore Leonard is a great storyteller, I hope anyone who doesn't know his job would be accused of reading his books because they saw this disappointing version of one of his stories. <br /> <br /> The story is a successor to Get Shorty. If you haven't seen that movie, don't look. If you've seen Get Shorty, don't go any further. <br /> <br /> I saw that you were back a few years, and tonight is the vid again. The first time shouldn't have made such a negative impression, because I forgot how foolish this successor was. <br /> <br /> Luckily, I don't think any less of those in this movie because they did it. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and very nice. Travolta I almost always like, but he's so much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the preceding Get Shorty. He was clearly unable to enjoy what was going on here. <br /> <br /> And I hear Freaky Deaky, another Elmore Leonard book, released in pre-production for 2008. Hopefully they can deduce it. <br /> <br /> Read the books. They are almost all good.
