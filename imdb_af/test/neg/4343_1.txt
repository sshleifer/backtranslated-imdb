"This Life" is really as bad as it gets. She throws out mercenary, capricious, relentless, dual, level characters as a reflection of his post-1980s setting and I have to admit it is an accurate creation. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter to me to sympathize with or care, and I consider it just another step to the television premium phone in scams; surprisingly bad, cheap, reality and 'celebrity' saturated television; and other cut attitudes that destroyed this medium and indeed much of British society. Sounds exaggerated? I don't think it is. In this regard, programs such as "This Life" are indeed as influential as they are often called.
