Oh my God, it's so idiotic. Completely useless, offensive and repulsive. Why do the writers have such a problem getting Zoey and Chase really, we all want them too! In normal shows, there is actually more than one plot conflict in the show, wow, which is a concept. Also, you can't even tell the Zoey 101 episodes apart, because the same thing happens every time. Quinn exploits Dustin for a little weird thing, Nicole is giggly and stupid, Zoey is just a little there, Chase slobbers after her all the time, but she doesn't look incredible and Logan is a while. repeat. Quinn exploits Dustin for a little weird thing, Nicole is giggly and stupid, Zoey is just a little there, Chase slobbers after her all the time, but she doesn't look incredible and Logan is a while. repeat. It's like a shampoo bottle. and the end of the movie, again. nothing useless does not happen. It was as if they had designed it specifically so that the movie could fit between any two episodes of the show and the show would go completely unchanged to the movie.
