The reviewer in Variety said it was "overrun and overcrowded" and I agree with it. It has a couple of events that seem and seem unlikely, such as when Cal (Crudup again as the "lost, rude and kind of dull" man) and Julianne Moore find a map of the USA in an incredible place. The story is one of those 1970's men must find meaning in his life, and I introduced myself to Jack Nicholson in his first role the role of Cal. The whole "hitting the way to find meaning in life" theme is still interesting. Does it really lead everyone back to the family? I wasn't so sure. The play is okay, I especially liked Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately only have supporting roles. I'll give it a 'five'.
