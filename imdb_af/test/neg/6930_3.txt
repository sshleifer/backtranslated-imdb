This film is about the frustrations of making movies. It frustrated me with his endless boredom. The area is an attractive Spanish seafood resort with its usual large saucepan. The writing was very poorly written or maybe there was no writing. Just the ad lib. <br /> <br /> A far superior film about the frustrations of movie production is Francois Truffaut's "Day For Night" made in 1973. It shows all the delays and how the cast is intriguing. It does not carry the viewer and you get sympathy for the director who has to complete the movie somehow.
