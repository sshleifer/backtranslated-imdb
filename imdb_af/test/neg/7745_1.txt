In 1990 I saw Kathy Ireland personally - I was at UNT in Denton during the filming of "Required Roughness." Strangely, the voice she uses in this movie is not too far from her real voice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot goes as follows: Kathy gets a letter telling her that her father is in a bottomless pit in Africa. She goes and investigates the place of her father's death, just to be sucked into an underground world, which is a partial dystopian nightmare, part of an uninspiring fantasy and inhabited by rejection of the Plasma. This movie really gets the talent of Linda Kerridge, who, in my opinion, could have been someone if she got the one big role that was right for her. Anyway, the main hero of the story, Gus, is a very lame Mark-Jacko-Jackson rip-off. The original is annoying enough to start with, but this man is really torture to watch. Eventually the nebbish Wanda comes out of her shell and ends with a bikini top and a sarong at the end. If you want Kathy Ireland in a movie, it would be better to be a bikini. Anyway, the movie was just bad and judged by MST3K. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one if possible.
