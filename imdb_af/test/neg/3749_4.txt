According to most people, I know what this movie has seen, and after the reviews I've read, it was supposed to be a very entertaining thriller to be seen oh so by more people. I didn't expect this movie to blow me away, but I certainly didn't expect to find this movie mediocre, that's what it is. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that French movies are both. French and studied as a student, so I am aware of the clich√©s and corny plot twists that can be unmarked by English / American audiences. There are a few big French films that had to be widespread international release, but none of them. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the plot is both sold out, over complicated and too clever to entertain so you really run every 2 hours and 5 minutes every minute and by the time everything is revealed. are you out of caring. The main character himself lacks any real charisma or even acting talent to keep your attention mainly on him and his journey when it is close to the crap so by the time you even considered swallowing the main plots, it is beginning to start you wasting your time! Actually, I remember turning off before the credits actually started to roll after the movie's climb. That was the point where I was sure I almost wasted my time. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't at all the worst I've seen, but it seems totally overstated. For example, I read somewhere that it beats all the Bourne Identity movies in terms of tension or even that it has 'wall-to-wall tension'. I can say that some people make this dull, dim movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10 is a very considerate rating for this movie I feel, and since I have seen some complete and complete stinkers, I will save them the 1s, 2s and 3s for them.
