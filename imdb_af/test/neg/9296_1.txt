It is probably one of the worst movies I have had in my entire life watching. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are terrible people. I watched this movie with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. Ben Kingsley's character is just stupid, but not funny at all. It's a wonder why an actor of his talent would be involved in such tries. Tee Leoni has a fine Hillary Clinton impression throughout to portray the very cold and uninteresting female advantage that has all the impressive features of a broom. Throw a useless and unexplained subplot and a terrible cringe worthy of mounting, and you end up wasting 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this movie at all costs!
