There is somewhere here a make-up of a decent and routine SF story. This is impaired by several factors. First, the actor is just terrible. Even the skilled actors are terrible. The dialogue is wood and stylized. The plot is predictably flowing. It looks less like a finished movie than the actors go through. Extremely disappointing.
