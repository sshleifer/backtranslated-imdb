Korine has now established itself as a talented and impressive sculptor. The promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the most impressive compositions of the movie (although there is one I still see in promo material: that of a bluebell nun picking a dog, with a stick surrounded by a green forest with huge rain. The opening images of this movie, Michael Jackson Lookalike (Diego Luna), driving a small motorcycle around a track, are particularly compelling and beautiful: Roy Orbison's Mister Lonely plays on the soundtrack and the images unfold in slow motion. There is also a funny and wonderful sequence in which the same character has a dance, without music (though a radio sits beside him like a silent dog), in the middle of a Paris street; Corine splits into sound effects and jumping cuts that both evoke a sense of futility and conception in the character's dance routine. <br /> <br /> The first example of the segment dealing with nuns is also strangely offensive; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest left to fly with a few nuns and drop food into impoverished areas in the area. In a scene that is both light-hearted and influenced, Herzog has to deal with a stubborn enthusiastic local community who wants to make the plane with them to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange developed, Herzog made a confession from the man: he had sinned and his regular infidelity was the cause of his wife leaving him in the first place. This scene, short and sweet, gets particular weight after learning its improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was at the scene when Korine and co. was filming - and his adulterous ways gave him a lasting, overwhelming debt in real life. <br /> <br /> From now on, the movie was hit and miss; a sequence of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a careless, confused narrative. While Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight through coherent structural frameworks, Mr Lonely feels like a victim of room justice. A few plays have been cut from the movie, which otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters due to costume continuity errors. This is undoubtedly due to the absence of gunfire and Korine's tendency to improvisation. An exceptional scene in particular - in which 'Charlie Chaplin' (Denis Lavant) and 'Madonna' (Melita Morgan) have sex - would have added more emotional conflict on a scene later in the movie (I won't spoil it, but It is there to expose any sense of warmth or celebration, and as it is, it is only half-grown. <br /> <br /> The two rays of the narrative, which are not literally linked, are best approached as two completely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one complements the other and vice versa. (This is something that has to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) But there are not enough of the Herzog scenes to earn their place in the film, and therefore any connection between these two allegorically-connected wires inevitably tense - and the inclusion is boring in retrospect. <br /> <br /> It is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey-Boy who, most of the time, at least in the lookalike segments, suffers from too many characters for the movie's running length, an error that would have been even worse has played all major stakes (as originally planned). <br /> <br /> With many of the images' self-managed beauty and moments of real, real-life soundtrack, it feels like it will be much more suitable for an art installation or photo exhibition. As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of imitation, it would not lose its power - indeed, it might be more impressive for me. The loneliness associated with iconic education (such as the icons themselves as well as those they want to pursue) is well captured in images such as those in which 'Marilyn Monroe' (a beautiful Samantha Morton) seduces the camera with a seven-year itch sit in the middle of a forest, or when "Sammy Davis, Jr. (Jason Pennycooke) establishes, post-dance rehearsal, with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible, tranquil lake. <br /> <br /> As it is, moments like this, and all those haphazardly-chosen titles Michael Jackson crawling across the scene, are married to each other in a movie story that is far less influential than what it should be. <br /> <br /> (For those who see it, I lost all faith during the egg song scene, leave it up. You'll know what scene I mean, because it hurts like a sore thumb, like a kind of gimmicky attempt to the new film language for which Korine was previously held.)
