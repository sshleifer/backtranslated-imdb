A new guard in the armored vehicle gig is being recruited by his co-workers to steal 42 million from the truck. No bad guys, so nobody will be hurt, right? Of course things are going wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and fixes things by saving the life of a dying man. <br /> <br /> I admit I didn't really have interest in it. movie, but I also had no interest in Fantastic Mr. Fox, and that movie made me top ten of the year. Armor is even more of a disappointment, then I thought it would be. As a lift movie, it fails to deliver the goods, it is dull and full of plots and leaps into logic that will be hurt. <br /> <br /> In spite of this, the film somehow has a very good movie, but the movie doesn't even use it to its advantage. Everybody looks like garbage in wooden characters that make stupid choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting advantage that is never charismatic and never makes the audience a shit. Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays Mr. Nice Guy at first, if things don't go his way, he quickly becomes the villain. The rest of the impressive film includes Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Prison Break's Amaury Nolasco and Heros Milo Ventimiglia. None of them do much, and when they actually do something, it is without much reasoning behind it. <br /> <br /> The movie is relatively short, but even with the running time under 90 minutes, it feels pulled out. How long can you make a movie about a guy caught somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more limited. The jumps of logic about the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have is every hour or so sure? The whole plan of my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Suggest that you hit the trucks and burn. They will then leave with the money. Of course something goes wrong or is there no movie right? Through a series of unfortunate events, the hero caught an injured officer in the truck. The rest of the movie is Dillion and his crew knocks on the doors to come in. How much exciting. <br /> <br /> The script asks our hero to have financial problems, he can lose his home, which in Draai lets him lose his brother. You see, both have died of their parents, and only the two are looking for each other. So now he has a reason to join the heist. Initially he did not want to, but his money problems are just the right pressure to put him in the thick of things. How convenient. <br /> <br /> Panther's whole turn on the heist genre is that it comes from an armored truck, from the guys driving it. After that basic premise, the film falls flat on his face. I found myself ending earlier and earlier every time someone spoke. Talk about the end, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
