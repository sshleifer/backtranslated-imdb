I think the best way for me to review this title is to divide it into its pros and cons. <br /> <br /> PROS: ~ They are in wolves, rather than plastic / cartoon monsters. ~ The pursuit of wolves through the forest ~ "Cash Machine" played by Hard-Fi <br /> <br /> Behind: ~ Some parts of the script make your neck (for example, the terrible part where the woman escapes 'games' from the "Fortunate Five" boys, and there is about half an hour of "Dear cousin" and a round robin of "Yes, see, we know Gabriel's law"). The diving transformation is ridiculous. The obvious and ridiculous ending ~ Aiden is told thousands of times to leave, and then "if you care for me, you would have left me" ~ the obvious characters ~ the unnecessary parcours ~ the completely unnecessary cut off the arm by Aiden ~ cringey speeches by Gabriel <br /> <br /> You see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I worshiped werewolf movies, and I tried to look it a few times to see if I wanted it better, but it just made it worse. I think I'll just read the book and see how I go. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this unless you have a 12-year-old brother or sister in eager things. Anyone over the age may suffer and want their hour and a half back.
