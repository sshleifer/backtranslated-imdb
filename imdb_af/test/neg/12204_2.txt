Did anyone get the plot somewhere in the movie? Perhaps the thing is lacking in this pretentious exercise of cinema theater. It is quite surprising that Gordon says that a movie without a plot is nothing ... It is possible that characters have more to say their own Wim Wenders. Was this phrase in the original plot or the actor decided to send a tip to the director?
