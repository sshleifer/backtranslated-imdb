Gamera has been a Godzilla fan for many years, and was a cheap beating to capitalize on the success of Toho's # 1 Kaiju star. ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS was an almost painful experience for me at the time. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I attended the annual Godzilla Festival, known as G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of GAMERA's stars against VIRAS, appeared. Of course they recorded this movie. It was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. Of course you have to be in the right mind to see it. For example, in a scene, the sea-going shots detained aboard the alien spacecraft escaped by distracting the non-bright aliens. When they realized that they were bumped, one of them said, "It's funny. I think those children lied to us." Not even out of space plans can boast that kind of dialogue. <br /> <br /> It may not be GODZILLA or GAMERA 3, but this one is a decent time-saver if you see it in the right mood. <br /> <br /> But if you want top quality kaiju entertainment, check out the recently released GAMERA 3. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 1/2 out of *****
