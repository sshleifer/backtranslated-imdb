This movie has no heart and no soul; It is an attempt to clear a cult film from the beliefs of others, better, directors, mainly David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he overloads some kind of rotten visual style and fills the street with rubbish and rubbish, he makes a statement. But it's not a statement about anything - except the director's shrill cry of "HE LOOK AT ME! I AM AN ARTIST, ALSO." But he does not have the imagination of an artist, just a good reminder of things that worked - like some of the actors trapped - for other directors. All of this would be almost acceptable if this movie wasn't a tedious, boring task to go through.
