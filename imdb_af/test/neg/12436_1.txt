Look, don't get me wrong, I love independent movies, but come on! I could barely sit through it without killing myself. The director had absolutely no talent and he changed something that could be good for a F *** ing Nightmare. I myself am a punk enthusiast and even suck the music. the acting was crazy. <br /> <br /> I'm usually a thriving heart for these low budget movies, but this one didn't even try. Please do not waste your precious time and money. I'm sorry to be so hard, but come on! it has towed and and again and again. Remember when the kids came to the party with the strange cupcakes and watermelon martinis? how did they just interfere? It frustrated me how they could just go where they wanted to and got into trouble and had sex and a meaningful conversation with whom they wanted to. I know I blathering but my mind is just buzzing with everything I hated about this movie.
