I was forced to write a review after seeing the only review that gave this movie a suspiciously high 9/10 rating. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself, or one of his friends, wrote that "review"? Naughty, naughty. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV, and expect it to be really awful. The special effects used were honest, very good for a low budget movie, and some of the acting wasn't too bad, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done to try, like me most expect pals from the film maker. <br /> <br /> I think the movie maker really did well by trying to beat his weight. I found the movie funny because it was super cool if it wasn't. <br /> <br /> If you don't take this movie too seriously and watch it while drinking with some friends Maybe you have a good time, but probably not as intended. This movie is not a 9/10, but worth looking for a layer in mind that it was made on a very low budget and in fairness to those involved in the production.
