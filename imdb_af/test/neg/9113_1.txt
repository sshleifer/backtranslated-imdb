I love most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean, so I thought I'd like this movie. Also, I'm Canadian and it's a mostly Canadian movie, so I was prepared to cut it down a bit. Nothing could have prepared me for the "Airborne" garbage. Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a chance. The acting throughout the movie was so bad I was having trouble sleeping tonight. I just have two wishes in my life. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you never have to go through this movie. 2. I wish I could get the 6 hours back. Oh wait, the movie is less than 2 hours - it looked just like 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Don't watch it. Seriously.
