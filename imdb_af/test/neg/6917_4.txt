Dr. Markoff is a crazy scientist who is experimenting, trying to find a drug for a viral cause of acromegaly. When he attends a piano concert, he is hit by the pianist's beautiful daughter and goes her woo. But when she doesn't want anything with him, he infects her father with the acromegaly virus in an attempt to exchange money and his daughter in exchange for a healing. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise for this B-grade low budget thriller. I must say I was underneath this movie. Not that it was terrible - it wasn't, but nothing was remarkable either. It was enough to explore, but it is not one that will remain in my memory. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is sometimes feverish and the play is only mediocre. The story is pretty predictable and doesn't really give us anything new. Of course, I can't complain too much about a movie that a man packs in a gorilla, which serves almost no real purpose and a doctor with a Svengali-like stare that does not enchant his victims. <br /> <br /> It may be worthwhile to be a watch if you like this kind of movie, but don't go into it with too many expectations.
