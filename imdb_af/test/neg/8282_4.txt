First, I want to direct a large and middle finger to the Troma DVD distribution staff, which was actually stupid to reveal the identity of the movie killer on the back of the cover! The synopsis just randomly mentions who the person responsible for the massacre on the day of graduation is for Christ's sake! I don't care how horrible or how predictable an 80's can be; just to mention who ruined the whole point! So, a word of advice if you also buy the Troma double feature containing "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell"? repeat, DO NOT? turn the box around and read the back! Watching the movie is already a painful experience, but reading the back would really spoil everything. <br /> <br /> Now, as for the real-life movie ?? O boy! Personally, I'm a fan of Herb Freed's movie 'work'. Well, I really don't really know if I should admire him or be sorry! All Herb's movies are pretty bad and amateurish, but at the same time you can say his direction is enthusiastic and full of good intentions! Unlike "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil," he follows a contemporary popular genre trend and has tried to pay cash on the typical high school treasure movies. Just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims in "Graduation Day" are promising athletes and members of the same trainer George Michaels (wonderful name! I think Herb Freed is a fan of "Wham!"). During the opening credits, we see a young girl die dramatically on the field, moments after winning a 30-second race. The debate about whether her coach and co-team members do not push too much of her physical boundaries is increasing, but a specific individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill anyone he / she sees responsible for Laura's death. make. What a dementia little movie! The writing should be one of the most incoherent I have ever seen, with very red hair and subplots that go absolutely nowhere and death order that is almost too cheesy for words! There is a block that is wrapped by a spear attached to a spear, others are seized with an absurdly large sword, and the most unholy bastard of them is all dead on a disguised bed of nails! Herb focuses on the ingenuity and rapid pacing of the murders so much that he completely forgets the sub-graphs he had introduced earlier in the film! For example, Laura's sister returned home from her military training and began investigating the circumstances of her death. Halfway through the movie, however, her character no longer appears in the movie. Also, the girl's stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard, but these interesting details are immediately ignored. Instead of carefully mounted tension and misleading red herring, we serve our discarded dance and roller skate sequence and ?? of course ?? many images of unattractive 80s chicks that strip off their tops. Despite being really bad, "Graduation Day" can fall into a respected role! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "City of the Living Dead") stars as demanding coach, Carmen Argenziano ("When a Stranger Calls", "The Accused") appear briefly as a police detective examining the growing number of missing teenagers . and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dracula's Dog") shares a lot of amusement as the school's highlighted principal. The teen beauty on duty includes Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies, is enough reason to count Graduation Day among the most significant slashers of the early 80's. It's a silly movie, but entertainment and chicks are guaranteed!
