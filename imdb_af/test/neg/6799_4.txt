Bizarre. This movie is based on a well-known photographer, but everything in this movie is fiction. I think it's trying to explain why Diane Arbus had a fascination with peculiarities and focused on her primary photography. In the movie wolfman moves in the apartment above her. She seems to be obsessive with him and falls to him. She places her children and men second to the wolfman and even tries to take him into her family gatherings. Some of the wolfman's freak show side skicks come over to visit and she mixes with them. The whole thing is very bizarre. <br /> <br /> FINAL THICKNESS: Nothing memorable. There is just something weird about a woman who gets her jollies to shave the wolfman. I think you can find better movies there.
