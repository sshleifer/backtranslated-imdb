I saw this movie in Blockbuster and thought it might be a good Sunday night movie if there was nothing else to do. So I bought it, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Although it was cheap, my money would have worked better on a nail to drive through my foot. <br /> <br /> The movie started out nicely. Kinda Dark and mysterious. I was always impressed with vampire and samurai movies as a kid. I thought the combo would be really cool. The first battlefield was pretty cool. I was excited about the rest of the movie. Then the movie took a serious nose dip. <br /> <br /> I understand it was a big hit in the east. I think of the twins. But I don't see it. This movie, apart from the first 10 minutes, was absolutely horrible. So many movies in this genre have the potential to be big and to blow it terribly. It's just another casualty. <br /> <br /> Jacki Chan's role in this movie doesn't make sense at all. Whyyyyyyyy? Full folly. He probably made a few bucks for it. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing in this movie is the swords they use. Nice idea. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
