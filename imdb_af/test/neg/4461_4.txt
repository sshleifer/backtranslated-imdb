The idea of ​​bringing Dracula to modern times is not bad. After all, it can revive the series a little by injecting a new story element into a series that has exhausted Hammer in its long series of excellent movies. However, as the current day was in the early seventies, the results were pretty stupid and looked more like LOVE AT FIRST BITE (a deliberate comedy). See Christopher Lee in a movie filled with 70's hip lingo and electric guitar chords and laugh rock music just seems foolish. To make matters worse, the play is much more upside-down - with an intense and stupid Johnny Alucard stuff. I also thought it was really funny that it took Van Helsing's grandson to see that Alucard "Dracula" was spelled backwards - no one else invented it himself! Wow, what's smart !! <br /> <br /> So because so much of the movie was bad, why did it still earn an almost respectable score of 4? Well, when the story came after the expected confrontation between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drac (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. In addition, and I know it, it will sound very sexist, but if I had to watch a bad movie, Stephanie Beacham's character did indeed wear some nice outfits that revealed her generous "talents." So at least it was a nice movie to watch. By the way, the movie ends with the phrase "he can rest in the end time", although it was not the last Hammer Dracula movie. with Lee. He just returned for a short while for "The Satanic Rites of Dracula" and in many ways it was even worse than that of a monster movie.
