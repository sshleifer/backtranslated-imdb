I watched this video because I love Malta and this movie is filmed in its entirety. Very disappointing as it fails to catch any of the flavors or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry and arid elements. The film was boring, boring, completely incoherent from start to finish, pretentious and without any imaginable plot. You had to be a psychologist to follow the plot line or lack it. It has its moments, certainly; but so does the dentist. <br /> <br /> In short, I'd rather endure a colonoscopy before seeing this terrible mess again. It was so bad, I couldn't really fall asleep. There are quite a few Eurotrash movies out there that are of course made without adult supervision. This is one of them. On the bright side, who is Nadia Cassini? Never before have I seen a more beautiful set of legs. She is the one saving grace of this movie. <br /> <br /> The story was also the cruel farmer hunt depicted in the closing credits. A farmer released on someone's property (Malta has very few indigenous mammals, all small - rats, bats, etc.) and then attacked by dogs before it was shot. Oh, well, visit Malta despite this movie - it's a beautiful, colorful island; rich in history and fun.
