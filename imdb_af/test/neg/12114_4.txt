Sure, this movie has been delayed. But you expected the moment you looked at the lid. This is a B-movie, and this movie was released on the T&A factor. Truly, it was more beautiful than expected. Though it wasn't really a comic genius, like 'The Party Animal' or 'Orgazmo', as far as B movies, it's worth the watch if you're in that sort of thing anyway. <br /> <br /> Christians and morally-oriented parenting groups, it's soft core adult entertainment. If you don't want your kids to see sexual content and nudity, keep your kids away from this movie.
