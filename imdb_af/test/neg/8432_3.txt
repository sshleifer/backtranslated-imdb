An art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made of gingko trees and puts it in his apartment, but it has a terrible history and is hunted by an ancient spirit that maintains its human form by ripping people's hearts. . <Br /> <br /> This beautifully crafted horror ?? Well, it's actually more fantasy / romance than anything else, cold fever is raised and some beautiful visuals, but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formal writing had no kind of life. The problem was that I spent most of my time keeping my finger off the quick button. It would certainly have relieved the film's slow pacing, but then I wouldn't know too much about what was going on, which was pretty hard to figure out or to keep an interest in. The performances have been too melodramatic or just dull, and this is probably because these characters cause unconvincing, distant and coma. The real story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and filthy, with too much focus on a thin romance, ridiculous when it shouldn't be and overall it is built in a normal way that lacks the oomph or conviction to carry the movie. What compensates for the story's shortcomings are real-life imagery, but the use of some images has made me somewhat amazed at what they actually mean for the movie. What gets your eye is the faded color scheme, but sometimes the actual screen will really look granular or snowy. Although it shows the raw intensity of the production valves, but also some beautifully polished effects, which go well with the soothing but sometimes edgy score. The camera work was quite diverse (although it didn't add too much to the feature), but during some of the more exciting scenes, there were too many close-ups or dark lighting that made it difficult to understand what you were doing. see. Also on show are some nice moments of blood and gore, but not openly large or distinguishable from most other films. <br /> <br /> Poorly strange film, with light images resembling something from a painting, but still not particularly seductive. Watch out, it can put you in a deep trance!
