After receiving a DVD of this with a Sunday newspaper, I was hoping it would not be the usual duff movies being given away because no one would ever buy them. I was wrong. Sheens Acting is equivalent to that of a 10-year-old school pantomime production and the same goes for the majority of the cast. Neill is satisfactory, but plays a Russian and is not helped by his hybrid Northern Irish / New Zealand accent, nor the rest of the KGB characters. They all sound like they're in a Cambridge Footlights reunion. In fact, the only people with real accent are extras that provide a strange word here and there, and help us at least know where the hell is going on in what is otherwise a complete moss. The "spying" factor is mostly unimpressive and consists mainly of Sheen who embraces several ridiculous disguises while trying to blend in the background. It is not only sowing quickly but laughable. The plot has potential, but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements. It could have been so much better.
