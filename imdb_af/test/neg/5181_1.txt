This movie is over Horrible, AVOID ALL COSTS !! I want my hour and 20 minutes back !!! <br /> <br /> Not funny at all, you can watch this movie without laughing or smiling once. Heavy rinsing from the speakers like a waterfall, each becoming more annoying than the last, and not contributing to the comedy OR plot (general comedy - not this movie in general!). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a $ 5 lame-water-down-typed "Out Cold" ish movie - but terribly terrible. The film focuses on two groups of a city of Poories and Richies (how clear is that silly?), Where the two contradictions fought each other with snowboarding. (story is much like a 4 year old's bedtime story without all the swords and stupid jokes) <br /> <br /> MOVIE - 1/10 - because you can't give lower scores
