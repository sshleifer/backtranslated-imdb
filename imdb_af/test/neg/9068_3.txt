Don't worry - no spoils here, just say there is a very predictable plot. A couple decides to stay in his dad's love so they can write a book / article / newsletter on his fling with a famous, tragic Hollywood star. This whole production chased as a high school group and did an episode of "Murder She Wrote". The only acting I was sold to was the old fogies they had fed into the story. Apparently, the directors thought the movie had become too long, and then they stopped showing their camera a kind of horrible image of the stars and brought in plot enhancers to wrap this thing up. Don't waste your time - even the tried and true horror / intriguing classics fail in this movie.
