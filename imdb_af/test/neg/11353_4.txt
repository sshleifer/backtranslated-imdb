"Mararía" really disappointed me. I can't see it as a bad movie, but the development was just too rushing and not credible because it could call any emotion. Dr. Fermín shows some unparalleled bizarre behavior from a passion that one cannot understand where he was born from. I mean, how many times did he ever have a conversation with Mararía? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never seems to be a real character, rather than a movie stereo that just had to be in the movie (... or else is another title needed?). Of the best acting came from a role that wasn't really important to the story, that of Marcial, the sub-intelligent but humble drunkard. Of course, the scenery, the cultural delicacies of the Canary Islands and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the film did not have a documentary version (if it was the right intent), and above all, as a solid drama.
