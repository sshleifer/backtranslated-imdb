Now it's a bad movie if I've ever seen one. In one of the greatest years of the film, 1999, Detroit Rock City pleads with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for the bottom spot in a lot of junkies. The plot is masterful. Four schoolchildren eventually have a chance to see the KISS's rock-hard rock for the third year in a row. So, when their tickets are reaped by an ultra-religious, chain-smoking mother, the pals fall to Detroit, and I'm sure you can find the rest. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly. ; The film goes out of its way to explain how the four group members (no, not gen, paul, ace and peter) are going to get these tickets: to lose your virginity in a confession; saving a smoked bimbo and your mother's Volvo (from Soprano's Steve Schirripa, yet); preventing a robbery in the midst of one for a 12-year-old's debt; And of course, break down your bare essentials for MC Ron Jeremy after putting a full blender with bourbon residue. Sounds funny or not? Perhaps Detroit Rock City has a point with all this folly in how extreme sometimes these supporters can go. And we understand this movie is a comedy; it is supposed to be filled with slapstick. But does Detroit Rock City strive for the right audience? It is named R, which is the only way to give prepubescent adolescents - the audience I see, after which many people will eventually get this one - voyeur will be illegal. <br /> <br /> Detroit Rock City also failed to touch the end of the 1970s. The camera's texture quality is far too clear and too bright, lacking the necessary flair of movies like This is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would have enabled the audience to feel more at home at times. Simply wearing kids in the 90-year-old grunge and putting others in 'disco infernos' doesn't do the trick. Environment means something you know; I doubt Detroit saw these glamorous in 1978. If something positive comes from this movie, it is the kick-soundtrack of loud late-70s to early 80s. Van Halen, AC / DC, call it, this is all here. Of course, we can't forget KISS, the band is being thoroughly subjected. <br /> <br /> What the film is failing to manage is questions about why the Knights of Satin's Service (it's just KISS) has become so frantic by moms around the nation. Certainly, the hard rock and devilish makeup can be part of it; encouraging the youth to explore themselves and have a good time can also be reasonable reasons. But, what does KISS say about the music we hear through this movie after this highly rebellious group? What separates these folk songs from 'rock' and rolls all night and party 'from the rest of the music? Probably, these questions remain in a music communication class and not in the movies they have to answer, simply because it is KISS and they rock and we must do everything in our God-forgiving power to see it. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 5 stars
