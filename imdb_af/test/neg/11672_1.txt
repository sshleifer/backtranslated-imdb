Every time I saw this movie, I get the same impression: some of them are so stupidly stupid that they run out of me, they are not deliberate, and there are many of them; The rest is just bad, stupid and / or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets credit to be bad at its own expense because it is the intended result. It's stupid and cheesy because Sam Raimi managed to do what he was trying to do. This movie doesn't have that excuse, it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers have failed so. The crap result is cut on top of the crap slideshows to make the shame that the lowest rating a movie can give is one for 'terrible'. Watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a Billy Madison essay - "Everyone in this room has now listened to it." I must be able to give this movie something around a -5.
