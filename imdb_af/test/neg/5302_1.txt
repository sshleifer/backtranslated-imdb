Although I think the judges who hated this movie had encapsulated exactly what it did wrong (everything!), I had to add two cents. If you want a long version of how terribly this movie is, please read the review by competing. <br /> <br /> Here's the short version: Shameless use of the actors' names to propagate the plot as opposed to using their talent (no one brought them "a game"), blatant commercialism (I think Pepsi can afford to keep an ad - or 40 - now in a movie) and a plot (???) "rock star" cliches that was totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Let me put it this way. . . I thought of Wayne's World all the time I watched this movie, but I didn't laugh! Every time you try to throw in Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to help your movie, you have serious problems. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, warn your friends and family - this movie sucks.
