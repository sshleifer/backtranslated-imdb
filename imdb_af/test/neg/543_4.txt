I struggle to see the point of this movie. It's supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't even laugh. The storyline is one that has been interesting in a well-made movie, but as it is done by cartoons, the result is quite incredible (like comedies should be). The comics were hit and miss, even at the episodes, and it is fair to say that all the people involved are going to do bigger things. One to avoid. I also just noticed that the comment has to be 10 lines long. The whole point of this comment is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching: don't write an essay or disassemble it. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, the boys, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, please let me know. On the other hand, if you like lame jokes as found in Friends and Dodgeball, enjoy watching it!
