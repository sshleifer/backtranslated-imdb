I do not understand why this movie has received such good grades from critics - I have seen dozens of documentaries (on TV) about the wine world that were much better than (if) you see it, please think of two very annoying aspects of mondovino: first, the filming is just awful and terrible and disturbing: it seems to me that the man behind the camera has just received the material and played through it: lots of zooming (for nothing but pressing the button in / out) - - I almost stopped seeing it because of it! Secondly, the interviewer (the director I think) is not really relevant: he looks like and asks questions like a boy scout, not a journalist, even if the general idea and themes are interesting, bad conclusions: maybe not for guys who know nothing about wine => not recommended at all (2/10)
