Have you seen all the great adventures of the last few decades? If you don't bother, you've already seen all the scenes - and I can assure you that those scenes were originally in much better movies. <br /> <br /> The story (I'm sure true storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid (silly in a way that makes it play in a mortuary, will be a bunch of fierce undead leads). Each character is based in a cliché and ... well, it's nothing but the cliché. And yes, all you need to be a hero is to be American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland they advertised it as the kind of movie the DVD was made for. Maybe I should sell my player ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
