... if we all know, nobody does it like the BBC. <br /> <br /> To be a keen fan of this kind on Sunday night, I looked forward to it a lot. How disappointed I was! In the first thirty seconds I didn't think it looked promising and after two minutes I was having a hard time watching. <br /> <br /> But my friends and I just kept on bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half the characters. The plot is hastily expedited to the extreme and the make-up and costumes are very ongoing and very 21st century in a 'bbc robin hood' style. This modern style could possibly be placed in sharp camera angles and visually cute cinematography, but unfortunately we didn't get it either. The direction certainly feels messy for both scene and shooting choices. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes we can't bare to see it and go out and be hired "The Prestige" (which is very good VAT). Perhaps it is unfair that I judge if I looked so little of this, but rarely did I feel compelled to warn people not to see anything! My friends and I, however, thought that the house and the parasols were beautiful, but it's as good as it gets.
