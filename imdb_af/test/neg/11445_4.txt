A young woman, Jodie Foster, is doing a mafia murder, reporting the murder of local police, and targeting herself as a hit by mob operations. A professional murderer, Dennis Hopper, hired by mafia, steals her to prepare for the hit, but eventually falls to her. Then, as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case when a kidnapped hostage begins to work and work with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster also falls for her kidnapper, makes love, and prepares them for a getaway . <br /> <br /> The actor, Denis Hopper, is trying to align himself with Dennis Hopper's creative ambitions. The result is disappointing and fails to keep up with the artistic level of a good artist like Dennis Hopper. There is no real excitement and the writing is sometimes naive and predictable. The movie is saved to some extent by performing Jodie Foster who is not at her best, but still shining with her talent, beauty and gift. Of historic interest is the brief appearance of Vincent Price, and in a small act of Charlie Sawn, known for his great role in Wall Street. <br /> <br /> If you decide to spend the 116 minutes watching the movie, it's not a complete loss; This movie provides easy entertainment, but we expect much more from the director of "Easy Rider" and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "The Accused".
