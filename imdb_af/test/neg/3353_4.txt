Wired horror excursion has an innocent teenager (Meg Tilly, who is always tempting) to try with the popular click at school (despite the fact that they hate her) the night in a creepy mausoleum. Despite the complete absence of originality, this low-budget thriller can gain some decent special effects and has several good performances (especially by Robin Evans, who championed the ominous champion as the leader of the girls). The writing is not sharp, but it has enough features to make the proceedings fairly tolerant. ** of ****
