A young couple decides to go away to sunny California. They never reach their destination, as they decide to come to the Rest Stop. <br /> <br /> After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on moving to a resting place. When she's ready to leave, she leaves the bathroom to find her boyfriend disappears with their car and traps her on the back roads of Texas with just an abandoned camper to keep her company. <br /> <br /> Rest Stop is one of those cheap and tough horror movies that can become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop Being a Cult Classic You May Ask? Well, the three elements you need to become a cult classic are gore, sex and artistic merit. Rest has a large amount of sinks, and while I don't want to give away too much, it contains oodles of blood. This movie has everything from the bad man running several times over a police leg with a pneumatic drill on a girl's leg. Sometimes it can be about as bloody as a movie can get. It also has a generous and yet some reasonably intimate love play in the opening hours of the film. Therefore, the sex is covered. Now the hard one ?? does it have any artistic merit? You never get the bad man's face? you see glasses, profiles, shadow silhouettes. He is a faceless, relentless monster, who only falls high on the artistic merit scale. The movie has very few characters in it except the main character? Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). As she spends a lot of the film herself, she cannot reveal her thoughts during a conversation, but must speak out loud so we know the audience what she thinks. Sometimes it can be slightly irritating; However, this is a brave step by the author (John Shiban) and it works for the majority of the film. As an audience knows, even if you are not chased by psychotic killers, it is completely alone and separate from civilization. <br /> <br /> So will Rest Stop become a cult classic? It will probably be because of the gore, sex and arguable artistic merit, including many chills, an interesting and inventive plot and screaming a lot on the screen because the main character has to do many things that you definitely shouldn't do when he a psychotic killer runs. (What fun are horror movies if you can't complain about the stupidity of the victims?)
