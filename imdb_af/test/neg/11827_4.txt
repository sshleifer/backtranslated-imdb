I liked the Takashi Miike movies I have seen so far, but I found it very disappointing. I bought it, but I won't keep it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the Adness DVD, which has only two episodes. In the first, a killer kidnapped women, cut off the top of their skull to expose the brain, plant them in the ground to their chin and plant a flower in the brain. You can tell it from the DVD box. In the movie, the head of the head is digitally blurred by TV static. If you didn't see the DVD box, the viewer wouldn't know what people were watching until later a young police produced a small model of the body. Strange, there is also a flash frame later on from the woman's head and it is not censored. Besides, I'm not really sure what is going on. Some women get phone calls, and a sketchy, animated character cavorts around when that happens. An animated character sometimes appears on TV screens. It is unclear if anyone sees it. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, pregnant women are found and their babies are missing. Again, a cop produces a model of what the corpse is, which is useful, as the body is again sensed. There is also a natural birth in the movie, but strange, even the baby and the umbilical cord are censored! According to the DVD box, uncensored versions are not kept when originally created. Maybe even if they had, if they knew they were going to be censored, maybe they hadn't bothered to show anything ...? Not sure. <br /> <br /> If I hear the later episodes, it's better, maybe I'll look for them. As it is, I won't bother.
