It is one of those strange, self-explanatory, self-explanatory films that are trying too hard to be deep. It's not. Instead, it injects cliches trying to pass Profundity. Typically, the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how life begins to breastfeed, and then moves to suck his girlfriend's chest and eventually his wife, who eventually concludes that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who share their view of life, the universe, and so on. Present on Adam's journey through the Mojave Desert on foot. (Suddenly he leaves LA the day of his wedding, and his family, friends and fianc√© assume he's killed when his car was found in a rocket-torn military test series.) Some characters are more entertaining than others . The best way is to escape from a mental hospital that speaks only by the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, does some impressive impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye, and several characters from the original Star Trek. But as soon as the interesting characters leave the screen, we again sit with Adam and his quest for the deepest. It's a long journey, which tows in many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and a half movie I've ever seen. And the final almost doesn't make it worth it. <br /> <br /> I discovered the movie one day on HBO, waking up too early and clicking on the TV. This will teach me. Next time I'll try harder to sleep.
