The first season of Bones plays in Finland and I can't believe the amount of bullshit this show takes - the characters are level, poorly directed and clumsy. <br /> <br /> It's a poor men's CSI. Or actually, CSI without a coherent plot. Although Bones has potential, it fails because of the lack of director who could not extract the essence of the actors' performance. It's actually sad to see a show throw it all away as it could have thought a descent show with just a pinch. From the beginning you get the feeling how uncomfortable the acting is. <br /> <br /> Short story short - don't waste your time on Bene.
