I like girls. So, twelve years after seeing Star Trek V for the first time, and thinking it was bizarre, I gave it a second watch, hoping to find some redeeming quality I missed for the first time. <br /> <br /> I didn't. <br /> <br /> The writing is half-baked, and although the quality of the play is only stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (though it is shaky), the farther we get in the plot, the crook becomes . The last quarter of the movie is just ridiculous. What's even worse is that it was the first ST movie to be released after the franchise returned to Next Generation to television and the average episode of Next Generation would be ashamed * - including the special effects! What an embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The Final Frontier is not thoroughly miserable - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it is so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, also the first one) that the only reason I can think to watch it is because you will appreciate the other movies more. <br /> <br /> * unless it is an episode with Troi's mother in it.
