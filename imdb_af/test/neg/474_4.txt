I enjoy B-movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very watchable actor. I love how he delivers his lines. 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness' were good movies. I like running time. But I don't know if I will ever watch this movie again ... and I bought it. Now, after saying this, I bet the commentary and special features will be worth watching! This movie has just too many holes for me to really enjoy, even as a cheapo movie. First, Ted Raimi was annoying, just plain annoying. There was nothing about his poorly-acted / written character that had not been done a thousand times before. Unfortunately directing was subpar and choosing a few shots ... yikes. I don't expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell didn't deliver. <br /> <br /> I didn't buy this idea, but it was an Oscar movie like "Annie Hall" I'm disappointed. I would have been happy with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I have much less. At the end of the movie, there were no scenes that came to me, no dialogue arranged within me. Even 'Hostel' had a classic line for petes sake! I don't recommend this movie.
