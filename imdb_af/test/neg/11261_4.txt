I have read the Dave Robicheaux novels and see James Lee Burke as my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I also visited New Iberia and many of Acadiana to better visualize the environment in most of these books. Needless to say, I greatly expected to see "In the Electric Mist", especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be great as Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very hooked; the interaction with the "ghosts of Confederate death" was level and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was dull, expressionless and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgotten movie is to add my "ditto" to a previous user's comment that this movie was like one of those old made TVs. I expected Jill St John or Cameron Mitchell to arrive at any time. <br /> <br /> The location settings were accurate, and photography sometimes has the essence of the steamy bay-like, smoky juke joints and ominous soil cemeteries of southern Louisiana. The bad idea of ​​the story and Tommy Lee's sub-par performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy region of the region. <br /> <br /> Next to the final remark: Dave Robicheaux's nickname is "Streak," in the novels. due to the clear stripe of silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (Similar to how Sopranos Paulie Walnuts would appear if he was only seen in profile.) Tommy Lee did not have such a streak in this movie, probably because the editors are James Lee Burke fans and they broke out after they witnessed Jones's testimony. Low Comment: While I generally find Alec Baldwin to be pumping and unpleasant in most roles, he was by far a better Robicheaux in "Heaven's Prisoners" than Tommy Lee in "In the Electric Mist." much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly credible performances and more atmospheric atmosphere than this new movie. <br /> <br /> "In the Electric Mist" is good to watch when one feels like fighting out and there's nothing better on TV. But then this is also infomercials.
