There should be some kind of prosecution to punish producers for financing finance. I feel that some kind of criminalization of bad movies might prevent more movies from making this idiot. Sure it has an interesting movie, but I don't think I've seen any more cardboard performance of a whole role as in this unique crappy piece of crap. That director should somehow be punished for not attracting at least some performance from these people. So debauchery is a theme (no, they'll beat you over the head with this one), that doesn't mean that each character should recite their lines as if they were on NPR. Did I mention this movie was crappy? Lastly, I'm not sure what the memories of terminal bone cancer would be, but I'm pretty sure if you were completely brain dead, your cancer will continue to grow. This movie is an insult to cancer patients, medical specialists and non-delayed people. Oh, and finally flying bumblebee because they produce enough mass for their mass by hitting their wings just like any other flying insect. I absolutely despise people who present false knowledge as fact. Next time, do some research before using an imbecile misconception as a foreground for a whole freaking movie. Just a treasure believing in Jesus!
