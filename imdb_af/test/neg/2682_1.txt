Well wait, let me get this street, there are actually a few morons on this site that think this is one of the better, if not the best, Halloween sequel. I even read someone who says it was just as good as the original. What nonsense they believe, I watched and clear every Halloween, unlike some people who at least make a good horror movie and this shower of S is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen in my life. Frankly, if I were John Carpenter, I would sue the person who wrote it or go to his or her place with a hunting rifle. Serious Halloween successors in general are almost all the garbage, two are shit, three are stupid, four are good, five are good five, H20 is good, resurrection painful. Yet in many ways I find it the worst of a lot of bad successors. Why? Well, let me just start with a kind of rant, not so much an overview, but an intense ration on why Halloween 6 is the healing of Michael Myers is one of the most deadly movies I've seen in many years. OK where do I start, ah yes the plot oh, the plot. Actually, the plot is an accumulated mess containing cults, signs of Thor and another shit. It's just stupid, it's really, the movie is trying to be flashy and intelligent, but it went in such a frightening way. Why did Michael Myers have a reason to kill people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives who will be adequate, but no we should have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and overall shit. God is so bad that it made me cry, but the authors tried to add the character of Myers, but actually managed to do the opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a kettle pack that is a completely different color, Myers is not the same guy of the original or even two, maybe even four. It's another thing that made Myers a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it had to be the other way around, but Myers is so similar to Jason. All he does is kill people endlessly. In the original he tried his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was much more tense. Here he just walks to kill people. I mean, in the space of half an hour we equaled the amount of death in the original, it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers seems to have a very big head in it, I mean she's big and he's putting a lot of weight on it. What else is crap, oh yes, the return of Tommy Jarvis is pretty bad, actually all the characters in this movie Crap Bar Dr Loomis are of course. I can't stand the baby, I wish he got it, he's really annoying. Our heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family is an awful lot of actors. The mother is rubbish, the brother is bad and the Father I mean was it his first part or something? He was like a cartoonist for God's sake. He was actually more angry than Myer. By the way, his death is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen, I think even Friday, the 13th would not make something so ridiculous. What else is rubbish oh yes, Tommy Jarvis doesn't know the name of the man, but he can't really act, he's trying his best to be serious and everything, but I just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he'd actually died if everyone was dead, would it really have been good. There Dr Loomis is a terrible age and Donald Pleasence dies for all accounts. Despite being on his last legs, Pleasance is still the striking time in the short time. It is a pity that such a cornerstone of this franchise had to be said farewell to garbage like this. What else is rubbish, oh yes, the piece where the radio DJ gets it. First, how did hell manage to get Michael in that wagon when he was in his home five minutes ago? Secondly, it was just a useless death that can increase body composition, but it is just another fake that adds to the drift that this movie is. It's actually dead what all this has told me, because it was nothing short of this movie.
