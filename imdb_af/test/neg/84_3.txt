See the title of this movie "Stupid Teenagers Must Die" made me believe it was some kind of spoof. I later discovered that the original title was "Blood and Guts". Both titles are misleading. It is not a spoof, nor a serious explosive film. It's something in between, failed in both areas. A group of teenagers are looking at a ghostly home and then the murder begins. Sounds familiar, not true. Well, these movies don't add anything to the endless stream of similar movies. And it's bad. Due to the lack of light, the whole film is granular. Now this effect can be highly effective, but it is not in this case. The young player doesn't play too much, but the director has no idea what to do with actors. In many scenes, the actors are waiting for directions, but it gets too late. Of course, this can also be the editor's mistake. The characters are unrealistic and the story line doesn't stink. The sound is sometimes frightening: conversations are unspeakable, but if it is loud or screaming, the actors are very loud. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it's still bad. a. For me a 3 out of 10.
