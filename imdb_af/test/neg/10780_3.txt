If you are at home on a weekend, bored and do not have the will to move, the next few hours, you can do nothing better to enjoy your life. The play and the mini-dissertation and general movie show of this movie are not really that bad, so it makes it really possible to put it through. This is definitely a movie that would show them in high school's health class to learn the dangers of premarital sex. Or they can also point out the dangers of many lame music - that "rock band" Brian Austin Green is really awful, I think it's a much bigger threat to society than parents.
