I can't see anyone saying that it was a really good entertaining movie. With a few well-known actors, I found it hard to believe that it was only made in 2005. It's crazy! The acting is equal to amateur drama, poor amateur drama. Unless you want to laugh out loud at an incredible 100 minutes of pure wheat, don't worry about loading or renting it, the worst I've seen for years. It's from the passing days of acting, where cowboys shoot 8 bullets from the six shooters. The more known the actor, the worse they were, Drury was just sad. I was very disappointed with Lee Majors, did he actually bow to this kind of garbage? It was bad enough when he played the six million dollar man.
