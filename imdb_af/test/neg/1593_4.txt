I think I was prepared to hear about it all these years. First heard of Siskel and Ebert. When they said that God had eaten, I had to look up. Then a friend told it in 1991. She also said that her parents saw it when it came out for the first time and that her mother immediately dumped her father! By the time I caught Pink Flamingos at Sundance, I was prepared. For the most part. <br /> <br /> I still couldn't help but am surprised by the anal close ups and the blowjob scene. That said, the only characters I experienced were Edie and the eggman. Her crying scene early in the movie, but about something that isn't ordinary people, actually makes me sad. Although she was not pretty, she had a cute voice. I was happy for her and the eggman, and they actually touched me. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the action in this poverty level production was not good. And for writing, how about John Waters with these things? Well, that's different.
