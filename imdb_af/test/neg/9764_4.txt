Since MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one has to sit back and enjoy the scenery. On a "remote Greek island" it dies a very urgent Michael Caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who come up with local wacko / mysterious man Anthony Quinn and his daffy girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped matrooshemp, is pretty good, but Caine looks as if he's ready to explode. Bergen, though amazing, should NOT ever sit on a British accent. She's not very good at that kind of thing. Guy Green's direction is good, but if you don't have endless patience with the circular logic of the movie, you won't enjoy it. A true sour note is the cast of the bustling Anna Karina in the completely joyful role of Caine's girlfriend. Having seen her in the shape of a woman is a woman and a band-girl, her presence here is quite shocking.
