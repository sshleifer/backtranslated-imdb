Someone decided to make a "black version" of the plane. <br /> <br /> Someone decided to make a really bad "black version" of the plane. <br /> <br /> Someone decided to make a really bad "black version" of the plane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> Someone decided to make a really bad "black version" of airplanes after the first twenty minutes and instead spent all the time on the intelligence of the audience and the cast. <br /> <br /> This movie managed to break the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time. If nothing else, it should be remembered for that achievement. <br /> <br /> It's not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's just a bad thing. A really, very bad thing. Selecting the point-by-point will be a waste of time. The best thing to say about the movie is that there was a purple plane. Do yourself a favor ... go and buy a picture of a purple plane and you will get the best from what this movie was about to offer. <br /> <br /> This one definitely goes under the category "What the! ^ @ @ & *! they thought ????"
