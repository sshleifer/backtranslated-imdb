It's just a long ad for the movie "The Death Tunnel". Although it is an interesting history of the Waverly Hills Sanatorium, the whole ghost theory is your interpretation. More "Ghost Orbs" you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera, and the "Ectoplasmic Fog" is just someone's cigarette smoke lit up with the camera flash. I couldn't see a "Shadow People" until they drew an outline over the distorted image distortion. No scientific explanations have been suggested for the phenomena, only paranormally. Maybe it's just events you should see to believe, so make sure you make plans to visit the Sanatorium on your next vacation in Louisville, Kentucky.
