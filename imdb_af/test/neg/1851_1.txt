If you think this movie is going to be my advice is not. <br /> <br /> For me, the film did not achieve the grade at every level and was a reminder of how much British (and Irish) films are. Forgetful trips are the best I can say. If it had been counted on, I would have been something more interesting five minutes after the start of the case. I watched this movie with a group of friends and after reading the press previews I went along to not be critical and hopefully pass a fun 90 minutes. But, oh dear ..... <br /> <br /> As a comedy it wasn't funny. As a lot, the stupid story was messy and lazy. As a love story, totally incredible. Most of all as a piece of 'glory over the upper cluster', it lacked both style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they had to do to earn their money. Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but other than playing the east-end gangs and dressing the boys, Michael Caine lets you cold? <br /> <br /> In fairness some of my friends thought it was good, but if you go, my advice is a few drinks (or puffs) beforehand and lets your critical faculties unlock safely at home. <br /> <br />
