As Ben Elton once observed, nothing goes faster with style than comedy. Steve Martin's latest offering - 'The Pink Panther 2' - recently opened for bad reviews and dim checkout gross while Mike Myers won 'The Love Guru' a few admirers. <br /> <br /> In 1970, it was Jerry Lewis's turn to feel the pain of rejection (ironically, his character in this movie is experiencing a funny turn when someone uses the word in his presence) when road to the front? ' He saved him from the big screen for almost a decade. <br /> <br /> In this World War 2 comedy, he plays 'Brendan Byers 111', the richest man in the world, who wants to join the army with his patriotic duty (and also because he is bored with success), but becomes rejected because he is medically disabled. He then decides to start his own privately funded army and recruit other 4-Fs. <br /> <br /> Challenged with ridiculous uniforms that look like those worn by "International Rescue" in "Thunderbirds", they are training. Here are some good visual gags. When they burn rocket rivals, they are happy with themselves until they learn they just destroyed a Texaco oil station! Brendan wants to learn German, plays a long-play record called 'Songs To Mein Kampf By'. When this army sat down to eat, instead of being in a miserable mess, they were in a cute room decorated with a candlestick. <br /> <br /> John Wood is very funny as' Finkel ', Byers' ever -And English butler. His best scene is when he exchanges a Mafia-type gangster to teach Byers brigade to death. <br /> <br /> The writing was not by Jerry himself, but by Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso, author of a number of episodes of The Monkees. 'Front' often has the appearance of a television sitcom, and sometimes you almost expect a laugh. <br /> <br /> Where things go bad, over the past 30 minutes, Byers became a top Nazi commander and after ordering the Germans to withdraw from the front, Hitler became involved (and Tom Cruise is nowhere in not!). As the commander, Jerry gives a display of such mental obscurity to reject description. He gives Brian Blessed a run for his money in the hardest man living attempt. It comes as a relief when the end credits appear. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the timing was just wrong - executing a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict raged was not a good idea. Or the public simply had enough of Jerry (the beard probably didn't help!). What he needed here was a good producer, someone to put him in the hand and say, "The gag stinks. Throw it out!". When the 70's are in progress, the new comedy icons Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty will be. A masterpiece is not a masterpiece compared to this picture. <br /> <br /> Python's fatter, more bite and in Allen's case, replaced more human styles of comedy Jerry's slapstick brand. It won't be until 1982 that he will make something like a successful return - as the excited talk show host 'Jerry Langford' in Martin Scorcese's brilliant 'The King Of Comedy'.
