Perhaps it's time for us to declare 2007 the International Year of the Crocodile. The ridiculous "Primeval" came first over a crocus named Gustave (!) Which governs the marshes in Burundi. Then there was 'Lake Placid 2', a low-profile and made-for-TV sequel to a forgetful original. Thirdly, there is this incredible derivative and sophisticated piece of Aussie abomination, and eventually I still have the promising "Rogue". The latter is probably the best, considering the involvement of upcoming Aussie horror talent Greg McLean ("Wolf Creek"). "Black Water" is definitely not a complete waste of time and film, but it is another beautiful, useless survival spot that confuses real life confusion. Forgive my stubbornness, especially since I honestly feel for the people who have gone through this trial, but three characters sitting in a tree and sitting for more than a full hour are not my idea of ​​pure tension! Three young people travel through North Australia and decide to spend a day fishing in the remote marshlands. It doesn't take too long before a giant crunchy crocodile capsizes their small boat and digs the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam barely succeed in escaping the hungry teeth of the reptile by climbing a tree. Although he remains unnoticed most of the time, the crocodile is in mind and it is impossible to leave the marsh alive. Yes, it sounds like a plot of 'open water'. Replace the many unseen sharks with one giant unseen crocodile and the open sea with an equally inevitable Aussie swamp, and there you have it. Oh yes, "Black Water" contains at least rare moments of excitement and an impressive water sample. It must be said, the crocodile looks terribly coarse and you count anxiously after every next time he comes out of the water. The three-head throw does everything they can to keep their characters interesting, but how do you get it by putting it in a tree all the time? Of course, the truth-based concept creates a number of limitations, such as limited images of the fantastic filming stations, dialogues, and friendly character drawings.
