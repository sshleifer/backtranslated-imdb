I watched this movie with my boyfriend, an avid hip-hop fan and he was really really looking forward to enjoying the soul the movie claimed. Son, we were dead wrong. When I finished the movie, I felt two things: repentance and relief. Repentance because I was sorry to waste my time to see this terrible piece of light and relief because I watched it on cable. <br /> <br /> This movie really gives a bad name to black people, making so much horror stereotypes that I believe all smart black people everywhere believe have tried to spell. I'm Asian, and I feel very sorry and sick for those who made this movie. What more to say? Bad writing, even worse acting and horrible storyline. <br /> <br /> Although you are bored and have no choice, you should not see this movie. Seriously. The movie really has nothing to offer, except if you want to see things like illegal illegal drinking, animals, women's decline, and overall: A VERY VERY UNLIMITED SEALING-AWFUL MOVIE. Bah.
