As a documentary, it is ridiculous in a kind of campsite - a schlocky collection of biblical tableaux, which was re-created, mixed with solemn interviews of so-called "experts". Think of it as an infommercial that pushes Jesus instead of digh masters. <br /> <br /> However, in terms of historical accuracy, the detailed crucifixion scene is better than similar scenes in such widescreen Hollywood extravagance as "Ben-Hur," "King of Kings" and "The Greatest Story Ever." For example, instead of dragging his entire cross to Golgotha, John Rubinstein only wears his crossbeam over his shoulders to his outstretched arms. Nails are not driven by his palms, but by his wrists. His feet are not nailed separately, but one is placed over the other so that only one nail is to be used. By the way, Rubinstein's attack before his crucifixion is 35 in the book, "Lash! The Hundreds of Big Scenes of Men Tucked In The Movies." <br /> <br /> Of course, Rubinstein and the two thieves carry modest ribbon shoots, which are probably not true for the shameful reality of Roman crucifixes, but allowances must be made. Strangely, the "good" thief is placed on the left hand of Jesus, who goes against a long tradition. Just why this thief is played by a pudgy, overweight man is a mystery, especially since the "bad" thief is something of a "hunger".
