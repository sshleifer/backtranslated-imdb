This movie tries to finish Predator, but that movie is much better. This movie has really horrible special effects and an immaculate plot. The team entering the forest to find the cause of the disappearance of military and scientists is a combination of rough and rugged male delta commandos and beautiful but difficult female rangers. None of them are too bright. All the characters seem more than willing to walk alone in the forest and for the first time in a spear or sword and their death. Some of the piracy is very large and needs a bunch of food. But the close-ups of the creature are laughable, like most of the deaths. Every clich√© that the authors could think of was used. If you are looking for a senseless slaughter festival, it can fill in the account. The night I watched was very slow so I sat through the whole thing. I have to admit it has been a while since I looked at something like that. There is very little to release this movie. I'm surprised that the mess like this is produced.
