Unfortunately, this movie lives up to about 1% of the hype that created the game in 2004 and leaves a lot of sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, bookworms and movie lovers, there's nothing more disappointing, then a movie based on an original concept (or on paper or gaming console) that doesn't deliver. And not only that is going well. Far Cry released the video game in 2004 such a cult following that making a movie out of the content should have been easy and the gamers' score would have been to watch the movie. If you are a gamer who played Far Cry; Don't see this movie. Anyone who didn't play the game; it will still look like a B-grade activated / B grade directed movie. Your Boll, hang your head in shame ... it should have been easy to be in a collision. The storyline of the game was incredible (think Jurassic Park meets Alien) and yet you have managed it and formed it in your own terrible recreation of an immediate classic. Video games companies are being warned - if your Boll hits, close the door. Oh & Til Schweiger ... I'm looking forward to seeing you in Inglourious Basterds. What did you think to adopt this one? Sigh.
