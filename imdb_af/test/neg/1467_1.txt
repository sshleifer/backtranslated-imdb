If you want to see the worst movie ever made, look no further. Some miserable movies are visible because they are inadvertently funny. Unfortunately, American Movie has nothing at all, no unintentional humor, just unclear what its director is thinking. <br /> <br /> For those who like this movie, I suggest you show Kevin Smith's "Clerks". In Clerks you find creativity, humor and enjoyment - all on a scant budget. This should make you forget about this terrible attempt.
