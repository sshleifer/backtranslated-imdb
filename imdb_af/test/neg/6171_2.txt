I'm so disappointed in this movie I can't express. I was so excited when I started watching this movie to see Mickey Rourke's whole doctrine and that third-party child from the Sun, like me psycho. I thought, wow, it's going to be a winner, freakin 'Natural Born Killers style. And it got better. The production value was wonderful, directing was great, the acting was great, the movie was great, and the plot was good, the plot, well, what, what? About half through this movie I pulled my hair and shouted, "What is hell going on?" and I mean it literally? Nothing makes sense. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg !!!!
