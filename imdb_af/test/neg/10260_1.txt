Before I really shoot this movie, I just want to say that I absolutely loved it. <br /> <br /> First, how many times in the movie the characters have the phrase "You're Right." use? I'm sure I counted in the hundreds before I gave up and watched the movie again. <br /> <br /> Second, what is hell with that blue monkey stuff? OK, so did the Dansen family lead many private lives and had one blue eye with one brown eye, but since when has it changed people into underground carnivorous blue zombie creatures? <br /> <br /> And finally, "Old faithful, here will protect me" hahaha :)
