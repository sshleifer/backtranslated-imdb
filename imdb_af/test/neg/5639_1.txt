While listening to my parents, watch it (after giving up 10 minutes in the movie), they have absolutely no idea what is going on. When Charles Dickens looked into the camera, I half expected him to become a demon (yes, he looked like one). Unfortunately, this didn't happen. <br /> <br /> This movie has several reasons why I didn't complete it: one, it was unbearably slow. I mean seriously, it was SLOWW. You can only say 10% of what is said, and the characters are poorly introduced. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and you like a LOTT of talk, no action, terrible acting, cheesy laughter and the same music / sound effects played over and over and over, then it is the movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 1/10 - absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
