I look forward to seeing this movie, unfortunately I had to listen to my daughters' advice. It had to be a spoof, but it took a realism that companies had to answer a lot. <br /> <br /> After all the work he did, Jim Carrey was still Jim Carrey and his comedy didn't get any better, his fellow star was unable to recover. Their son in the movie was invisible. <br /> <br /> The life of crime was a wink and that was the missing link from the movie. The movie showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before, which lost it to me. <br /> <br /> I laughed in some areas, but overall not good enough, AlecBaldwin felt I was there to add. a little weight to the movie. His character was not strong enough. There were just too many gaps to make it a smart and stiff film.
