Potential viewers are warned. The current IMDb viewer rating for "Tomorrow at Seven" is a departure from the lower voter turnout. It has an interesting prospect, a killer leaves an Ace or Spades ticket on the scene of his crimes, while he notices the victim. However, the performance is flat and to say that the movie has its share of plot holes would be to imply that there is actually a plot. <br /> <br /> Chester Morris portrays mystery writer Neil Broderick, weaving elements of real murder by the Ace of Spades killer in his latest novel. Broderick aims to maintain a rich businessman for his book, but first he has to go past the man's eccentric secretary. "If you raise his family, you'll have enough money to keep a Ford together." That line presents itself to the daughter Martha (Vivienne Osborne) who presents the offers. <br /> <br /> Broderick meets Thornton Drake (Henry Stephenson), just as the latter is about to complete a puzzle. puzzle delivered by a courier the morning. The only remaining pieces, as we learn in the next scene, form the bold, black form of the Ace of Spades containing the words "By Seven Tomorrow Night". Now, which person compiles a puzzle, do not use the pieces with contrasting colors FIRST! <br /> <br /> Initially, I was inspired by the appearance of Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins in their roles as a few police detectives called in to the Drake residence. Generally, their characters are colorful enough to provide real comic relief, but here they are just irritating. McHugh's Clancy is particularly concerned about comments made by his partner Dugan, both of which are in the opposite direction if real problems arise. <br /> <br /> Now here's a question - given the identity of the Ace killer, why would he have a novelist and a policeman he just met on a flight to his Louisiana plantation invited? Especially when at 7:00 am, all parties will be heard a prisoner aboard the aircraft when the first murder is committed. It's not Drake, but who's dead, but his secretary Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). The early suspicion fell on pilot Henderson (Cornelius Keefe) following a light scene, but Henderson still did not report the murder to his supervisor until he arrived at Drake's plantation with everyone. Can you imagine someone getting away with it today unless your name is Ted Kennedy? <br /> <br /> With the cause of death not yet to be determined, the local shoulder is called in, but the first one to show up (a Broderick accomplice) is a fool. Yet, when the true destroyer appears, he just disappears immediately! In a second dark play, a letter from the murder victim Austin Winters is about to read. It wakes up when the lights come back, and because it can refer to the killer, it becomes a clue that needs to be recalled. So where was the letter? Winters's daughter Martha grabbed it and put it on the cloak of the lounge! How many thoughts are in this? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the whole thing is so dirty that Morris's character easily solves the issue. Although the movie comes in just an hour, it's almost a task to look with all the nonsense that's going on. There is actually only one humorous moment worth repeating; During the plane, the detectives exchanged this: Dugan - "Hey Clancy, how often do these things fall?" Clancy - "Once!" <br /> <br /> Except for McHugh and Jenkins, I can't say I've seen any of the other players in movies of the era, although I am a fan of most of the '30s by the' 50s. Luckily, the couple compensate much better back for Humphrey Bogart in a 1938 goofy jewel - "Swing Your Lady", where laughter is deliberate. The best thing I can offer about "Tomorrow at Seven" is a quote from Martha Winters in the middle of the year, though this turkey - "It's just a foolish waste of time".
