A 10-year-old child who is saturated with his parents decides to take a car and make a surrealistic journey across America to find Motorama cards, which are a gas station ticket card. If he can spell Motorama, have a chance to win 500 million dollars. He meets many bizarre characters along the way. No one can make a "quick college classical", Joe Minion's previous "After Hours" achieved it with merit and a wonderful director, but it wasn't immediate. This movie, on the other hand, is just bizarre, just to be bizarre. No rhyme or reason for any of it. The plot is at its best in accidental circumstances and apparently exists only to display various combinations. It's just not a fun movie or thoughtful one. It's a way of slamming together. I heard a lot of comparisons between these and David Lynch movies. It's damned near heresy, because even Lynch's 'worst' movie (the worst in quotes, since he doesn't have bad movies) is even more than the miles above. <br /> <br /> Eyecup: Cynthia King is very short topless <br /> <br /> Extras: Trailer for 'Joe Dirt'
