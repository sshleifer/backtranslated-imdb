Horrendously acted and completely ridiculous ghostly horror movie that has a way out. Anna Paquin plays a neurotic teen who fights the "things-in-the-dark" that suppresses her and her family shortly after the move to their new home in Spain (?!). Slightly more than a geographically replanted rip-off of "The Shining" and especially "The Others", the poor sudden "Darkness" is basically your typical B-horror feature with a few predictable lame horrors by audiences. of (so to speak) can be seen! In retrospectus, I think I would not set my personal expectations so high for this movie to be really good, seeing the well-known fact that it was laid for almost three years before finally released Christmas last year in US cinemas the country which was ultimately lucrative ticket sales and very difficult reviews from critics. When will filmmakers ever learn that there is more to making movies (whether it is horror or otherwise) than just the fine chance of a little financial gain? (Turkey-Zero Stars)
