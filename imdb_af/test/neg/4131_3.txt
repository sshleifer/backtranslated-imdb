What is it all about? Kelly (Jennifer) looks at all the moral behavior as she arrives at the island. She finds this Juan P (Manuel) existing and exotic, although she saw when he clapped his ex in the face, which he later justified in the film fair or wrongly justified? These two guys are the first to find each other on the island. Kelly is completely lost in all sentences and the great Juan P can fish and build a little home. Mr. They look a good time. Then Billy Zane (Jack, Kelly's characters man) and of course two days without knowing what his wife did with this beautiful Juan P, he is a little jealous. Billy Z is the stereotype rich man and maybe not the most beautiful man in the world. He doesn't like Juan P (beating his girlfriend at the pier, who can blame him? He's also arrogant, but he paid a lot of money to rent that boat and Juan P, who is the waiter / everything don't even get a beer? 20 minutes Don't want to be upset yet Billy is probably the man you want to face when you meet him, but at the same time he shouldn't be guilty of the shelter. Kelly and Billy have just lost a few dear friends! How convenient it is with them, no matter what! For a strange reason, however, Kelly likes this girl who touches Manuel and hates Billy to be jealous. OK, Billy overreacts, that's for sure, but Kelly doesn't do much to convince him too. She spends more time with Juan P and even wants him to sleep with them because he was so nice (and although Manuel shouted at her and called her things to ask him some intimate questions. But Kelly is so forgive ...). Yes right. And then she starts sex with this Juan P. It should be said that Kelly and Billy have a working relationship with this island incident. They have at least intimate sex on the boat and talk like people do when they love each other. others. Now you can think this scenario is possible. But for real, is it? Do you hit your man on a coconut island after two days just because he is jealous and drunk in the bar? (I wouldn't agree if the relationship was really bad, but the director doesn't give much hints if that is the case). For the sake of Christ, Juan P did not really show that he was a good person. Catch some fish and build a wooden house to get into someone's pants, is it a good side? Not to befriend Kellys' husband anyway (it would be very easy to leave them alone most of the time). He doesn't care about their relationship (and Kelly can't make up one) wants to have sex with Kelly. Kelly's character is just not trustworthy (if she was stranded with Billy and another attractive girl, she wouldn't be upset or what?). Or maybe she is? Billy Zane plays a very nice person, and Juan P is actually not much better than you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused and believes that she has sex with Juan P, will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor Juan P? So ... to all who read it ... What do you think about it? If you're where the Kelly character is, you'll be cheating on your husband because someday you know, you'll be back in real life, and Billys might not be that terrible. It's just jealous. And if you're where Billys character, what do you say, is he totally wrong in his behavior? And Juan P's character, what do you really think of him. One thing is for sure. Manuals exist! Ps ... The voodoo thing is so wrong here! What was it about? Seriously! Anyone tell me?
