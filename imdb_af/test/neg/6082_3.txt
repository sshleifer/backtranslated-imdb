The movie was terrible. The production company should be required to pay a fine for the waste of electricity that nonsense surrenders. <br /> <br /> There were too many holes in the plot. Why would the DOD send a killer to kill a world leader? If they weren't the DOJ, why would they send someone they thought they wouldn't do the job? To quote Butch Cassidy, "Who are those guys?" Apparently the director doesn't know either because he never told us. <br /> <br /> The characters were incredible. They didn't behave in any way that seemed what they were supposed to be. With the exception of the doctor, none of the characters were particularly compelling. <br /> <br /> If you want to save money on the electricity needed to watch this movie, feel free. Otherwise, turn the opposite direction.
