If you ever plan to rent this movie (hopefully not buy it), think again. It was as if Gary Busey had a gun on his head and was forced to act or die. I just wonder if Busey was arrested for something and sentenced to play in this movie, because I didn't see the man playing so much better with Keanu Reeves in Point Break in this disaster. It was a good movie, but there are thousands of other good movies that make you laugh without having to get your money back. <br /> <br /> The only reason I would ever tell anyone to rent this movie is to watch this movie is to see Gary Busey jumping up and down like a monkey. If you want a good, funny movie, go over Quigley and hire Spongebob or something.
