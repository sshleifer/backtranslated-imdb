I saw about half a dozen of the low budget poverty driving B westerns made by Ken Maynard in the 1930s, and I'm consistently surprised at how poor an actor he was. How did he ever become a leading cowboy actor? They say he can drive quite well in the silence, but in these later sound films he does nothing special. Maybe he got the lead because he was big and could drive. <br /> <br /> Phantom Rancher isn't as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard movies I've seen, but it's not much yet. Some of the other characters refer to him a few times as a "young fella", which seems to me to be just as old as the other older actors. <br /> <br /> And if it's not stupid enough, there's a fairly meaningful essay in this movie. At one point one of the characters commented on how the ghost prevented the poisoning of a pit, something that had not yet happened. Just a few minutes later we see that particular scene. No, it wasn't a look back. Initially, I thought that when Treeline Movies did the DVD transfer, they might have reversed two of the rules. But in those days, film roles were about 11 minutes of film, and the entire turnaround only had about 3 or 4 minutes. Everything else was in a logical order. So, it looks like it was a real continuity problem in the original movie. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Colony Pictures didn't last long.
