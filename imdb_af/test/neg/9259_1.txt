Take a bad writing, a little bit of activity and throw in a politically wrong morality story and what do you get? Something that is supposed to succeed for quality family viewing. <br /> <br /> Seven alone is the story of a family in the 19th century traveling across America in a wagon train, hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose gender I'm not quite sure of) hence the title of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story opens with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere. Oldest son John is a preliminary teenager, "lazy and good for nothing" as his father reminds him constantly. We see to the right of the bat that he has a penchant for practical jokes when he ties the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects it to a nearby mule. Of course, when the mule is moved, the poor girls are unloaded from the bed. John is caught by his father and is immediately punished by a band. <br /> <br /> The same day a wagon train goes through. Dad is tempted to join as it promises a new life in the wild, wild west. So the family keeps their belongings up and down. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the movie looks poor and amateur. The acting is lower than that of one of the films shown in the school about the pioneers. However, I cannot blame the actors, because the lines in this film are stupid and just too sickly sweet and optimistic. <br /> <br /> I must tell you that I caught this movie while I could bypass one sowing Saturday afternoon on a Christian television station. Not of a religious mind itself, I watched in horror as seven only offered moral explanations that were not only obsolete but just offensive! If I were a good Christian, I would hope that I would have the good sense to complain to the television station to air such a trash. However, since I am a cynical, non-believer with a bad sense of humor, I decided to sit back and laugh at me. <br /> <br /> In one of the opening scenes, the role of the father as the strict ruler of the house was established when he proposed the idea of ​​going to Oregon to Oregon. Her reaction is a warm "over my dead body." We are expected to laugh, I think, as the film cuts to the next scene, while Dad and Mom smile as he crosses the prairies. Oh, I think even the most beautiful feminists would have to admit that this "Father-best attitude" was the norm in those days, and one could settle the need for such a dictatorial rule if the living conditions were difficult, but I somehow it feels that this movie supports the idea even for today. Beautiful message comes from a Christian television station. <br /> <br /> Anyway, things are getting worse for the family, and the film's moral integrity is further reduced. An Indian (or Native American) rob John while sleeping in a field. Like a common wilderness, Indian Johns takes clothes and belongings. Thanks Pa, with the help of the passerby Kit Carson, can kill the Indian, as well as some of his delinquent friends. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a true hero. <br /> <br /> The family is accompanied by the trailer's resident doctor, Dr. Dutch (played by Aldo Ray). He shares Dad's sentiments about John and declares that he is a useless brat. Maybe, but he is also the best of this movie. Aldo Ray's doctor is a buffoon, who can't tie his own shoes, let alone one of the girls for a broken leg. Fortunately, the young child did not cry when the wagon overflowed and her leg cut in two, because dr. Dutch did not look the right bed service. We know the disadvantages of a child who is constantly being cut. Here's a movie that promotes that behavior. <br /> <br /> She later develops food poisoning, or something, I didn't pay much attention, and he died. His deathbed scene is the stuff that great acting is about. Frankly, the man didn't even get sick. <br /> <br /> Soon after, Ma also dies. The children are left to guard themselves. And that's when the real adventure begins. Sneak it through the rapids, meet more Indians (this is nice) and venture through snowy terrain. These kids do it all. And I thought, "What a lot of garbage!" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but there was nothing about this movie. This low budget Little House on the Prairie is a disgraceful waste of time and an insult to 'families' everywhere. I was surprised that in 1975, at the end of the feminist movement, and at a time when the treatment of Native Americans was in focus, something could really happen. <br /> <br />
