The worst part of this movie is that it shouldn't be so terrible. <br /> <br /> They had a good budget, though so many movies; they made it look nice and nice, and the best of all was the 21st century lesbians who would embrace a lesbian positive film ... yet the writer and director went out of their way to make every single movie about lesbian torment and confusion at residences, (you know, the place where all lesbian love lives and dies). <br /> <br /> This is a recurring theme and again in film, but something that viewers - if you use this voice forum as an idea - doesn't look enough. <br /> <br /> Every element of this story was so overbearing, excessively ominous and impressed that it was painful to go through. The main characters say it all: the crazy, abandoned, brilliant, rebel-lesbian tough girl (well, they took a super pretty femme like Piper Perabo and tried to snatch her, but it didn't matter much) seduced rich girl who is destined to betray her. <br /> <br /> To see them every step of the way, character 3, a dull, well-meaning, wide-eyed, good-looking girlfriend is. I say "every step" because she shares her every thought with the audience through the hardest, most unpleasant monologues. <br /> <br /> Although her lines seem to be written by a fifteen-year-old, though they try oh so, so hard to sound like a fifteen year old, you know it well ... talk. "To hear them (make love) with their sounds was um, you know, like, well ... okay!" she tells of her 2 rude roommates, who rolls beside her in bed. <br /> <br /> Later, she asks Graham Greene - the completed Native American actor who has been totally in a role as a gardener! "Is it wrong to give what people think?" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but is she a teenager or is she 7 years old? <br /> <br /> Granted, Piper Perabo (like Polly's tortured dive) and others do a good job for the terrible lines they are forced to speak. Perabo has a good energy level and is of course very comfortable in front of a camera. She will do well in a decent project, so it is by no means a criticism of the acting. <br /> <br /> But this story is SHAMELESS to survive every stereotype over lesbians who all play in one character. They couldn't stop with her (Polly) who was an angry, crazy passionate, secret genius who had completed math problems for the speechless teacher. Oh, but that's after she argued with the teacher who at least accused her of gabbing. <br /> <br /> "This is a word they (men) use against US (women)!" she says, bumping out of the classroom. <br /> <br /> Is it ALL the author can come up with? Or maybe we should ask: Why stop there? <br /> <br /> Poole and co. continued and Polly made a poetic dark child who communicated with wild hawks by shouting their name in the bush. <br /> <br /> Cue slow motion, sci-fi, Xena atmosphere! <br /> <br /> Then we wrote her to her birth mother ... (most lesbians are love-disturbed orphans, if you were in the dark). <br /> <br /> Then we have two teachers (one one, one single tap with loose neck straps) moving across all the action (the school looks very big for just 2 teachers) ... and gives a dark child / seductress / bird girl looks tense. Hmmmm. I wonder if something good, you know ... um, FUNNY happens between these TWO TEACHERS ?????? <br /> <br /> There is simply no excuse for something that did poorly. Heartbreak happens, but surely the writer and director knows that lesbians exist in this much more sophisticated time than this shock. <br /> <br /> I can't reveal the end of respect to those who force themselves to go to the end, but if you don't laugh, I can only guess crying. And not for the right reason. And I don't mean the wimpy make-up scenes.
