Leslie Nielsen hits with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. There is nothing to keep about this movie, because it's actually a one-joke movie, and the joke isn't that funny. How many times do we have to laugh at an almost blind man to make a fool out of himself? It's not funny, it's a pity. Nielsen must start seriously to refuse some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong must stand to make Jackie Chan films because it doesn't get much worse than that.
