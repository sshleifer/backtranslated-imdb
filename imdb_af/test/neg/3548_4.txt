I usually don't try a crime thriller, but Cleaner was just too predictable. Samuel L. Jackson plays the character Tom Cutler, along with his profession, created an interesting twist in the beginning of the movie, but it was about it. Without thinking, I knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes I already found out who the murderer was. Rather, I trust myself and I have seen several films that make a script, and I looked at its completion. What a disappointment I was right from the start. <br /> <br /> The decisive characters were good as well as the performers of Jackson and Harris ... except for Eva Mendes. From the start gate she does not play a credible character in correlation with the writing and it ruined the whole plot too soon. Perhaps it was a direct accident or just a weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut had to show more emotion and need for the situation around her. This would have made the build-up a little more compelling and the end more dramatic. Nevertheless, cleaner is vigilant, not unforgettable. I saw CSI episodes that were more exciting than that.
