Although I put the whole thing in, I must say it wasn't good. It was all over the place, with huge pieces of information missing on how things evolved and even inaccurate at some pieces. If you don't know anything about Michael, you won't understand anything. You need to rely on your present knowledge of the man so that some make some sense. Action was a bit dramatic, Flex Alexander saw nothing like Michael who was the end of me and the end. He literally looked gray. He saw that Michael was a little naive, but very positive, gentle and loving individual was okay, though they made him a fool from time to time. If you want to see MJ's life story, watch an American dream. "It's much better, but the only thing is that it will fall into a bad era. I have no doubt that they are finally a big budget movie of MJ's make life story, cos Michael You rock ;-) !!!!
