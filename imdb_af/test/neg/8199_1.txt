This film's only reasoning factor was the fact that it was free on TV and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. Other than that, Hallmark has to revalue this section of their empire, and perhaps their movies are more focused on bizarre love affairs between cancer-related haemophilia in Mississippi. To go into details about how sensible this movie is, it will give credit to be memorable. It wasn't. I remember the act of watching it, there are vampires (some of them teenagers) and some very bad dubbing. Whoever worked on the double panel of this movie should be moved to another sector of society ... maybe food service, to the deaf. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie, just because it makes so many others really bad movies, looks Oscar-worthy in retrospect. Then again, if you actually ended up with this movie's profile, I think it might be too late ...
