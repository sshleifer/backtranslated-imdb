If one believes Carson McCullers is one of the leading literary figures of the 20th century, it seems to be a huge shortage of talent to destroy one of her stories, but this movie shows that it did can be! How do the actors roll their way to becoming directors? Wood, unatmospheric, unsympathetic, totally out of sight with the poetic compassion of McCullers' writing, drowned my jaw with horror and disbelief that such a mish-mash of a movie could ever get finance and supporters. The only redeeming features are some fairly good acting (although said, Vanessa Redgrave appears to be delivering the same performance regardless of the character she plays), and some good cinematography in places, but otherwise it's a bitter , bitter disappointment. could and would have been a contemporary masterpiece. Simon Callow has to keep his head in shame and keep playing!
