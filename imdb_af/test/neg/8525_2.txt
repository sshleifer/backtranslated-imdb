I almost laughed out loud when the director commented during the comment that this movie was originally with a strong plot line. There is not one ... repeat ONE original plot line or special effect in this page. <br /> <br /> The Crows .... Hitchcock did it great for CGI and even with CGI, this movie is not a well-done attack. The creepy crawly boy ... The grudge did it and did it better. However, the psychologist ... recently done in Cold Creek Manor was killed. No pun is meant. Disconnected / rebellious teenager who doesn't listen to anyone ... over a dozen movies, this one just used straight for Beetlejuice. The naughty stuff from the basement ... can you say Amnityville Horror? Doors opened ... What Lies did, did it with much more flair. Creepy farmhouse ... too much to mention. <br /> <br /> The background of metaphysics - which should have been the central focus, gets lost as soon as you find out what's going on, which is pretty early. <br /> <br /> One thing (very much) that they never even try to explain is how they explain to the police that their attacker is sucked into the basement in the basement so they really have no body. <br /> <br /> Overall ... DO NOT BUTTER
