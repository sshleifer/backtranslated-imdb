Oh my God, this should be one of the most USELESS BRAINLESS STUPIDEST comedy ever made! What happened to Subhash Ghai, even Apna Sapna Money Money was worth watching <br /> <br /> Eww! GOD This movie stinks <br /> <br /> Don't look. Save your money. Bad movie. Bad sweets. Bad jokes. Bad acts. Even this movie is an example of Shoe-Polish smeared on a face. <br /> <br /> Trust me This movie even lets you smile, Vulgar jokes, Cheap jokes, a really silly movie without concepts <br /> <br /> Rating 0 at 10 <br /> <br /> AWFUL movie it's the two hours I never come back. <br /> <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi of Pakistan
