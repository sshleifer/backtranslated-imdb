Speed ​​I believe is a direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I haven't watched this one) give an impression of a test game that is very exciting in the first four days, but finally comes in a very boring draw . I watched this movie today on January 12, 2008 on rented VCD. It's release date is October 19, 2007. But fortunately for me, I haven't known or heard much about this movie except that it is a flop at the checkout. So in this situation when I watch the movie, I feel that this movie could have been a great movie, but then the director falls again for the Bollywood traditions and has lost a very good chance. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a Bhatt movie, it has to be copied from somewhere else. But now it doesn't matter to me, if I didn't see the original movie. I just found the main theme very similar to 'Nick of Time' and 'Badshah'. In the film, Sanjay Suri is shown to be an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks he's a chef. This brings back the memory of 'True-Lies'. The only new part was the use of the phone. But it also I found out is now taken from film Cellular. So when a movie is made with the mix of so many other movies, it's clear the future. <br /> <br /> The thing I like about the movie is its fitting. As the name suggests, things are really happening fast, and there is not much time to think about the scenes. But it breaks in the last 20 minutes so the movie goes into the traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishum. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is also very interesting. Three stories go parallel, one after another. One of Urmila's kidnapping, the other of the Zayed who is trying to help Urmila, and then the prime murder plan. Of course, these three stories are mixed together while the movie is going. <br /> <br /> But then the spirit of the movie killed the very ordinary play and unnecessary extra style. Besides Sanjay Suri, nobody else makes an impression. This also applies to Urmila, which is always promising in RGV films. Because of this ordinary acting, some scenes do not really give the feelings that director wanted. Eg The scene at the end where Urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone had a good impact. But instead, we're just waiting for the end of that scene. <br /> <br /> Unlike acting, unnecessary love for style, the film demoralizes. Showing such cool villains is good for Hollywood movies not for Bollywood. The background of London is just for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this wallpaper can be seen. Especially in the end, all those dhishhum dhishhum were completely unnecessary. Perhaps the director is an impression that the climax in Hindi movies should have such fights. They seem unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make sure people leave the theater before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Everything, I find the movie once visible. When it comes to TV or you can get it on rent, it's OK. But then make sure you have the remote control and the forward button handy. Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can see other channels safely.
