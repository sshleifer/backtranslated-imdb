To be honest, the movie was so surprising that I loved it. Never before in my life has such a terrible movie been seen. I was in shock. I mean, I don't even know what to say. <br /> <br /> The characters couldn't even keep their own guns, one minute a man had an M16 and his friend had an MP5, then in the next scene they phoned guns. (Don't ask, trust me, I know my guns) And I will never understand how they came from a place that looked like Vietnam, to an Arizona highway, to my backyard, and then to " a chemical plant in California, that's what I took it. <br /> <br /> Why would you be afraid of a man in a Halloween mask wearing a trash can and shooting plastic arrows for you? How is it scary? I wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie. I love how the "skeleton man" randomly decided to go on a deadly spree that day. But hey, everybody who made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a hillside firewall. <br /> <br /> Good day.
