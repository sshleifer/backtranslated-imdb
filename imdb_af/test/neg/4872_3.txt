They make everything too easy in this movie. It reminded me of Indiana Jones, where he hid during an ocean crossing on the outside of a submarine. Everyone knows everything about it, it's just really easy to get anywhere in the White House. I don't even know why I watched half. Because I love Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I expect the normal ability to force bullets from all angles, and can run faster than a motorcycle (usually faster than a car in a garage or ally). It was stupid, mostly, and I didn't even know, had a ten-story lift in the White House. Anyway, something conspiracies is always interesting.
