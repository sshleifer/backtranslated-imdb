Norman Wisdom's last main vehicle was a departure from his previous outings ?? bringing its unsolicited milquetoast up-to-date, it's a product of the Swinging Sixties! The end result is an uncomfortable and occasional embarrassment that blends the star's typical slapstick (and sentimentality) with soft sexuality and even milder satire; The plot deals with an executive on a trip for a bank conference that falls for teenager Sally Geeson (who doesn't mind getting involved with him but also their relationship so seriously); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's friend who warns Norman of her capricious character. <br /> <br /> The film is nowhere as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB rating it will have, and if it is, it's interesting for the treatment of middle life crisis (in many ways similar to Hoffman [ 1970] and 10 [1979] ?? both, incidentally, I just did not watch); By the end Norman is even trying to bring his wife to his new way of thinking! The Pretty Things appear as if they are performing a number of good songs in a nightclub and Norm himself sings the catchy title track!
