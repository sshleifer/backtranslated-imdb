So you have the spoiler warning --- but I would argue that you can't spoil what is already rotten. I assume they changed the name to "The Cavern" just in case "WIthIn's reputation preceded. <br /> <br /> After paying the cable hire for this movie, I considered my household refuse save for a month and post it to the writer / director, delivering his rubbish to my house, so I thought it was just fair to return the favor. <br /> <br /> The movie opens suggesting that the scene is in the desert of Kazakhstan, I'm not sure why they chose Kazakhstan, maybe the author is a fan of the Ali G Show, but they just had to start in the cave because the Outside, of course, was not Kazakhstan. It was the first idea that I would hate the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has no redeeming qualities except one: it is consistent, everything is terrible. directing, the play, cinematography --- every aspect of this movie is just bad, and i like bad movies, goofy movies, B- horror movies. . . but it was just bad. A judgment. A hackneyed. And predictable. And boring. <br /> <br /> To get a feel for the movie, go in 5 with your friends in your laundry and switch off the lights. Turn on a flashlight (turn on) and start to tumble. Now you all start screaming and screaming on top of your lungs. This is it. <br /> <br /> For a complete re-enactment, 5 out of 6 people in the laundry play dead on the floor. Throw Karo syrup on them. Turn the lights on again (stop the dryer). Now a man in a gorilla costume entered the room and stood the last person. <br /> <br /> FIN <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: Read through the other comments, many find it remarkable that this movie was made on a low budget. It's not remarkable. Making a crap movie on a big budget is remarkable (Waterworld). Making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable (like Blair Witch, who I thoroughly enjoyed). Making a crap movie on a low budget is not a bit surprising, and you can expect more from these people if they still make movies, because I don't think anyone will give them a pile of money after they it didn't look. br /> <br /> Is the low budget an excuse for a terrible movie? No, and it certainly is no reason to see it. Would you eat a dog sandwich just because it was cheap to make? <br /> <br /> The IMDb rating for this movie over time will be interesting to watch. It has to fall further down, but only if the number of innocent innocent viewers exceeds the ability of the filmmakers to beg their personal friends to give it 10 stars.
