To begin I didn't see the grudge. The preview for that movie didn't let me jump, didn't scare me and didn't entertain me. But when a group of friends asked me to see The Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a little curious about how this movie would be. I went mainly because of my friends. Not even 5 minutes in this movie, I realized I threw $ 7.50 away. The action of the grab is terrible. The schoolgirls in the beginning seem to have never acted in their entire lives. Then the movie plots. Let me tell you, I couldn't stop laughing at this whole movie. It's just as stupid. I'm pretty sure they didn't try to make it frightening. They don't do anything jumping. It shows the children, then they show "attack". It builds on it, it's not an "all-of-a-sudden" thing. And even in the middle of the movie, the core of the movie, the play is still terrible. This allows so much time between dialogue that someone can add in their own comments. This movie is one of the funniest horror movies I've ever seen. Poorly written, terribly acting, horrible writing, terrible "non-action" throw, and a terrible concept. The movie darkens and changes situations more than you can count. Each part finally plays out and then binds to the end of the movie. I will never pay again to see this movie. I won't even see it on cable. This movie is a joke. Please do not delete your money on this movie!
