I watched this movie at the 2005 International Film Festival in Edinburgh. <br /> <br /> This movie was compared to Sideways - which I wanted - in the EIFF program - so I look a lot at this movie. I also hosted Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite etc ... so I had some good recent experiences with some weird American indie movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found that Puffy Chair did not compare favorably with any of these movies. <br /> <br /> I spent 35 minutes waiting for something amusing, spiritual, informative, or even lightly interesting to happen. It didn't happen - and the shaky video camera made me sick - so I ran away. <br /> <br /> It's just the second movie I've ever walked out (the first was "Showgirls") which is slightly disappointing. I could probably have been expensive if it wasn't for the nasty effects of the shaky picture - but nothing within the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that I would miss something. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
