The movie gets a score of 3 because it dared to be so. It features a cast actor while you can hear their thoughts and desires! It's really a strange movie and an experience I won't forget. The only problem is that the experiment, although interesting in some ways, is generally pretty boring and unrelenting. In fact, it's great that a Norma Shearer and Clark Gable movie can be boring! The film is based on a Eugene O'Neill game and it really looks solid. In fact, it would have been best to just keep it as a stage production - it didn't translate at all. It is therefore only recommended to use the stubborn cinemaniacs. And those who love Gable movies just have to watch all their movies!
