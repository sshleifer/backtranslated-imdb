Needed Roughness (1991) was a bad comedy / drama that tried hard at every level to be a serious film about college football. Many of the current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comic highlights. Other than that, it's a very mediocre movie. They just had to hold on to make a straight comedy filled without realism. Instead, the filmmakers try to play both fields and end up at the short end of the stick. When will someone make a decent movie about college football that is funny and realistic? <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless it is free at
