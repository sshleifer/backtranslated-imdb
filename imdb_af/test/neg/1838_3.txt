I look forward to this movie, as everyone is talking about it as a good horror movie, and finally a European one. Perhaps my expectations are too high. <br /> <br /> It starts with a good silent horror / shock sequence, but it immediately lets you in the following scenes, where the plot begins to be set, as the acting and motivation / life of the characters reveal no better than any "made for TV" drama. It keeps right to the end. <br /> <br /> The terrible part of the movie is definitely a good idea and another one, but ALL the screens are of the "seen before" kind. <br /> <br /> Overall, my idea of ​​this movie was that it had a good concept, placed in a mediocre story, bad acting, and less than tolerant plotgate. <br /> <br />
