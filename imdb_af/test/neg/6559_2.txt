I recently saw this movie, and I said to myself, "This movie is bad!" William Shatner is a good actor, but he is not a director! <br /> <br /> It's not just that the acting is bad, it's terrible. And instead of a plot we have a very bad story called a plot! What I really thought was bad at first when Kirk and McCoy taught Spock to sing, "Ride, Ride, Drive Your Boat!" <br /> <br /> Do I have anything against William Shatner? I don't. But when it comes to a director, he sucks! This movie is not one of the worst movies I have ever seen. But this is the worst of the Star Trek series! <br /> <br /> I noticed that Shatner didn't return after sending another movie in the series. They didn't seem to want him to lead a movie again after it happened! <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> 2/10
