Well, I watched this movie expecting to roll into the corridor ... how wrong I was. The movie was moderate, at its best, and irritated the worst (the slapstick comedy styling of building an ark with archaic tools, laughing ... no I didn't). I'm very disappointed as Steve Carrel was in charge. I looked at the United States office religiously, I beat incredibly, I thought 40-year-old virgin was good ... but Evan succeeded us - why on earth he accepted this writing. And, as for Morgan Freeman, he's old enough to know better. <br /> <br /> So, the idea was reasonable, the actors I had every faith - but the performance was nothing to write home and the end, Well, it looked like they were out of money or ideas walked. It was one of the most motivated ends I could think of. They have taken a biblical story and come across it to a warning story about localized environmental issues, not even global issues, but a local bill. Summary, reasonable start, gradually got worse and for me, it was all wiped out by the time the credit rolled up.
