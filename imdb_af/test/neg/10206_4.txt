No Holds Barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten was the coolest movie this side of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But then, if you grow up and see it, you feel ashamed that you were so obedient to love it. You feel sad, shy and stupid. If you have a little brother and you show it to him and he tells you it's gay, give him a high five and take him to the strip for his eleventh birthday.
