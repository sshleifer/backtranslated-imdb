It's a horrible movie. Angie Dickenson is a class action and always does well, but she doesn't get much more roles and needs money to do this movie. By the way, she is less than 10 minutes on the screen. Oooh, wait, there is one redeeming feature in this movie: Meg Foster has a small role in this movie. Now Meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not very good, but she has the most scary eyes of any actress I've ever seen. By name you probably don't know her, but one looks at her eyes and you will recognize her. To sum up: the play is horrible, the story is bad, and even the filmography is terrible. A screen that is going to black every time the director wants to change scenes is pretty moronic. See any thing other than that, even Mr Ed reruns!
