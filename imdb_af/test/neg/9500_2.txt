Yah. I know. It has the name "Sinatra" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I hired this idea. It was a movie I missed in the theaters. It's not. These are some rubbish films made by people at Showtime (cable station). Geez, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make what garbage movies they want! It's not good. I'm such a Sinatra fan as any healthy man, but this movie was just stupid. Boring. Dull. Unfunny. Uninteresting. The only redeeming quality is that (if they keep the facts), you learn what happened to Frank Jr.'s dragons. Otherwise, it's just a silly movie.
