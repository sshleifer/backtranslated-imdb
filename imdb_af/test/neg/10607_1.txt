Pure crap, decent cinematography ... I liked colors. Other than that, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Drilling, lifeless, not once did I get interested in any of the characters. I kept waiting for a real plot to form and the movie picked up the pace. Nothing ever happened! I think they have spent too much time on hair and wardrobe that they forgot when a movie was made.
