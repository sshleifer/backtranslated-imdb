I know most of the other reviews say this movie was great, but I don't agree. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a good book! It was actually one of my favorites when I was very few. But it's just not meant for theaters. Maybe for a short half hour, but I don't see how they can make a short kiddie book in a whole feature film. <br /> <br /> This is a cute movie, but I would only recommend it to many small children. Older children won't be interested. Adults can have a little more interest when they look at their little ones. But any age of 7-adult will have a snorkel festival. <br /> <br /> Sorry if you disagree, but that's my opinion. :)
