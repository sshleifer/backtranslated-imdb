A good coach but had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a team of no hope; the star player who has a row with the coach; the assistant coach with an alcohol problem, the little guy being kicked to kick the winning car; the whole town against the coach (all but the front lady). This is the old story - straight from the British comics, where a team of species geeks and fatter take the Brazilian football and winners. <br /> <br /> This movie, albeit good, is full of these clich√©s. The only part I didn't predict was when the star player suddenly decided at the village meeting to be with the coach. No reason has ever been given. It was like a very strange thing to see that everything was so far. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy. <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays a dressing room Popey Doyle. I'm sure Dennis Hopper's caliber actor found nothing extremely challenging about his role. The same can be said about Barbara Hershey. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie full of cliches could be done much better than it was.
