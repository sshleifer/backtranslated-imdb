Lou Gossett, Jr. is an excellent and engaging actor, but to take him the role of a "president" and then act as he is James Bond, running to carry a gun and entering a warehouse to uncover a plot to kill Christians. , and then being able to escape the supposedly high security facility to live another day, does not do him justice - this movie has so many unresolved issues. <br /> <br /> I will try to list just a few: <br /> 1 - what was the purpose of storing a vaccine if no one was vaccinated? - For example, the minister could have been vaccinated if the "tribulation force" had already had vaccine at hand - later Williams's wife went with the sick minister and became ill herself; So, was the virus infected? - If it was contagious, why did Ray and his wife go to church without proper protection? - Why didn't they get sick? - And when Chloe drank the wine and was "healed", how did she suddenly know the wine was the "antidote"? - Was it California wine, plain red wine? - Can Red Grape Juice suffice - and if the minister had a community at least every time he preached, might he have already flown through his body? - Bok and Chloe had a "heavy" subject subject that was never used - what mysterious message should we see in it? <br /> <br /> 2 - Presenting "evil" powers working with the Antichrist Nicolai to destroy the world, such as Russian, Chinese, etc., is truly a relic of the 1950s and the former James Bond era, and shows ignorance of modern society and of humanity - should we believe that Russians and Chinese are constantly trying to destroy this planet? - and for what purpose, mere destruction? - It was such a wise view of this world and was so clich√© as to laugh. <br /> <br /> 3 - the main purpose of this movie was the scene near the end where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett, Jr. renounce the non-believers in the audience (by showing Kirk's prediction). It was a movie without meaningful story, too much disconnected with reality and a completely inappropriate plot for a good actor. <br /> <br /> I therefore rank it as 1, since Zero is not available
