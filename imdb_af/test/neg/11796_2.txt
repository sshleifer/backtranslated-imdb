There is a very repetitive dialogue in this movie about "cold spots" (indicating the presence of a ghost) and characters surrounding themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the movie, I will make repeated references to cold spots during this review. I have worse movies than the st. Francisville experiment seen, but it may be the most * forgotten * one of all ("it gets cold!") In general, some 20s spend the night in a haunted house. It is filmed as a so-called true documentary. Of course this is not really, but the house does contain cold spots. SPOILERS- (as if you can't predict most of the plot!). Not much happens in this movie. We have the ancient horror cliche of a cat jumping near the beginning of the hiding, as an "exercise" afraid to warm up the audience. The people wander around with flashlights, sometimes they take a moment to remind the house that they are coming in peace - it does not mean evil to the spirits (or cold spots). Occasionally a door is swinging and someone is scared. Of course, the ouija board makes an appearance. They talk to a ghost called "Charles". A girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach in it. More cold spots. Another door swung and a guy went over the sound of the door. Scuff, scuff, he says. Oh my god, somebody says. "Surround yourself with white light." I admit there is a good scene on the attic (where a chair is beaten by a ghost) that really caught me. But apart from a funny bad dialogue, the chair scene (the real split second when it's beaten, nothing immediately before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this movie. However, there are still a few cold places here. Eventually the movie ends. Nobody dies. No further details required. I wasn't a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, but it looks like a masterpiece along the St. FRANCISVILLE experiment. You may find that you are not debating whether this is a true documentary, but whether it was meant to be funny. I still don't know. But whatever it was, failed.
