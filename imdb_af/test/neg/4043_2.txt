This movie was so stupid I couldn't believe what I saw when I saw it, it was like a big train wreck. I couldn't look away because it was just as horrible! I can honestly say I've never seen such a bad thing in my life. It was so cheesy and the acting was just as regrettable that I just thought. "It should just be a joke, right? Nobody would actually make a movie the right way?" I really hope this is all just a bad joke and these people don't really expect people to face it with a straight face and I really hope that the people in this movie are acting in the right way and actually don't believe they are good actors?! The draw queen is quite funny to watch, and so are the special special effects of a bad 80-slide movie. <br /> <br /> Just look at this if you've already seen all the other movies. exist first and there is nothing more to see! I would give it a "0" if possible.
