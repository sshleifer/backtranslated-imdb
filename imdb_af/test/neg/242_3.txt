With the dialogue in the baptized version of this movie, I don't think Shakespeare is in any great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy that was created. His stuff was taken and it really threw him off. He seems to know who does this, though he is a mischievous, surprising entity. I loved the two dull men telling how the mummy was found and the doctor determined to destroy the creature. There are all these scenes in this ridiculous cemetery, full of cheap crosses and other rubbish. There is a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. I can't start reproducing the idiot of this, including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown (there's a door next to him so he can crawl) to the robot, a lot of metal cans with a man inside. The dialogue is terrible. There is a long break between speeches, as if someone is leaving, feeding their lines. I love the scene where the two little children charge their mother for going out at night (she goes into this zombie state or something). However, if you are looking for a movie that you can laugh at and never take seriously, watch it. First, keep some beer. Like a straight line from the mummy's tomb, "Look here and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink." What else can I say?
