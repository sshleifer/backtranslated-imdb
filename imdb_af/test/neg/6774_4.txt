Fortunately, a brief mystery about a telephone operator is being discovered as the kidnapped daughter of a railroad magnate. The discovery brings an end to her life, filled by Charlie Ruggles as a "crime reflector". Things are turning to the dangerous when everyone gets into the title scene and another attempt is made to do the girls' lives. Your enjoyment of this movie will depend on your tolerance for Rugggles and its nonsense. I usually like Ruggles, but there was something about this role that rubbed me the wrong way. Actually, I think it didn't help that the riddle wasn't very good, so there was nothing outside the characters to make you look. Yes, the final on the train was exciting, but it didn't make up for everything that had gone before. Not worth looking for, but if you stumble, give it a try.
