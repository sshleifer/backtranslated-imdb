An airplane with a rich scientist's daughter goes into the thick wilderness. He meets a group to get her and the others, but the rescue party soon thinks there's something they stole. Then the front motifs for the expedition are revealed and it only adds to the already existing tension. <br /> <br /> The movie is a decent idea and an assumption on the popular Sasquatch legend was sooner or later. But the film's direction breaks a fundamental rule of horror / thriller directing and it shows too much too soon. Of course the audience knows there is something the characters stalk, just read the title! But what had to be the movie's kicker that spoiled most of the tensions early and, as a direct result, a lot of fun. The film also does not have a good atmosphere and there are hardly any wilderness landscapes, but there are many sampling views that add nothing to anything. They are actually shamelessly 'Predator'. The low-budget horror movie "Wendigo" did what this movie is trying to do much better. <br /> <br /> Some of the character tension and a non-clich√© end make it possible to stand up for this rise above the scratch stack, but it's still poor and gives the starting point and potential, many disappointing. --- 4/10 <br /> Valuated R for some violence and curse, but it's pretty tame compared to most R-rated horror.
