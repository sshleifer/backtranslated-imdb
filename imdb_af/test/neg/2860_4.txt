Child's Play made a new genre of horror, THE KILLER DOLLS, Some of these movies don't have too much money to make it, but I think the only movie that makes shadow for Chucky is that. It is a typical product directly for making video or going to TV, but Pinocchio is not and the killer is the girl. The imagination of children is too big and this movie plays with it. Those roles are good and Candance Mckenzie is good. <br /> <br />
