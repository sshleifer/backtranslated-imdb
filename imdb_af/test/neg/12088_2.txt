The government was by far a very keen film. I don't use this word loosely because it was frankly a bad excuse for a movie. I finished watching this feature with just one word on my head? "Why?" Honestly, you can use this question at the end of every scene of this movie and it seems to fit. There were so many inconsistencies that led to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) that eventually led to a very confusing film, with actors running through the movements, rather than giving any explanation. Scenes will occur without pre-shadowing, understanding or a complete end. It was as if I had looked at some different ideas without really making a decision. Actors have set up events that do not suit their character or are really solved. This was my biggest problem with this movie. The complete and complete lack of structure for this film has crumbled all the foundations of the foundation, with the result that a true "wrinkle effect" is felt by the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Let me further explain this lack of consistency throughout the film. I would compare this movie with a bowl of fatty oatmeal that had a zebra in it. It had no sense, and there was no logic behind it either. Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this deed. Her character's lines are very vague and drawn almost transparently. She will do things like always talking to her sister about sex, but she is always open to sexual experiences. She has her first moment of passion in this movie, and there is no pain or excitement. It suddenly happens, and it doesn't seem to fit the original conversation we had at the start of the movie with Rosina and her sister. She is a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention? It was confusing and completely random. Isn't it clear to anyone else that her teaching methods didn't exist. Anyone in their right mind could see that she didn't teach Cavendish's daughter anything. The sudden and uncomfortable relationship formed randomly between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers made me laugh aloud. I thought maybe I discovered some magic in this movie when Rhys-Meyers literally poofed in the scene and suddenly caused an unnecessary drama. It felt that the director (or author) thought that the original story had gone nowhere, so adding this random character could disturb the plot a bit (or confuse the smaller movie enthusiasts). Well, it didn't blow me, I saw that he was almost a "cut and paste" character used to strengthen an already weakened story. Don't start me at the end, which doesn't have the concept of the rest of the story. With the "cut-and-paste" method, the author of this movie had a way to just end the story, and that was the only solution they could come to. It's sad when actors are forced to do things out of character ?? but I think this is the name of the game in Hollywood. Recovery until completely broken, or at least recyclable. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story was undecided dribble. There might have been a handful of neat cinematic moments where you could see that there was a creative creativity trying to go along with some nice, decent, periodic music, but nothing to write to grandmother. More family structure with a few stronger introductions could have strengthened this movie a little more, but as I said earlier, you will experience a crack in your foundation by laying open plays just across the film. What looks like a solid story will eventually diminish over time, and by the end of this movie I felt the house crumbling on top of me. Wilkinson plays his normal self in this movie, while the driver doesn't seem to want to get naked, but everyone also has (I'll see a doctor after the images are burned in my eyes?). Also, she wore the same dress every day. It was disgusting and I could smell her through the television. Sex and dirty laundry. Now there's a good movie for you! There was only one potential to drive around here, but it was just rubbish. Nothing was answered, questions looked like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity looked like a rule. <br /> <br /> Overall, it could be a decent movie that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but rather it was just unfortunate. I cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters go through movements without any explanation. I didn't hand me cinematic moments like a child, but something had to be done to build a foundation. Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy I used. If you were as confused as I was, you will understand the movie The Governess completely, while if you prefer zebra in your oatmeal? then this movie might be for you! <br /> <br /> Degree: * Off *****
