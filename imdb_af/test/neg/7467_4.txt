Not a terrible movie - my 10 year old son loved it, and he would be the demographic target, so I think they hit the spot. Very dim for an adult already. <br /> <br /> Difficulty talking to animated lego characters, even to high tech ones. <br /> <br /> I thought choosing the three great virtues of the Bionicle world was a bit odd - unity, duty, and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks it sounds a bit fascinating? Especially destination. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.? <br /> <br /> Oh, this will sell Lego. Kind of dull for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute ad. Could have been much worse.
