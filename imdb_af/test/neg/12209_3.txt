As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I can't claim this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I've ever seen. One problem I see is that the scope of the novel calls for a few minutes of a few hours, rather than a regular movie. It's just impossible to capture a significant amount of events in two hours. I don't enjoy the exaggerated setback format. It was incompatible and would be impossible for someone who did not know the story to fully understand. I also don't think the filmmakers correctly interpreted Copperfield's personality. The idea of ​​him walking on a beach that stinks of his life seems inconsistent with the proactive, forward-thinking nature that Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes also bothered me. She came as a home-like decoration, rather than a strong woman. But Dora was perfect. This movie was full of trouble, and I'm eagerly waiting for someone to make a decent screen version.
