Crazy director .... Yeah, you gotta be crazy to make a close movie. Rob Lowe was bad in his character, Ice-t was always bad and Burt Reynolds had nothing to do with the movie. Crazy six is ​​an unknown movie, with some well-known actors ... it's pretty strange. A bad movie with some good actors in it. The bad movie seems to have had an impact on their performance. Mal people ..... I give it * and a half out *****
