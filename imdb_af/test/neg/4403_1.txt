A Brazilian cable television offers "Yadon Ilaheyya" in his "Cult" channel this month. I saw the trailer and listened to the ad and decided to watch this movie. Indeed, it is an absurd, boring, pretentious, blunt, inextricably detached shit about the conflict in the Middle East, and with Soultangler it's definitely the worst movies I've tried. I really wasted forty-three minutes of my life, looking at the first half of this crap, highly indicated for the torture of enemies. How can this movie be awarded and nominated for prizes including in Cannes? My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Intervenção Divina" ("Divine Intervention")
