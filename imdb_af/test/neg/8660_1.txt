What a crappy movie! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and raised in Canada, but he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or uday gay in this movie? Also, do all the chicks in Canada do dresses like ditches? At least this is how it is in this movie. All females are dressed as slips. Don't waste your time with this one! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. Wonder why Bollywood is going through a slump? This is because of movies like this. I miss the good old days when Hindi movies were actually entertained! I couldn't even finish this movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood should stop trying to repeat Hollywood's style because it just doesn't work out. They have to stay with their roots because it makes Indian movies entertain.
