Oh, but it's angry. One good actor after another turned in a sad dialogue underneath which had to be incredibly pedestrianized to consider it acceptable. I love Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley is one of my favorite actresses, Tom Courtney can do well when he is pushed and David Suchet is a professional person of the highest integrity, but they are all around like fish in a barrel of water. overturned. I swear that Courtney was in possession of painkillers or both. <br /> <br /> Was there a good thing in the whole thing? Well, David Hood as the junior underground engineer whose partner washed away seemed to take the matter seriously and give him credit for it. It may not be easy if "everywhere they lose" to speak, or perhaps his plays came under the guidance of the assistant director (if there was one), I do not know what these people are doing in a movie like this poor were not (other than paying the bills, of course) I can't begin to say how disappointed I am in them. YOU MUST BE PROTECTED FROM YOURSELF! <br /> <br /> Any other positive than David Hood the third ... yes. London's aerial photographs were largely submerged, and the effects of the artists earned better than dividing their good work by such a level story. If you forgive the expression, if the few people they see will do it on a much smaller screen than it will be. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? Why do British filmmakers try to imitate such characterless, spectacular, tabloid genres as the disaster movie and then even worse than the Americans do. Eager realism, character integrity, capturing true emotion in a way that makes you feel and caring ... The Family Way, Spring and Port Wine, Get Carter, The Long Good Friday, Trainspotting .... Don't Get It. I'm wrong I like a little escapist loft. The real "Italian Job", the adventures of Tom Jones; but oh it should come after that, there was more realistic drama in Carry On Camping.
