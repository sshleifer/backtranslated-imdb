Enter the Ninja (1981) was the first of several "Ninja" movies produced by Cannon lead roles or fellow star Japanese sensation Sho Kosugi. But the star of the first "Ninja" movie was the legendary tough old Franco Nero. Unfortunately, Mr. Nero or Sho Kosugi does not see this movie. If you have two bad dudes in an action movie and it's not watches or fun, it's wrong. But I deviated. Skip this chapter and look at the following movies in the series. They are more interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Next is Revenge of the Ninja. Instead of playing the "evil oriental" (I use that term in your cheek). He's the star! Strange for a Western movie. Hold the one instead. <br /> <br /> Not recommended except for the hard Sho Kosugi fans or Cannon movie buffs.
