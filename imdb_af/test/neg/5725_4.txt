This film was released shortly after the Conan films, a kind of woman Conan, Red Sonja, played by Sylvester Stallones, former wife, Brigitte Nielsen. Unfortunately, she is not a very good actress, as shown in Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole movie feels cheap, but Arnold Swarzenegger appears strange in this movie, but not as Conan, although he looks, acts and fights like Conan from the two Conan films, I don't know what it's all about. Anyway, he appears about every twenty minutes and doesn't hang long. Maybe Arnold filmed it in his time from the filming of Conan the Destroyer or something? Anyway, the movie is a way to slow and sow an action movie, skip it and watch Conan the Barbarian instead.
