This movie was terrible. I thought it would be fine, but it just got worse and worse. Some of the gimmicks seem to be heading to another safe predictable rom-com, but the moment he gets home, it's just being dissolved. None of the characters have any depth and the only person who was close to credibility was Tom, although the way he so easily distracted, just annoyed me after a while. The dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film is virtually non-existent. In an abusive attempt at comedy, the author / director introduces a new character or event into virtually every scene. Neither is realistic, and it makes it very confusing to keep up with what's going on. The plot is hardly an excuse for a movie: man loves girl, home sits fathers' house to get to know girl, home, get girl. A complete waste of time.
