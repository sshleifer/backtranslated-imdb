Anna Kokkinos 'success with' Head On 'now seems to be entirely dependent on the script and Alex Dimitriades' good lead performance. The extent to which this latest, "The Book of Revelation" is both derivative, pretentious, and totally inexorable (except for Tristan Milani's fine cinematography) seems to convey it. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there have been quite a few Aussie movies dealing with such themes, some in the 1970s and 1980s and beyond, which have affected sexism (and / or explicit sex scenes). It is worth looking at this piece of fluff again. Of course, the whole thing sticks to the ballet world and makes it all painfully slow (and in its choreography, like a 1960s Dutch ballet experimental number) presents Great Art if you haven't traveled much - and then only if you never have gone as Art Theory 101. <br /> <br /> Add to the pretense, terrible arch dialogue ("you will do as we command ...") and the whole shebang fall on his well-funded face. Then there are the 'sexy' bits: straight from Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Given the beautiful but rounded show by Colin Friels - how about a true over-thrilling thriller? <br /> <br /> All in all, with the book of Revelation, the feminist project has been restored for another decade - and with the willing and deeply imitative (from male writers like Henry Miller, William Burroughs, even Bukowski) some collections in Melbourne, Oz, suffer from some form of educational and ideological amnesia! No revelations await us here.
