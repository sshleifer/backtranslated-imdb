I read the book after I saw the movie and didn't care for it, I found it a little sad; But trashy books often make good movies, and this one certainly has. The story of a teenage girl's exploration of her attractive power over boys, which she finds irresistibly stimulating as it is dubiously manageable, and which has an even tighter grip on her than it would be on a normal girl because it through her werewolf-the story will have a clear appeal to the young audience for what movies are made: an attraction of one kind for girls and of a different kind for boys: and I do not understand how the filmmakers blind can be and do not turn the story into one with a small appeal to anyone. <br /> <br /> To begin with, take the title (which is the best of the book): it is drawn from a Hesse quote, also used as an epigraph, about a person in fear running and tasting blood and chocolate in his mouth, one tasting as bad as the other. It is a wonderful metaphor for the heroine's state: torn between her human and wolf-like sides, each of which is equally scary. The movie rinses with the epigraph, and places the character working in her aunt's chocolate shop! I can understand how the title of the book to the filmmakers could have portrayed the erotic loaded chocolate of "Like Water for Chocolate" and linked them to the same symbol for werewolves. But they did not; so why is it in the movie? In the book, the characters in high school - whether in and out, like the Five, are a teenage girl who prefers black jeans and T-shirts, and falls somewhere between the heroine's nemeses and her pet tendon. In the film they became decadent twenty-something club-goers. In the book, the heroine is 16 years old, only to discover how her sexuality works on the boy she wants, as well as herself; she is the one who starts the contact, then walks back, reinvention, et cetera. In the movie she is no longer a girl, but a woman, and the man is no longer a high school poet living on the edge of campus, but a refugee of the law (and a comic book artist, start), it is he who rises up for her, in a way as unattractive as that of her worm-cousin. She initially puts him off, but admits, because he is confident that she wants: hey, you know you want it. I would have thought a female director would have had the opportunity to present the book to show a female protagonist in an unfinished, proactive role; but no. <br /> <br /> In the book, the heroine's clan is driven away from their home because of the Five's criminal behavior; In the movie it's because she went for a ride (!). She is a good runner, prone to kick off building walls, and she and his clone on scale buildings in a trice; much like heroes of martial arts movies and very different from wolves, or something they look like. In the book they do not change into real wolves, but things that are greater than wolves; In the movie they are just ordinary wolves. In the book, they metamorphose in "crying" style, with nodding spines; This is one of the things that the heroine is aware of the pain her body brings, as well as the pleasure. In the movie, the werewolves are magical acrobats, take large swans and transform into the middle of the air, glittering yellow like Tinker-Bell; It looks cool, doesn't mean anything. <br /> <br /> In this book, the clan is a slightly white-trashy family who moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the film they live in Bucharest, but everyone speaks in different accents, not Romanian. In the book, almost the whole pack wants to lead normal lives and agree that to ensure that - and indeed, their survival - is one of the necessities to keep their true nature secret from people. And so the characters remain in the movie; Yet the head of the tribe is a kind of underground boss - but apparently not a crime boss, as he despises criminals - and has a permanent deal with the police providing him with "meat" for the suit. It seems a great exception to the rule of letting people know; but perhaps the police are considered safe because of their familiar tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder. <br /> <br /> At the end of the book, the heroine teaches she can't be something she isn't when, in his attempt to live a divided life, she gets stuck between human and animal states. can not be one thing or the other. Her boyfriend is not sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the parcel cannot endanger him and the two are forced to divorce. In the film she saves him like Lassie, and they drive to Paris (why Paris?), In an end that is smiley-face, but not really happy, since the conflict between their nature - between _her_ natures remains unresolved. <br /> <br /> But the difference in the most enjoyable movie is that while the book characters are traditionally acting within the realm of young adult novels, those in the movie are for some reason as annoying as possible. Every other line is a threat or another kind of oneupsmanship: you will be sorry; you do not belong here; you will not get rid of me; I gave you your chance; etc. I prefer to prevent people from doing so. <br /> <br /> There were very good vampire movies, never a good werewolf effect. If this one was held in the book, it might be the first. <br /> <br /> But no.
