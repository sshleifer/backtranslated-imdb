While the movie was beautifully shot and performed reasonably well, the screenplay was dull. plodding and nothing we haven't seen yet. Not once in this movie have I ever felt that these people were really in danger. No noticeable climax and very standard resolution. I believe these movies are exaggerated and must be given a rest. After all, didn't everyone see the planet "Schindler's List"?
