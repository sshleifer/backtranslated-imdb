I've heard of Ali G in Madonna's music video "Music". I always think he's funny. (In fact, he's really.) Just last year I always thought about buying a Ali G Indahouse VCD. That's why I buy it cheaply, and I started looking at it. <br /> <br /> But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I were planning to be a big, laughing comedy. It seems that "Indahouse" is just a blunt piece of garbage. It was really bad. It also contains explicit sexuality content and very rough humor. It also didn't make me laugh, even just a big smile. We definitely hate that movie. Oh, by the way, I have plans to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali G was very different in his film compared to his TV shows - in such a negative way. Maybe he wasn't really focused and serious enough to make this movie. Just because there are a few sex scenes in it doesn't mean it is freaking hilarious (because it is sometimes too much, it's no longer laughable). For the first time I was disappointed. It really made me happy and happy. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 more than 10. Actually I really want to give it 0 rating. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I would not recommend anyone who wants to see good comedies that are not too explicit or terrible.
