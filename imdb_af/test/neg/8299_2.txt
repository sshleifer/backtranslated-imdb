Okay, if you like your monster moovies, stiff, starchy, and thundering, but with lots of acceleration, then go right to Lady Frankenstein, a sturdy, costume Italian runner. Joseph Cotten ("Citizen Kane") plays the crisp old Baron himself, and really needed to make the condo payment. Sexy Sarah Bay, who played in newspaper lessons European B films, usually like Rosabla Neri, including Hercules Against the Moon Men, plays his ambitious daughter, a ruffled prom dress surgeon. Cotten makes an ugly monster with big head (cud, it really is so much trouble to make a nice one?), Which ran Cotten (who took his check of the royalties) and wandered all over the face to suffocate. Tania (Bay) decides to change the brain of her lover (who is old and wrinkled) with the brain of a younger man (who is "nice" but stooopid) to make another monster to the first monster Cotten to choke, wandering around to hide people. Well, after much exposition, and a little choking, the 2 monsters pitch for a bit, Tania sticks the first monster back, and then sex in the flaming ruins of her home with the second monster - just around him to let her smother! Do! There is so much splash that you have generally overlooked that the film is as exciting as a dead carp, and just as fast moving. The Alpha video version I saw was heavily edited, and one wonders that cow has been cut off many necklaces, not that it has much improved the movie. Director von Theurmer has previously helped a variety of grade Z-euro refuse, including "Jungle Warriors", "Island of the Dead" (like Mel Wells) and "The Crucified Girls of San Ramon". The MooCow says avoid this look from a movie, and find something going in the moors of a full ... acceleration. <br /> <br /> = 8)
