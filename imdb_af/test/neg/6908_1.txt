Hello - I usually like movies. I'm 19, I've seen a lot and don't like one or two. This one, but the second I finished, had to put my sister (who wanted to see it) out of the arm and jumped into the tears as soon as I got out because it was such a ridiculous horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Why was it awful: - all the cows had udders, especially the MALE kids were having udders - none of the characters was unique or tempting, except perhaps the most important Coyote Day - the idea Keeping cows looking at cages is just ridiculous - the 'funny' moments are repetitive and just become a drive to go out - do the last one. The themes of working together, which had to be present at the end, were inconsistent. Instead, people get the impression: Well, I'll take it all on myself, and in this case I was fortunate that my friends decided to repair me without my knowledge - all the moments similar to the lion king (like listed below) was beyond fever, even for a kid's movie <br /> <br /> and ... worst of all ... It embodies the lion king in every way. Responsible father figure murdered by Coyotes (the Coyotes are essentially The Hyenas, with Dag, the chief Coyote, is the equivalent of Scar. The farm falls into chaos, Odis (the cow, though basically Simba) wants to play around and is shocked that his father is dead, believe it is his fault even though it is his fault in this movie, confronts the Coyotes and gets a donkey who visits, after which Dag tells him to leave, and on the verge of departure Odis decides to go somehow and save chicks and his friends back. up (of course he surprises, he goes without knowing that they will help him). <br /> <br /> Other things taken from Lion King: stars moving around as signs, father figures refer to stars / signs in a mystically loving way, the natural caution of how father Ben Odis got and cared for, and how Odis's love interest will eventually give birth and he has a similar experience. Birth at the end? GOOD GOD, what the hell ... and even similar music, which is completely over, because it is completely different from all the previous music. Honestly, this is the first movie I have ever seen where I was really rooted for the bad people - I never understood what other people have said so far. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Don't waste your time watching it. Convince the children not to see it and look at the Lion King again. Or, or take them to see the Ant Bully, which was creative and artistic.
