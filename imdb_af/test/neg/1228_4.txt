I, like many people, believe the 1989 epic Lonesome Dove was one of the best Western ever produced, perhaps the best. And realize that most successors (in this case, a prequel) surely disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon meets the expectation with its marginal direction and acting, poorly decisive and honest, a lousy script. <br /> <br /> Lonesome Dove created Western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call because of incredible performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Before living in Lonesome Dove, we believed they fought bravely to get Texas out of bandits and wild Indians during their years of running. <br /> <br /> Once I saw Comanche Moon, I would think these two leg heads were a few incompetent, cowardly idiots. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae presumably chased Blue Duck all over Texas and never managed to catch or kill him. In Comanche Moon, a shot after Call's shoelace convinced him to settle and obtain cattle. There wasn't a decent fist fight or gunfire in the whole miniseries. The best punch was McCrea sucker punching Inez Scull, a funny scene, but out of character for McCrae. <br /> <br /> Where was McCrae's wit and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunken, unshaven slut and filander was absolutely indisputable. And Maggie's love for Call, a passionate and sloppy single, has a logic. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was excellent, better than the original. Credit is not just about HD technology, but the movie maker. The Comanche Moon miniseries were better than anything else on TV for three nights, but unfortunately it doesn't say much.
