Oh, what a disappointment this movie is. I can't believe it was directed by Wajda. There is virtually no plot and 90% of the movie consists of several people walking inside and out of the screen, trying hard to talk to each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes to an end, but by that time I just stopped caring while trying to suppress my gift. <br /> <br /> Almost the whole movie is filmed with a hand-held camera, which is supposed to convey the sense of "personal immediacy", but there is nothing personal or immediate about most of the movies. Instead, the constant snap of the camera made my seasick. To be honest, there are also good shots (no pun intended), but nothing that lets you go, "Wow!" <br /> <br /> If you're not familiar with the Katyn massacre, the movie will leave you scratching your head. If you are familiar, you will also scratch your head, though for various reasons. Actually, the film says and repeats that it was the Soviets who killed thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point is repeatedly hammered as if someone in the audience had to be convinced of this basic historical fact. However, the film never tries to explain why they were killed. After all, ten thousands of Polish soldiers in other Soviet POW camps have not been damaged and were released in 1941. This is never sufficiently explained. How many people died, although the figure is thrown 20,000 in a few times. <Br /> <br /> The play is adequate with only Komorowska (old woman) and Chyra (Lt. Jerzy) who perform remarkable performances, but they can act in total for 10-15 minutes. Certainly not enough to carry the whole movie. Many other actors look more chosen because their matinee looks rather than their acting abilities, but I won't call their names. It's enough to say they're definitely NOT the Oscar material, so any allegations that this movie is "robbed" of the Academy Award is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie is also wrong. On the one hand, it tries to be an accurate historical drama, on the other hand it falls into cheap anti-Soviet propaganda, as a Russian soldier tears the Polish flag and uses it to clean his boots. Then there are some mysterious scenes that have absolutely no influence on the plot, such as a couple climbing on a roof or the liquidation of the University of Krakow. <br /> <br /> There are many opportunities to make this movie more interesting. , like adding a political angle to the story, or showing the German discovery of the graves or even depicting Anna's journey from the Soviet-occupied part of the German occupied Krakow. All of these things could have been the bulk of the movie, but instead they are reduced to a few minutes. In the end, we get a collection of loose, confusing, boring scenes about Poland's reaction to one of their greatest tragedies of World War II. Not very compelling and not worthy of Wajda.
