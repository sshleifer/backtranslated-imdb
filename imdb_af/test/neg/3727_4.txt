OK, if I was in the rental shop and someone asked me if the movie was worth three dollars for the rent, I would have to say no. The plot was unreliable. I came to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves could not act. He can sometimes be painful to look at (although my wife thinks he's cute). Then Aykroyd (who is usually big) was even a bit disappointing than the crooked head. On the positive side, the plot (because it is far-fetched) is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
