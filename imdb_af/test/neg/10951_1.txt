First, I'm a big fan of crap movies. B grade is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately, this movie is just bad. I dressed as a zombie for a party and my makeup looks better than that in this movie. Especially the big man in the beginning, it just looked like a child with the crayon pulled on his face. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad I don't have to comment on why. The effect is also very amateurish, with obvious blood tubes a straight ray of blood from the back of the zombie heads when they are shot. <br /> <br /> Also, many commenting on this movie seem to be trying to improve the rating. No one without their finger in the circle will rate this movie above a 5/10. Frankly, it's scandalous that people who worked on this movie increase their ratings. <br /> <br /> I suggest everyone avoids this movie, it's not worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life. <br /> Absolutely terrible.
