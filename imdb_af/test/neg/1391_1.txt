Carlos Mencia is simply not funny! His performance is painful to watch. His sketches / parodies are all very awful, and it really feels like a stuffing for the Chapelle Show, which, while not a big fan of it, is much funnier than this trash. Carlos Mencia gives the silly speeches and he hangs too many of his monologues with a delayed voice and goes "there, there." It's just not funny. He often makes words when he speaks to others. They are terrible and painful. When people don't laugh, he blames them ... why would anyone laugh, he's not funny. He has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show. It's amazing that everyone but 3 year olds watch it. One of my least favorite things he does is water in every subject and make it a joke! I hope this racist idiot will be taken away as soon as possible because he is immersing a station that should no longer be obscured.
