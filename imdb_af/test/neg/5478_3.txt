Certainly, the concept has already been done with Alf and the Charmings: the modern society printed on one or more out-of-place characters. But I loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990. When I learned about Scorch, I was really very hopeful for something new, as new TVs in the 90s have not impressed me so far (but at least Star Trek: TNG and the Simpsons were still in progress.) /> <br /> What I got was a great disappointment. The acting was terrible, but given the ridiculous dialogue and utterly incredible writing, I couldn't blame them for what they had to do. There were some humorous moments, but most of the deliberate jokes were forced into their delivery. The whole production work on the show was too low for the TV that was on television at the time. In the 80's it would be right. <br /> <br /> However, it was the first episode and the characters had to be introduced and the whole premise of the series established. So I gave it the benefit of the doubt. The second episode was not that bad, and I got my hope that once it was in its fight, the performance would improve. Unfortunately, my videographer did not record the third episode, I never saw it and the series then disappeared from the TV list. All I have now is the first two episodes recorded from the air on a VHS band.
