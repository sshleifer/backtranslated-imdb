Chupacabra Terror: 2/10: It was the Navy Seal team who typed the balance of bad cheese film to just bad. Until then, there were many bad movies, but the stamps ?? They wear bicycle helmets painted black. You know the one with air holes that every adult they wear looks like a complete tool. Of course, the bass fishing boat they took to greet the ship might have been another idea (it won't leave it over Tampa Bay, let alone an ocean)? and their tactics will not succeed on a 3rd XBOX game. <br /> <br /> Did director John Shepphird take pictures of John Rhys-Davies in a compromise position with a Hobbit? Because I can't think of any other reason, he'll be in this movie. The other actors have a big excuse. They are talented unattractive hacks that cannot be hired for an infomercial. The plot is that two men are trying to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra (Love that name) on board a ship and it gets loose. <br /> <br /> The sets consist of horrible shipwreck (complete with airshafts the size of a small apartment), the monster murders are below the barrel, there is no nudity, and really bad actors refuse to complete death. Of particular annoyance is a gigolo character from a 60-year-old Doris Day movie. <br /> <br /> The molded bleeding ketchup while the Chupacabra blossom day glows in the dark blood. (Why a goat that eats Mexican mammal will bloom, but red is past me.) Every B movie has a point that makes it a fun time (Hey this is a lesbian shower scene, OMG just ate that guy are own eyeballs or not so nice (Did they just mention those forty something overweight guys who picked suitcases and bicycle helmets Navy Seals)? Chupacabra falls into the non-tasty B-movie side with a drop.
