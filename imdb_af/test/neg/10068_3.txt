Although it comes to three Star Wars, Krull and innumerable others, this movie will be outdated in the 1950s ... 1 SFX mostly consists of the 1970 video games such as bolts etc; irritating after a short while. You also get an SFX creature that looks like a poor man's version of a level IV Harryhausen monster. <br /> <br /> 2 sets are mostly rural ruins, with paper-mache temples and miniature cities or dwellings making 1950's Japanese monster movies look like flawless perfection. <br /> <br /> 3 Plot is extra thin ... Hercules must get Zeus's seven gold thunder balls stolen by the conspiracy of god and zombie tyrants. <br /> <br /> 4 action consists mainly of delayed, muscular Hercules (look at the variety of facial expressions) that affect the cheap 1970s games effects. <br /> <br /> 5 acting awards go to Milly Carlucci (third Carlucci show-biz sister with Anna & Gabriella), who says everything. <br /> <br /> 6 SFX makes other tiger II Italian salad bowls like L'UMANOIDE & STAR CRASH look like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Well, considering that Ferrigno's main exploitation existed in the embodiment of a delayed green monster, with a whig and green espadrillas, we must be indulgent. <br /> <br /> Watch and forget about it.
