Being a fan of hospital and medical programs, I found this one grabbing and sometimes humorous (especially the scenes with Dr Whitman) that brought a little light relief. However, I was looking forward to the last episode because I expected the bad people to be punished and the goods to be restored. Instead of this, hospital management makes even more foolishness of themselves in an incredible way and it gets worse and worse for good. You can't help wondering what the unions are doing or not, Rob, Donna and Maria know what unions are there? In addition, the outside, trees, grass, sunlight are a bit oppressive. Anyone understood what the last words were? ie the answer Rob Lake gave to Mrs. Strawberry's children have asked, "Why do we tell all this?" It was very frustrating not to understand it.
