Everything everyone has said is quite a lot of rings when it comes to 'The Prey'. Endless nature movement, bad play. In addition to these elements, it is a viewable movie for painters who in some cases are considered a cult classic. Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan play pretty well apart. . There is also a three minute banjo solo showing Bostwick's skill behind the instrument. Not as bad as I say it myself. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of the movie is the saving grace. The end still holds me to this day. It can also play a momentous plus, because early John Carl Bucheler does the special effects. Some may know him from films like 'Troll' and 'Friday the 13th part 7 - He directed both of these films. All in all, it's not a movie, everyone will solve something. In fact, it is on Hollywood level can stand up with one of the businesses' most amateur efforts, but even for the handy (but very loyal) movie fans in the world, even the bad plays and horrific natural movements can forgive be.
