After giving Loomis a quick repetition of Micheal Myers, we slipped back to 1989 where Jamie was kidnapped by the Black Man before the burning police station exploded. Micheal returns to Haddonfeild to find Jamie and his baby. In this version, the Loomis character gets more scenes and looks much more proactive than he is in the final track. The score is much better, more in line with parts 4 and 5, not one of the electric guitar BS. And the end makes a little more sense. For these reasons, along with the fact that this track has more characterization and tension, and looking back at the gore factor (Halloween, unlike the "Friday the 13th" Franschise, was never about blatant ones), why do I prefer this bootleg Manufacturer. Not to mention that the cut changes a turd in gold, just brush the turd a bit and make it more understandable. The whole cult plot is still very stupid, as Micheal is a child <br /> <br /> My Producer's Cutting Board: C- <br /> <br /> My Theatrical Track Degree: D-
