This film comes from my friends mom who worked in a charity shop. She gave it to us with a load of other unknown cassettes. The movie itself is a bit of garbage. There are a few notable pieces to laugh like the little girl penetrates her head, but in general the film is faint. Interstingly, when I saw the trailer for "The Island", I couldn't help the deal. Clonus might have been the inspiration for that movie? All in all, it does not make it difficult to watch this movie because it is boring and boring. We really enjoyed it when we were 16, and we called our band after that. Another sign this movie is a bit crappy is the shots on the back of the video case not actually appearing in the movie? strange
