This movie would be a great piece of history if it was actually a real movie of the Kennedy assassination. There are too many mistakes in this movie to show me. This is a film of the Kennedy assassination, but many of the important facts have changed. There are missing scenes, and many of the scenes, after the president's limo passes the sign, don't fit. Both Kennedys move noticeably slower than the other four people in front of them. The next time you watch this movie, look at things that don't add up, like the Texas Gov. And she, along with the SS men in the front, forward, but you can see that the limo doesn't stop or slow down, in fact it's accelerated. This movie is clearly an attempt to make a cover.
