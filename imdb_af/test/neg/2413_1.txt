So I give it one star for true quality, but I give it half an hour for pure enjoyment. An amazingly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilant thriller, "Young Warriors" is just the kind of bad movie you will usually find if you go around the video edge, but so rarely do. It starts with about half an hour of shaky chickens, sexworms and juvenile shenanigans (including an olive in the martini joke that should be seen as not believed). Then the main character's younger sister gets gang raped by a bunch of heavy riders (an offensive scene that likes me giving it a 10 for entertainment value - rape is not entertaining!), And the main character gets the rest of his Six crazy brothers to help him clean the city, find the responsible cyclists, and kill anyone who is a criminal on the road. <br /> <br /> It's hilarious, non-stop fun, apart from the very unpleasant rape scene, and is essential for any serious bad movie fan. Trust me - I have put my time on this, and this is one of the best. Highlights include a wonderful visit to the library, a huge flickering slo-mo shoot in a curly bar (with a shot of a man blowing his own foot that is quite impressive), some decent slumbering actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine), some semi-famous recognizable faces (Lynda Day George, Queen Linnea Quigley's shouting) and a few relatives of famous people (Chuck Norris's brother Mike, Van Patten clan member James). It even has one of those wonderful "What made us?" tapping morality lessons, although the turning point comes when the vigilante fratboys fend off some children robbing a shop with a toy gun. I always wondered why it was the catalyst that the hero thought; After all, whether they were children and not hardened criminals, and whether they had a real gun or not, they actually robbed another shop. As far as I can tell, it was just another job well done for our vigilante frat boys, right? Wonderful things. Highly recommended, don't be guilty of enjoying yourself in spite of yourself.
