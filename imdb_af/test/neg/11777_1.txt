This piece looked EXTREMELY because the description was kind of strange. This movie stinks of cocaine, the opening phase alone should cost at least five figures in the flash for film. It is a racist, homophobic piece of garbage that runs for a good 1 hour and 22 minutes with absolutely no direction. I'm a little confused about how it has good reviews here. I will not tell you the plot line, as far as I can say there is no plot. I'm pretty sure everybody came up with the series that had huge lines every day, Loretta Switt dressed in the sting of necks to scream as many flap jackets as possible and shout action; improves the role in a cocaine madness. Just like a real beer, this movie failed my liver halfway. Save your money, and look 'Strange Brew' instead.
