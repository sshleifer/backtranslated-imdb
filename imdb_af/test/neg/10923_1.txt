First things first, I'm by no means a fussy movie keeper. I'm not one of those people who get movies just to clear up and criticize the mistakes. I, like most other people, look to be entertained. I would basically see any type of movie, no matter how bad someone says it is (sometimes a movie is so horrified and written that it calls a kind of sorry humor I get a scoop). With everything aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on TV and just didn't know what I was watching. It was too poorly written and cheese to be an adult movie, and had too much sex, innuendo and curse to be a child's movie. I even doubt that children will be amused by that. The humor (pretty generous, even it calls it) was so pretentious and champion, I couldn't see how someone with half a mind could even find it funny. The only thing that made me laugh is how people like Bernie Mac and ridiculously put their name and time on something that hurts. Luda's character was such a cheap trick to laughter, which fell very short of purpose. The plot did not make sense, the storyline should be the worst series of events ever created on the screen. I can continue, but I want to see what people think of my reaction before I start discussing specific cases of pathetic scenes. All I have to say is really to wonder how much time these writers spent on their knees, trying to make it. <br /> <br /> J
