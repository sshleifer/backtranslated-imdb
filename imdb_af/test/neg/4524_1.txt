What a sad surprise. <br /> <br /> To be the tough fan of the original series (starring Don Adams), I looked forward to it a lot. Poor me. It is more acidic and more brain-dead than a monkey's bottom. <br /> <br /> To say it's bad would be a serious suppression. This is / was the worst movie (well first 30 minutes of one). I've seen for a long time. I couldn't stand more than the first half hour, preferring to watch my hard drive fragment. <br /> <br /> I can tolerate badly ... Bad is OK, sometimes even cute. BUT with a crazy Hollywood shit (and it should be the worst in many years), I won't sit down. This movie is a great insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! My five-year-old daughter could have written better - and she's not even dyslexic !!! I'm really tempted to try to look at the rest, but I'm afraid I have better things to do ... like making pizza dough and watching it rise. <br /> <br /> What a sad disappointment. No ... I'm buggered! What a scammer! As Mel Brookes once said; "Piece of shirt!"
