This rule is a good summary of this movie. If you have read it and watched 20 minutes of the movie, you will know exactly how the rest of the movie will perform. Some researchers called Surgei (pronounced SirGay) are looking for hell in Moscow's underworld. However, he seems to disappear, and his friend Oven follows with a team to look for him. Could they get a more boring plot? Some bad actors look at an old man in the underground. The acting is very bad, the romance really feels senseless and untrue. There is often no good reason for the way the characters behave, nothing is scary and, above all, nothing interesting about the whole movie. They just walk and ask gang leaders and other guys over the road, walk more, complain, find the old man, and then they run and eventually find the way out of the underground. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives me the lowest rating of this movie is the atmosphere. If you just want to see a movie, it can be a good choice. It's dark, and it's misty and dark. However, the rest of the movie is really boring. You sit there all the time, wait for the movie to start or something to happen. This actually happens only a few things, but they are not very well done. For example, I didn't really notice when one of the characters disappeared, and I swear I wasn't sleeping or anything. And I don't understand what is dangerous with these children. They just run around in the underground area and scrap it walls with sticks (I think it's somehow scary). <br /> <br /> Just look at this movie if you need some dark atmosphere right away.
