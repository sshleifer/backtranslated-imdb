she must surely be one of the worst gay-themed movies. Who told one of the so-called actors that they could act. Bad sound - bad writing gestures so overboard that they ignore reality. A nightclub scene with just one actor and a spectacle scene. <br /> <br /> After seeing other low-budget movies the same way, I was ready for something innovative - but not just pathetic. <br /> <br /> Parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to do so. <br /> <br /> And the DVD - No menu access; it is worse than a VHS band. Once you start, you have to look through the whole thing - fortunately, the fast forward button - with this movie and DVD nothing else.
