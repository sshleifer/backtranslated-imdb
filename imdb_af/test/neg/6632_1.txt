It should not be made in a movie. Everything was idiotic and I don't think I laughed once. There were bits that were good, I think, but that's about it. Many parts were strikingly similar to many other films that made them a lot better. There were some well-known actors / actresses in this, but no one did a good job, they just didn't care. It's one of those movies trying to have a "cute" end, but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values. Root Top is probably the worst comedian out there. Do yourself a favor and discover it! <br /> <br /> Final Decisions: <br /> <br /> Movies: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> Buy DVD: Absolutely not! <Br /> <br /> Rent: Only if you have seen everything else and have a free voucher, but even then it is not worth it.
