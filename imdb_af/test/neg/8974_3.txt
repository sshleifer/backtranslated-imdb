After having had a quiet time before I was working, I watched my "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" DVD collection and chose the most obscure title in the pack: Zis Boom Bah with a forgotten Grace Hayes. "Classics" is of course the operative word here since most of the titles I have never heard of and I suspect they are all in the public domain. Anyway, this movie also dies her son, Peter Lind and his wife, Mary Healy (who I just found out, is a New Orleans resident of the state in which I live, Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as a malt shop owner and Huntz Hall, taking a break from the East Side Kids, as Peter's mate. The plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to make her rich, careless son in a responsible one with him who is unaware of who she is, is for the birds and does not have very funny scenes, although I as Peter's famous personality characters and his dance with Hall. in tow. And the songs and dances are in themselves entertained. However, Rubin is already in the spot with his confusion of the American national language of the time and almost everything he does does not make sense (although I did like his funny dance). As it was only 61 minutes that I certainly played on the bottom half of the double feature account, I would be a charity and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining pieces I mentioned.
