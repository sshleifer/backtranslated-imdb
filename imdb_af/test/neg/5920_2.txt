I thought this movie was terrible. I understand it was shot on a small budget, but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just stupid. The plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic moron. In fact, all the characters were impersonal and no one was fully developed. The audience is not related to anyone in the movie. It was supposed to be tension, but if you didn't care about the characters, it's hard to catch up with the movie at all. I felt that an outsider who was forced to listen to someone told me a stupid story. All the plot turning to the end was just a little too much - I actually laughed when I thought I should be shocked. All in all, I thought it's really just a bad movie.
