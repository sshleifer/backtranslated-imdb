I don't see the point. It is punditious. The animated people are creepy (look at the uncovered valley). Scenes continue and on for very little purpose. The plot is skeletal and must be placed with many meaningless dramatic, screaming, route rides, as if Disney or Spielberg are planning a fun park ride based on the movie. Most characters are annoying and unattractive. Some of them remain as if they have something important to add to a climate. They don't. They just disappear with no lasting impact. Somebody summed it up as "if you don't believe in Santa Claus, you'll be kidnapped on a train at Christmas." It summarily summarizes it.
