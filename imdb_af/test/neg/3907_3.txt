How to make these bad stories. It's not a question. This is a statement. <br /> <br /> Here are my movie issues. <br /> <br /> 1) Much of the story development was predictable and boring. My emotions ran straight into a flat line. There wasn't much to draw the viewer into the movie. <br /> <br /> 2) The characters were definitely uncharismatic. One was a wage, another was confusing, and the third was pretty damn boring. There was absolutely no reason to be drawn to these people. Although I knew this wouldn't happen, I hoped they would interest someone else, someone more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was uncomfortable to me. A trailer ??? In the desert ??? The desert is a place where most people prefer not to visit. How is it that these three people end up in the desert? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on earth managed to find each other in the desert in a few weeks? <br /> <br /> 5) Was it really necessary for me. Ryan must be in two scenes that need a swimsuit? Hey, she looks good, but it was pretty free. <br /> <br /> Well, so if I thought it was so bad, why did I give it a 3? I try to be as objective as possible. Although I found Alan annoying, I have to say that David Arnott had a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd (the character reminds me of some of Albert Brooks' more annoying roles). Jeri Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it was just not well written. All right, so she had to be a confused, dysfunctional woman. But why? What did it add to the story? Her mood swings made me feel like I was ripped in one way and then another and then another. <br /> <br /> I don't often go to movies, but this one considered me doing it. stop. Stiff, predictable, boring. Go at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My 2 cents.
