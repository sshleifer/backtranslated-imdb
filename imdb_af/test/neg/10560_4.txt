As a professional poker dealer for more than 25 years, I have had a hard time watching this movie. Too unreal. It seems as if the producers of this movie have done little or no research or just do not care. The card tricks are something you would never see in a real poker game. Common sense right? Plus it was full of movie clips and so on the tricks. Who can't do this? The fraud was amateur stuff. Palming, marked cards, etc. Do you want to put in a high-limit game where they use open deck cards? Would you put in a game where the players are pushing their chips (constantly) in the middle of a pot, mixing them in and balancing just how much they bet? C'mon! I gave it a 4 because the turn and turn might be interesting for some, but for those who know how to play the game, it will be pretty painful. Next time they should use real players and get insight into how to do it right. One !!!
