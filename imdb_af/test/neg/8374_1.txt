It must determine with the worst movies I've ever seen. It just wasn't funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you're the kind of person who's going to be a dog in the eyes of a dog, then it can do something to you. If you're expecting a comedy movie to have humor about it, you'll be disappointed unless you find an English radio presenter who says the f-word many hilaries say. The strippers in the club kept their underwear so there wasn't even a little nudity to relieve the boredom. What happened in the comic club didn't make sense at all. There was a great deal of muttering through the main character with whom I had no sympathy at all. Mena Suvari was scarce in the film, supposedly just there to make people think it was a serious attempt to make a movie. The bad guys were unconvincing and carry so much threat as a dead sheep.
