Okay, so not every Australian movie is so good. Yes, maybe there was very little with much merit. Removing is, however, an absolute bomb that qualifies as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wanted it. I thought I'd give it a fair. I even met one of the screenwriters Dave O'neil, so I feel kind of a traitor that gives this movie a bad review, but ... The plot is pretty thin (I won't bother ... read the synopsis), which I can forgive: there are many movies that can cover it with some decent jokes. Unfortunately, Take Away's jokes cover up his plot like a red tape of $ 2. Probably the only laugh out of the 6 other people in the theater was the poor acting and dialogue. Take Away goes down like a week old Dim sim ... You can understand the joke if you see the movie, but the joke is not worth it.
