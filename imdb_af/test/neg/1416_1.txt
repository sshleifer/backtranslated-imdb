How is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors? Were they forced by that? The plot has nothing to do with an idea of ​​how things will end up when a comedian runs for president. They didn't even try to give an impression. Just when you thought you watched a comment from well-known liberals on DC politics (the first five minutes), the movie goes off the road and in the B movie about 1) a computer tuning error, 2) the regular evil corporate suits that want to cover it with the most original lines in history, and 3) a neurotic but extremely beautiful female programmer trying to tell the upcoming president about it. She is soon to be the victim of the evil X-files master masters of the computer company who, instead of killing her, make her drug look unreliable. But when she comes to GS, she doesn't tell him. In fact, the film then changes from B-movie drama to idiotic B-movie love drama. So far we have been so far from the original starting point of the movie that most people switch it off. I almost did. If only INTELLIGENT love drama could have been, but no! It's not! It's the kind of "oops I'm so nervous, I'm always stupid, so love me for that" child of love drama. All with a slow, slow pace, which has nothing to do with the political plot of the movie, the X-file plot of the movie, or the comedy plot of the movie. All sites fail at all levels, reminding you of every annoying piece of meaningless dialogue. The love part must be the result of decision making during a drink. "Hi, there must be a dynamic love between the presidential candidate and the extremely beautiful female programmer, yes, it will work! Paste it there!" <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lewis Black is castrated and rolled into a Lewis Black line. The Lewis Black rage has been replaced by a hope that it will be somewhere in the movie that never does. And Christopher Walken is thrown into a hospital with heart problems to replicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the president's closest help in Westwing. Watching Christopher Walken, like Lewis Black, is castrated in roles that are constantly struggling to beat casual and Westwing-ish, but every time Titanic looks like a big blue whale that dies on a beach. Heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Then, write the low point of the whole movie. This raises the sensible, difficult ethical question: If Robin Williams becomes president, does he know he's chosen because of a computer glitch? The American Dream and All the Good dominates if he switches off the presidency on live TV, as Lassie would like the dog. With the usual patriotic sheen of the presidency and the so-clever-that-our-making history atmosphere that Westwing has grown in sickness over the next million years. <br /> <br /> Director and writer, Barry Levinson, is now on my personal list of writers and directors that I stay away forever. This film should be seen as a symptom of a faulty production process where people (including Barry Levinson) have to spend production money because of their personal relationships, not their skills. This is a project designed to satisfy poor skilled people's desire for career success, and the previously mentioned major actors have been hampered to participate. That's the only explanation there can be. <br /> <br /> PS: The voice error in the computers was due to the double letters in Dobbs, Kellogs and Mills. Of course it was, otherwise it might be if you write a script and can't tell a computer from a dishwasher.
