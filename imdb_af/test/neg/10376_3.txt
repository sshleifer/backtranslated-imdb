Formal to the maximum. No title reflects the series' actual content, "Nazis fighting in Morocco," (actually the Iverson ranch). The plot is just to fill in the lulls between fist fights. The packaging demands more than 40 "physical encounters" in 15 chapters. That's at least three a chapter! Aside from the fact that Duncan Renaldo is thrown as a Spanish accented Frenchman, watch as many furniture is overturned, broken, thrown, burned or blown, what this series really is about. When the protagonists start fighting, you can bet everything in the room will be in it too. So, kudos to the choreographer's battle, who's the true star of this series! <br /> <br /> Two positive notes: the characters sometimes lose their guard during the battles, and best of all, we have the girls' head (often a journalist, as she is here) who actually participates in the chaos. mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys. Still, Linda Stirling died the biggest villain in "Manhunt of Mystery Island" (1945). On the downside, there is just too much jumping off the road that escapes - before the plate falls, before the car crosses the cliff, before the speed boat explodes, before the building explodes before the truck hits you. Etc. . <br /> <br /> This series is alleged to be partially inspired by George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones movie, but it is more with implicit concept than due to the real story or series development. <br /> <br /> Rod Cameron 'shines' as a moving rock, a role he played in all his movies. Unlike watching all the furniture hit, there is nothing really going on, compared to other series that have fewer fights, more story, better actors and more developed characters. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 for everyone to break the furniture.
