It's a pale imitation of the Die Hard franchise that just sucks. The low ambitions of the movie are clearly displayed when the terrorists hold the Vice President hostage and he must call the White House to ask them to transfer money. In most movies of this genre, the president is kidnapped or hostage because he (or she) is the strongest person in the country with a finger on the core button, and so on. Would most Americans really worry if Dick Cheney had been kidnapped? The honest answer is probably not. Why the terrorists would choose a Stanley Cup final to run their operation and why, despite many explosions around them, the audience in the hockey stadium is unaware of the situation, unanswerable questions. Let's just say this movie is really hokey, not hockey. Those who liked the movie and found it to be exciting should get a life.
