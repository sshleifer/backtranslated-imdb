Uncle Fred Olen Ray gives us some of his Retromedia "goodness" in the form of this soft core Cinemax non-classic. <br /> <br /> A stump nut pair looks out for rocks when they come across a swirling vortex a "black hole" as the intelligent dolts set it. A beautiful golden girl from a million years ago has become a beautiful period and she thanks her way in the future. Soon her second half will come in the future in the future and blow a path through the beds of the future. <br /> <br /> Ray is once again delivering a negotiable (but rare) scam that is terribly perceptible but a decent skin. Yes, it's hardly titillating but heh! If worse gets worse, it will cure your insomnia. <br /> <br /> S10 reviews: 1/5 or 3/10
