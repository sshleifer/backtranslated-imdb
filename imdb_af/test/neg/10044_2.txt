If you've taken all the stock elements of a Shrek movie (eagerly sour, annoying donkey, cute kitty, mandatory dance number, etc.), put it in a blender and condense it up to 20 minutes, you'll have this mess . Painful to watch; I laughed once. The story and dialogue are overheated, with the voice players sounding like they were phoning in their lines. The final revised version of "The Christmas Story" poem felt it was written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With his desperate attempt to be hip and current, this display will be outdated and forgotten for a long time while classic like The Grinch ?? will remain timeless. An unfortunate waste of all concerned, a real "shark of the shark" for the Shrek franchise.
