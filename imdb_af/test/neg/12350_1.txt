Not a balanced point of view. The director should not express her opinion as truth. The film has some criticism of Fujimori, but it always gives him and his family the last words. So few critics from Fujimori were foreseen that the only reason they were included was to say the movie offers both views. But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film hardly shows any of the accusations Fujimori is accused of. And it gives him credit for mastering the murder of the MRTA insurgents who took the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA has done the planning. There are even photographs of a well-known CIA strategist on the website published by Caretas magazine and other newspapers. <br /> <br /> The fact that such familiar information was not used by the director gives us some possible conclusions: the director is pro-Fujimori and deliberately and falsely chooses to give him the credit; the director does not want viewers to notice that the CIA and Fujimori worked together; or it was just out of ignorance because the director was not Peruvian and was not present in Peru when the events occurred. <br /> <br /> The explanation provided by other commentators is that Fujimori is still quite popular in Peru, excuses the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations. <br /> <br /> The statistics provided in the movie for the real support of Fujimori were also the highest I have ever heard. Most statistics by major polls are much lower. <br /> <br /> Another point to mention is that the intelligence that was key in catching the leader of Sendero and discovering the secret network, through a police force led by Ketin Vidal and he had complete autonomy of Fujimori and Montesinos. <br /> <br /> The first Fujimori government experienced an improvement in general economic trends (GDP), but this improvement was funded by the privatization of several national industries with contracts It was not beneficial for the country on the long term. Also, the gap between rich and poor continued to rise during Fujimori's regime. In its second quarter, the economy suffered and there was nothing else to privatize. By the end of Fujimori's second quarter, the economy was falling. <br /> <br /> In terms of infrastructure investments of Fujimori's regime, they fall into the paternalistic pattern. They were created to support Fujimori, but were not meant to last long. These structures require sustained maintenance, but Fujimori did not give the political power to citizens to claim further investment. In fact, Fujimori's regime was able to destroy most forms of political organizations such as unions and root groups, and the increase in informal disorganized labor was enormous. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director decided to speak most of the movie with Fujimori instead of the cases of massive corruption in favor of Fujimori (the Media, Business Owners, the Military, etc.) what so widely spread it was impossible for Fujimori to be unaware of it.
