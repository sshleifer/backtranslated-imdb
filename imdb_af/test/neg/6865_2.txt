I can't believe I'm wasting my time with a comment - but this movie is strange. If 20 different directors were introduced to film different parts of the movie without having an idea of ​​the story filmed by the other directors, it would be almost the result I would expect. <br /> <br /> I also think some of the screens are out of order - things don't always look right. The film acts as if we already need to know about half of the characters. <br /> <br /> And Steve Guttenberg tries to do the manic, a-la-Robin Williams comedy in this movie. EWWW. And the whole premise of putting a lot of kids in control doesn't seem realistic in this day and age.
