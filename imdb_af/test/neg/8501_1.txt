How did this film come at the Berlin Film Festival? I understand it came in the Panorama section, but still. <br /> <br /> This movie contains: <br /> <br /> 1. No plot. 2. Terrible acting. 3. Atrocious videography. 4. Of the worst graffiti ever captured on video. <br /> <br /> The one vowel most of his feast is acceptable is the presence of old standby: homosexuality. That's right, the only thing that happens in this movie is that one graff artist makes up with another and breaks him down. Then he feels strange about it and they have a boring old "break up" conversation that you can expect from your first loved one in the middle school (with lines like "You kissed me first, man."). Oh, and by the way, it's not a Crying Game ... you see the gay corner coming in the first ten minutes of the movie. Apart from this, it is mostly only bad labels, poorly bought "shelter" options, a skate boat, and a train ride. <br /> <br /> If the topic is of interest to anyone, I recommend watching the web for some graffiti underground underground videos taken by real graffiti artists. There's plenty out there ... and they're a hell of a lot more entertaining than this crap.
