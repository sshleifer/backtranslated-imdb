Starting this movie was sick. Here's your wife dying, and you're going around town with this blonde chic on your side. Then your wife dies and within 2 months you are with this chic. Hank (James Brolin) is definitely moving through the whole movie. I call him Fast Hank. Fast Hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it, she has sex with his best friends. The part that gets me is when she does it in the barn with Kevin and is caught by another Hanks friend. Kevin got up and went, she dropped her robe and BAM !! Right in the arms of the other man and they start and then "get it". I think he's done what Kevin started. HOW GREAT !!!! I'm like this is lifetime movie ??? This is a typical OU MAN JONG WOMAN movie that says you can have my body if I get your money ...
