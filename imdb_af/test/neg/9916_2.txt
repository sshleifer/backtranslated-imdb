I hope Matt Dorff's original writing for this was much better (there are signs of it - dialogue that needs to happen well before big f / x scenes (to represent characters) that would make sense earlier becomes later in the timeline Maybe the original script is for a longer running time, but maybe not - anyway, this series. Every character is uninteresting, and * everybody * speaks statements as if they are speaking the word of God. Wiest's "Secretary Abbot" is just awful, explaining things to her assistant (and by chance we), in endless speeches that no one will ever say in real life (when she doesn't explain things to her assistant she already knows, her assistant explains things to her that she already knows. There are characters that are completely one-dimensional - the evil mate, the pilot who is not just about his personal life and concentrating on his work. The "well-meaning" super-operating super-hacker man what can collapse. <br /> <br /> * everything * in Chicago (including the phones) - then give the oh-no-what-have-I-Fit speech (but don't leave it behind?). The corruption reporter who abandons her principles at the drop of a hat? The power-company shift supervisor who left his job in the midst of the worst crisis in Chicago since the Fire - with no consequences? Hospitals STORY by doctors and nurses during the crisis (I'm not joking, it's in the movie.) Oh yes, and it's filled with Hollywood morality lessons - generally women are good, men are angry unless it is influenced by a woman (the ultimate is the punk with the gun - deprived of a woman's influence, he literally becomes insane); An evil stupid thing (as the reporter did with hacker-bozo) is good, as long as you mean well. Evil men die, capitalist evil people die as horribly as possible, everyone lives differently (except Randy Quaid). And did I hear someone say that the nuclear power stations had to shut down because there was no electricity to manage the safety systems (think of one)? <br /> <br /> There is one ray of sunshine (if you want to forgive the expression) - Randy Quaid basically plays his character from "Independence Day" (you know - "Hello boys - I'm baaaack!") - this time as a storm chopper with an infinite range of SUVs and superdop batteries for its camcorders. Nevertheless, they kill him - mostly, it seems, so the audience will appreciate that tornadoes are pretty dangerous things (so level, that.) <br /> <br /> Give this one a pass.
