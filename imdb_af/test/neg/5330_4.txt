I was diving to see it through the very friendly reviews here. Son, are they away from the point! Giving these 9 to 10 points and calling it one of the best films of the 1990s is just unjustifiable. The big problem here is a lack of fit and a paper thin plan. It's like a slapstick on Prozac. Everything is predictable and listless. The plot is poor to start with - two garbage men look at their foxy neighbor, testify to a murder and unravel a waste of conspiracy - and the movie never goes much further. There are some amusing situations and decent acting, but it is nowhere near enough to save this jealousy of a movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy that doesn't get its fat off the ground, so why waste your time?
