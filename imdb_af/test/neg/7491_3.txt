The C-class cast and poor transitions made with the horrific act made me believe that it would make a good TV release, such as the FX presentation of a smallpox outbreak. However, about 9 copies are kept on the shelves at my local level. No one was watching when I rented the title. (I wonder why ....) Anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the "fear factor" going for it. The whole "death count" at the bottom of the screen sometimes contradicted the plot, as when the helicopter crossed Angola and the toll was accelerating at 23 million to 24. But when the movie ends (possibly a few hours or even a day or so after the helicopter landed), the death counter bank is reduced back at the moment the helicopter approaches that area. The movie end has left a great whole in the whole plot, and God knows no one is waiting for the successor. Anyway, don't rent it, I only recommend watching it if you've got the title without a financial loss, and you're in the mood for a cheese-like movie.
