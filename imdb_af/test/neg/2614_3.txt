Last attempt to revive the series that is actually based on a pretty good idea, but without the required gore fx / violence for this kind of tension - and therefore ... BIRTH! Good special fx, sets, costumes, etc. But the movie comes from just stupid and short-term spending. Hopefully the next installment will fix this problem.
