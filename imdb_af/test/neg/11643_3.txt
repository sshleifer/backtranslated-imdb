The best thing about this movie is that they seem to have used many things left over from the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of the P-40 which crashed into the row of parked P-40s, but was filmed from the top of a hangar or tap. Unfortunately, it just gets worse. <br /> <br /> There are two black guys and two white guys like US POWs, as well as some Filipinos POWs and Japanese guards. The position POW of the Americans is a white fleet lieutenant, who is obviously an O-3 in the fleet. Anyway, he needs a cut, bad, distracting bad. Hockey hair does not belong in a WWII movie. Oh, and he's a racist. He doesn't want to share quarters with the "negros". Of course, in real life, he also doesn't want to share the white, unpretentious old quarter. I think the Geneva Convention has a clause on official quarters and designated, but that was not the point here. Oh yes, I think plot is secondary to other issues in this movie. He sits in his place and spends the rest of the movie as much as the air pump for the divers. <br /> <br /> But as soon as you go, it's not a bad story. The japs ​​want the divers to increase the silver poured out by the Americans before Corrigador fell. The Filipino resistance wants them to take their time. And the POWs are doing their best to help. A potential good story and not done so badly, I think. A little incredible when the POWs camp used, reasemers made to swim every night between the POW camp and the Philippine town. Maybe I'm not as picky as I know it's not a flashy movie. I think that's why it comes on a 20-pack, five dollar DVD war movie collection. <br /> <br /> The 70s music didn't feature in this movie or any WWII movie. It's pretty distracting to say the least. The acting wasn't that bad. Probably better than I could do. <br /> <br /> Not a fan of football, at least I found out that Jim Brown is a real person and not someone Richard Pryor. It is in itself worth the 25 ¢ I paid for this movie. <br /> <br /> Paying attention to TCM or paying a quarter. <br /> <br /> One star for a war movie, another for World War II and another because I feel generous.
