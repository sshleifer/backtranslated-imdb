I watched this episode with great expectations after seeing it on so many people's "Favorite episodes" list. I don't boast in any way, but from the beginning I realized they were in a kind of toybox / gaze, with the big eye on them, the type of characters there. Although throughout the episode the questions of "Who are we?", "Where are we?", "What is outside?" Bearing the tension of the episode (which I unfortunately found out), I have to say that different types of characters and the interaction between them made the episode interesting enough. Although turning the story might have been harder to guess if ALL of them (toys) were soldiers.
