I believe a whole book about the odyssey can be written to redesign the classic film on which this film is loosely based. When Hollywood first talked about such a business, the response was always negative, as there were too many things that could have gone wrong, starting with the solid ensemble that made the original memorable. And this is exactly where things are starting to get acidic here. of actresses who can otherwise do remarkable work, but it is not suitable for the parts, and unfortunately, it is aimed at the heavy hand of a director who does not understand or appreciate the source material. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no focus or direction, or as if the direction taken was annihilating everything that was good about the original movie. This is called an update, as we drain the story of humor, funny dialogue and any interesting prospect. Most of all, let us prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we are not really (at least watching this movie) where the women really go. <br /> <br /> For starters, who play Meg Ryan in the central role, is almost deadly for the movie, as she seems to have somehow made a kind of limbo, where women don't really change not even after 20 years of work in the movies. Her Maria, who was a difficult role in the 30's, somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes, such as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" by learning, observing and realizing that she " have a choice in the case. It might not be a choice women would celebrate today, but it was a fun ride and part of the fun was the cats, stupid, sometimes slapstick routines that raised that movie in the sublime empire. Here we are with a drop to the earth. Changing the nature of Sylvia, the movie lost a lot of its spark, which is not Annette Bening's fault anyway. I couldn't help but admire how she tried to save this sinking ship and she had a sinking feeling when she struggled with the terrible lines she was handling. Luckily I entertained myself by looking at some of her awesome outfits and remembering how talented this lady really was. Her Sylvia is wise but flawed, and she could be a wonderful creation. Unfortunately, me. English did not pay attention to her own work and lost control over the one character that the film could change in a new direction. <br /> <br /> However, it was not the greatest blasphemy of all of them. . In the original, Joan Crawford probably has one of the best performances of a woman. Her crystal is legendary, with connection lines, burning moves, double maneuvers, and some very sexy positions. She was the link between the man and the woman, and through her we knew what the whole disaster was all about. She provided the tension between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, the ultimate femme fatale. A woman of intelligence we feared and admired, and above all, wanted to destroy us to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, as beautiful as she is, is two-dimensional in this outing due to poor writing, and again, some bad decisions. <br /> <br /> There are more atrocities in the film, such as the addition of a terrible role to Mensing as the dedicated mother who lives to have babies, and the rather annoying lesbian twist by Pinkett. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie, because Bette Middler, who is a little unrecognizable in her makeup, shows the spark of what could have been. Her sour delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle that the film could have taken. Her words revived and put a great, very necessary sobriety in the film, and it is exciting to see that it really could fly, then she's gone. She is in the movie for six minutes, and she disappears in the middle of the fair. <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that raised our expectation and disappointed us, a movie that made the successful "Sex in the City" that made a great transition to the big screen because it respected its source material. did not endanger it. This gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. It has really updated what has been successful in the past. "The Women" in his current reincarnation must go back and recreate, as "The Hulk" did this year, more suitable performers, a very good writer, and especially those who really make good movies are the best. about.
