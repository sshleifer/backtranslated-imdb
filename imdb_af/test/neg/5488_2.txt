The story is: a turn-of-the-century actor actors, along with producers and theater owners, have many complicated relationships. A resident playwright wrote a psychological drama. He wants to get a good production on stage, but he cannot, unless he convinces a reviewer to review the production and give a positive review. If his production does not continue, then the troop will be posted at The Doll House, recently written by Ibsen. Many different relationships between principals are investigated; None of them are interesting. But the involvement of the characters causes the play of the resident playwright to give a second shot. <br /> <br /> This movie is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put up a movie. The story lines are incoherent to anyone who is not one of the stars. The only reason I didn't leave the theater after about half an hour was that a fat woman at the end of my drive rested a full meal on her stomach.
