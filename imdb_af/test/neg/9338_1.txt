In short, this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a Disney movie, which is usually mediocre plot movies and bad acting. But I have to say it's the worst of all Disney movies, with a bad play, a couple of annoying teenage girls (my god) and a very unrealistic plot. Even as a 12 year old, there is no way I would like this movie. The only way this movie might be worse is if they tried to put it in theaters or try to sell it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and change the channel before you see it, no matter how bored you are on a Sunday afternoon.
