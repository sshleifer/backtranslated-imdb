Well, I have to say I own this movie and I just love the end. The movie is boring and slow, but the final battle is so funny. Let's just say if the fake bird didn't attack the biggest evil man, this movie would be a 0 out of 10. However, the bird makes it a 3. If you are really bored or want something terrible to see this and fast forward rent for the final blow.
