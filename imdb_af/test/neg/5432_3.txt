It was a highly filmed film before its release, but was a dud. I never spoke to one person who ever liked this movie. I agree: I didn't like it either. Perhaps one big reason is that it was not a success in the box, that it had nothing but unpleasant characters in the story. <br /> <br /> For a while there - I don't know if it's still true - I didn't have a movie in which Laura Linney or Dylan Walsh played anything but BAD annoying characters. <br /> <br /> This, and a stupid story, make this movie a big disappointment, especially in view of the great build-up. Did the filmmakers, with this silly dialogue, really think it would be a hit?
