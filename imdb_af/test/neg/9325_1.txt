Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! "The Beginning" was not the biggest, but better than this one. It's not a good way to go to the original movie. It's just awful! The CGI hyenas were so fake in both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than that. I was royal disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothing that that era has captured well. I understand why this movie was reconsidered as "The Beginning". It's just as bad, I think. where does the money come to waste? Give me a multi-million dollar budget and I'll show you how to do it!
