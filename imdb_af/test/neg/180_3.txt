This film appears to be an outline of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries all over the world are increasingly joining big conglomerates (the American producer, Mondavi, in the case of this movie) or affordable experts to help them make the perfect wine. And as a result, wines are very standard and predictable. For some it is a good thing (especially as few people can afford to pay $ 50 or more for everyday wine) and for others it is terrible because the uniqueness of smaller wineries disappears. I can really understand the concerns of both sides and don't think there's a villain or hero in this business. Sure, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but as with beer (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European shopping centers are almost indistinguishable from American) and mega stores like Walmart / Asda takes away much of the uniqueness of the "little guys". So I was definitely prepared and willing to listen to these filmmakers. But with a product that is almost two and a half hours long and a general lack of focus, the movie just got too big to look at and I lost interest. An 80-90 minute focused movie would have been very effective - especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophilic (this is the high-level wordword for a "wynaficionado"). <br /> <br /> The positive side, the filmmakers are smart to not talk much at all - and let people talk on both sides of the matter. Plus, the topic is so relevant and timely. But in spite of choosing a good documentary style, the movie just goes back and forth, and too long, and ultimately makes it a very dull movie.
