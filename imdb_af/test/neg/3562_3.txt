This movie tries to say something profound; I'm just not sure what it was. Too much is finally left unresolved for me to find out the main point. A few plays really wondered what was left on the cutter floor. I don't think the wall was very well developed. I never got what was actually going on there. When the mother finally revealed it, I could not relate to the boy's silence. What was the point of the boy who didn't speak? Was he just mad or if he got some kind of power. What was the scene with the burned girl? Another power the boy has or what? I don't understand how it developed any character or moved the plot. I got the bully bit, but what happened to the dog? Did the dog come back or mum somehow get rid of Fido? <br /> <br /> There were several additional platter elements that were more junk than used. Like the radio talk in the background of the war in Iraq. I think it was supposed to create a kind of comparison with the sadness and uncertainty the mother and Addison had, but for me it was distracted and tense. I didn't buy the link much. I also found the teacher at Addison not to say "here". The mother who saw the doctor was useless, how did it help the plot? Was it to show how desperate the mother was, or was it something about the medicine I didn't get? Was it the father who came back in the last scene, or just a guy? So did work on the wall? What happened to the dog?
