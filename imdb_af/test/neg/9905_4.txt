The first two hours of the television version are full of character and plot layouts. After a fast-paced Las Vegas series was hit by tornadoes, the action didn't really start until the second two hours. However, some character relationships are not clear to the second part. The actors are becoming proficient performances, but nothing special, but better than those in "Aftershock: New York Earthquake". An exception is Randy Quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. The plot is a nice standard mix of parts of Independence Day, Speed, Day to Tomorrow, Earthquake, Towering Inferno and various other movies. You can predict what will happen next, and come close to the dialogue, word for word. The special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the effects in "Twister", the tornadoes in this movie look less realistic than the one in "The Wizard of Oz" and other effects are, of course, made for less money than the series "CSI" and "Cold Case" spend on the totality of a single episode. If you need to watch a movie for the TV drama, you'd rather see the day, asteroid or special bulletin. You'll get better plots, plays and effects.
