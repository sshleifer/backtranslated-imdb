Overall, this is a very bad movie. But for $ 5 at PathMark, it wasn't a total waste. <br /> <br /> The whole scenario has to do with a guy who is infected with snakes with this lady, presumably a magical curse. The actors / actresses aren't big names (although some look like TV shows), so I won't do my usual Troy McClure thing. <br /> <br /> For a while, the movie keeps your interest as the couple walks a train and travels to LA to see a shaman to withdraw the curse. There are also some other sites going on; like two ladies smuggling drugs. <br /> <br /> But the last 20 minutes seems to be a total deviation. Just as violent and greedy as the whole movie, the big final is just totally computer animated. <br /> <br /> I saw the unprecedented version of tons of language, gore, blood, violence, everything! The bonus features were OK. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade: D-
