I have to agree with what many of the other reviewers have closed. A subject that could be light on a reverse double standard failed. <br /> <br /> Rape was a crime of violence and forced to control abuse. The screens were mostly pathetic. . It would have been better to give a brief overview of what was going on and what the audience was thinking. And the victim's laugh with the police, when he was missing his police charges, was as much as police's. No inconvenience, no hesitation just to include. I don't know if it was badly acting or bad, but someone missed the point altogether. Like his half-supposed quest for his attackers, pathetic. They had skipped most of the sex scene - another monumental failure in themselves, and met him when Colin Friels first went to the police. The story could then be written with good dialogue and the occasional flashback - and saved by the superior acting and presence Colin Friels - the only reason I watched this movie - bring to any project he does. <br /> <br /> The only concrete revelation of this movie is, it was a crap.
