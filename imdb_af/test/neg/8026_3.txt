Being a completely broken movie film with a home to provide, I'm a big fan of IKEA. My entire home is almost on the edge packed with the cheap particle board. And you know how all those stylish household items at IKEA have those funny names - a bookshelf called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror called a "Grundtal". It just adds to the whole Euro charm. <br /> <br /> Like the most interesting (but terribly translated) items on the shelves at IKEA, I'd like to give some translation to some of the reviews I've read about Swedish Kraftverk 3714. <br /> <br /> Original Comment: "For a low budget movie, it's pretty cool stuff. It'll be great to see what these guys can do on a Hollywood budget!" Translation: The movie stock is crappy, the lighting is pedestrian, the movie is uninteresting, the sound recording is hollow. Original Comment: "David Lynchesque sci-fi drama has placed equally strange in a strange forest village. Characters!" <br /> <br /> Translation: These "actors" work for free, the storyline is circular and tiring. The flashing ideas are trying to be existential, but are simply mundane and the settings (especially the interiors) are dull and full of ugly background. <br /> <br /> Original Comment: "The editing is well done, and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that compelling CGI effects should not come from a Hollywood studio.! <br /> <br /> Translation: If you started sketchy filmmaking, hide the imperfections by digitizing it all on a Mac and mixing it for three minutes brilliant! <br /> <br /> I have a chance on this DVD because I'm a sucker for independent movies, especially those trying to tackle the often expensive and awesome genre of science fiction, I mean, some of the best sci-fi flicks of all time are realized with little or no budget, spfx , and playful actors Take for example Peter Fonda's eco-warning-time-travel flick "Idaho Transfer"! A classic. <br /> <br /> But "Kraftverk 3714" does not fit the category of "carefully crafted" , low-key, idea-dependent sci-fi. "It ruthlessly focuses on characters who don't do much and don't interest do not say things. These are circles. It's too long (it comes from a great Tarkovsky fan). Worse, his concept of "reality-shifting strangers" is Twilight Zone feed from 40 years ago. It's not just a well-made movie, and I really wanted to be, dammit! <br /> <br /> But if I'm the IKEA fan, I've made a devastating observation. First, everyone working at IKEA knows how to work hard. All four wheels are multi-directional. The cars can turn a perfect 360 degrees, and it requires some familiarity to handle them like a pro, as any keen IKEA store knows. Well, I will be condemned, but one of the main roles in Kraftverk 3714 goes to the ink wine cellar in the middle of nowhere and where does she push? A multi-directional shopping cart! So, it's not an IKEA invention, but is another wonderful invention (let's call it a "Tacklebee" for hell) of the land hey-doo!
