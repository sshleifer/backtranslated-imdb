and nothing else. <br /> <br /> One of my friends bought the Problem Child Tantrum Pack (containing the first two problem children in one disc) and we decided to watch the sequel because it was "nicer". <br /> <br /> There were many funny moments in the movie (the vomit scene, that's all I have to say.), Nippy the dog after he had CHOW DOWN, and many others ate. The movie is nothing but toilet noise, but it's hilarious. Unlike the funny moments, this movie has little to offer. <br /> <br /> John Ritter shrugged me off as it looked like he was reading a book. The man can't act in this one, sorry. Although I can't tell if I will find the movie now funny ... (we were blown when we watched it), it's a perfect movie for a rainy day ... but nothing else. Don't expect Oscar material on this one, guys.
