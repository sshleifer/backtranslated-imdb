When the Spirits Inside was released, all you heard from Final Fantasy fans was how terrible the movie was, as it doesn't look like Final Fantasy. It's a different story, for better or worse. The well-known settings, characters, music, story and top action scenes should be exciting fans of the original game. The problem is that it's just not a good movie. <br /> <br /> The direction during the battle scenes is often sloppy, and the camera angles are becoming ridiculously fast changing in an attempt to make the action look more frenetic. but just serve to make the screens look and confusing. <br /> <br /> The CG itself is exceptional, but I can't say it's the best I've ever seen since Spirits Inside had much more detail on the characters, although I have to admit that Advent Children's characters move much more naturally. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost a black hole. It is a giant deus ex machina designed exclusively to bring Sephiroth back for one last battle. Old characters appear again, but serve no purpose other than to support fans. Character development is non-existent and the movie does nothing to solve any of the plot threads that hang out at the end of the game. But it is full of neat combat scenes with magic, summonses and limitations. That's probably what fans wanted anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end Advent Children is a very flashy, yet completely brainless action movie. It does more than a side story for Final Fantasy VII as a true successor. <br /> <br /> By the way, don't think you feel my feelings by voting. Not useful. It just makes me better if I know fanboys / fangirls refuse my objectivity so strongly.
