Her widow Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) recently moved with her two daughters, Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz), to her late husband's country house. Pennsylvania, where local legends speak of zombies fleeing the bush at night. <br /> <br /> Just to see the names of the author and director of this film in opening credits, it was enough to send my spine: Boaz Davidson is the "genius" responsible for writing the scripts for such STV titles as Octopus 1 & 2, Spiders and Crocodile, while JS Cardone gave us the divine 'video nasty' The Slayer and dim vampire flick The Forsaken. With such dubious talent responsible, I didn't expect much from Wicked Little things. <br /> <br /> And just after I finished the movie, I'm glad I kept my expectations low. <br /> <br /> Although the movie sometimes looks good, with a beautiful use of the terrifying bushveld, and the movie gives reasonable performances given the clich√© river with which they work, the plot is so trained, poorly written and deduced that it impossible to be enthusiastic. about. Most importantly, the film's killers, malignant children who come out of the mine every night they died in, are not scary at all, a blemish of makeup, black contacts and a few crazy joke scars that add very little. . to the sense of threat. Scout Taylor-Compton and their company are doing their utmost to fear the tiny horrors that convincingly confront every confrontation, but their admirable efforts to create a sense of fear in the audience are of little use: the little blighters have just not It is necessary to chew the blood. <br /> <br /> There are some fearless zombie chow scenes in a useless bid to win over gore dogs, and the last murder, which sees the victim's blood drainage, both Compton and Heur, is tasteless, but Generally, Wicked Little Things (AKA Zombies in the UK) is immediately forgotten trash? Just another clunker in the filmography of Cardone and Davidson.
