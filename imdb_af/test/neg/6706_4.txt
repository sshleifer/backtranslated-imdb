CORRIDORS OF BLOOD <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.66: 1 <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> <br /> London, 1840: While an anesthetic solution is being formulated, a dedicated surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to drugs and is cut off by local body snatchers. <br /> <br /> Driving the rocktail of a Gothic revival caused by the recent success of Hammer's THE COURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1957), Robert Day's CORRIDORS OF BLOOD is a strange blend of historical drama and grand Guignol-theatrie. Producer Richard Gordon has led Karloff away from Hollywood - where his movie career was bumped into a B-movie (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.) - for some rogue shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control. . In a 1945 drama, he played a novelist who stumbled upon a terrifying secret while investigating a series of recent history murders, while in a drug addict, he is a drug addict who murders a gang of criminals has. by eastern bar landlord Francis de Wolff. Less than a horror movie as a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings, the film entrenches its commercial commitment through a number of mocking excitement (a cut open leg, a face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the narrative is mainly motivated by Karloff's altruistic pursuit. of an anesthetic formula that relieves the terrible suffering of patients during surgery. <br /> <br /> Produced under the title "The Doctor from Seven Dials", the finished movie unpublished until 1962 due to indifference by distributors MGM, by which time co-star Christopher Lee earned a prominent screen credit, playing a small but significant role as 'Resurrection Joe', a sinister Cockney villain who carefully kills select protectors from the Wolff's curly bar and sells the remains to local doctors. Lee filmed this glorious como before the FRANKENSTEIN COURSE hit the international deaths, which is responsible for his limited screen time, although his intense performance is one of the highlights of the film. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) distinguishes herself as the Wolff's partner in crime, and there is a celebration of famous faces in supporting roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: DARKNESSPRINCE), Betta St. John (THE CITY OF DEATH), Finlay Currie and Nigel Green. Excellent artwork (by Anthony Masters) and cinematography (Geoffrey Faithful).
