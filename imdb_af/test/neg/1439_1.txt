Oh where do I start? Give a brief summary of the story? No, you've already heard, or don't want to. Anyway, it sucks. Much like the movie. I'm a semi-big horror movie aficionado, and I have to say it's one of the stupidest and most clumsy movies I've ever had the displeasure to watch. <br /> <br /> The writing is terribly stupid. The story starts too fast with absolutely no tension or buildup in the slightest. All those torture scenes would have been much more effective if we even gave the smallest shit to the characters. Since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls Capt. Howdy meets, how's hell with them? First, they seem stupid to go to a party with a guy they don't even know, and secondly, we don't even know their dam names! Why the hell do I care if they live or die? Not to mention the fact that they really have trouble making us feel sympathetic to Capt. Howdy after being "reformed"? PLEASE! I cheered when he received his net-deserts! He deserved them! Hell, he got worse! We were also forced to put in a pointless wrong sequence that was lifted directly from "The Silence of the Lambs" (and here it was HORRIBLY! Of course he gives them a false address! you don't think he'll wait and don't put a guy up on Johnson? RETARDED!) <br /> <br /> Then there's the dialogue. Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughing or just stupid. "The dead are so dead when they die" ?? What is the crazy kind of crap? Dee Snider at one point says "knowledge is power". Well, if that's true, this movie has absolutely no power whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Then there are the plot holes. Yes, I know it's a horror movie (well, wannabe horror movie), but damn! You can drive a semi-truck in this hole! First, it must be the DUMBEST police I've ever seen! EVER !! I mean, dear God, these guys are moral! Call for backup, idiots! Secondly, how the hell did that humungous septum ring fall from Captain Howdy's nose? Apparently, this penetrating expert man says "it's the biggest one I've ever seen", but if it's so big, how can hell fall out so easily? The Capt. Howdy just left it at the crime scene because he wanted to be caught? They certainly didn't seem to have done it. Also, they will never Capt. Howdy doesn't release, and I know this for a damn fact. He will be in prison for the rest of his life, and there is nothing to come of it. Much less, let him return to his old house where he murdered or tortured everyone. Impossible and indisputable. <br /> <br /> And now the acting. Dear God, these people sucked. Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this movie. She is ready and wonderful. She hardly gets a good chance of acting in this piece of crap. Amy Smart appears for about 10 minutes and then falls out of existence. Even the usually entertaining Robert Englund is underutilized and ineffective here. Dee Snider plays the crazy man with no talent whatsoever. I never threatened, scared or intimidated. I'd rather have seen Dee Snider in Alexis Arquette's role in "Bride of Chucky". It would have been so much nicer to see this talent-less hack, get it through that lovely psycho doll. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is just sucking. He can't act (one of the least I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?), And of course he's stupid than freaking Jessica Simpson! This film is just a way for Dee Snider to show all the strange shit he knows about self-reduction and modern primitive and blah-blah-blah. Or it has been done before or it just doesn't have to be done. I was bored with the whole damn thing. <br /> <br /> The play sucks, sucks the music, sucks the writing, sucks the pacing, sucks the special FX, sucks straight ... basically, sucks this movie. This movie tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller / horror flick and fails it. It cannot be frightened, shocked or disturbed in any form, manner or form. It is probably one of the least effective and completely inexperienced movies I've ever seen in my life. A piece of film garbage trapped on celluloid. <br /> <br /> "Strangeland" gets a 0 out of 10. Avoid at any cost. Not nice in the slightest.
