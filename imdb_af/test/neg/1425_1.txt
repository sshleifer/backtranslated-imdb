I didn't laugh so much for something the filmmakers thought would be <br /> <br /> hysterical. </p> </ P> br /> <br /> Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected by the army as 4-F <br /> <br /> and decides to use his money to set up his own army. <br /> <br /> about half a dozen. He then embodies a Nazi commander in <br /> <br /> Italy, and finally tries to kill Hitler. This is the description of the <br /> <br /> fine plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is as funny as a heart attack. This film makes "Hogan's <br /> <br /> Heroes" like Shakespeare. If the cashiers of "The <br /> <br /> Producers" really wanted to lose their cash, they had to show <br /> <br /> this movie. I can't stress how bad this thing is. <br /> <br /> Lewis's direction consists of two different cameras that shoot the <br /> <br /> action from two different angles, and then edit them together. This <br /> <br /> sitcom type direction works on television, but here it is a clear attempt to cheat the audience. He ends most of his <br /> <br /> scenes with a silent shot, as if the viewer gives a chance to double <br /> <br /> before going to the next tired setup. I have the most of <br /> <br /> doubling the film in abdominal agony, along with <br /> <br /> severe flatulence, over this thing. <br /> <br /> The director and producer, Lewis, set the film in 1943 but made <br /> <br /> no attempt to use costumes or sets. Everyone wears the latest style <br /> <br /> and has the latest interior design ... for 1970. <br /> <br /> supporting role is lost, as Lewis goes on his patented touchlines, <br /> <br /> lasting as long as a major operation and just as painful to look <br /> <br />. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, he spends the last half of the film screaming on top of his lungs in a <br /> <br /> performance so despised to stink any good will. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The final embarkation shot has Lewis and his loved ones try <br /> <br /> one on the Japanese farm. They carry bends, cut their <br /> <br /> eyes and speak in a "funny" accent. It can be one of the most <br /> <br /> blatant racist events since the internment camps. I was <br /> <br /> the way Lewis did this whole thing, but it put me over the edge. Look for Kaye Ballard's very tasteless scene <br /> <br /> where she tries to try suicide over and over. <br /> <br /> "George Trek "'s George Takei has two small scenes, then it makes sense <br /> <br /> falls out of the picture. It has less to do with Mel Brooks' last <br /> <br /> three movies combined. There is nothing more sad than looking at a <br /> <br /> previously respected comedian screw, such a project so terrible that you are ashamed of <br /> <br />. Jim Carrey taught it with "The <br /> Majestic", but Jerry Lewis once again shows a television while pulling the same infallible sktick. I feel sorry for him. <br /> <br /> "Which road to the front?" is cheap, rude, offensive and stupid. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for everyone involved and anyone who needs to endure it. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it. <br /> <br /> Although rated (G), it contains physical violence, some gun <br /> <br /> and some adult situations. If your child is interested in <br /> <br /> please see it, consult professional help. <br /> <br />
