It's really one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. It's not funny at all. It only depicts a lower class North British environment. I find it a very sad movie at parts, at other tracks where they shouldn't be. One thing that really annoyed me was the sprinting of useless objects that really slowed the pace of the movie. I just made it through the movie because I sent certain series to the end. <br /> <br /> This movie loses the attention of the audience. The biggest problem is that it causes several reasons for one action, which in turn weakens the action. But if there is one reason for one action, it makes it more passionate. All in all, this movie is everywhere. I didn't learn enough about the characters to care about them, because of the shift of plot lines and stories where I might have enjoyed the life of one character. <br /> <br /> For example, when the man meets god in the bar, god looks like a cool man. The movie could work out at that moment and I thought it would have been much nicer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough if that is. Watch it if you want, but I warn you that this movie is a crap. I respect the creators of trying to turn it off with such a low budget, but they could have done a much better job. I think it's all lies in the camera movement and editing, the acting was decent. But then it's just my opinion.
