this is the worst movie I've ever seen and most disappointing is that it is a yash raj movie, as long as you see the promotion, you think yes, it's definitely another yash raj hit . But if you see the movie, your eyes will be water with disappointment the storyline is stupid and stupid We've seen it many times. He will soon marry and fall in love with a girl blah blah blah. If you see this pathetic movie doesn't go with your family, there's too much exposure and kissing. I even see why you were going to see it on your own. Overall it's a shame and it's something bad and start with a d-movie, not to see it, you'll finally shark yash ji and yash raj movies
