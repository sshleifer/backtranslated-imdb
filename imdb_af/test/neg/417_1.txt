The impossibility of the plot was noticed by several commentators, especially the large number of problems Fr McKenna had to have, and the mere impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had, including that Langdon is going to decipher every clue in minutes . McKenna is branded; A few seconds later he gave orders, and a few minutes later he ran (literally) in control of operations. In real life he will be in shock. And as usual in exciters, the assassin does not kill the heroes, and as his only lame she explains that they were not on the list of those who had to be killed, as if every other innocent bystander he was shooting was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly horrible movie (US President recommends aircraft and hitting aliens, ha ha) and this effort is close. For such an incredible movie, Angels and Demons contain a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh when the killer got his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt screaming, "You're going to be blown up". Who didn't know that the heroine would get a corpse in the lab? Who didn't see the bath? Technically, the movie was terrible. This dialogue was more often unclear or clear, while the races across Rome were accompanied by deafening music. In addition, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looks like the Vatican - an achievement, because I'm sure the Vatican officials didn't want this shot in and around St Peter's - and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magical place, and I enjoyed seeing it briefly.
