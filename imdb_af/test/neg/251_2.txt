This movie had to be billed as three movie summaries linked to form a full movie (including many shots people walking slowly dark streets and streets). BE WARNED! The first hour of this movie is just a repetition of the first two Aztec movies as the main character tells. The real movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over. I must say, the overworking part of the Bat is quite hilarious. <br /> <br /> As far as the robot is concerned, I thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not look like one. The bat's "robot" consists of a radioactive resuscitated body encased in a main robotic body. As Tom Servo put it, "He's not that impressive, he doesn't even have knees!" That, and it takes the robot about an hour just to wood over the room. But as soon as he catches you, look out! He will dissolve you with a touch (powered by Radium? Pluh ease!). <br /> <br /> It's a great movie when accompanied by Joel and the Bots. Otherwise, you're just a glutton for abuse.
