It's a poor movie. This is definitely how to make a movie category. Story, direction, acting and style are all flat like a pancake. Story consists of five? yes five ?? Football matches have spread over the course of the film, each one being more annoyingly filmed than the last because a dysfunctional amateur soccer team goes from strength to strength. That's it, it's the plot. It's hard to know who this movie is aimed at. It is too banal for soccer fans and there is nothing for teenagers or adults. There is also nothing for women, there is not even a single female character. This is sadness carrying you down as the team plays after the game after the game after the game after the game. The story, as it is, looks dialogue and manners of a past Ireland, with all the actors spitting the plays of the Dublin accent. It doesn't have to be seen to be believed. Avoid at all costs. Can anyone give me 90 minutes back. Highlight the credits at the end, low point too much to mention. Brendan Gleeson is in this movie.
