I love watching Australian movies, but this steamy pile of shit was just ashamed. The DVD cover looked promising, but you know what they say, not a DVD. <br /> <br /> I also noticed it won the best actor for an award, but the competition really had to be bad because the acting in this movie is pathetic. It just seemed like the director thought he had enough talent to regulate and act when he really had to focus on one part of making movies and getting it right before he got himself too thin. The music was pretty ordinary. The story didn't really go away. It was just a series of battles combined with a weak script and cheese dialogue. <br /> <br /> However, I would say this to all aspiring filmmakers. Watch this movie. It will give you hope that your movie will win something at a festival. <br /> <br /> But good for them to go in and go there. Hope they have learned lessons and their next venture is a little better.
