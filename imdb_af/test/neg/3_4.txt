Wow, another Kevin Costner hero movie. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even that baseball movie. He seems to be making movies that are the focus of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the heroic, the faults, the greatness, the fall, the salvation. Yup, within the first 5 minutes of the movie, we are all supposed to be in his awe and it builds more and more from there. <br /> <br /> And this time the story is ... story? ... is just a collage of different movies. You don't need a spoiler; You've seen this movie several times, though it has different titles. You will know what will happen before it happens. It's like mixing an officer and a gentleman with Backdraft, but both are easily better movies. See Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made ... and also to see how a good but slightly underrated actor, Russell, plays the hero.
