I think you can't imagine how these people really work !! Before I came to the studios to see the guys work there, I actually thought the same as you do. But since I have seen and done the work that guys have to do on that TV show, I have to say they really deserve respect for what they do all day. It's really no easy job. And also the actors, who can be terribly bad in your eyes, are very good people and many of them can really act! I don't think the material given to them can really show, as I think this material is not very good. But they are really good! So I don't think you can judge work before you see these guys there! And I didn't have to judge them either before I met them, but I was very embarrassed. So don't let yourself judge these great people unless you haven't seen their work.
