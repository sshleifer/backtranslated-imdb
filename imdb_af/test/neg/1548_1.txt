I remember this terrible movie I bought at the Camelot Music Store in the summer of 1989 when I visited my grandparents. It was a time when I discovered only movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, The Return of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for all the horror / gore genre that had to be presented ... or so I thought! At that time I was about 12 years old, so I don't really remember that. I remember a psycho running around with a cork shot killing people, and a few police (what I think) driving in a car that didn't really move, but they looked sideways to look as it were ... true cinemagic. I also remember that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I immediately threw it into the garbage. Something tonight made me think of the movie (I can't believe I didn't actually remember the name), so I jumped on imdb to see if it was listed. To my surprise it was! And quite a few other 5 people saw it .... Amazing. Although I remember being the role of the film, I had such a desire that I hid it somewhere because I like to enjoy it again (it will probably make a good movie). Anyway, I'm glad I'm part of the elite couple who saw this little "treasure". I'd love to pick it up for a few bucks. But beware, it's not a recommendation ... it's terrible ... it's just for nostalgia.
