It is one of those great potential movies. Brilliant actors, a debut of a very interesting director and a haunting "Survivor" tomb. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't work at all. <br /> <br /> Starting with the good thing: The cinematography is stunning. The beauty of the Namibian desert shows itself as a ruthless environment, even in the pictures. And then there's the play. Quite right. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. Bruce Davison also developed his character from Altman's "Short Cuts". <br /> <br /> The disappointments: Janet McTeer. Romane Bohringer. And the plot. Why on earth does Levring choose "Lear" for their play? The whole idea of ​​allowing Shakespeare to express their despair and inner longing does not work. It looks like a facade. And it is clear that the tragedies are taking place because of the choice of "Lear". They only fit into the Script at the Levring and Academy Award winner Anders Thomas Jensen. <br /> <br /> And the sex. It takes about three days, then all the characters are more or less sexually frustrated. Dahh !! Sex is always the easy way to go when you need a plot in a plot. Janet McTeer's part falls completely apart, mainly because of that ridiculous idea. The generation immediately makes the plot on the ground. Instead, they could have focused on the dialogue. There must be talk between all the characters, but we especially see them in smaller groups. They are talking so dead like "Lear" and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The King Is Alive" is not yet the worst Danish dogma'95 movie. But compare it to Lone Scherfig's most recent homemade dogma '95 films 'Italian for Beginners', this one fails badly. It's not a good movie. It's a bad one. But it's beautiful.
