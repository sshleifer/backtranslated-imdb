Don't take these guys, just a computer kicks off the same at once, just changing names, places and faces to prevent boredom. Hubby is attractive and rich, but too busy paying attention to his beautiful wife. A situation she is constantly trying to repair. Her friend / neighbor has the same problem so they are interested in each other's hubbies - the grass is always greener. Throw in a sexy twilight that has designs on everyone and you get a lot of syrup and dipping and a salad bag of an incomprehensible plot. <br /> <br /> The quality of bodies is quite high here, although not much in the way of 'contact', even simulated, is shown. Good late-erotic if Jay Leno can't let you sleep.
