This one is like a previous movie of 1987 "Masters of the Universe" based on the cartoon "He-man". Basically, you have a wonderful old world and for some reason they should have almost all the action of the movie on modern earth. Well, I think it's not such a modern earth, and it's an ancient world, now of strangeness and a pit of good times. Well, I think I can figure out why they have practically all the movie in modern times in this movie. To save money on costumes and sets. It's much easier to recreate what is happening in the present as a strange world like that of Eternia in Heem or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death. This movie is forgotten and not very entertaining, your first idea that it will not be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing this one goes to is the animals that are not as common in this one as they were last. Marc Singer is back and it is sad to see him in this condition. The man was a pretty good actor who was reduced to a sequel to a movie that didn't really need one and even though it happened five years too late.
