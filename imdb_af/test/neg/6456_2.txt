There is something wonderful about a "revenge" movie. Everyone wakes up in the morning and believes that he / she is the star of the movie, and that anyone who interferes with his own personal agenda is somehow the enemy. Revenge plot films work especially well when a person has a low self-esteem. Rather than fighting back in the moment, the "hero" draws on built-in anxiety to engage in a single force in an effort to restore equilibrium. Of course, in the "real world", this kind of revenge rarely relieves tension because life is not a movie; After the revenge was taken, the actions they took had their own consequences. A good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill. In the films, the final credits and all responsibility are resolved. <br /> <br /> "Swimming With Sharks" is advertised as a comedy, undoubtedly an act of producers to find out how to sell this stranger. . It's dark, but it's not dark comedy ("Company of Men" and the works of Todd Solondz come much closer). Parts of the movie are so cruel that they precede the current "torture-porn" genre. Everyone is so obsessed with ("Saw", "Hostel"). There are a few laughs. There is also laughter in "Saving Private Ryan," but it's not marked comedy. <br /> <br /> The intrinsic problem with this movie is that it hasn't earned its revenge. It is apparently about a young man being abused by his boss and eventually taking his boss's hostage to pay him back for all the abuse. The hero (a "Guy") is an "allman" so vague that we literally know nothing about him ... what does he do with his spare time? Does he have friends / family? How did he get to where he was? What are his interests (it becomes a moving motif through the film, undoubtedly inspired by the film's author's own struggle ... "What do you want?", The answer we are denied by a vague, fraud of an end)? It is very difficult to care for such a character, even if it did well (even Tom Hanks becomes a creep in the wrong role, such as "Punchline"). Kevin Spacey, the boss, "Buddy" is supposed to be a monster, but he is too charismatic as an actor. The best laugh came when he was abusing his assistant - he looked almost as surprised as the audience was likely to have on Guy. When Kevin's character is tortured, the view suddenly becomes empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a learning monster without rationality. At this stage, any message the writer had had been lost; There is no hero in this movie, it is no reason to give it. <br /> <br /> It is not a stretch to assume that this story is based on the author's own difficult career in the film industry. I worked for a similar boss and can make sure it's not so far-fetched. I had similar fantasies at the time and I thought I was justified. I thought you could win the most beautiful woman in the story (actually, the only woman - it looks like it's about four people in the universe of this movie) just by being your keen naive self, that eagerness has won awards . and that a boss abused you because he was a common man. Time and tide has revealed the truth that most "monsters" are just the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based on self. As the film points out, if Guy was so unhappy, he just had to leave. The movie does not offer a denial, but "surprise" in spite of that. We still don't know about the protagonists, we can't even be sure what anything they said is actually grounded and everyone gets their cake and eats it as well. In short, it was nothing but pointing out that (shock!) The movie business can be quite cruel. <br /> <br /> There are many good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge. stylish fantasies, both the emotional variety ("9 to 5", "Working Girl", "The Devil Wears Prada") and not so much ("The War of the Roses", the remake of "The Hills Has Eyes"). This is not one of them - despite a fun turn by Benicio Del Toro in the Emily Blunt role of Prada and an interesting work by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, it is a frustrating, mean, confused and slightly dim creation of self - concession by a director who now has one hope, worked it all out.
