Yes, it must be one of the lamest movies I've ever seen. It's completely tasteless, has no style, the story is so thin you can watch television and the whole movie has as many holes as you can drive through an oil bar. <br /> <br /> Sure, I appreciate a good B movie as much as most male white homo sapiens do. But it must be the worst I have ever seen. In fact, it's so B that it lacks everything that makes a B movie interesting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is based on such charming artefacts, such as the characters shooting the shit, different body functions, and the complete lack of common sense on anything on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny. In fact, it's the opposite. I sometimes found it boring because of its extreme predictability. <br /> <br /> I find nothing good to say about this movie. It was a waste of time to see it, and I hope others don't make the same mistake. If you pay for it, get a serious brain scan.
