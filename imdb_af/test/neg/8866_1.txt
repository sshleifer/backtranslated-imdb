I have never understood this kind of movie. You get a serious / semi-serious movie that everyone knows and takes it seriously from immature forks and so on. We saw it very, many times, and it was never really funny. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. It seems to be one of the dark and less popular of the genre, although I honestly see nothing in it much worse than Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This film, as clearly understood from the title, focuses on making childlike fun of pulp fiction. This is the main reason I decided to see it, because I found the film too much indulgent of Tarantino's sick spirit and powerfully overestimated. I was hoping for one or two good jokes, making fun of the overly violent and useless type of film that Pulp Fiction was in every aspect, in my (anything) humble opinion. I was very disappointed. The plot is almost a rip-off of Tarantino's movie, with a few scenes that spoof others, often better, movies, in the same childish and humorous way. The pacing is poor, and often you sit there, you can guess the outcome of each scene, predict every joke, often thinking of a better one on the spot, bored from your mind. The acting is bad. The characters are clich√©s and stereotypes, and are deliberately paper-thin to make the characters on which they are based. Problem is, it doesn't work. It just makes the movie much harder to go through. The humor is young and lame. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that they have managed to find some actors that look like the people they would look like. The film is a terrible waste of the actual workers involved. Perhaps almost entertaining with fans of the typical flea movies of the same kind. I only recommend it to people who truly hate Pulp Fiction, or fans of the Zucker parody films. Everyone else: avoid. 10/01
