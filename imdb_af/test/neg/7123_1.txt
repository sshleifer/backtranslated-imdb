The grudge 2 is one of the films that made me wish there were more synonyms for "terrible" in the English language. With a plot full of more holes than a trawler network, this movie's compulsive performance fails for a fan of even the most intriguing movies I am. I was forced to stay in the cinema until I got Â£ 5.70 p. Get out of it, though I was afraid I would be there for a few years. A better movie can be made from the first part of The Grudge, although I'm not quite sure it's not the result of such an exercise. As expected, going for a plot in this harsh example of wasted celluloid, ends with no resolution whatsoever, giving producers the option of applying 'The Grudge 3' to the public when they continue the time feel true hatred for civilization.
