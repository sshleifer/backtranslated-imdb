Another movie with a star of wrestling. So far I've noticed .... wrestlers can't act on the movie screen. This movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible. It makes you laugh at what they say, and they can't be serious, they try to be scared, but they fail and look stupid. The acting is terrible, possibly the bad director. <br /> <br /> The plot was stupid. Only some people are placed in a hotel because they are criminals, and they are killed randomly. The movie is thorough throughout and makes it one of the worst things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only thought and that's why I give it a 3 and not a 1 because of the way Jacob dies Good night. The pole through the head and the stories of him were great. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a very horrible movie and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it.
