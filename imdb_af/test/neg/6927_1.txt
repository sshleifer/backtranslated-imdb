I wanted to love this movie. I read the book to my daughters and we all love it. The book is wonderful. This film is very far from the book. The book is beautiful - this film is a terrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> In the book Sara is honorable, friendly, strong, and NO does nothing but get someone back. This is the point of the book! She acts as a "princess", whatever the circumstances. An important part of behaving like a princess is not to return ignorance. It is honestly worn, no matter how you are treated. <br /> <br /> In the book she endures a lot and touches the lives of others. Other people changed their behavior after they had evidence of her kindness and ability to endure without sinking and resentment. Sara does what is right, just because it's right. <br /> <br /> Outside the bakery, she comes to a beggar who is poorer and hungry than she is. She has half a dozen hot buns. She is VERY hungry. She gives a bun to this wild girl on the doorstep of the bakery. When she saw how rude the girl was and saw her throwing the bulbs, she gave her another. She continues to do so until she has given 3 or 4. I don't think how many. <br /> <br /> The baker looks through the window. She is so impressed by what she has seen, she takes in the bedding and makes her stand up as her own daughter. Other people are also influenced by Sara. <br /> <br /> And in her book, her father died. The man next door is her father's mate - he is looking for her. Her father did not lose his money - the man was excited to find Sara; He takes her and Becky in his house and raises them as his daughters. And of course Sara has her full heritage. <br /> <br /> Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, she stays in the same post at school. But she is humiliated because Sara told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. And Sarah finally talks to me. Minchin. Miss Minchin tries to minimize her treatment of Sara and Sara with a quiet, persistent attitude, and gives Miss Minchin that she was cruel. <br /> <br /> There is no coming. for me. Minchin. She continues in her unhappy existence. It doesn't matter - it matters that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her beloved friend, Becky, is now for all purposes, her sister. <br /> <br /> The book deals with love and honorable behavior under the worst circumstances. It's about self-control and humility. It's a wonderful book. This movie does NOT fix the true story and messages of the book. My wife was so disgusting about it, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stick it out. We were not rewarded. <br /> <br /> I can't think of a life's reason why the filmmaker needs to change this great book in such a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the terrible script from the book that Shirley Temple used. I don't know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values ​​I don't recognize. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - buy the book. It's unforgettable ... even for a dad!
