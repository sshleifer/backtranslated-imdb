It has been a long time since I was in the art theater and I got Douches Froides because it received so many reviews in the newspapers. <br /> <br /> The thing is with this movie, it has no head or tail, but just a part about the life of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> When it started, I knew it would be a long time, but sometimes things get better, in this case. There is no real character development or interconnection between players. You start in the middle of a situation, suddenly there is a girl and then there is a guy with whom he has to be friends to fulfill his sports ambitions, but the way they are composed is quite strange, as they are "just together", so it looks. <br /> <br /> And suddenly they have sex with each other, at least one you can see. The feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other man is barely noticeable and really all I could think of during the movie was "when will they have sex again?". And if you think about it, it's really crazy. Because it basically means nothing is really worth looking at, but three teenagers go to it and it makes me at least a very crazy movie, stay out of it and save your money (my 7,50 is wasted), there is better art house movies than this one. <br /> <br /> I give three stars for the acting show, one each.
