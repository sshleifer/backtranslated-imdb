When I bought this movie, I expected to get a pleasure, 1970's exploitation competition. Instead, I got this drama party by amateur author Andy Milligan. Oh, Andy Milligan. With its sturdy editing, smashing, and wonderfully well-known actors, you'll almost think you're watching ... one of his home movies! Seriously, I couldn't even stay awake for the first time trying to look at it. The screens of boring people dragged on, and when someone is killed, the movie will slow down. Sometimes it will also speed up, so the characters' voices sound like disk monks, which were probably the best of this movie. The script actually looks a bit better than the movie, and looks more suited to being in a soap opera than in a grinding 70's sleeping pill where the actors are constantly bumping over the lines. The cover said: "Their first cuts were remarkably erotic ... but thoroughly brutal!" Trust me, there is nothing "erotic" about this movie. Oh, we get characters that look like extra crunchy cottage cheese, but that's about it. And as far as "cruel", well, the viewer is most broken with this movie. And another thing ...
