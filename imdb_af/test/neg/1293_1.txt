I really tried to give this movie a chance, but when I realized that most of the movies were told of a bunch of boring officials walking around and talking on phones, I knew it was over. Much of this film also looked like stock material. It's just lame. <br /> <br /> The camera person kept making this quick short zoom, NO REASON! It bothered me so much, but I just wondered why they thought it was a good idea. It adds nothing to a static scene of two people talking. It's not NYPD Blue or some police or anything. <br /> <br /> How could they not realize that this type of story tells talks of people in conference rooms and what isn't it? Didn't they see this mess? Anyway, it was just a very boring movie and it seems everyone who made it doesn't understand good stories in film. <br /> <br /> Darn stock footage ... this is just wrong.
