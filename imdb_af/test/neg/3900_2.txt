When I started to look, I noticed immediately that I couldn't understand what someone was saying. I turned up the volume. With background sounds coming out, I could hear the voices. What do the actors say? Isn't the movie baptized? Do they speak Spanish? After some confusion, I realized that it was English. At least I think so ... The Amazing Jess Franco put the microphones too far from the actors. As a result, we can't quite hear what they say. He's done it before. But maybe it's Mr. Franco's intention? By not knowing what people are saying, we are thrown into a mystery about what is going on and left with more visual clues ... Maybe it's just me, but I'd like to know what's going on! What about some tips? The basic premise (I refuse to call it a plot) relates to a young American exotic dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman). He has a boyfriend who invited her to a small island that is owned by some thin rich people. It is somewhere outside the coast of Spain. For this visit, a big cash payment is promised to Paula, who gets the boyfriend. He then escapes from the island, only to return later. Why? Pay attention to the scene where boyfriend Paula's American passport opens. Although his hand tried to cover it, you can see the actress's REAL name, Amber Newman, underneath the photo at the bottom of the passport! Anyway, back to the "story": There are a few other thin, rich, beautiful characters visiting the island, all with ambiguous motives. We see sadistic games (are they really or fake?) And unpleasant menus. But the food must be good, as a bad French chef has prepared! There is a young servant walking around naked and never talking. Is she really dumb? And give us care? Of course, all the women are mostly naked in this movie ... Oh yes, we can at least be thankful that the (50+ and overweight) men are dressed! In addition to the incredible sound quality, which I have always wondered about Jess Franco, his wonderful ability to make beautiful naked women roll so that the viewer is completely switched off. This movie is no exception ?? I needed fresh air after watching it! <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm happy to report it, no matter what Franco can dream, I'm still attracted to women.
