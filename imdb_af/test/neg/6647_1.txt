This movie was a total disaster for me. There is one thing that movies should have to wake up to, and that is * some * psychological credibility of characters ... unfortunately, this is not the case. The main characters wear most of the time irrationally and even if they have reason for such behavior, it is not disclosed to us by the director. Sophie Marceau's character is particularly annoying and makes photos of everything throughout the movie, when one can expect something more rational (for example, meeting her mother in hospital). And why did she faithfully marry this man? (No, it's not a spoiler). The plot sometimes looks like a soap opera, and while the actors' performance is not bad, it doesn't help much. All in all, I couldn't find a way to connect with this movie. Not that I tried too much after the first hour. I never walked out of cinema during a movie, but this time was closest to my life so far.
