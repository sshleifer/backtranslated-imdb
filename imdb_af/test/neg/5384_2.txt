From an artistic point of view, the film fails to entertain or provide any moral resolution. The plot is difficult to follow if there is one. The acting is hard to stomach. The dialogue is clear and clearly written by someone who does not know English. Only the movies were worth watching in this movie, although you can still see some bugs in the picture. <br /> <br /> As an Asian-American woman, the movie made me angry because it showed how meticulous people can be. Politically speaking, the Asian women should be banned in such shameful roles. The survival of stereotypes of Asian prostitutes is not only bad for the self-image of Asian women, but also for the country as a whole. I feel for the main actor who played Maya and the exploitation she had to face to play such a role. <br /> <br /> As Americans, please avoid this movie. Art must be used to develop our tolerance and respect for each other, not to hold back.
