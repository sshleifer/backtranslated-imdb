You'll probably get something like that. I translate movies for a life and this is the first movie in my 5 year work experience that I found offensive to my intelligence. Of course there are dull Hollywood movies about drunk teens on spring break, but those movies don't even claim serious artworks. But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but offers a crazy (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of diverse scenes, pretentious dialogue ... Then you get the worst kind of movie that another reviewer defines very accurately as "pretentious shit". For those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - this is your intelligence and your imagination that you obviously used to make a little sense of this spicy effort (it's in our human nature to make sense ). <br /> <br /> One more thing: I can tolerate political wrongdoing very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of unbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much. I wish someone told the director it was mysterious (even in an unrealistic film) to portray a Slavic woman as a semi-articulate-confused being related to the forces of nature, probably due to the fact that she had spent her whole childhood looked at the stars and dairy cows on a tripod.
