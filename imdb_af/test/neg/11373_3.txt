I gave it a score of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> And what's sad, I've made a point of looking up the movie schedule for that channel so I won't see it. I wanted to see this movie because it is based on a book by one of my favorite writers, Barbara Wilson. As a lesbian, I expected to love this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Mrs. Wilson felt about the movie, but I experienced a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> It had to be intriguing - it was a mystery - in Spain, and the main character, Cassandra, is a language translator who is contacted by a mysterious, beautiful woman who offers Cassandra a lot of money for her ex -man, Ben, to find. . <br /> <br /> Public secrets have been revealed, but for some reason it just didn't matter. It was like, oh, so what. I couldn't get involved with these characters or to care for them. I couldn't even identify with these characters. <br /> <br /> I think much of the movie's failure was the actress who plays the main character. She looks old, tired, exhausted and so boring as dishes. Her hair was an eternal mess, her pockets were boring, and she was just not attractive or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was hearing a Dean Martin recording, but even that was ruined. worn by the strange makeup by the man dancing and lip-synching to the song. Believe me - it was nothing like the suavely attractive Mr. See Martin. <br /> <br /> The end is so syrupy, you would have liked to have had pancakes with the syrup. <br /> <br />
