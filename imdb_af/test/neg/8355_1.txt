This movie is as bad as "The Birdman of Alcatraz". I am not referring to the acting, but rather the point of departure of both films, which depict psychopathic criminals as lucky figures. In addition, it disturbs me if it is respected. Respectful actors such as Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles, as their status tends to give credibility to the director's intention to elevate the film's subject, community rejection. <br /> <br /> I was in the late years of Caryl Chessman's life in junior high school and his death penalty appeals and books were much in the news. I remember the grounds that the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was the victim. <br /> <br /> Get hold of people. Read history. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. He drove into the LA streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle. He placed cars with attractive women to make a traffic jam; Then the women kidnapped and raped. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to his abomination and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Chessman did exactly what he deserved, it only went on for a decade. No sympathy for the devil here.
