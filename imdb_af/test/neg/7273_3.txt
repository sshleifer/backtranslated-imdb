I decided to watch this ultra-low budget movie of the "Poverty Row" studio, PRC, because it featured the exciting character actor Lionel Atwill plus the title. Although Atwill has often played in these cheap movies, his excellent acting has always made the movies look much better, as his screen was great (his real life is also very interesting, like a bizarre soap opera). The reason I use the term "driving poverty" is that it is a nickname given to the very cheapest and worst production companies of the era. Many of these were not even real studios, but production companies hired space and sat out of the big studios at night! Yes, there is a good chance of being filmed after normal working hours. A common thing for such studios. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Lionel Atwill, telling his friends a story about something he had been involved for years. ago. A doctor falls in love with a lady, but he is afraid to tell her about himself. This is because his work kills people on Death Row ?? not exactly a glamor! The Doc asks his friend (Atwill) for advice on how to break it for her, but regardless of whether she will have the man. Later you realize this is because her own parents were criminals. <br /> <br /> Later, a man is killed and the lady is involved, although it is clear to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved in (and is a bit of a nut) and the evidence against the woman was poor. But the jury was apparently full of mindless people and she was found guilty and sent to Death Row. Even more brainless is that her old boyfriend was the man responsible for her performance. Don't you think anyone else can handle this thing? Until this fateful hour, her friend (Atwill) spends much of the film trying to prove her innocence and proves that the shaky sister knows much more about what she will recognize. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is just slightly interesting and a bit stupid. While it is visible and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the movie never really gets out of the way and some of the plays are pretty loose. It's sub-par and about what you would expect from such a low budget flick ?? and nothing more despite the cool title.
