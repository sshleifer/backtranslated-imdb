I attended a show of this movie. It was done with clich√©s and many indifferent jokes and setups. I think the other comment was by people who worked on the film or had family members of the film. I'm surprised this movie costs $ 3- $ 4m without any real stars. Where did the budget go? Of course it didn't go to writers to write again. Well thought out about the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a big mistake. There was little or no spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was at best a little thin. The direction was uninspired and looked like a student life. <br /> <br /> I don't even know what that means. Everyone wants Italian. It's a real word. I've never heard of it.
