After reading so many glowing reports of "Serving them all my days," I went out and bought it for Christmas. A waste of money, I'm afraid. I was looking forward to something in the same league as "Brideshead Revisited" and some of the other great productions of British television, but it's certainly not among them. <br /> <br /> The characters are too good to be true, put in a very predictable plot, and with the most tricky and eye-catching script I've heard in years. Yes, it has its moments, but they are very thin on the ground. The main actor is interesting, mostly due to his unprecedented agreement with Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in "Brideshead"), just dark. But his undoubted talents are being wasted on a character who is undoubtedly self-sufficient and priggish. His excitement is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the Somme during the first half of the first quarter. He does the early episodes, which are centered on his nerve condition, better than he later plays the sipping clean, socialist yolk. <br /> <br /> The women are absolutely incredible, as in unreal. His first wife is annoying chipper and chirpy, the girl, the perfect sophisticated slut, and the last woman a hodge-podge of political bosom. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other masters, Hobarth, I forget the actor's name. <br /> <br /> The hearty preachiness of the script is typically Andrew Davies, author, in his early years, and tiring in the first two episodes (this mini series is 11 episodes long!). At episode 4 I just wanted to get through the blast. <br /> <br /> The music is equally boring, limited mainly to one mawkish piano stamp and a coral sung by the boys during the credits. No cost savings have been made on location settings that provide a visual relief for an otherwise unpleasant viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I like such stories as a rule and am very disappointed with the maudlin nature of this series. If you want to see something that looks about WW1 and its descendants, there are many other finer vehicles to rent or buy. The one who comes to mind is 'The Unknown Soldier' ​​of 1998. The characters in the masterpiece theater presentation are actually fascinating and move one, unlike the 2-dimensional puppets in 'To serve them all my days'. As for films at boys' schools, you keep in mind goodbye Mr. Chips or Tom Brown's Schooldays. <br /> <br /> I know it's going against the overall favorable view of this mini-series, but I strongly recommend thinking twice before getting the Acorn Media for their 4 DVD set, 2 disks on my set was insurmountable with freezing and jumping.
