There is nothing more I hate in a movie than pretentious, and it is one of the most pretentious movies ever made. This is self-awareness in every framework obvious: "Look what a profound, sophisticated film we make," says the director and writers, and say to themselves: "We can see how we hear even more." rather, watch the worst movie of Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer as something like this. At least they gave us honest waste, and at least their films were entertaining in their own horrible way. This film is about as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia, and so it is similar to torture. <br /> <br /> Have these writers ever heard the word "story"? It does not look like it. They have a concept, they are able to create an atmosphere, and they were able to play an excellent role and create good performances from them. And for what? Drilling us for an hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this movie. The only exciting part, and it only lasts about two minutes, takes place when one of the soon-to-be homeowners starts shooting at the state workers who tell him to leave. But nothing comes of it. He did not continue to shoot until he shot the writers. The only redeeming features of this film are the plays and a beautiful photographed landscape at the end. 10/03
