Dear friends, I've never seen such a garbage film as NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems as if director Kevin Tenney had the intention of copying classics like The Evil Dead by Sam Raimi (1978) or George A. Romero's return of the same year's live death. The cinematography was mean, the movie was very dark, so I had to change the brightness control to the maximum. Indeed, horror photos must be dark, but not the way NIGHT OF THE DEMONS. The whole movie was ridiculous, no tension, worse actors except Alvin Alexis in the role of Rodger, and terrible makeup effects. An average voice of 5 stars for that movie? I can not believe it. Perhaps the users were happy about the tits, asses and pussies of the actresses, they were indeed worth 5 stars. Regards, Hans-Dieter
