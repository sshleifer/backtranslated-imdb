Really a big leap forward in the perfection of painful theater. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is bad. Acting (if it can be called), lighting, sound, writing (if there was one), editing, direction, camera work, it's all horrible. There is not a single element that is well done. If I thought it was deliberate, then I can give the film some credit, but I can't believe that people will look forward to making such a hearing movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth buying and watching your worst enemies.
