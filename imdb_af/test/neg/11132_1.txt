Great concept, perfect characterization and voices, but a total waste of time. A real shame since it was aiming higher would probably not be the bomb it was; much too dependent on scatological humor, for starters. I am amazed at the comments of "educated" judges referring to the "good science" behind this piece of puerile waste. Unlike "Finding Nemo," where (with a little bit of disbelief) attention to detail was staggering and science was as good as the context would allow, "Osmosis Jones" was utter nonsense; Don't master yourself about science. Eight-year-old's humor, but subject is more suitable for some unsophisticated teenagers.
