A young man, who never knew his birth parents, received an old farm in a remote area of ​​West Virginia at the death of his natural father. He visits his property with a cross-section of possible victims, including the funny relief black man and a trendy lesbian couple. (Hmm, will there be thin dip? Touch.) Unfortunately, the party ends when the spirits of drifters raised by his evil grandfather and used as scarecrow return for revenge. This movie starts well. A spectacular montage of depression erotic photos and false newspapers set against speech by FDR - this is my first appearance in a killer-scarecrow movie. I developed some hope for the movie, which was partially realized. The story was of sufficient service. The area was sufficiently bucolic. Photography was mostly in focus. The acting, while not good, was slightly higher than the horror films in this budget series. The movie could actually have worked within the strict demands of the genre if the scarecrows were scary. But they were not. They look cheap. They were not scary at all. The better the sample, the better the movie. These scarecrows won't scare Dorothy, let alone Toto.
