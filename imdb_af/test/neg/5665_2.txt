Out of boredom and great curiosity, I decided to watch this show today, as my four-year-old cousin loves it. I had to know it was a show that could only hold a four-year-old. The show was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> First, the show wasn't just funny. The lag track went down at the most inappropriate times, which was very annoying, especially since none of the jokes was funny. The lag track went off at one time or another when one of the cameraman's children said, "I'm going to polish my lenses." How the hell is it funny? The parts in it (like meat bins) that were supposed to be funny were just stupid for anyone older than eleven. <br /> <br /> Now I feel that four-year-olds are not the target audience. . However, since I have a four-year-old cousin who looks at it, this kind of thing worries me while I watched it: It doesn't show very good behavior. In the episode I watched, it shows Sam stealing Carly's sandwich and pushing her to the ground, just as Carly can get up and do the same thing to her. I don't want to see my cousin who's rude. I also don't like the idea that two young girls have a webshop where they give personal information. If it was right, there would be freaks about her. <br /> <br /> This show is likely to be good and funny to anyone who is 11 or younger, but anyone older than that stays away. I will give these two stars as I think I can see how funny it can be for a child.
