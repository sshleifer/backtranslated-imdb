People! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents beg him to kill them because they are going to be senile and want to be exhausted from their misery. Several times he tries to kill them and changes his mind and saves them at the last moment of his death and loses each of his body parts every time in the process. The movie looks as though its main character is being hated, making it more and more painful to watch. There is also the usual love interest and predictable termination. <br /> <br /> This movie was also the first time I saw Tom Selleck without a mustache, and I remember being shaven upper lip and making me feel a little smooth. But it can only have been due to the terrible prospect and lame performance of the movie.
