It was one of the ways I looked to eradicate the positive elements, and because I have been a Nick fan for many years. Some of them would be the stage sets, B-plots, gas stars, and some of the most important actors that were good. I went through the high school in the show, as I quickly grew to despise Jamie Spears, along with the other chicks in the show that couldn't perform. The only characters I looked at were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael & Logan. Quinn is a perfect publisher who eventually started to fit; Stacey is a complete stranger ball; Dustin gets a lot of weird, random situations; and Michael is kind of the righteous right-handed man of Logan. There is a remarkable difference between the performance and acting quality of the B plots they involve, and the A plots that have shown a lot of screaming girls and an iconic "Miss Perfect", repeated bad lines and obsession with guys . This show would have been great if the main sites contain the quality of the sidewalks, but the main features are nothing. When it recently returned to reruns, and I tried to look again, I was called for the girls' deadly act and had to change the channel. However, I would give the previously listed characters credit because they made the show more or less worth it.
