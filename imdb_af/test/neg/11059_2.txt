Audio: <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie with worse sound. There are scenes where people walk through the grass, and you can hardly hear them over their footsteps. They should aim their feet. <br /> <br /> You know how they forget a line in some movies, so they have to put it on a shot from someone's head. Here the editors were not that smart. There is actually a scene where Shannon Tweed's character says her line without moving her lips. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure for their background sound they played effects loops live while shooting, because in many scenes the sound effects will be different or absent when the camera angles change. <br /> <br /> I could write a lot more about how bad the sound is in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other Nuggets: <br /> <br /> In this movie, they probably consider opening credits as special effects because they were so challenging to produce. The capital letter and the first few names in the opening credits are in white text over a white sky, and they blow as if they were carefully painted by hand. <br /> <br /> The reuse of extras in this movie. is incredible. There are about 15 rebels in the throw, but in any given fight thirty or more of them will be killed. If it was just the high quality movie to distinguish who would die over and over. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that the rebels are usually killed by explosions, which are always between 30 and 200 feet away. There is one scene one scene when some rebels run out of their huts in the rebel base and shake one hut if the rebel leaves the door. It makes you wonder if the cabin will last long enough to experience the inevitable explosion. <br /> <br /> There is a blue helicopter that looks just like shorts, but somehow comes equipped with an infinite supply of missiles. When they show that the missiles are being shot from the helicopter's missile boats, they often shoot in unpredictable directions that look very close to large bottle rockets. They still succeed in hitting their targets with ease, which, as mentioned above, is always a very safe distance from the rebels who kill them. Note the recycled footage of the pilot pushing the LIVE button to burn the missiles (because it is vertically pressed, the first few times we saw it, we read it as the "EVIL" button). <br /> <br /> Notice how the grenade launcher they use produces identical explosions to those created by the helicopter missiles. It's also fun in many scenes how the actor shoots in the foreground in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers he kills. And often characters character an excessive number of dots to the soldiers being murdered (such as when a short burst fire kills a large group of enemies). <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is very very bad. The plot was thought of almost as a 5-year-old soccer game, and the editing is the worst I have ever seen. But frankly, it is fun to spend 90 minutes on a group of adults who truly participated in such a horrible movie.
