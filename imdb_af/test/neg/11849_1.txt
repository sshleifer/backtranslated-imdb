<br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER ALERT *************** <br /> <br /> If you like JURASSIC PARK 1, 2 or 3: <br /> <br /> If you are likely to appreciate bad movies for their entertainment value, if not for their quality (case-point John Carpenter's DARK STAR strongly recommended) <br /> < br /> If you look at movies about dinosaurs in general, <br /> <br /> Stay away from this CINEMATIC POWER STYLE! <br /> <br /> The shameless use of CARNOSAUR inventory 1 & 2 makes the most of this unfortunate effort on a dino / slasher movie. Take, for example, the scene where the security guard meets his punishment at the Alpha T-Rex jaw. For some reason he falls about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. Why is it? Simply because this scene was lifted directly from CARNOSAUR, which was a crumbly movie. <br /> <br /> The ending was a carbon copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those who were unhappy enough to sit straight. video loser. Again, we see Mr. Rex battle against a bulldozer that alternates as a forklift - through the wonder of -ta-daa! - stock footage of the aforementioned CARNOSAUR 1 & 2. Of course, the end is exactly the same - the animal falls to its death just as the complex goes up in flames. <br /> <br /> A true insult to anyone's intelligence. <br /> <br /> But it's even better than watching the ROSIE O DONNEL SHOW. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * from ***** <br /> <br />
