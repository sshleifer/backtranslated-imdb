It's one of those movies you find when you stay late and just have basic cable. It's hard to believe this movie was made in '95, as it looks like something from the late 80's. Plucky young people with varied home problems face a demented ice cream man who is on a mission to make the best taste ever: Soylent Cream !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely demented and is just scary in how creepy and absolutely, ridiculously rough it is. Actually, the frightening thing about this movie is the nature of the problems these kids face at home. The fact that these children do not escape from their silent suburban suffering makes a randomly rewarding loosening in the area, resembling a walk in the park. <br /> <br /> The most laughable part of this movie is the fact that the stereotypical "fat child" is, of course, a slender pre-teen with a mountain of stuffing under his pockets sweatshirts. I suspect that either a) they didn't find a suit or couldn't afford it; b) The ruling director was too lazy to get a spicy child star or c) we are honestly supposed to believe that this child is hungry and a very outstretched stomach. <br /> <br /> So if you are at 2 am and need something ridiculous and disgusting to rip your drunk friends, look and look. Personally, I'd rather sleep.
