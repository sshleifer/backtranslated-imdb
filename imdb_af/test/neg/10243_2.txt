It's not the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't feel like pushing my eyebrows to look at Galaxina. It's just not good. The jokes are almost funny, but fall short. All of them. The few gags that come close are hit by repeating them over and over. The production values ​​are good, not existent. The sound is bad, the lighting is bad, ... it just made cheap; too much. The dialogue ... well, often it lacks - very uncomfortable silence; they all just stand around and someone seems to have to say something. The film even looks ambivalent about what it wants - it is not always clear that it is intended as a comedy - as it may have developed after shooting began. It feels like someone's movie project that they threw the night before the appearance, and if they sat there for two weeks, it could have been good. <br /> <br /> And I'm easy to please. I thought, "Mom and Dad, save the world" was a hoot. I like "Pluto Nash". "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite movies. "Spaced Invaders" is close to a classic. This turkey doesn't. "Space Truckers" were more credible. <br /> <br /> Avery Schreiber, who can be very funny, is trying too hard. His part asks for a straight man, and he plays it leaning toward sitcom. Dorothy Stratten is OK in her role, but not particularly remarkable. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the "My watch is always slow." line was funny. I will need this movie all the kudos it can get. <br /> <br /> The spacecraft models are not bad, but they are few and are not being used effectively. The space screens are vague. No passing passes, no detailed pilots, even appropriate action scenes when docked. (The Infinity falls at one point very strange.) Flight dynamics are terrible; Worse than you have seen, they are jerky, not at all. The initial struggle is quiet and static; Although the two ships have shown that they can maneuver in their rugged fashion, they are only a short distance away, reminiscent of a sixteenth-century naval struggle, except not so exciting. <br /> The strangers think whether Star Wars was the Cantina scene. That many rubber masks can be sowed a little quickly, no? A few are used as signatures that are OK for the first time, but not the fifth. <br /> <br /> Graciously, if you're trying to look at Galaxina, you'll probably fall asleep. (I did something else and missed the last ten minutes, and didn't feel it was worth repeating it. If it didn't say "It sucks", I don't know what.) There is a lot of potential, and it could easily have been a good movie. It will be easy to retry and have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> MadKaugh
