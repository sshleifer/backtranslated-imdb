It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I didn't go into high expectations, but once it started, I thought it might be o-k. It wasn't. Jim Carrey tried to try, but he spoke all his lines as if he were a diabolical cartoon character. The other actors all try their best, but are kind of wood. The plot has a good base, but the melodramatic lines make it dull and kind of stupid. I laughed at the whole second half of the movie, and after five minutes I got tired of it. Most plot 'twist' you could see from multiple miles. It's just not worth looking at. I really wish I didn't mess up my time with it.
