It starts out pretty well, but after a while you expect more of this movie than you actually get. Everything becomes unclear and it remains unclear. Czech filmmakers were well over 20 or more years ago. But after moving to the capitalist country, it is Czech non-official but well-known mentality ... COPY ... COPY ... COPY of everything they see as good when they see it in other movies or countries or elsewhere . I think this is a good example of making "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "movie" and money. And it keeps me from the / One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which cannot be compared to this movie in the way of ART and ACTORS and STORY and POLITICS. I think this movie is boring. This can be done better. At least they tried. Sorry guys. :-( CANOT not recommended
