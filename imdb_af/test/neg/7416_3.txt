All of you, I just wanted to give you some crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the makeup FX artists who helped create the "animal" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looks absolutely wonderful. I remember when we got the first pictures from the set, we all talked about how sorry it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor. <br /> <br /> What actually happened was that Jason Palmer made the original make-up for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and shoot many of the creatures again. The saddest part was that Jason had done so a few weeks before and so the redesigned creatures were not as close as great to the original. <br /> <br /> For me it was very sad because it was Jason's final movie, and he was out of his final fame because of the bad re-shoots. Anyway, I thought you might be a little bit interested, and if you want you to switch to mmmyeah.com and look at some pictures behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> Later Jeff
