That's what I asked myself during the many battles, screaming games, curse and general chaos that penetrated the 84 minutes. The equations also stand out if you think of the one-dimensional characters, who have so little depth that it is virtually impossible to care for them. They are just badly written ciphers for the director to adhere to his multicultural beliefs, a topic that has been done in other plays on TV and the theater. <br /> <br /> I have to confess, I'm not really one for a bad performance during a movie, but it should be said that Nichola Burley (as the heroine's best friend) and Wasim Zakir (as the nasty bully brother was absolutely horrible. I don't know which acting school they graduated, but if I were, I wanted to apply for a full refund after rush. Only Samina Awan in the lead succeeds in impressing in a cast of the so-called British talent that we will probably never hear again. At least, that's the hope. Next time, hire another exploration. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thought is the spectacular soundtrack that is like Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Now I'm a music fan and I'm familiar with most of these artists' performances, but I didn't recognize any of the clips during this movie (apart from the ubiquitous "Run"). B-sides, anyone? We get many, many musical settings that telegraph how we are supposed to feel. It is accompanied by such brilliant original images as couples kissed by swollen lake and canoodling in doors. This is a problem as none of the songs convey the mood effectively and we realize that the director does not have the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through stories and dialogue alone. <br /> <br /> The ending is supposedly meant to be just desserts, because everyone gets their arrival and there is at least one big shock in the store. But I resolutely remained unconscious because the scripture did not give me anyone to root. It's not enough to tackle a problem with a button, but you actually have to give a plot that hasn't been killed yet and individuals more than window decoration. As it stands, this movie is a noble failure, with only the promising main actor and a few lightly distracting punch-ups to save it from the bowl. 10/04. Must try harder.
