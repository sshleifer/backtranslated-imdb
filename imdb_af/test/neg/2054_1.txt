I hired this movie today ... the worst movie ever. It was a total waste of time and a terrible story. The acting was terrible, especially by the actor of "Sai". She was so bad, it was ridiculous. I can't tell if it was her bad acting, or because the character was just as stupid in the first place. I can't even mind my mind, just how awful and useless this whole movie was. I'm surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to film this movie and bother it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good Vampire / Horror movie, this is not the movie for you. Move Right! It's a waste of time and money. Heck, I wouldn't even download this movie if someone paid me. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad it doesn't even earn a "1". I wish I could give it a "0"!
