This series is formal and boring. The episodes are the same every week, with slightly different settings. Some pure bad character does a little deadly act, Walker goes after him and it ends in a karate game. The villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all clean, honest and holy, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes completely unwavering by all but the least distinctive fans. Certainly not Norris's best work. His other work can be cliché, but it doesn't usually wake up for weeks. If you enjoy formal, boring, repetitive clichéd snooze fests, then it is for you.
