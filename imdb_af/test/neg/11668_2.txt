A few days ago I watched all three crazy maximum movies and was extremely disappointed with the third installment. It destroys the fine work of the first two films with poor and chaotic action and a story line that changes the apocalyptic Australian desert into a comical sand pit expected in an adventure movie of children. the character of max is unrecognizable from his dark and cynical persona seen in previous films and turned into a predictable uninteresting savior who betrayed me. If you haven't seen this movie yet, simply do it. Let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful hour and a half. (spoiler alarm) The other big problem I had with this movie that really left a bitter taste in my mouth was the pilot. we've seen him in the road rider where he helped maximum and yet, when he appeared again in thunder, the two never seemed to have met. whether he is a different character or a relative of the road users gyro man I do not know. but it is not explained and is a poor element in this overall poor movie. 2 out of 10 do not get a 1/10 due to the thunder.
