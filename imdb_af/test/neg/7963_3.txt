Spoiler Warning !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my least favorite Cary Grant movie. I thought most of the time: ignore him, leave him etc. Is he killing her? Do we suppose that after the end, when he persuades her to go home with him, he immediately kills? I see from reading a few books that this is a reading that some viewers / critics have taken. To finish early is a more reasonable way to make a book movie than to change the end - and this is a more unreasonable change from the end than in Altman's The Long Goodbye, for example. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example of not making the killer the killer because a star was thrown (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's murderous habits aren't mentioned) The end of the book is definitely not excluded no. <br /> <br /> In Robin Wood's Hitchcock's Movies Revised, he writes: "As a spiritual" trick "comes to an end, the meaning of each scene changes, the apparent solidity of the story dissolves, disintegrating the illusion of the 'reality' of the fiction, the film becomes a 'modernist' text in which the process of narrative is at the forefront. 'I enjoy intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else but unless the film is on a straightforward read, fail it, this one fails, even after the deadly glasses of milk that come in a few Hitchcock movies, consider. <br /> <br /> An annoying quarrel The year is 1941. Nothing in the movie says that it has been set in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) holds his money in a Paris Bank, and goes there to do financial business, doesn't he know there is a war? flee from Croydon airport - is he on good terms with the Nazis? How is it, it never suggested the Dui Czar shot him as a spy or something. <br /> <br /> Curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina eat with Isobel, the secret writer and her brother, the pathologist, are a fifth person who never explained or introduced - a woman in a smuggling. The credits say she is Nondas Metcalf who plays Phyllis Swinghurst. Isn't this an example of how lesbians are coded in '40s movies? Should we take her as Isobel's lover? The books that discuss open and hidden gays / lesbians in Hitchcock (eg Robin Wood) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
