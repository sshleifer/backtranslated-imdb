I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this great showtime horror-anthology series, but it was easily the worst of the bunch. It's really bad. Part of this may be because of the poor, if alien, choice of source material. Why didn't Joe just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this soapbox episode where the "message" overshadows the writing, characters, plays, everything, and finally I just wondered if it could get worse and I wouldn't spoil it. it got worse. What stinks of such a talented creative team. Skip this one and buy the John Carpenter one instead. It manages to balance all the elements: horror, humor, character, vision, and it's fun. Homecoming is just as fun as having a bear, taking a shower on you while you sleep.
