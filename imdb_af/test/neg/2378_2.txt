I think it's the first time I'm going inside a theater and going so disappointed. There were two reasons why I visited Astérix et les Vikings: first as a movie buff, and second as a great Astérix fan. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie doesn't meet any request. . It's just a big animated mess and it proves that the Astérix franchise goes from bad to worse. <br /> <br /> In fact, it has been so since the death of the first writer René Goscinny in 1977. His faithful collaborator, illustrator Albert Uderzo, took his place, but the following books have clearly shown the quality of the Goscinny years were present. <br /> <br /> "Astérix et les Vikings" is based on the book "Astérix et les Normands", published during the Goscinny government. The basic story is the same: Goudurix, Abraracourcix 'cousin' comes to town and Astérix et Obélix has to turn him into a real man, while the Vikings come to Gaul to discover what fear is, as fear seems to give wings. <br /> <br /> The similarities end here. What follows in the book is an incessant series of laughs, gags and hilarious dialogue with the result that the Vikings discover fear and flee Gaul. The movie is stupid, indecent, fast, corny ... Well, just call a standard and it has good chances to be applied ... <br /> <br /> The difference between the book and the movie can be more acceptable if the movie was good. But the new ideas just break it into a bottomless pit. Even older Asterix movies such as "Astérix le Gaulois", which have almost passed the lines one by one without changing it, are easier. <br /> <br /> Animation has the quality of other 21st century movies, but it has its faults and any movie beginner can find the mistakes. The biggest example is the continuity error, which follows the day after a fraction of the night, in the same order. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They have taken animation studios from many countries and they still can't make enough movies. <br /> <br /> Changing the original story is simply unbearable. And they could even be if there was no original story. Goudurix, in the movie, has a pet pigeon called SMS and acts as his cellphone (!). Viking chief Grossebaf has a rebellious teenager named Abba (!) And she continually pleaded with her father's authority. There is also a stupid Viking wizard, his cartoonish stupid and muscular son, the faithful bride of Grossebaf who is busy decorating (her name is Vikea!) And ... well, I can't last much longer. <br /> <br> We are far from the original gags from the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen, mainly because the biggest laugh in the books comes from the oral jokes and visual gags that don't have the same appeal on a theater screen. I remember the biggest moments in the book of Obelix laughing at the intruders' names (all of them finished) and Goudurix trying to scare them in ridiculous ways. <br /> <br /> And if not enough, someone in the publicity staff decided to write on the movie poster that there is a pre-existing Céline Dion song that appears in the final credits. If it was a new song, I could have understood it. But using an old song is just another proof that the film is so badly prepared that they are ready to do anything to attract movies. <br /> <br /> The only good point for this movie is that it's so stupid and the end is so bad we can't just walk out of the theater without being cold. In a summer release, it just can't hurt. <br /> <br /> The only other acceptable point of the movie is how Goudurix becomes cheerful. His psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible, while it is better in the film and the motivation point is more credible. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't waste your money on it. Grab the book earlier. <br /> <br /> Oh, René, why did you leave us?
