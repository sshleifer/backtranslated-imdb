It's hard to believe that a movie this one was produced once, but four times! Most movies require a certain "suspension of reality" to enjoy, but this one only takes it too far. The basic scenario is an air force pilot shot over a "Middle Eastern" country. The US government is dragging its feet to repair him and leading the pilot's son (Doug Masters) to a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with the movie is that it portrays the American Air Force as one colossal joke. In the movie you find that Doug and his friends on the airbase are two F-16s, all the ammunition, the fuel, the Intel for the mission, and so on. Can be secure. Security on this basis seems to be a joke. No one has a problem as if a sixteen-year-old child is fully qualified to manage an F-16! <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough, you'd think the producers would at least try to get the ammunition right, as people would like to see things blow. Not so! Several times in the movie, Doug fires off AIM-9 missiles on ground targets. AIM stands for "Air Intercept Missile", which means a weapon used to strike targets in the AIR. He also fires 15-20 missiles, where the maximum can hold an F-16, is 6 AIM-9's. The film also lacks continuity. You will see the plane set up with one set of ammunition, and in the next scene it has a totally different ammunition package. Also, 20MM not only destroys everything it affects! An F-16 holds 500 rounds of 20MM and is mostly used for self-defense. <br /> <br /> I could use plot holes, bugs and live misinformation for the movie forever, but I've won You won't be wearing. If you're in the mood to see a good air force movie, your choices are pretty slim. Most military movies also deal with the army, navy or marines. Up to Hollywood, an air force movie on the lines of "Save Private Ryan" or some good men may come, we will be forced to watch movies like the "Iron Eagle" series. <br /> <br />
