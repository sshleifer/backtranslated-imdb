I hired this movie and expected to suck it, and it didn't let me down. I hired it with a few friends as a joke. But what we got was worse than anyone could ever have imagined. <br /> <br /> It starts sucking before you even take it out of the box. It looks like a Blade rip-off and the man on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie. She called vampire Assassin, but isn't an assassin killing someone? Well, this man kills that of his own will, so it doesn't make him an assassin. <br /> <br /> Then, if you actually put the disk in it, it gets the worst. First of the menu animation is lame. But if you actually start the movie, every thing from the set design to the lighting (or lack thereof) is terrible. You know a movie is bad when the credits even suck. The acting is Laughable. The action is childish. The writing is elementary. And directing is the worst>
