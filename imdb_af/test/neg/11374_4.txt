Whatever of the PC Enforcers section is responsible for this movie, something I've never thought of has been achieved: to take really talented actors (Davis, Hardin and Taylor) and to ensure that you'll never be in a closed space do not meet. The sentiments underlying the script are so young and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine which audience this picture will find appealing, much less funny. Architecture students maybe? <br /> <br /> Only one scene is visually smart: Marcia Gay Hardin sashaying, all the cliffs and rhythm, in a bar, managing more style and energy in ten seconds than the rest of the rest. film added and multiplied to tenth power. As for the other cast members, they will probably not want to place this one on their CV.
