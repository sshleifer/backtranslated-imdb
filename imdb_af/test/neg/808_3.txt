As a South African, who resides in South Africa after a 32-year stay in the United Kingdom, it is a pity to say that this movie is a great disappointment. The three main issues I had with the movie were a) why Swank and Ejiofor - an American and a Nigerian - can play the leaders. This country is bursting with talent and does not need any imports ... b) Gillian Slovo has been trading her fighting relations for years. She is a very mediocre writer, and even her novel does not stand on the folly of Mr Hooper ... and c) Hilary Swank is such a great actor, as proven in Million Dollar Baby (but also Eastwood ), dressed in the contemporary New York style while wandering around the Karoo's poverty. Where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the client and director? Yes, the movie finally moves - how can it not be? - But the overall mood at the conclusion is one of the tremendous ruins. Heart is in the right place, but needs a tailor.
