Jane Russell was a subordinate comedy and singer (see SON OF PALEFACE and GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDS), but you would never guess about her performance. A real stinker, produced by Howard Hughes in his all-successful attempt to kill RKO Radio Pictures. <br /> <br /> The movie makes its first opportunity to show sexy Jane when it takes her in a bubble bath. and then she chastely chanted "I'll be switched (if I'm not cut)" - and that's all downhill from there. In her autobiography, Russell apologized for the movie's "Lookin 'for Trouble" movie because it was so supposed to be. Today you can show it on The Disney Channel. (Incidentally, autobiography says Russell's jaw-biting photo in a bikini, much more sex than anything.
