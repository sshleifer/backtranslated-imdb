It's not terrible, but a waste ... Lousy gags, bad music, poor drawings and animation ... <br /> <br /> Regarding the impressive number of animators and interval lists on this photo (of, hum ... a hundred different studios throughout the world, come on, how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie this way!) I wonder if one man on the credits = one drawing! The lines are rough, the 3d work is inadequate (I'm not against, but not in this movie). But the backgrounds are correct. The storyline is rather stupid, far from the exact smartness of the BD, and of course aimed at an international audience. Spreading a movie around the world doesn't mean everyone in the world should be a simple man. A cultural object is much more interesting than challenging, even when it's a strange movie (French is in this case. It's even worse!). <br /> <br /> Some new things are doing well (the Olaf character, sometimes, as with the stone explanation, but it's not nice), but the modern references surprise (music, SMS note even an oral joke, just a stupid bird called short message service: does anyone know imagination?). But hey, it's a M6 / TPS production with some Celine Dion in it ... pathetic. <br /> <br /> Asterix is ​​under construction and Obelix speaks too much. Goudurix can be big (as in the book), but he is obviously a "cool man" who has a love affair (with an uninteresting female character). In fact, only the vikings (magician singled out) are funny. Too much action, not enough laughter. The best part of the movie is the final credits. Not the music, but the few silent it contains. BD style. Well, Asterix is ​​definitely not made to move!
