This movie is just junk. I must say I am an expert on garbage films. I keep the "1" rating for filthy movies but funny, but this movie is just boring and certainly not funny, but in a funny way. It gets a "2" so that those of you out there can distinguish between the one who will make you laugh and the one who will drop you. There are scenes in this movie where the actors look at something, their expressions are astonished and there are wide-eyed eyes and pouches told to the audience, what they are watching, it's going to be great. It's simply not just a closet or even more desert. It must be terribly godly, terrible for me to walk out, let me tell you, I went out and so did a lot of people.
