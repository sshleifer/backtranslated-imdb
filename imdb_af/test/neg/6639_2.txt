The humor is not in this loser of a movie. Carrot Top plays a surfer dude inventor who blows the rents consistently on his goofy, useless inventions. Then he helps an old man who is broken down the road, and voila, he inherited a large corporation. And over and over about the jealous family members, the corporation empowered, hostile takeovers, the mandatory love interest .. aargh ... let's just say this movie is virtually incompatible. What Root Top achieved is to convince me to never go to his stage shows.
