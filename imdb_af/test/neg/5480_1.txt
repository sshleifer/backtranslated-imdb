This game was terrible. I think they've worked too hard on the footage and haven't done much with the game, it's the most important part. I mean, the footage looks amazing, but is the game really "fun"? NO! I think it's like "hey, let's jump from buildings" and all I do is hold on and A / X. The game is just not there and I disagree with what Ubisoft did because they have this hot girl (the game's maker, Jade Raymond) and they were like "OK we have this hot girl, let's pimp her" and if you go to gambling sites, you don't see games of Assassin's Creed, you'll face her watch with a microphone and it will be like "We fed Jade Raymond over her favorite cookies!" It's like the man, keep the F * @ K UP, who's going?! Apparently ... many people do because they bought the game and like it. I compare this game to Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that really does not abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and delivers the most important part, GAMEPLAY! They could do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still stunning, the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded great, and it was a game that earned the game of the year. Not Assassin's Creed, man, doesn't even deserve to be a NOMINEE for Game of the Year. The hype around this game where it was like "oh it's the next generation of gambling" .... really? I do not think so! So let me get it straight, because I think the people who keep this game just find it because they are Jade fans, so I will tell you, JADE WILL NOT BE WITH YOU OR ANYTHING, IF YOU LIKE IT OR EVERYTHING HAS. game! If you want a REAL game on the PS3, get Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, if you want a REAL game for the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a lot of other games as well), and if you just Want a REAL game in all the systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will be much hated, but seriously, with two buttons to do all these cool things, is it a LOT of fun? The only reason other games make it more complicated is because it will ultimately be more innovative and fun. And this game is just not. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 A LIVING HELL!
