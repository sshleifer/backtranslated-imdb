This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth looking at here. A complete waste of the then rare numbers of Ice-T's and Ice Cube's talents, each of which has proven its ability to act and perform well. Don't save this one, check out New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, High School or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's frightening dialogue alone makes this movie on the teeth, and I still wonder what Bill Bill Paxton did in this movie? And why does he always play exactly the same character? From Aliens, every movie I saw at Bill Paxton, he plays exactly the same annoying character, and at least in Aliens, his character died, making it a bit satisfying. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is second hand trash. There are many better movies to watch, and if you really want to see this one, look at Judgment Night, which is almost a carbon copy, but has a better performance and better writing. The only thing that made it look immediately was a decent hand on the camera - cinematography was almost refreshing, coming close to the horrible movie itself - but not quite. 10/04.
