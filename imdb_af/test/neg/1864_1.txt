This is one of the worst movies ever made. I can't believe how bad it was. I was shocked at the horror of the "ghoulies" masks. They're forever Halloween masks! The mouths don't even move when they talk !!!!! Why did they feel the need to make the ghoulies comic and goofy? When they do anything, they seem to be this circus-like music and overuse BONK and BOING sounds when they hit people. The bondage dominatrix lady is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. This movie is just bad. The plot is inconsistent. The mother of ONE TREE HILL is already in this and she has obviously had a nose job since it was made. Why did the main character of the first movie come back to make this garbage? BAD BAD BAD movie.
