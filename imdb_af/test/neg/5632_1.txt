This movie was pure trash. Not the worse movie ever. If it had to be dismantled, the play was good enough to get the job done, but the writing was so stupid and so stupid that one was going: "Where did my life go?" Even Vanessa Redgrave ~ who I love (and that's why I watched it) was wasted. Completely wasted. She didn't even leave an impression. The direction was so far that none of the characters left me much of everything, but to see that Redgrave left nothing. Her part was nothing. She was good like an average boss, but it was. Depth and she gave depth to small roles. See Venus and Reconciliation. I won't waste my time and was upset to spend the $ 5 on this movie ... I wanted it back. No returns. Skip the movie. It will only bring you sadness ... and boredom.
