Controversial German journalist, Jutta Rabe, who has himself misled the Estonian wreck, puts this silly thriller together to save her investment. <br /> <br /> Of course, Donald Sutherland is always watchable - but he's just in three screens.

The actress playing the Swedish minister's secretary (or whatever she was - she doesn't look like cast) is very bad. <br /> <br /> The writing has some good ideas, and the story is actually interesting. The final script had to be written several times already. Some scenes are simply ridiculous - especially the end tones. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes long. Presented as a 60-minute TV movie, it could have been very interesting. Jutta Rabe may be a good journalist (her ideas on governments using Estonia to transport military items from Estonia to Sweden are closed.) So recently, when the Swedish army officially said they actually used the ship for this purpose. , but as a film producer she sighs. <br /> <br /> The director, writer and actors are sucking more. /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10. I would have given it a 1, if it wasn't for the fact that the story is sometimes interesting, Donald Sutherland is in it and it has real stock. <br /> <br /> But we don't "Don't see the boat's sink! What kind of movie about a ship sinking is it? Like a werewolf effect without werewolves ...
