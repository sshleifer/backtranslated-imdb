I really enjoyed the first movie and when it arrived again, without thinking or watching, I took a family friend to see it. I was ashamed to have inspired so much about it. <br /> <br /> Disney processes the original movie just as the human body processes a nice meal - take something in and look it ... you know. And by having a dark-colored person as the FBI man, the results of the informant's fingerprint are muted. <br /> <br /> As an isolated film, I think it's not as bad as one's that strange kind of thing, but if one reads the book or saw the first movie - horrible!
