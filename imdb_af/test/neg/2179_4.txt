Perhaps it was * an Important Film * and that's why people rated it so high, but honestly it's not very good. In retrospect, it is easy to see that Chaplin (probably already Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the extent of what was really going on in the ghetto. You can't make him too much guilty of the disconnection that a modern viewer touches, but the disconnected remnants. <br /> <br /> More disappointingly, the movie is not clunky; It's as if Chaplin had no idea that movies have advanced in sophistication since the silent era. The solid pieces, which include both the Jewish Barber and the Dictator, do not flow into each other; they sit there just as discrete clues of storyline that progress in pace and begin, move ANY, but never come to the decision. Some are funny, some less so. <br /> <br /> What charm the movie has is strict in the person of Chaplin himself. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole thing, and there is no denial that he had a physical mercy that was wonderful to look at. But almost everything he had surrounded him was offensive. Hannah was also DAMN American. The Storm Troopers were also DAMN American. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! Another thing! I don't know what purpose it meant, since garbage is the source of evil behind the throne. It almost looks like the movie says that if it wasn't for malicious influences like garbage, Hynckle wouldn't be that bad.
