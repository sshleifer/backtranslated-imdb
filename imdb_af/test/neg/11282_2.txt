I walked out of very few movie shows and this movie managed to become one of those I couldn't bear to watch anymore. What the awards it won are the awards awarded by Turkish festivals, I believe are not credible. My only explanation for the award of the Queens Festival was to think that somehow a low comedy was "acquired in translation" as the captions drew the attention of the terrible performances. <br /> <br /> At the start of the show I attended, the presenter briefly talked about the history of the Turkish theater and at one point we mention that the early Turkish theater was suitable as "stage cinema" as much of the filmmakers and actors involved people from the theater scene. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this movie falls right in that category. English speakers reading subtitles may think that Turkish is a naturally harsh language and all the screaming in the movie, but acting indigenous commentators will immediately notice that all actors act with exaggerated loud voices. You can ascribe this to the amateur nature of all actors, but the biggest source of "screaming dialogue" is the main character played by the only professional actor in the movie. Not surprisingly, his background is in the theater. My guess is that in response to his hard line lines, all other amateur actors have also raised their voices, changing the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances. <br /> <br /> On top of all this is a story that evolves into a snail's pace, you get a very boring movie. <br /> <br /> I must also say that I also have a personal problem with Turkish movies depicting rural life with shallow characters. Since then, Zugurt Aga, one of the best Turkish films ever made, has apparently not been able to avoid Turkish film producers' appeal to Turkish film producers. It is only interesting in small doses and if it is so well orchestrated with excellent writing and directing as in Zugurt Aga. Mostly, however, it is extremely boring and honestly anything embarrassing for native "urban" Turks. Rural communities are a neglected, underdeveloped part of the country, and while offering good material for comedy, it is a huge expense for Turkey's image. <br /> <br /> A Western observer whose only exposure to Turkey is this movie will no doubt think that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I wish filmmakers would realize it and leave their passion for the stories of the "rural man" and remain true to the majority of the country, living in cities that scan Europe's metropolitan areas.
