I've been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters since the beginning. The most seductive thing about them was love and innocence and companionship. Kermit was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving. A spiritual character, but sweet and credible. All the other characters were slightly eccentric, but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings interact with each other, with respect for each other's difference. <br /> <br /> Next movies had the same feeling. Yet it is a very happy Muppet Christmas movie, "Jim Henson would be spinning in his grave. These characters are completely rewritten to be horny, nasty, selfish and vigorous. <br /> <br /> The film continues to portray God as a rude corporate headline, with an average streak. Angels as spineless, non-spiritual corporate staff, and the movie was so bad I had to stop watching. I bought it for my grandson, but luckily I see anything I give to a child. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves the garbage dump and has no socially satisfactory content or charm. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame on the people who wrote the characters again and deviated from Jim Henson's original heart-centered, socially-conscious version. It makes a terrible disorder to a big sad man who is no longer defending his creations.
