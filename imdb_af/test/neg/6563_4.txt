Star Trek V definitely deserves the dubious distinction of the worst movie in the Star Trek series. Despite the active efforts of the actors, it suffered from a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not enthusiastic about this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the Enterprise crew enjoying their extended beach leave as a rebound for earth rescue from the total ecological disaster. Their beach leave is cut short when a disorder occurs on Nimbus III, the planet Intergalactic Peace. Captain Kirk and the Enterprise only come to Nimbus III to break their ship through Sybok, Spock's half-brother. Sybok brainwash the crew of the enterprise and set it a suicide mission to talk to "God" just before the Great Barrier in the middle of our galaxy. Captain Kirk should then find a way to regain control of his ship and defend the Enterprise's Klignon pursuers. <br /> <br /> The only light spot in the movie is the play and directing. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill, and the rest of the actors all give good performances. William Shatner also does a good job of directing this film. <br /> <br /> However, the film had a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, the part of Sybok was initially offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. So, Laurence Luckinbill got it. Secondly, many of the special effects are severely cut back ... the entertainment of the movies diminishes. Third, the scene depicting the arrival at the Great Barrier has left much to be desired. Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura in this movie didn't make much sense ... since there wasn't such a romance ever before this point in the Star Trek universe and it's never explained how such a romance suddenly realized between Star Treks IV and V. <br /> Overall, this is a very poor movie. You should probably just overshoot this movie and move on to Star Trek VI. The film and the team, after all, made the Star Trek VI partly to defend themselves after their debacle with Star Trek V.
