Honestly horrible movie, bad editing, terrible lighting, urgent dialogue and scrappy script. <br /> <br /> The lighting at is so bad, there are moments you can't even see what's going on, I even tried to play with contrast and clarity so I could see something, but it didn't not helped. <br /> <br /> They had to find the font in a bag, the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie to succeed this one to keep low store. You can't even laugh at the cheesy'ness. <br /> <br /> Directing and editing is also terrible, the whole movie follows a very tired routine and fails every time it bumbles through the plot that's so bad it's just unreal. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to say because it is really bad and nothing like Jean-Claude Van Damme's previous work you can enjoy. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the poster, honest words, fail me to condemn this "movie".
