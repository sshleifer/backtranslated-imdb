No words can describe how horrible this movie is. She, like the director, took literally as a film in a film and published it to the public. <br /> <br /> The play in this movie is terrible, The plot is so stupid, and the death of every character is laughing badly. Some silly screens include Akshay Kumar, who pulls a gun from the north to kill a hologram (yes a hologram), Akshay Kumar carrying a bazooka around the city. Rajat Bedi is defeated by a poorly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth double penetrating Monisha Korella (How did they think it was straight?). Also, I want to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. The scene that supports this statement is when Kapal has the motorcycle and somehow wins the glasses. The shopping case seems to have been done in micro-paint. <br /> <br /> The best parts in this movie are with Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that he even makes God feel scared. In one scene, he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it. Chuck Norris's roundhouse has nothing to do with it! He is even so powerful that he can fly to India within 10 minutes of London! Overall, this movie may be the worst movie in the universe. If you have to see it, look for the hilarious thing that is going on (VAT is supposed to be serious)
