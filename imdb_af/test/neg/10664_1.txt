In Bollywood, worthless movies don't get hit, good movies flop and good actors don't make it big <br /> <br /> AKS is such a movie <br /> <br /> music director and singer tried to happen. The hell man, just because his songs have become a hit, which means he'll be an actor next time. <br /> <br /> The producers were sure the movie might work, the songs were also a hit and of course Himesh has his cheap publicity as usual <br /> <br /> The film tells such a poor story , such a poor direction, so poorly acting, it approaches you <br /> <br /> Indian rickshaws in Germany, Stunts at Himesh and lots of stupidity Himesh's cap is intact, even when in the car some summer sultans <br /> <br /> Direction is poor Music saves grace, although most songs sound the same. <br /> <br /> Himesh tries hard, but unfortunately his emotional scenes are a joke, no expression, he is best suited to his music director and some sing. He cut a sorry picture. Hansika is terrible. Malika is right. Sachin Khedekar is good, Dars han Jhariwala hamme
