I wish I could have voted this movie a ten, that's funny. If they meant it would be so funny, I'd give it a ten. I have to give it a 1, but it's the funniest darn 1 you'll ever want to see. See the giant blur flash over the screen! Where did it come from? What is it? It's flying, it's scary, it's electrifying, it's on strings! This bird has real personality. I was about ten when I first saw it, and when Big Bird appeared on Sesame Street, I was sure they were one and the same!
