Why does the poster and artwork say: "Clubbed is one of the best British indie movies I've seen in a very long time. SCREEN INTERNATIONAL" when it was quoted by the French distributor by Screen International (an influential film trade publication ) has been reported. See www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39811 which reads: <br /> <br /> "Pretty Pictures has acquired all the French-language rights at Neil Thompson's Clubbed .... James Velaise, Pretty Pictures President, said: "Clubbed is one of the best British Indie movies I've seen in many years." "<br /> <br /> Isn't it rather misleading? The distributor must say it's good. Are the other quotes really?
