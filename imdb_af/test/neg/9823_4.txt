Hellboy turns to classic comic book / action / superhero genre story lines. In essence, Hellboy is a kind of demon who found his way on earth. He is raised from a child by a priest and within a government association and has chosen to protect the people of the earth from the supernatural, rather than a threat (the normal career of a devil). <br /> <br /> Setting up the story involves creative uses of history, combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It is ominous, but so is the whole idea of ​​a devil who roams the streets. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how they handled very well. The rows are up to the point and very entertaining. In fact, the opening is the best part of the movie, the problem lies in it. In essence, Del Toro who both writes and regulates this piece, flashes it. The film is absent from any tension or any great conflict. Hellboy is essentially unbeatable in the first play and so the rest of the movie is made up of scenes in which any conflict is automatically better because we know inevitably that Hellboy will be OK and the bad man will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action / hero movie. Well that's it, but once we're recorded in a well-made action movie, we can't help but feel the hero can die. The Hard work because John Mclane is likely to die on all parts. He escapes death through the thinnest margins. The input is increased as his wife is also in danger, and so on? Terminator and Terminator two work, because in both cases the villain is much better than the hero. The threat and tension are constant. <br /> <br /> Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of using deus ex machina. Characters usually disappear and appear again as their skills are needed in the story. The villain appears in maybe three screens. He has no motives. Arrive unexpectedly and inexplicably. In one scene Hellboy seems to be a real threat (groups of monsters) a character unleashes her abilities - the screen blows to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead, but everyone lives. A small character who becomes an annoying and undeveloped love story becomes the key to closing the film. Her character is so thin, the relationship is so undeveloped. Obviously she is nothing more than a plug to push the plot together and make it all meaningful. I don't want to ruin the end of the movie, but in essence, a character who is dead is miraculously and incredibly revived. <br /> <br /> The movie suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just aren't smart or funny. After a while it all began to stir. <br /> <br /> What's more, Del Toro blows action scenes with some uninspired visual sources. And anyone who made the creative decision to make the armband's primary weapon a gun instead of his claw should be discharged. In essence, the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film, which does not break down the battles more than a one-sided shoot. <br /> <br /> The few positives include: The cinematography is very good. There is a feeling of mood at all times by the dark lighting and the darker color palette. As well as using interesting places. But maybe it's a bit the same. <br /> <br /> The use of CGI and FX is well done. We never get an overload. When effects are used, they are well used and the sense of realism is preserved. Rather similar to how Nolan FX used batman. I prefer this method much to the overpowering effects we see regularly. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a pretty poor movie. The real shame is that (despite not reading the cartoons) I wasted the movie a lot. Hellboy as a character has many seemingly fascinating dimensions that are completely unexplored. The movie has viewing capability, in the sense that when it comes to TV and nothing else, it might be worth watching. But in any other situation I would not bother.
