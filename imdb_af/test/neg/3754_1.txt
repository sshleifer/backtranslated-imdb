Full disclosure: I was born in 1967. Initially, the prospect has tickled me. If you were a teenager in Reagan's age, a trip to the memory lane was worth a laugh or three. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock 'em Sock' em Robots? Beloved, it's not * despite being goofy, but * because * they were goofy and stupid and fun. But when VH1 decided to make the series "I Love Last Tuesday" I knew that was enough. Will Hal Sparks have nothing better to do than reading a teleprompter how idiotic Slinkys is? (Wait, let me look ... hmmm, no. No, it doesn't seem like he does.) Snarky, snotty uber-hip posture has its place, but enough!
