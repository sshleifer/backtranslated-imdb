I can't believe how bad this movie is. To begin with, the film deals with the legend of Big Foot and a group of people who have a close encounter with the creature. The point of departure is interesting and with Lance Henriksen in the cast (ALIENS) the "Ontold" gave a promising prospect. Unfortunately, it is as interesting as it gets. It looks like a direct DVD release ... or so I think. It's basically a production-less affair with probably the worst editing (with a constant "blur to black" between each scene !!!) I've seen in my life and acting that will make you sure. Why Lance Henriksen chose, it's completely unholy. And the movie takes up almost any other genre movie, from "Blair Witch Project" (the video scene) and "Predator" to "Alive". It is supposedly based on true events, but the only truth found here is just how BAD is this movie. I am usually not a hard critic and believe me, I have tried to enjoy this trash, but did not eventually do so. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this DVD. <br /> <br /> I'll try to put it mildly: This movie is PURE garbage and it has caused me to take my gun and shoot my neighbors ... or ask BLOCKBUSTER for a refund !!! <br /> <br /> And Lance, ashamed! 1 * out of 10 *
