It is an amazing standard of Western, which contains bad acting, dull storyline and stupid acts. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, perhaps, is how incredibly formal this movie is. It has all the usual cliches, even a barber and the movie really has no surprises in it. This makes it a dull and a poor Western look, even in the least, because it's so poorly made. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a small production and the movie looks like it was shot in 30 days. Directing and editing can be badly mentioned and all the actions that appear in the movie are incredibly stupid. It may be almost humorous to watch, for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> The story isn't that interesting either. It is a nice friendly western (so no blood), about which some strange reason seems to be against the younger brothers, portrayed in this movie as good and very friendly guys. The story becomes more soulful and soulier than it leads to its end. The younger brothers really existed and were part of the James-Younger gang, whose well-known brothers Frank and Jesse James were also part of. Of course, they were not as friendly in real life as depicted in this movie. It was just named for an early '40's to have similar man characters in it. It wasn't really the Spagethi-Western century that the main characters were really rotten. Oddly enough, it approached, but always worked out better than that of the early western in which the main character is on the good side of the law. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie original is the fact that it's shot. color. It was something unique for a 40's western and still gives the movie something extra. However, you can wonder why they shot this western in full color. The film is still in the style of a black and white early western, and I actually believe this movie would have been a little more credible if it were in black and white. <br /> <br /> You can easily do without these westerns. <br /> <br /> 4/10
