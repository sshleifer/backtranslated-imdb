The only entertaining thing I got to watch this movie was watching Star Wars coming through the movie wall (yes, I'm going to a very bad theater). This movie is so annoyingly bad that I think I'd rather scrape my eyes out of a cat rather than see it again. Let's compare it to the original one. One is charming, funny, exciting, well behaved and one of the best movies ever made, the other is so far from funny that everything you can do hopes your eyeballs will fall so you no longer have to look . I'm sorry Christina Ricci is a good actress, but can't compare to Hailley Mills. I don't even get to see Doug E. Doug in one part occupied by the amazing and absolutely beautiful Dean Jones. Dean Jones's small part in the new version is the only partially redeeming part of this movie, and that's the only reason I can justify a 1 * rating (also because the imdb doesn't have negative effects).
