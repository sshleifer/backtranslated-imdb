After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself disappointed in Hollywood to make such a stinker. Gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940s that have made one proud to be an American, to fight the evil that desires abroad and death in the house. What we left behind is dribble at the mouth of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men who have returned from the war. One comes down to out of control madness, which culminates in his death. The cartoonist devastates his country in a time of war and at the same time destroys his best friendship with his fiancee. The third is truly the hero of the story and prefers to continue the battle that was brought to our shore about eight years ago. What makes this movie bad is not the play, but the point of departure for that. We have led to believe that decorated soldiers are actually enemies of our country. Destruction is similar to betrayal in a time of war, and the main characters flirt with it throughout the movie. This paradox is designed to weaken the audience's response to the central act of the movie. We are not supposed to find fault with King, as he wears medals, but his actions don't just deserve them, but weep for them. He's not an anti-hero. To accept the movie, the audience must accept the correctness of abandonment because the story paints King as nothing but a hero. I can't accept it because it's like asking me to call the sky on a bright blue day. In addition, there is a mockery for the real hero, the man who enters his country again and stays. I would only recommend this stinker to anyone who needs convincing Hollywood decay, as it is a clear example of that. No wonder it did badly in the box office.
