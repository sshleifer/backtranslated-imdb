I really didn't like this movie !! It was boring and didn't really interest me. I'm more of an action girl, and it has NO. I rented and rented this movie because the other comments were left. But it was completely deceived! Don't get this movie unless you enjoy the dessert and lots of boredom. I just didn't really like the movie. It wasn't my style, but it could be yours. You just have to see the previews or something, but it is my recommendation if you are a girl. don't get this movie! This Scandinavian production uses some of the observational strategies of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi, which allows us to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and flowing points of view. it's just not for me!
