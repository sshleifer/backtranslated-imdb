When I saw the first octopus film, it was a laugh to see the cheesy and frightening effects. This movie looked like it was for the acting, but not the special effects. After Jaws and Piranha, make sure, don't make a movie about a killer octopus? The octopus penetrates the New York waters, where two police investigators try to stop the cattle from appearing before 4 July. <br /> <br /> A fun, clean plot and descent event, but the octopus was pretty upsetting, it's nice to see they actually made it, but it looks like a piece of plastic. Better on a big budget, really, this movie can be a good look. There are a number of mistakes that won't surprise me if they don't investigate the way octopus lives. <br /> <br /> See if you want cheap DVD successors, otherwise you're better off watching Jaws.
