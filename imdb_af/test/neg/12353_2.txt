Rabbit Fever is a spectacular collection of sketches. Each one focuses on a female personal device made popular by a single episode of sex and the city in 1998 (the latter half of 1998, rather than the early episodes all by women). From the opening of statistics that makes Rabbit Fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a sea of ​​predictable sketches with true and imaginary characters in a global amok with women's addiction to lonely pleasure. <br /> <br /> Men, as Germaine Greer rather arrogantly explained, invented a women's gadget that made men in the bedroom redundant. The Rabbit Vibrator (which represents some a quarter of all vibrator sales) is so named because of small rabbits such as long ears that vibrate to stimulate the clitoris, while the rotating beads within the shaft stimulate the inside of the vagina. The films support characters who attend Anonymous to help overcome their "addiction", as well as well-known people such as Tom Conti who position as professor or Richard Branson (amid scenes of rabbits banned from aircraft). He wants to offer free rabbits. to its first class airline passengers and finally to everyone. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the movie is that the idea is not enough to sustain 85 minutes of theater, the sketches do not have the writing skills to say a Charlotte Church or Ricky Gervais to them funny enough to make, and while it may make a desperate late-night TV, they don't have a hook to let people in the public stand on the multiplexes to watch masturbation jokes. <br /> <br /> Lines like: "It's almost a week since you used your rabbit. How are you?" Turn slightly thin after five minutes. The film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word 'rabbit' will get a laugh. . . and another one and another. Strange midnight drives to buy batteries can be fun in real life, but here it looks rather difficult. The special emergency service is warmly welcomed. <br /> <br /> The BBFC has remarkably given it an 18 certificate despite zero violence, virtually no explicit sex, and sexual references that are less 'distorted' than any late night comedy program. The company objected to the decision, but the BBFC did not quake. At first glance, it seems to be on their side and their consumer advice now simply says: "Contains regular strong sex references." One might think that youngsters will find masturbation jokes, prettier than the most desperate of night parties, and the topic that is worth debating; but Rabbit Fever does not even have the saving grace of a balanced approach to his subject. <br /> <br /> The best part is probably The Rabbit Song by Ruocco (who plays a band called Thumper in the movie). For those who have done away with and woke up at the end credits, there is a bonus scene at the end of them to ensure they have missed nothing.
