I rented this movie from my local movie shop, and I don't really expect something to flash or fancy. Since it was a "B" grade movie, it was made on a very tight budget. The opening styles of the movie were quite original and so was the plot and that's what made me movie. However, the film becomes very boring and frustrating on points. The story had a lot of holes in it and the acting also had a fair share of disappointments. By the end of the film, I prayed that a higher force would hit me where I was lying, as I was very bored, but more frustrated with how the story turned out. I still don't understand what actually happened and I don't care. In conclusion, the devil would cry in disgust to know that hell (his domain) was used as the basis for such a crappy movie.
