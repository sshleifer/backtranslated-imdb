I saw this movie in a cinema club in Germany in 1970. Most of the participants were from the local private school where I was teaching. I used to see some Godard movies while living in France, and although they were not my favorites, I could at least make sense of them. To speak French has helped. <br /> <br /> The fairly harmless start of the Le-week end soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images, very well, perhaps photographed too well, it didn't make me sense at all. For me, movies like books must have a clear sense of meaning. It didn't do for me. I think I'm not "in" art films. Images still haunt me from the movie. To date, I refuse to eat rabbits meat, loved by the French. Those who watched the movie can realize why. Yes, the theme of materialism came through, but cannibalism, the car wreck, and all the other scenes of destruction and horror made me sick. I'm not sure I was out before the end, but I definitely felt like that. I promised myself I would never see another Godard movie, and I didn't and will never know. <br /> <br /> My review: nothing. It was the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. Others may be more clumsy, stupid or stupid. I forgot them while screens of this one will haunt me forever.
