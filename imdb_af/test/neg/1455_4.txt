Overwhelmed mob mob comedy. Director Demme breaks the actors into a few funny lines to make the audience laugh, and not miss the next line. Seems weird - this director made "Silence of the Lambs" - now there is the way to use pauses! Casting looks like it. Mathew Modine too young for FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love interest! Dean Stockwell does a Jack Nicholson thing with a crook, and he gets a nomination for it! Plus, should we accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a mob lawyer are interrupted with just one rule each - they should be the knobs. Song Score by Chris Isaac is completely out of place - better for a movie like "Pretty In Pink." Repair this movie, it's worth it, but with the right casting and director and the satire will come through ... even the often repeated "Forgedaboutit."
