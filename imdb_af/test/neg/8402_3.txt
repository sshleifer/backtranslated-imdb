I heard that Novo is compared to Memento for the simple fact that they both rely on key characters who suffer from short-term memory. Well, it's like comparing the silence of the lambs and Friday the 13th, as both had a character that killed several people. They can't be further apart in ideas. <br /> <br /> Novo deals with a cops at a company that has short-term memory loss. He is consistently followed by another man and his boss likes having sex with him in the office. In comes a temp that also gets involved with him and may not use him for sex. Needless to say, he has a lot of sex on the screen. <br /> <br /> Wait, there's more. There is a boy running in the awkward amnesia and it is clear that there is more to this boy who just stumbles into him. And there is a notebook that the man likes to remember important clues. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm not one of foreign films. I don't mind reading the captions, but I think it sometimes detracts from one of my favorite aspects of a movie: big dialogue. Since they have to translate, or I can't understand for the most part, I really believe they simplify what the characters have to say. This movie was no exception; The dialogue was just, well, blah. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it was interesting enough to keep me around for 98 minutes. Weird, yes, but again I don't live in France, so I'm not so familiar with their likes / dislikes or lifestyle. (As I think it is acceptable for a father to lie back and forth with his son on the beach. It must be a cultural thing.) Fortunately, it was not two + hours of time invested to see this man regained its past and progressively progresses to its healing. Because when the "secrets" are taught, was I really? Well, okay then. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend for somewhat decent, sincere people and soft porn sexual situations (like every 2-4 minutes), but if you're not in that kind of scene, I would completely eliminate this slow moving and memory recovery movie overloaded.
