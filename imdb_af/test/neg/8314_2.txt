"Dead machines" take a pretty good condition for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts killers being sent out to eliminate a crime base's opponents) and turn it into an unwavering mess. I rarely saw such a combination of small budget, bad acting and incoherent writing released as a so-called movie. It's easily the worst martial arts / action-oriented movie I've seen in years, even obscuring the "Ninja Holocaust" (which had at least some good energetic tones). <br /> <br /> The real "star" of the movie is the white "Dead Machine" (it's basically its vehicle), so it prominently appears in many more scenes than its two cohorts. He's in good shape, and he doesn't look bad, but as an actor he is almost there - thinks Chuck Norris in "The Octagon", just without any energy or emotion. This is, of course, a deliberate choice of actor and director. .. but you have to be Arnold to pull off this kind of thing, and this man is not Arnold. <br /> <br /> The film (and director) can't find the time (or budget) to film the scenes that would answer the basic questions it originally posed, such as: Who was the shadow that the mysterious Asian lady gave her orders? How did the "gang war" end? Why did the mush-mouthed Asian lady decide to kill her zombie assassins? And what happened to the accident causing her assistant to die and carry a katana like a broomstick? <br /> <br /> However, it is time to film a very strange battle in which a sailor (well, like Popeye looks) destroys a bar because the jukebox is not working. It is only related to the rest of the movie, because in the process he is also KO's film "hero", a bartender / karate student who was the victim of the first major task of "Death Machines" ( he cut off his hand while killing them his teacher. This follows one of the most unnecessary "love stories" between the hero and his girlfriend I have ever seen. The victory doesn't make sense - at the end of the fight she fights over his split body, and the next thing is in a "tasteful" shadow-fitting of sex and love that looks like it comes from a Hallmark card . VAT, we never see the sailor again. <br /> <br /> Wait until you see the riot between the killer and his captain - it is as if the director and screenwriter never actually saw a movie in a police station, but heard of their second-hand audience. and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked. <br /> <br /> The movie is a handbook case of poor casting and community-scene actors running without proper direction. The three "Death Machines" occur like clods; the "hero" knows his lines but cannot carry the movie, as his character is an ineffective lash; his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; and all the other small parts are barely vigilant. All this makes for a pretty poor movie - but the "dragon lady" does more to drag the movie into underground stinker than anyone or something else. She looks ridiculous; Her tiny, indelible face is overwhelmed by her ton-o-hair skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe, and she speaks with a terrible mush-mouth delivery that shouted "needed time with a dialogue. coach". Poor lady - she was obviously out of her element, and as far as I know, never appeared in a movie again. <br /> <br /> Add a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never closes and plays nothing that is appropriate or interesting; Crappy film stock and lighting; fight choreography that is strictly hungry; and a general around dreaminess and lack of energy in blocking and stage business ... and you have one lame movie. <br /> <br /> It's part of a 50-movie DVD compilation, so it costs me about 50 cents to watch it. It wasn't worth it. Feb!
