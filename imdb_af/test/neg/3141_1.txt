Looking for something shocking? Good stuff ... the images are. It's about it. This film attempts to make profound connections with the audience through various symbolism and eventually becomes irritating. I'm not quite sure if the director's purpose was to portray a deep message to his audience, or just trying to make hell out of gore, sex and violence. I think it probably was the first ... but in the failed attempt. It eventually became a piece of artificial garbage with lots of blood, some stupid characters, and an over-reliance on religious symbolism. If you are looking for an independent film to criticize for its attempt to use metaphor ... it has. If you're looking for a gore flick that will make you disgusting and uncomfortable ... here you go ... If you're looking for a movie that won't annoy you at all, because you realize it was stupid eventually. .. the movie was stupid ... and you will never get back those minutes of your life. It's certainly the movie for you!
