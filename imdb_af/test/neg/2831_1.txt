First of all, this is one of the worst soft core straight to the cable "erotic thriller" I've ever seen in my life. Of course, as all erotic thrillers want, it's about a brothel, ma'am, and put in a brothel. This, of course, makes the softcore simulated sex that pops up every 10 minutes, looks "in context." Whatever. <br /> <br /> For a moment, forget that it was never meant to win awards. The actors are horrible and their line reading curled me. The woman who plays the female police is so bad that it is out of description. She must be a really good friend of the guys who put the movie for this terrible adventure, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are only slightly higher than porn. Other than that? I think if you're really drunk and you need something to laugh, it would be a perfect movie. And if that's the case, I recommend sending all the screens with the female cop quickly. What is that accent, Brooklyn? Hilarious!
