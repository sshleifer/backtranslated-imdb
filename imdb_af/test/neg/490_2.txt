First, the genre of this movie is not comedy, it's more of a drama. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations on the movie, and yet they didn't show up. As some of the other reviews show, there is good music in the movie. But if you want to listen to good music, I suggest spending the time on a concert recording with Bon Jovi, or MÃ¶tley Crue, it will be more quality. Last if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rock'n'roll genre, I recommend "Almost Famous".
