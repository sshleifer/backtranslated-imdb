I'm just ready to look at Goliath. Wait for me to order from my library. I remember vaguely years ago and wanted to see it with my son. Anyway, the movie was running for less than 2 hours and I thought it was much longer when I first saw it. The back of the VHS box states that the Goliath "emtombs have a Nazi file whose secrets could destroy the eternal world forever." The divers were presumably on a secret mission to retrieve the demonic document. There is nothing said about recycling this document. Also, the box says the "bestial ship's insatiable kettle feeds on human blood." This would make it a horror movie and there was nothing in the movie about it. I can't remember the details when I watched TV this year ... but could the back of this box really be true? Maybe the 3-hour movie revealed more details? <br /> <br /> Just wonder if anyone knows about this.
