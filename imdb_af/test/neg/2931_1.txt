I believe this movie was a terrible waste of my time and I will know after watching it five times in class. This movie does not show what happened perfectly during these times. No one can really say that these things happened to the letter. If at all, the only good part would be the actors, even though they were really really crazy. They read the scripture without expression. very boring. I'd rather watch play school. so I definitely never want to see this movie again in my whole life. This is a total waste of time, unless you want to waste your time and if you want to see an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981.
