Such a BS movie. It's just a few stupid anti-Russian propaganda, with a full BS plot, not related to the book at all. <br /> <br /> The production team seems to have got more money from the people who ordered the movie than they could ever get to sell the movie. The plot of the film contains references to some of the actual recent events in Russian and other parts of Eastern Europe, but places them in such a way that it has nothing to do with reality. It seems like the movie is a brainwashing tool, helping Russia to be a place populated by evil people who always dream of killing someone. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are hundreds of stupid bugs such as using the USSR card instead of Russia when news reports are being run, displaying a crowd with Ukrainian flags and commenting on Russian elections. <br /> <br /> There are also many bizarre episodes (that is, a character is already in the Red Square in Moscow and in a second he is in the center of Sophia, Bulgaria).
