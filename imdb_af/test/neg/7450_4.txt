'Ernest Saves Christmas' is comedian Ernest's Christmas special film. In this film Ernest must find a sequel to Santa Claus to continue Christmas. Along the way he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important to Santa's (I will not tell you what it is, you just have to watch the movie for yourself). Like most Ernest movies, there is a lot of slapstick humor involved. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably one of Ernest's best films. It's funny, and it has some important lessons to learn about friendship and family and not afraid to show love. It's not the best Christmas movie, but it's a good one to get you in Christmas. It's a little sad that the movie is a bit dated.
