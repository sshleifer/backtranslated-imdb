(It could have a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I first watched the movie, I thought it was OK. The music was good and the bizarro dream sequence I was willing to forgive, but the lack of appearance in the main character and all the other characters for the case made me uninteresting to watch the rest of the movie. (I know completely in vain.) The music at the beginning was enthusiastic and appropriate, I thought for a mock Gothic novel. But come on! Saxophone music for an early 19th-century film? It didn't fit properly. This movie was totally boring and if you want to see a good movie or an Austen, don't rent Northanger Abbey! I give it a 30%. 30% = a dripping degree!
