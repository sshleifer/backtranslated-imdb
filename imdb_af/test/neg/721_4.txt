I borrowed this DVD from the director of a movie in which I work, playing an actor playing Prospero. Knowing his own style, I didn't expect anything like a "classic" interpretation of the text. <br /> <br /> What I found is sometimes striking, sometimes tempting, but often winding and annoying. As in most experimental music, I find that in movies like this, the building blocks of powerful movies are made, even though they haven't found their most useful form in a more coherent format. <br /> <br /> So we've got a Caliban who is more a clown than a threat, and who doesn't even look like Miranda is terribly scared (which is strange as we know he at least once tried to rape it). A Stefano and Trinculo that are more annoying than funny. A strange young Prospero that looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot by creative editing and strong styling. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I don't have a problem with the way Ferdanand or Miranda is portrayed. His stupid rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but an experimental one. One that pose great risks, but is more intended for students of art and film and not for anyone with an interest in the Tempest for their own sake.
