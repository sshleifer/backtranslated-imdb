This show, Paranormal State, has an almost "Blairwitch Project" feel. As you look, you look at a 'documentary' that is actually just a written film made to look at a documentary. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the show is their Warren's outside advisors, who have been announced for their "investigations" of the Amityville killings, which have been shown to be totally deceptive, based only on the police reports of the family's deaths! (Like the oldest daughter actually involved in the whole thing, to the point of even helping with some of the deaths!) Then there is the way they are constantly jumping to blame demons for everything. Not to mention how proud the group is about what matters they take. They do not want to help those who need it most, they just want the strangest cases, which will get the most pressure and attention. <br /> <br /> They are complete fraud, simple and simple.
