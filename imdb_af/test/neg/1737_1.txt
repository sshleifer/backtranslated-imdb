Serious movie. Nothing more needs to be said. Aaron Carter is completely repulsive and the rest of the throw should fire their agents immediately. It's really a terrible horrible movie from start to finish. I wish I could be more eloquent to describe the movies a lot (oh so many) mistakes, but I can't be bothered / become too angry to form proper sentences. <br /> <br /> In short, I have absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in "such a bad" kind of way. <br /> <br /> It was unsaturated drag. <br /> <br /> Gavin
