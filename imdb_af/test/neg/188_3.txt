Delicious Candace Bergen as a primary Victorian beauty kidnapped by Sean Connery as a devilish Sheikh desert! How can you go wrong? How? Oh, let me count the ways! Earthy, primitive Sean Connery, exactly the right man to form a brittle, elegant beauty like Candace, is. . . Well, sublime in the role. This is because, instead of having a dialogue about real issues ("you are a woman ... I'm a man!") He must be nonsense about the "will of Allah" and "the wind blowing over the desert sins. "John Milius, a director known for the worship of naked male bodies and brutal military power as any insight (or interest) in conventional human relationships, has a crazy way to cut away from his desert lovers. every time it looks like Candace can kiss. Instead of looking at nature, his career with two wonderfully attractive people takes in a picturesque landscape. We are treated to endless (and I mean END) shots by Brian Keith who makes his walrus whims flashing and delivers funny sermons on the joy of being Teddy Roosevelt. . I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but watch him test his new gun or make a speech about the heroic death of a big bear, but don't excite me about the way the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would have no. . . if it was actually going! The strange thing is that Milius spends most of his time building up characters and story lines that have no resolution. Candace's two small children in the story both get screen time as they do. There is no humor, no chemistry, no sizzle, in any of the things that happen to her in the desert. Unless you think it's funny that her hair is running around for a few weeks, her hair is still perfect. <br /> <br /> The only "real" moment in the story is when, at night, Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter from a healthy sleep on soft pillows and says, "We must escape." The girl turns around and, without missing a friend, answers, "but Mom, I slept!" That one rule summarizes what is really missing from the story. No danger, tension or sizzle in the basic story line, of a cultured woman in captivity. She (and her children) are both so meticulous and caring that it's hard to believe anyone has acted on their destiny. <br /> <br /> Remember, if Candace itself said the line, it could work better. . If the tension arises from her enjoyment of her captivity (or her joy of being in the arms of Sean Connery) and her guilt over all the problems caused by her kidnapping, then the story would have had tension. But Milius makes the strange assumption that the audience worked just as if he's over or Teddy Roosevelt gets the chance to prove his masculinity three thousand miles away. In the end, the beautiful woman and her children do not seem to be condemning him. . . And since they're in the middle of the story, the whole thing looks rather dry and endless. . . like the burning desert sand.
