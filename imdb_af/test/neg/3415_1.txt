This movie is not worth posting in the VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are two bounty hunters in love, but they are total opposition. She is ambitious and organized while being retreated and completely scattered. <br /> <br /> In this movie, bad guys are staring at Jersey Bellini (Dudikoff's character). It opens the door to bad Godfather impressions, ridiculous battle scenes, and Tony Curtis plays the most slightly-looking mob boss I've ever seen! The end must be the most ... amazing scene I've seen in a movie for some time. I would believe that the Terminator, even the Matrix, has a better chance of being true than this end! This movie only series of cheapness. The writing had to hit someone as absolutely ridiculous. Yet, the green light has been given for this piece of dung that has to be dropped and dropped onto the unsuspecting public. I watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we were cheated. No one in the group can say anything good about the movie, except it was over.
