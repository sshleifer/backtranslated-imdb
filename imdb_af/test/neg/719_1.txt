I have read all of Shakespeare's plays, seen and performed and directed a majority of them. I don't necessarily believe that Shakespeare should be done in the traditional way, but I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> There is nudity that is unnecessary and unnecessary. There are grotesquenes that are far off what I believe Shakespeare means. Some of the dialogue is incomprehensible, and there are those elements, such as the song and dance that give no meaning to the movie, but replace Shakespeare with the director's self-abandonment. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say I wasted quite good money buying the DVD from this movie.
