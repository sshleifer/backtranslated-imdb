Allegedly, the "true story" of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (yes, the same who financed Columbus's expedition) is the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, Archduke Philip of Austria. known as "The Handsome" (and played in a rather unispired way by Italian hunger Daniele Liotti, at his most buttery and beefy here). It is an award-winning well-known story of the late 15th century, early in the 16th century. intrigue, betrayal and throbbing ripping. It drops destructive lust from beginning to end. But while La Reine Margot manages to entertain cruel sensuality and relentless, cut-throat intrigues to watch, Juana La Loca just doesn't pull off. It ends up just like a big-budgeted soap opera, with below average, lazy or excessive acting. Liotti looks positively bored and Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in the title role ?? Although fair, she may fall into proper talent ?? It seems like I'm trying too hard to switch back and the fourth of two-dimensional horns, to amazing teenage hysteria all the way through. Some of the supporting role players are OK, with the exception of Manuela Arcuri, another Italian stuff, full-blown and beautiful, but really no "actress" to talk about. I couldn't really feel any concern about any character, nor did I feel negative about any of the suspected villains. What a waste of a considerable movie budget! This one is unfortunately just as rhetorical and deja-vu, nodding to other films in the genre, rather than the source material - history - for inspiration. It seems to me such a fascinating and complex historical era deserves a much better movie maker to elicit it.
