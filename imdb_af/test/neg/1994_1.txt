I just saw this stinky old kettle on TV. Best viewed with a very big flag of dr. Jurd's Jungle Juice at hand, this exploitative cheese feast is hilariously bathed. On the (very slender) plus side, Raquel was in her physical head, she looked good, and you got a fair share of her as she played a go-go dancer; She had big legs, that's for sure. There is also a small interest in screen buffs in Los Angeles imagery ca. '69, and in the cartoon actors in small parts dealing with the better things. Veterans Thesp Ron Rifkin ("Brothers and Sisters") performs early performances as "Sailor" the "bassoon junkie" bartender who raises Raquel out of the bad man. You can also recognize the armed security guard in the hit-and-run scene. This is a very early appearance by Gordon Jump, who has donated such a beautiful performance in Soap as a piece of Chelief Tinkler. <br /> <The 'plot' of 'Flareup', as it is, follows the trajectories of an exotic dancer (Welch) underway by her murderous ex-husband (Luke Askew). This turkey is a classic production line of Hollywood slime - a slideshow, pedestrian, hokey shots, modifications and effects, ultra-cheesy stock music, plywood sets and matching appearances. <br /> <br /> The cast is just as terrible as the screenplay. Although Raquel can perform proper performances in the right vehicle, this old old clover is so bad that she doesn't really offer a chance, nor the audience. One of my favorite moments occurs when Raquel goes to hospital, sees the Vegas police word following her murderous operator and asks, "How did you get here?" - Then of course he replied "In a plane." Oh mankind ... And you won't be able to get the doctor's (Michael Rougas) eyes, because that might be one of the worst walks in the long sad history of bad cameos. Raquel's love affair Joe (James Stacy) strikes the film with a fixed look somewhere between confusion and embarrassment - and no wonder. This bomb puts the role of every TV client in the book, from Raquel's spectacular horrible turn in the horrible nightmare montage, to the sheer shock of the romantic horseback ride along Leo Carillo Beach. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler Warning ** - Just about the only interesting thing in the whole movie is the unbundling, in which Raquel eventually gets her own back, and hilariously sets the title by burning the bath. . Who really earned the stuntman his money on this one - like Yorba Linda, he goes into a heat wave. Yet even this reasonably spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crews is moving in the lap near the end. <br /> <br /> There are so many crazy things about 'Flareup' that it's strange to force; I wondered if it could be made one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The answer seems to be a sounding "yes". Until I hit the movie that followed, Roger Corman's mega-trashy 'caged heat' classic 'The Big Doll House', which takes Awful on a whole new level. I can highly recommend these two shlockers as a double account. You will laugh at your cowardice.
