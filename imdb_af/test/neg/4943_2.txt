I'm very disappointed. First, the German synchronization is bad. Maybe in the original version (with subtitles) it would have been better, but the whole movie looks like the director Luna Papa and Black Cat have seen White Cat and also tried to produce something in this style. But fail in every aspect. It is an incongruous mix of a strange amazing story and very childish gags. No atmosphere, no life. Extremely primitive sex humor. I voted 2, because 1 is the worst, and the other point for 'Sybilla', she is really cute. Sorry - I like eastern movies, but this one is really superfluous.
