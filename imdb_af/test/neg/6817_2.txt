PDQ Bach did it better. Many of the "Bach" shares are letters written to various customers who complain about the amount and speed of his payment. Anna Magdalena's diary, mostly about the death of children and all sorts of other family matters, is an iota more tempting. The music is disturbing: 17th-century large chapel orchestras and choirs that produce 20th-century concert sound. The overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show. J S Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for himself. This movie doesn't add anything. Netflix sent me two slides that wouldn't play, so I streamed the movie. It was clear that Netflix wanted to tell me something.
