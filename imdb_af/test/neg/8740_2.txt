After I put this movie, I can only wonder about the reasons for creating the movie. It was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen and had no redeeming features. <br /> <br /> If it's supposed to be funny, it's possible to be a very poor comedy, but as an action thriller it was dire. <br /> <br /> Slow, no plot, no real action, nothing closer to good dialogue and I have no idea of ​​the characters. What else can I say? Avoid.
