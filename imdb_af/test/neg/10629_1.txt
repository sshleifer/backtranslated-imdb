I rented this movie because it is supposed to happen in a jazz club - you know those hip, cool places that you might stumble late on a Saturday night. Well, there isn't one ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. The score is goofy, the original songs are terrible. Both main actors' singing, in turn, is constantly excellent (sincere) and unprofessional. The plot is no more complex than "boy meets girl," the play is laughter and the only decent movie moments are the stock images. The jazz club scenes contain sophomorical dialogue that is stifled by excessive organ music. This Joey de Francesco must keep his day working (unless his day is working with movies). Is it possible not only to get my four dollars back but also to pay for my therapy sessions? This movie, interesting enough, is so bad you might want to see it. Similar to driving through a bad accident - you just have to look. Just make the ear plugs right!
