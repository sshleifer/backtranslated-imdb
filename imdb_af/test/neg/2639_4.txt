Typical story of an evil child going to people. I suspect Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear on "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Schiavelli did not want to emphasize this junk on their CV. (In fact, Schiavelli resumed this life with a mostly good CV). Sometimes I wish the killers in these movies would just go to the idiots who decided we needed a new one each month for these movies. (Note: the comments should not be taken seriously; I just think the slashers lost their touch). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a movie you will do best to avoid. It is ninety minutes after two hours I will never return.
