2/3 of this movie is recycled footage from the previous movie, a fact that is unfortunately obvious, even to someone like me who didn't see the original movies. And somehow it feels like a rip-off, though I haven't seen the objects yet. It's like the episode of every TV show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you only see recycled footage from other episodes. I have seen some producers make extensive collections of recycled footage, but never more than 5 minutes or so. This movie is mostly things that have already been seen by audiences, so you can argue that it is one of the biggest rip-offs ever seen on the film publicly. <br /> <br /> I saw it. The theater, in a 16mm picture, which is good enough, I think about considering how scarce this type of material should be on film today. I give the film some credit for semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor, but it's about it. The Aztec mummy monster looks good, even some mobility in its face that is better than most movie samples of the period. But the robot is unfortunate, though it is interesting that they made the human face completely visible. It is a "robot man" or something of the kind they explain a bit in the movie. I think it's considered an Android. So technically in hard sci-fi terms, this movie should be called "Android vs. The Aztec Mummy", but I doubt anyone was more concerned about techniques here than they were concerned about quality. In fact, the film is so sophisticated that it makes the television look good. Even the doubling of Mexican to English is lazy and weak. For example, at one point the hero says, "I can start just as well." What is the whole translation of it? Couldn't they at least say he was "starting at the beginning", it didn't sound repetitive? A high school newspaper editor could have solved the script of this movie. This is the feature of utilitarian film making, but absolutely nothing in this movie is not needed to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the movie. They didn't go out of their way to do what they needed to do, and in the light of the extensive recycled footage, I doubted that they had made this movie for more than a week. <br /> <br /> I will now stop writing about it. The principle that I do not want to spend more energy in the process of comment than the creators of the movie actually released while it was made.
