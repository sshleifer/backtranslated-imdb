There is a special heaven reserved for people who make the world laugh. Along Chaplin, Stan and Ollie, The Marx Bros and ..... (fill in your own special favorites), space for everyone related to "Airport 80 - Concorde, the movie" needs to be made. Robert Wagner in particular exceeds all expectations that give the comedy performance of a lifetime. I would never have thought he had it in him. The only way he could have been harder would have been to wear a red nose and a spinning snare. British filmmakers will recognize Cannon and Ball's fat as if they were a Russian athlete, a good trick if he could pull it off, but he couldn't tragically. I have a 14-year-old labrador more athletic and almost so funny. . George Kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him to talk and move at the same time, and my goodness he triumphs! Brow wrinkled with difficulty, he speaks out the timeless dialogue, each word is lovingly polished in cowardly shine. For a year in twenty years, Hollywood has shown a movie like 'Airport 80'. All the trouble and struggle, the sweat, the tears, the lessons with Lee Strasberg, born of suitcases, born in a skirt, and so on, all come into being. An artwork is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them. I think I'm ready for my medication now.
