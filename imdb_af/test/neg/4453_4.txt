It's strange, this movie; you get the impression that the makers of this snooze fest spent more time in the local bars than on the set. In fact, it is a surprise not to see Harry Alan Towers' name on the credits; It certainly has the taste of one of its tax shelter productions, but the motivation behind the project seems to be enjoying a long stay in Provence for everyone involved. Despite the fact that the film is supposed to be anywhere in the region, Les Baux and its surroundings are almost everything. <br /> <br /> David Birney makes a spectacular colorless hero - as Michael Lonsdale says at one point "you're a walking clich√©". What Lonsdale does about this is someone's guess. For some reason the most interesting character, played by Rampling, is juxtaposed, while being the central figure, regardless of the book, because she clearly has the ability to carry the film anyway it would be boring, but at least we have more of something beautiful to see). <br /> <br /> All in all, a pointless thing that is just worth watching is how action-less can be an action movie.
