The film was slow, the dialogue between actors and actresses was "flat" and basically there was no development of the characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps is constantly looking at his face with a mad look. , pouting and actually looking annoyed with everyone. Danes have no screen magic, and Ribisi's character is a goober that no one wants to hang out, even if they pay to do so. <br /> <br /> Throw the strange scene where Epps should dance with an old man, and you may have the worst movie in theater history. <br /> <br /> I watched it on satellite (thanks, I didn't pay for it) and didn't want me to have it. . <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and sort your underwear and socker if you need something to do, but be sure to watch this movie when / when it comes to your TV. Awful movie if you ask me, and I generally have something good to say about about any movie out there.
