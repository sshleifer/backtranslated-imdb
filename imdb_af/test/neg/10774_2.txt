I tried to watch this movie, but I didn't pass it past the first 15 minutes. This is a terrible disappointment given the role, but I can't go beyond the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors pretending to be India are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk) . Since India alone has one-sixth of the world's population and one of the biggest film industries, I don't think it would have been difficult for filmmakers to find an excellent Indian actress to play the role. And I'm not saying this because of a blind patriotism, but because it is absolutely and totally absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian / Pakistani. Now some say that "as long as she is convincing who cares?" but my point is precisely that she is NOT convincing and never can be - not because of her acting skills, but because of her ethnicity. For example, how good an actor Tom Hanks may be, he will never be able to play an Australian Aborigine! <br /> <br /> But the biggest faux pas made by the manufacturers is still small. dialogue in English. It completely destroys the mood, as well as any allegation of authenticity. If the same movie in native language (Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles was made, this could be an excellent movie. Unfortunately, if things stand, I would not recommend anyone to see it, except film students who want to learn "not in movies".
