Ask a thousand people who are the biggest unintentional comedy of all time, and they will almost always tell your Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 from outer space. They are wrong. American Ninja rejected those two turkeys for several reasons, the least of which was a manuscript that was not thought through. While fully supporting the B-picture industry to keep slobs like Michael Dudikoff in work, a little work on the product would have been over. <br /> <br /> For those who give a poster's posterity, my next few paragraphs will give away important parts of the plot. <br /> <br /> First, if we provide background information about the titular hero, we will tell his birth date, next of kin, parents, and so on. , everyone is unknown. I don't know about you, but I expect the US military to come a little more serious about the facts. They also succeed in screwing the continuity of dates fairly effectively, though I don't remember what the dates were and when. It's actually one of American Ninja's less obvious mistakes. <br /> <br /> It has been pointed out before, but a common failure of many martial arts films is that when our heroes are confronted with large numbers of antagonists, antagonists have attacked one at a time. More recent films such as The Matrix Reloaded deny this convention, but just about every 1980's movie screamed the audience, "hey, why don't you all fall right away?" Martial arts films tend to be more impressive if the battles are more extensive than one-on-one. <br /> <br /> The central premise was originally a joke, but in view of recent events where the US military cannot wipe out a bunch of rebels simply because they will not delegate to the specialists, it seems oddly ironic . Filipino apostates steal weapons from the US Army's local sales department to wealthy customers. Remember that such theft will force the army to make local businessmen responsible, or even accept, an air purse exam, after all, it is an action movie of the 1980s. Part of the movie, however, is the climate battle. As Joe and Jackson form a combination of posing and art, evil Ninjas are exploding for no apparent reason. I agree with one previous commentator because this film should be called the Ninja Holocaust, because I am willing to collect a total of at least three hundred evil Ninjas during the film. In addition, the Black Star Ninja launches with rocket riders, laser beams and all sorts of ridiculous implements that have not only thought badly, they are knocked down. You will never see a laser beam effect that looks cheaper. <br /> <br /> Above all, the movie is so seriously damned. During the scene when Joe returns with his old mentor, I dare not laugh at the terrible dialogue. Not that I know any modern practitioners of Ninjitsu, but the logical part of my imagination has been hard to believe that they have spoken so much in history. During this mentoring scene, I half expect the old guy to tell Joe to prove his masculinity by cutting off his head with a blunt plastic spoon. Overall, I gave American Ninja a 1. is a special score in my system because it is reserved for the worst, most horrible, most offensive movies I've ever seen, or movies that make me laugh without ever trying. American Ninja is definitely an example of the latter.
