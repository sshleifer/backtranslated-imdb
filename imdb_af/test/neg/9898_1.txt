I wish I had read the comment on IMDb before I saw this movie. The first 1 hour was OK, but it made me wonder why everything in Chicago was centered and why no one reported any weather forecast from outside the US. Isolated nature evidence (of this size) is unthinkable. But beyond the first 60 minutes, drag the movie just like a never-ending story. The script is terrible. As for the actors, very poor choice. Only the people who are hired to run into panic keep up their roles. But I have to agree that this movie has some good special effects. If you rented it on a DVD and want to watch the movie, in spite of the reviews, then it plays at maximum speed that your player will allow!
