this film is an undivided attempt to appeal to a younger demographic of fourteen to twenty-four, and an insult to everyone. I refuse to believe that that age group is deadly to be entertained by this unnecessary remake. Early in the film, one of the characters proclaims, "I'm surrounded by idiots". this is the decisive moment in the film, which goes from there. full of clichés, red-herring scares and inexplicable events, the movie is also full of characters that are not really brainiacs, a formula that is all known in silly horror movies. and that crappy "it's so dark I can't see" scenes stolen from Chainsaw Massacre, but just annoying, not building up any tension or horror. It's hard to roll in the dark, and sometimes darkness is a big vehicle in a movie that needs to be stressed. but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case, the better. Maybe he didn't want to wait until tomorrow, because he doesn't mind, otherwise it can cost him more money to do good night tones, or he doesn't know how. who knows? Unless you've never seen a horror movie in your life, whether you're two or three years old, every aspect of this movie is predictable and done before. Warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. said enough. All in all a blasé slasher movie asking the question, where the h * ll was? It was treated like a lost leader. if you are so bored and all the other rentals are out or you are just in the mood for a bad horror movie, which is not really scary, or you want to see Paris have a pole through her head, go ahead and take a chance. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but if it's the producers of this movie think a younger audience wants me to be deceived. a profit-driven movie without any effort to achieve any art or respect for the genre. you know, make smart characters for a scarce movie. I believe it is Collet-Serra's debut as director, except for advertising and music videos. He has another one featured in 2006, called Doel 2. Hopefully his goal is to make a better movie.
