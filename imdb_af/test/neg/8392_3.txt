Paranoid Park is about Alex, a 16-year-old skater who causes death, even though it is accidentally a security guard. As the movie goes, Alex deals with minor issues such as his parent's divorce and the sexual heat of Jennifer's girlfriend (played by Taylor Momsen who you can currently see in Gossip Girl) while guilty. So far I've only seen one movie by Gus Van Sant, Elephant, and I can assure you that he has kept all his ways while doing so. Once he crosses timelines again. Once again he uses strange filming techniques, like the never-ending shots of people ... maybe you like these filming techniques, I know I don't. The plot feels unsatisfactory to me ... it's almost too easy to be explored for so long. The feeling I get (the same with Elephant) is that Gus Van Sant is trying too hard to make an "artistic" film that causes the film itself to lose dust. Also, Gabe Nevins was pretty bad as Alex, there is a difference between looking alienated or detached and looks like a robot. If you are a fan of Mr.Van Sant, look at it, otherwise it will skip. <br /> <br /> 3/10
