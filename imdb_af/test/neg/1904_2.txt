If you have an idea of ​​whether Playmaker is decent or not, watch his star, Colin Firth, calling it an interview as an absolute rubbish - I sincerely hope no one ever sees it. <br /> The script and plot are ridiculous, the female head is unconvincing. The only thing worthwhile is Colin Firth, and he looks a little embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Only for the Diehard Firth fans - the shower scene alone is worth the $ 3.99 you might have to shell out, if you find it. a video cutout as I did. <br /> <br /> I'm happy for Mr Firth that his days to take projects like this one are over!
