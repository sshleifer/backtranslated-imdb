In the past 5 years I have hired some bad movies ... totally deliberate. Seeing I'm striving to be a movie reviewer, and as we all know, terrible movies are released every year. Anyway, about 3 months ago I rented this one. I watched it all the time ... and cried eagerly. It's one of those movies that is so freakin bad, it makes you crave. It actually gives a sick feeling in my stomach. I saw many bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000, somebody?), But this one takes the cake. The plot was difficult to follow, the relief was terrible and the sounds were almost inaudible. If there was a negative rating on the scale, this movie would be at -11 for me. It may seem strange, but I strongly recommend it. It's something you need to see for yourself ... but don't say I didn't warn you. I don't think this review can get more accurate, so I'm done now. <br /> <br />
