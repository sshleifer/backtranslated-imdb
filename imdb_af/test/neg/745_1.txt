The filmmakers were clearly on drugs. That's the only explanation I have. How else do you explain this travesty of a Jane Austen adaptation? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a Gothic novel. But this film was made as if it were a Gothic novel. The bizarre music and dream series for me suggest drug-induced hallucinations, rather than a naive, innocent girl with an overactive imagination, like Catherine of the novel. <br /> <br /> The actress Catherine played is just about Bug-eyed all the time. Peter Firth seems at least ten years old to play Henry and he actually looked a little bit at my gay side. I don't see the attraction between him and Catherine. John Thorpe's portrayal was rather strange, but Isabella wasn't really that bad. But nothing can save this piece of CRAP movie! Another thing - This film finds a character not in the book, a French friend of General Tilney's, "The Marchioness." Why exactly what they added is outside me. Must have been the drugs. She is scarce, without wit, with white foundation, red lips and black lines painted randomly on her face. (Drops?). <br /> <br /> You'd think it would be at least amusing in a "bad It's good quality, but unfortunately it's not. It's just BAD.
