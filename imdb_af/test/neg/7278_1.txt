Tagline: The lucky ones died before watching it. <br /> <br /> I've never watched a Bulgarian 1920's movie, so I can't say it's the worst movie ever made, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever watched . I almost can't remember it. <br /> <br /> All I can remember is a family of stupid people who don't do anything right. Their car has one wheel of four stuck in the sand, so they decide there is nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there. Then there is an old man who is aware of the existence of a group of cannibals in the whereabouts, but has never considered the idea of ​​reporting the fact to the police. <br /> <br /> And, speaking of the police ... if those freaks have long been there to eat people, many people had to disappear. How did the sheriff not suspect? <br /> <br /> But I asked questions about the first five minutes or so. The rest is drill. A Hallucinated Amazing Drill. <br /> <br /> I will be gracious and will not talk about the dialogues. And the play. And the effects. <br /> <br /> I'll just call the final scene, where the freak girl knocks out a snake (the snakes! They eventually come out, what the hell do they have to do with the story?) with a sniper-precise throw a stone that completely disregards Mr. Show Craven for reality and for things that occur on planet Earth in general. <br /> <br /> I believe there were riots when the movie was released in 1977. <br /> <br /> Eating even a cannibal will not be a fair punishment for the director of this intelligence attack.
