An object teaches how to make a bad movie that is devastating as Horror. Without going too close, I think it's the results of a lot of film student students who add all the bits to the story and actually think about it! It's like a movie workshop of some kind and it's a badly needed movie for an editor. In that case, it will take 10 minutes! The director of this garbage probably had more money than sentence. Consider the number of scripts submitted or even unreleased films that would benefit. The so-called Grandma who killed people in a little stupid way, looks like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future - or maybe the musician Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter. It starts with a 20 minute scratchy boring nonsense expressed by the students - something about paranoia. Giving this junk 1 is because it can't get less. It doesn't have one reason, and if one of the girls thinks the body is covered in blood in the floor, the man is crazy about tasting the red stuff before she knows it's not tomato ketchup! This is an insult to the intelligence of an idiot
