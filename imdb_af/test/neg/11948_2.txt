There is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: terrible. How "Mostly Martha" was made again was terrible. The title of the movie is terrible. The actors are terrible. And the idea of ​​combining good cooking and the US is terrible. If you saw "Bella Martha", well, it's the original title and it means "Beautiful Martha", this one is a punch in the stomach. The actions of Mrs. Jones is so poor and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, could be considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp). Not to mention the cook, who would better play a different role. And the little girl ... not worth mentioning. Bella Martha was a very nice movie, an authentic one ... why was it made again? There was a story ... here they took it out. There is no story ... What will this suggest? In one way, this movie was also perfect. You know when all the ingredients fit together? Well, that's the case here. A perfect crap.
