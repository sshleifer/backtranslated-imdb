I don't understand why you would give this movie something about 4. Quite enough, it takes me back to the 80s and to the 'good old days of horror comedy', but that genre hasn't gotten better since then - it's still so LAME Low budget - low technology - bad acting - bad story line - not scary at all and not funny enough ... actually there is not much that I can say about it. The so-called monsters are just terribly bad! I mean we came back in time when they made the samples out of plastic and shot the screens fame for frame ... I really don't understand why anyone would invest any money to make this script a movie - but I think it would have been pretty good if it was a bigger budget movie. <br /> <br /> Recommendation - please do not make the mistake of wasting your time unless you want to get a bad Halloween makeup! Personally, I enjoy independent movies and anything out of the box, but it just didn't do it for me.
