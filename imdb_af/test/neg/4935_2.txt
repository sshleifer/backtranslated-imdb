Brainless movie about two girls and a few guys meeting them in an airport, getting on the wrong night break and ending up in a whole world of trouble. Big twists and turns are completely, and I mean, totally messed up, in a movie with a plot so stupid to disregard the description. What goes on in a general sense is okay, I mean the idea that a man kidnapped unguarded girls for ominous purposes is a good one. The problem is that the details are so convinced I won't be shocked if you don't turn off the movie in complete disbelief. Give, a man who's supposed to take you home isn't one of the ways you know, and you're on the bus? This gets worse, think of every bad choice and this movie has the characters, even to the point where they could just walk away, but never do. What is annoying is that some of the twists and turns may have worked if something was previously intelligent, but there is hardly any intelligence in this movie. Well, maybe there, the end, the end is smart. The end is the kind of thing that you have to miss. it should be the "oh # $ * @ !!!!" be instant and become a classic of horror cinema. Instead, it lies just under the stupid ruins of a silly movie. One of the most mindless films of the year.
