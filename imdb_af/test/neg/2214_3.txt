That's about one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Maybe there's not a worst movie ever, but if you haven't seen so many bad people, it can easily make your top ten worst list. If you consider what was achieved with the original "King Kong" in 1933, you should ask yourself why someone would push so low to produce this debacle. Then, take it one step further and realize that next year's "Star Wars" quantum leap has achieved a new level of sci-fi entertainment, and with this presentation you will laugh and laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> Let me ask you now, what will professor (Peter Cushing) have to bring an umbrella as a leading part of underground research equipment for the ride to Earth's core? OK, so it was handy to get the parrot / tirannosaurus (parrotosaurus?) Early in the passage, but come on. Somehow, I don't think that's what Edgar Rice Burrough's had in mind when writing his stories of Pellucidar. He probably didn't mind Caroline Munro, or as Princess Dia, probably the only redeeming factor for this whole escapade. <br /> <br /> There was at least one pseudo-scientific explanation that I got a kicking. of; I'm always looking for one in movies like this. It has to be how the air on the earth's core was really the bottom of the earth's crust, explaining that the etheric pink is glowing. But try as it may, the story just couldn't hook me up to find anything interesting about Hoojah the Sly One or Jubal the Ugly One, much less the goofy half man, half pterodactyl creatures. To paraphrase the good professor: "You can't trust me, I'll pay attention!"
