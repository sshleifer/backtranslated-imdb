My god ... I haven't seen such a terrible movie for a long time. I've seen for a long time. It was seen last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes. Keira Knightley really tries very hard in this one, but she can't handle it. She stole her accent every time and didn't have the charisma to fill the role. Sienna Millers Active gets you to a point where you start asking yourself: Has she ever had lessons? Judging by the edge of love has never been in the acting class, but must be considered in the near future. They both look really nice. Maybe that's what they need to focus on in their future career. if they can be actresses. Everyone can!
