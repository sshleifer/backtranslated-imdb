Last night I received an early preview screener of Prozac Nation. Because I love everything Christina Ricci was, I was only excited, but when the film went on, I started to wonder where it was going. Based on a true story, it's just about Christina Ricci's character and her struggle with depression, drugs, friends and family, as you probably can tell from the title. In my opinion, this movie was getting too fast, and it was too dramatic. I would say that there was a dramatic moment every five minutes and the movie was moving very quickly through her life, leaving no room for us to associate with Christina Ricci's character. Christina Ricci's performance was fantastic as always, but Jessica Lange stood out throughout the movie and I believe the movie's success will be all because of her and Christina Ricci. I will rate this 4 out of 10 and I suggest you hire this one or read the books by Elizabeth Wurtzel. They are good and definitely worth checking out.
