We were excited to rent this one after reading some reviews and seeing it being so high here. Well, we got it home and couldn't believe what we saw. It basically comes as if it was written by some distorted old guy who couldn't help insert his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime movie that was truly lacking in plot and humor. The main character is everywhere in the place ... one moment he's like an immature little child, the next moment he's mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a twisted stalker. <br /> <br /> The worst part is all the sexual content out of place. I have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has good sexual energy, but it is only presented in a way that is creepy. Nipple flakes, close ups of a girl's hook (many times) in white panties, or a swimsuit. It was completely out of place and it was as if the person who wrote it was trying to make a few fantasies through his cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> We expected something of a mature nature, but we just looked at each other and asked what the point was. Besides the cartoon boobs and poor dialogue. If you want to see some cartoon characters stone and crotch's ... this is for you. If you're looking for something, this movie is empty. The characters and dialogue were just annoying. <br /> <br />
