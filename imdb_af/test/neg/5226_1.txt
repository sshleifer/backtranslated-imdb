Wow, this is anti-Christian bias big time! It is based on a Stephen King novel and he previously wrote this kind of bias and Hollywood even more exaggerates it. In this film we see a Protestant minister and a Catholic priest. Both are foolish and become unholy at the same time. Of course, the devil took over the town, so maybe his influence is in these guys too, but they are typical Hollywood depictions. They never show a minister talking and acting like Billy Graham, or your local minister or priest. And - another "given" - they make Satan's character the most interesting of the film. <br /> <br /> Max Von Sydow plays the devil and makes him a nice man. Ironically, Von Sydow played a number of these roles after depicting Jesus in the 1964 film, "The Greatest Story Ever Told." You wonder why the actors are so busy? They do not know whether they are God, Satan or anyone in between. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris, who has played very unstoppable roles in recent years, is appropriate in this story. He and the rest of the temperate characters in this movie don't look good. <br /> <br /> From what I've heard, King's book is even darker and lighter than this hate-filled movie built better. Honestly, who cares. King and Hollywood deserve each other.
