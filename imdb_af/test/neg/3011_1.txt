Keys to the VIP are just another of the terrible T.V. what you can and will see at this station. The show is terrible with guys claiming that real players compete against each other (there are two of them competing in each episode) in stupid games where they try to get girls to a bar to talk to them, girls to get over, and so on. . The judges are four other guys who also claim expert takeaway artists, but they also look like big d-bags, just like the contestants. The show is not funny at all and not even interesting, it's just boring to see if these guys are trying desperately to convince us what wonderful players they are (even more about the four judges than I'm about the contestants). Nothing funny even happened in the shows I watched and the shows were apparently erected. Do you really think they've invited all these people to the club, released them, and have them tied up while these guys are doing the same stupid games with them? It's not real, it's just stupid, it's probably even ties in the day. Someone else has written here how they knew someone on the show and it was all false good, it's obvious, it's a fake show and even with actors it's still not funny. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.
