One of the worst things a movie studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others, commercialize a 'shock' or 'gore' factor to sell tickets to buy their Birch a new diamond necklace. Another worst thing is to misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by producing events, dialogue and images to the director's own taste. Lastly, one of the worst things a movie studio can do is to use under-the-act actors and shoot it all at a sound stage that is rented for fifty cents a day. All three of these are the creators of this film. It's, hands-down, the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. A score of '1' is too good for this waste of celluloid. Not only should the filmmakers be ashamed to make it, they should be ashamed of the negative exploitation of the heroes of this story, who are the people who experienced the first-hand tragedy, both the living and the dead.
