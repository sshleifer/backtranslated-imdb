Debbie Boone hit a monster with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life;" However, the Didi Conn movie of the same name was a terrible embarrassment. Conn plays the stereotypically goofy-homely vulnerable girl in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe man. They are engaged but everyone knows that Zaslow is not going to marry someone who is not blonde and built. So Didi is just surprised when he dumps her. Needless to say, Didi is rather shy. <br /> <br /> In her spare time, she wrote some songs, and she has a song that she thinks is pretty pretty. She calls it - can you guess? - "You Light My Life." She cries in the car and drives down to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now I remember sitting in the theater and watching her hop in the car to drive and think about the big city. "Thanks, we finally got rid of the exhibition. Now something interesting can happen." And something interesting has happened. The credited credits. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was. Not only was the movie bad, badly written, and badly filmed, it also ended in the middle. This movie is a very, very bad movie, and we are not talking about cult movie bad here. We speak immaculate flop, a true yawner from start to finish. If you like the Debbie Boone song, buy a copy of it anyway. But don't waste your time or money on this movie. This is a movie you will be glad you missed. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
