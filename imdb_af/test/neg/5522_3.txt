"Happy Days" was emitted and radiated from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. It seems to be more ridiculous with age. By the time of the broadcast, most viewers who had grown up in the 1950s, in the middle-aged with families, and the screens at Mel's Diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them. Of course, the Fonz was the coolest of the cool (although actor Henry Wrinkler has never learned to ride a motorcycle today). Richie Cunningham was the all-American blonde haired child likely to be elected president of the president. Potsie was Richie's best friend - the star of the show should have a best friend, I think. And Ralph Malph was the bumbling sidekick to the Fonz, if not the whole group. I loved it when the Fonz knocked on poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the middle-aged air running Mel's Diner. And of course, who can forget the look of Mork? Was it really the 1950s? Ironically, films produced in the 1950s, such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One", have become better with age and the period is more honestly portrayed than that show produced 20 years after the period it depicts. <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TV show "Happy Days" is not in the same league as "Rebel Without a Cause" or "American Graffitti". Happy days may have caught some aspects of the 1950s with his burger dinner, juke boxes, cool cars and sticky plaid shirts, but it is more of a nostalgic idealism that is rigorously done to laugh rather than an honest portrayal. "American Graffitti" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950s, while the "Happy Days" was more about what middle-aged people in the 1970s wanted in the 1950s. The result was a kind of watered down production that really had nothing to do with the 1950s. "Happy Days" is at best a comedy fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950s as background. As noted by another reviewer, the All-American child Richie Cunningham is likely to be hijacked because he befriended a fall like Fonzie. And Mel will probably prevent Fonzie from entering his dinner. <br /> <br /> A quick history: "Happy Days" was originally a pilot called "Love in the Happy Days" rejected for broadcast. Comedy pilots who had themes about sex and romance that didn't make it to pilot flights, sometimes appeared on the rare broadcast show "Love American Style" which was regularly broadcast instead of raining baseball games or other unexpected programming cancellations and / or changes. In short, "Love American Style" was a disposable show that contained all these one episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slots debut. "Love in the Happy Days" appeared earlier in the early 1970s as a "Love American Style" show, but TV drivers could not predict how a show of about 1950s youth would be popular, especially during All-day Comedy shows around middle-aged people, such as "Mary Tyler Moore Show" (and subsequent spin-offs such as "Rhoda"), "The Bob Newhart Show" and "All in the Family". (How things have changed since now are most TV sitcoms about young people and the industry avoiding most shows on middle-aged people like the plague!) <br /> <br /> Then, one of the young stars of "Love in The Happy Days, a children's actor by Ron Howard, was given the opportunity to die in a movie about young people who took place in 1959, called "American Graffitti", directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas whose previous "THX 1138 "unfortunately bombarded at the box office. Even when it was performed for movie drivers, the studios could not see how a youth movie in the 1950s could have been popular because it didn't "fit" with what was popular in the past, although they didn't realize. that part of the film group was young in the 1950s. As everyone knows, the movie was a big hit, and studio managers admitted that they had completely disregarded their audience. Somewhere in American Graffitti's theater career, TV drivers realized they had a comedy pilot in their safe that was much like "American Graffitti". They brought it back with the original cast, plus Henry Wrinkler as "The Fonz", titled "Happy Days" and the rest is TV history, as it has become one of the most popular shows of the 1970s. <br /> "Happy Days" now looks ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never more than they are superficial. The issues they deal with are trivial. And their reactions seem unattended and even stupid. Nowadays, the character of the Fonz looks like a caricature of, The Fonz. Was the idea of ​​being a sort of parody of Marlon Brando's character in "The Wild One"? Looking at the show with fresh eyes, I really feel the producers have a great opportunity to offer the 1950s with depth and realism that can still be fun and entertaining. Instead, the producers decided to laugh cheaply for quick money. This is definitely a performance that has not resisted the test of time. "American Graffitti" has much of the outward appearance of "Happy Days", but it did have a head start. It had an honesty about the characters and their problems. "Happy Days" got the look of "American Graffitti" but couldn't take his heart.
