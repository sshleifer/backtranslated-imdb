"Dogmatic," as another reviewer describes, is an appropriate word. The director's idea was to present Bach without plot, acting, pleasure, theater, dialogue, story or drama. Achieve Mission, Monsieur Straub. "Pretentious?" Yes. "Film?" Not at all. This is anti-cinema. Nobody moves. There's almost no one talking. The camera holds static shots for 10-12 minutes at a time: many times the camera will dolly in. You can take a look at the fingers of Gustav Leonhardt over the keys. This is it. <br /> <br /> If you want the idea of ​​staring at the back of a harpsichord's head (7 times) while listening to Bach, this is the movie for you. I'd rather listen to Bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.
