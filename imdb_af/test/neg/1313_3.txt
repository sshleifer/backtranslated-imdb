'Flood' is an excellent example of how to cast good actors and cgi at a movie will do little to compensate for a garbage. The basic premise is good: who threatened to send the sea straight across the Thames flood barriers as a freak storm and swamped so fast in London that most residents would never get out of time? It's basically the New York segment of The Day After Tomorrow, but it shouldn't make it any less of a movie. However, the writing is not there. It's just functional, flat, and lacking in depth. Great British talents like Robert Carlysle and David Suchet to name only two are doing their best with what they have, but their characters are two-dimensional figures, like something from an old wonder art. and it would be fairer to return the tide. Not that every actor got off the hook - Tom Courtenay could only look one emotion throughout the film, but then he didn't get much of a challenge. <br /> <br /> I welcome any opportunity to flicker some non-Hollywood disaster for a change, and I don't expect to spend millions of dollars to deliver ultra-realistic graphics. However, there is no excuse for shonky writing - especially from a country that has ever made some of the best science fiction. It's the kind of half-hearted B-grade fluff that produces the Sci-Fi channel, and it's hardly a target to pursue. If I am like you, you're such a fan of disaster films you're still tempted to do yourself a favor and watch it with friends. Better yet; Don't bother.
