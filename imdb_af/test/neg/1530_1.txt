Not for the first time, I'm out of the basement with the majority view. Oz is a terrible, pretentious, voyeuristic series. The makers have their cake and eat it. Oz, Em City, etc. Used as ultra-rough signals that apparent greed is complete fantasy. It allows viewers to hide intellectual excuses to look at soap operative nonsense that is clipped with everything bad about people. <br /> <br /> If you watch an episode, please remember that while the filthy, violent, absurdly convoluted, unconvincing, sick, imaginary drama unfolds before your approval, a few hundred babies in poor parts of the world is dead of bad food or water. <br /> <br /> Oz is extremely dramatic at worst. It calls on the basic instincts, but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a Mahler symphony. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is inexorably ugly and utilitarian. The freedoms taken with realities are stupid. Here is a nightclub that owns dandy. He comes to Oz in his delicate gourmet, with a ridiculous, cloudy contact lens in one eye, with a bump of drugs that no one has seen. Here is a murderous look at the heat-death of the universe that begs to be killed, but of course is denied by the brute he approaches and makes a little unlikely throat that cuts himself. <br /> <br /> The action races up At a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic, foolish viewer to always think about what happens next, rather than the mess just shown. Don't worry, a betrayal, a murder, a sex scene will be within a minute or two. <br /> <br /> Finally, of course, Oz is pretentious. You don't have to be ashamed of the fact that it is being transmitted through its flow. You can see it and tell yourself that the producers, writers and actors are doing everything with a big wink (or the same word but for a change of vowel) to the audience. <br /> <br /> Yes, you can be a wise viewer and excuse yourself for the cunning, postmodern, etc. skills of the Oz production team. They call on the lowest common denominator, pretending to work at a higher level. <br /> <br /> Truly a contemptuous series. And every hour it rewards its makers and actors and generates advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who can do nothing better than to watch something as ugly and unnecessary. Another hundred children die whose lives could be saved by spending the dollar through this terrible, successful series with great praise.
