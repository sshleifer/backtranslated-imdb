So if a man meets you and he says, "I want you to look at my erection!" Don't worry, maybe he wants you to look at the movie he made about how to build his house. yes! that's the only thing happening in this movie! It's like the worst Warholian BEEP I've ever seen! It's like filming the inside of your toilet before rinsing it, but it's less interesting to look at it. <br /> <br /> But if you look at Lennon's setup, he is warned that he has posted a lot of background. noise in that too. I mean, really, it is as if the building is being attacked by space mutants of hell or something! Meanwhile, the building is going on, as the erection can also (in almost 20 minutes, which is a performance). <br /> <br /> So if anyone asks you to watch his erection, make sure he wants it all video tape.
