It's a male bashing bonanza. I saw it on Sci-Fi a while ago, and the idea was interesting. It could have been a good movie, and I don't see the plot itself as male bashing, but some specific references to men are really annoying. I can still watch the movie again, because at least it tries to solve itself by hinting that the women in the movie may not be as violent as they demand, but it still doesn't compensate for the very tiring man. -bashing. I mean, I can understand a little, it's part of the movie's plot, but come on, it gets really tired after a while. Not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept being homosexual and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority than going into the closet. It's just too incredible. There are too many women out there, with cultural or religious constraints that will stand out, it is absolutely unquestionable. I mean I know his sci-fi, and I love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi has at least a hint that it's possible, and it's too unreliable. The phrase "Truth is Stranger than Fiction" originated because fiction at least seems to be welcome, but the truth is not always. This movie is not like that. Other than that, the movie has some good acting and the ultimate morale of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, leave it a bit, but not enough.
