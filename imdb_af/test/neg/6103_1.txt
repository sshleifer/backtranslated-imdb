<br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed under a large audience with the gills. <br /> <br /> Very often, the characters appear in KADOSH, and they see intense eyes. Very intense unhappy faces, very pensive, very serious. During these moments, there is very serious sound music, just to make it clear, sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games. <br /> <br /> The more entertaining parts of this movie come from the very pensive star. We learn that the women of the KADOSH community have two tasks. One is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands. The second is to stay in service so their husbands can't work. What do these men do with their free time? They pray. And we learn that they pray out loud at home: "I thank you for not creating me as a wife." And at their place of worship, they pray to give thanks for the functioning of male genitalia. <br /> <br /> Along with prayer, there are many scenes of indignant fiancee, screaming, and endless headbiting and bodies looking back and fourth, and mixed with everything is very complicated and bizarre (or simple but equally strange) ritualistic activities. <br /> <br /> The unintentional comedy cream comes from the generation. The images of a warm and stored man who actively exchange body fluids with his wife while trying to keep his beanie off his scalp are unforgettable! <br /> <br /> Every sex scene is funny, but one that stands out. is when a man rubs his face against his beautiful wife's (YaÃ«l Abecassis) feet. Oh, yes, we're finally in the country of sensuality ... but no! The feet that rub, stop before anything happens and the man starts rocking his autistic, wandering head and body until the scene ends! <br /> <br /> There are three attractive women in the near states to pull out, but KADOSH has absolutely no nudity. Technically, there are some interesting images and pleasant uses of light and colors by the director. <br /> <br /> For a more credible, educational and entertaining treatment of the fate of being an unclean woman unworthy of a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed with which a man Mentioning a phrase from ancient writings, I suggest Barbra Streisand's YENTL. <br /> <br />
