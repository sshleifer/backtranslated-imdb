Surely expect more after seeing the cast list, but WOW! <br /> <br /> I think a first time director could have done a better job with this project and the fact that a veteran like John Buechler made it, my puzzles to no end. Somehow, the budget allowed them to secure a crowd of D-List actors, who embarrassed them for one and a half years. The unknown actors were just terrible, less Steve Wastell doing a decent job than Axl. The story is so bad that it's really not necessary. The overall production value appears standard, with a little average camera work, if you can make it through the God-Awful "slo-mo" scenes and the painful person on fire sequence. I knew it would be stupid, I just had no idea how stupid and unhappy it is time that can never be returned to me. I think if you really enjoy bad "B" movies, it can work for you, but if you appreciate any story, this one is just awful ... An absolute waste of time.
