All this show is the same plot. Kuszko (spelling?) Is in danger of missing school, he has to succeed in becoming emperor. He must learn something that he thinks is stupid, then he uses it / learns more about it and realizes it is not so stupid. Eezma, who serves as chief, tries to transform Kuszko into an animal to stop him. Every episode. <br /> <br /> Jokes from the movie are copied (Eezma's incredibly complicated plans, Kuszko constantly breaks the 4th wall, squirrels.) They should try to hire some writers. <br /> <br /> 2/10
