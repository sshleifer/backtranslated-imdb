I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why are they always chosen more white women, then they are black women. every episode they are always more white women than black one. as if to say that white women look better than black women. I'd like once more black women to see white. And it's not just your show, it's so in many shows, always more white. but I would have thought since you were the head of the show, you will see for yourself and have more black women on your show. but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are fair and beautiful. You're just a big, shrewd hypocrite.
