The fact that this film was distributed free of charge with a certain national newspaper that I didn't care about expressed me to that extent, but if I got a copy that a local charity shop didn't give up I felt I with a good conscience. <br /> <br /> The movie has its moments, the call of the Thameside site is well done, but it suffers, I feel, from some too many mistakes. First, Vinnie Jones is simply not convincing as the journalist. Although Vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he simply does not have the scope of acting ability to pull out such a role. <br /> <br /> Secondly, who would have with them a lost manuscript that was informed "priceless"? It looked as if everywhere Mr. Jones went to this manuscript! Thirdly, the whole Dickens aspect of the story, while it seems important, is getting rid of what could be an interesting movie of corruption in high places. Maybe I'm just a little bit thick, but I couldn't really see the point of the story-inside-a-story Dickens style. It didn't add anything to the movie, and just meant confusing things when things started to touch the modern story line. <br /> <br /> The one bit of praise I will give to the filmmakers is that they have at least tried a little differently. I'm all for British Independent movies trying to be "left of the field," but it's not a "Red Road" or "It's England". What it is, is a bit of a mess, and an over-long one to it. Yes, it is partly entertaining, but in the end, it felt that two films were merging to make a whole, and both failed to do so. (I also can't help thinking that I recently did something similar to that seen on TV by Ian Banks recently. In Edinburgh they have a story about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes).
