This movie is a movie collage of gangster clich√©s. The writing is grade z and the plot and story are erected without care or logic. It's a messy backdrop of stereotypical gangsters (think of Bugs Bunny cartoons) and silly supporting characters (the lady doctor and author). There are much better Bogart movies out there. In fact, Bogart looks like he slept through this show. He puts very little effort into this character. I think the legal advice he received was something like "He's a bad man. Do bad." This man is the era equivalent of Darth Vader; obvious, evil and the anti-hero. Don't waste your time with this one.
