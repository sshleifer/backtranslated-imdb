My friends and I hired this movie to miss another one on skateboarding. Watchin Steve Guttenberg as an action hero is hilarious. The movie is so incredibly predictable and on top of that it is finally a laugh festival. Although I gave it 1/10, this movie has to be seen, especially if you manage to capture it on any TV.
