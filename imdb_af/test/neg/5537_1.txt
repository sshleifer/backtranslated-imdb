How did it ever make this movie in the name of decency? <br /> <br /> One supposes the captions just say 'terribly' to every frame of this truly dishonest attempt. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, difficult dialogue and the lack of talent of everyone involved. nightmare makes for an impeccable 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall impression? <br /> <br /> A lot of excited drama students got lucky with a lottery award and made one of the most painstaking films ever made. <br /> <br /> It makes Hammer Horror TV shows like Oscar material. <br /> <br /> And don't think for a moment it falls into the "so bad it's good" category. It's not even that bad. <br /> <br /> But the fart lighting scene is probably worth another look.
