I never really thought about watching this movie. I've seen it put on the horror movie rack in my local video rental store and never thought about it much. Just run the mill mill zombie flick with a little gore and a sex scene. Nothing special can look as good as Python ... oh no wait, it's a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I just decided to see it when some of my friends saw it on TV and said it was a terrible piece of trash. So I decided to verify these stories, and only then did I realize how horrible the movie was hiding behind the meager and uninteresting DVD cover. <br /> <br /> Not that the idea itself is bad. An airplane is a limited area, and would be a real death for the people on board if zombies make their appearance ... a good starting point for a zombie movie. But this film had a good environment and scratched with poor acting, unashamed camera work, annoying characters and a terrible score. <br /> <br /> The characters all have different levels of hatefulness. There are two young couples who basically go to friends on holiday in France. One couple consists of a jock and his annoying bitchy girlfriend who has a relationship with Mr. Jock's best friend, who is with his girlfriend, who is a blonde psycho, meets. There is also a policeman who guides a wife (an equal and highly annoying wife). The policeman is probably one of the least annoying characters of the lot. Then there's a bunch of air females who mostly end up as zombie chow ... no I didn't watch the whole movie, it was just too painful an experience to go through, almost as bad as the Cannibal Holocaust. Oh, and there's also a golfer on vacation with his wife, a strange air march that doesn't really seem to be important until he is called to help with the zombie escaped, a thirty scientists who are all victims of the dead and a few pilots. The work of the camera is often shaky, and although many people do not think, it can really come to your nerves after a while, such as constantly having a tiny airbag around your head. It's small, but it's there and it's annoying. <br /> <br /> The adultery couple is really annoying. All they do is sex in the toilets of the plane while their spouses are not watching. In fact, all the young adults in this movie are badly annoying. They swallow, bitch, argue and have some of the most boring and sensible boring dialogue in the movie ... yes, it makes you happy to see them die. <br /> <br /> The score is horrible. It's so generic and uninspired that it kills any kind of tension that could have generated a scene and replaced it with the feeling that someone was scraping a blackboard with their nails and laughing at you. In fact, it sounds like the count of ... Python! That movie will never stop haunting me. <br /> <br /> There's also a character that the filmmakers were incredibly intending to have as many shots as possible. A nun, which sits close to the young adults and connects her Bible, included in so many shots, starts wondering if she plays a big part in the movie ... but no, she doesn't, so why did she so many scenes? Was it because the original project of the film's creator was a non-porn flick? No one will ever know. <br /> <br /> The zombies look pretty good. Their make-up is good and they are probably much better actors than the living characters, they are much more convincing and fun! The guard responsible for keeping the scientist's illegal cargo was pretty funny. A large crate appears on him, and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg is pierced with a sharp object. Yet he did not shout, shoot or hurt. He just grills and closes in an effort to get the thing out of his leg. In fact, he sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain. <br /> <br /> Well, all in all, I give it one for the interesting environment and one for the zombies. <br /> <br /> Just look at this movie if you like young adults and throw things together, and unfortunately there really isn't anything funny about the whole thing, so look at a laugh will probably fail unless you high on a kind of psychoactive drug.
