This movie contains several well-known actors I usually like, so I had at least modest expectations when renting it on DVD. I was very disappointed. In fact, I've been through some refreshments for half an hour and somehow I ended up in the kitchen, rather than going back to the TV. The actor shows where poor pretty much across the board and none of the atmospheres in the movie were very convincing. Almost all scenes felt that "just a movie" for them, I just sat there waiting to hear the director "CUT!" Name. followed by the crew who talked a little about the scene before moving on to the next. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is about gang members, most characters are tough and bulky. The problem here is just that it's very bad. -boy-attitude is so badly played that it feels like a joke. The constant guitar drilling soundtrack also really tries to emphasize this atmosphere, but when the same song is played the 18th, it just adds to the already strong sense of the whole thing that is just fake. Maybe it was just a very bad script, maybe it was just poorly executed. I'm not a film critic, and I hardly find anything that is VERY good, but it's just bad, no matter how objective and forgiving I try to be. Not recommended, not even a rental!
