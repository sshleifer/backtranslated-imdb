If you want a full time spell, if you pull a ribbon out of your belly or it has dried out of your ears or sink your tile, your idea of ​​a carnival rush, then you won't miss this one. br /> <br /> For one thing, forget about the VHS cover. NO body in this movie looks so attractive (ie the Indian girl). Someone else has commented that anyone who is set for the cover is not the same girl and I agree. The cover is the most exciting thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> To put it in perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds in the movie, I knew I was already torn. <br /> <br /> I finished watching it because 1) I paid 99 cents, and 2) there was possibly a hair of chance, a scene in this turkey was worth more than a broken bread. <br /> <br /> There wasn't. <br /> <br /> Good sadness, Fonda. I know you were hard on roles when you did it, but it's under you.
