Not good. Mostly because you don't give a damn about what happens to all these people. Some remarks: 1. I am tired of seeing government-goers who never talk to their pupils, never teach them anything and take a tired and irritated look when the said pupil, who of course is won in 4 seconds, says something 2. Fine, so Rosina has a father complex and is therefore attracted to her employer. But Charles is completely different in all aspects of her father. If something Henry is so much closer than a sensual, lofty person. 3. How can you ever believe that she would attract more to Tom Wilkinson than to Rhys Meyer. 4. Hard to believe, if she was actually raised as a deeply religious girl, that she would be so careful to sleep with a heathen after he knew him for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Some good things about the movie: at least she didn't get pregnant, didn't know who the father was ... The whole description of life in the Jewish community in London is good
