The movie Heart of Darkness is an insult to the book by Joseph Conrad! To be honest, the movie made me sleep. On the other hand, the book was definitely extraordinary. I feel the movie left out several key elements and missed some of the main points of the book. In addition, the actors were boring and lacked their originality and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The book, while not an adventure story or easy to understand, is full of hidden meaning and interesting plot twists. The book, although very confusing and complex, is amazing. If you finally understand it, you feel like you've actually learned something. The novella, or short story, had several important ideas such as futility and madness that left the movie out. In addition, several key screens have been changed, affecting the entire plot. Many of the screens were very "messy" in the sense that they didn't fit together. In summary, the film was a bad interpretation of the book. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend watching this movie if you can't picture or understand the book, but otherwise I would hit this one. It was terrible, and in full disarray. If you've never read the book, you definitely shouldn't watch the movie, because you need the basic information from the book to understand the movie. The movie was a horrible ending to an outstanding and detailed book.
