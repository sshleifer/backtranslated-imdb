This show started well, but then it became a nightmare. The worst part was the participants. Most of them were weirdos. They did stupid things to live and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season one man said he was talking to his pants. It is sick and repulsive. Also, no one cares to win money. All they ever wanted to do was make alliances because it was "Survivor" or something. The men were always afraid that the women would work together. The women were also the same. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to stop watching. It was truly one of the worst shows ever.
