The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins to relive her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abused father). Tory discovers that her friend was only the first in a series of murders that still occur. Can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the ongoing murders? <br /> <br /> You really don't have to find out, because, oh my God! It was so so bad! I know all the Nora Roberts fans will flutter to this movie and it gives tons of 10's. Then the rest of us will see an IMDb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. But don't be deceived. The end was predictable, the acting TERRIBLE (don't even start me over the southern accent * y'all *) and the story was thin. Just remember .... you've been warned!
