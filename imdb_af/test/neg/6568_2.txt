Although I'm not a fan of the "Star Trek" movies or universe of programs and books, I get some enjoyment in some of the movies with the old cast and in the case of "First Contact", even the new roll a little. However, this one was sad to watch ... it seems to be so much, but it has failed at so many levels to be one of the worst Star Trek movies. The plot is far-fetched, and wants to combine three or four stories into one of the best Trek adventures, but it ends with an unfunny when it tries to be, not tense when it wants to be and not action packed. of contradictions. The whole movie to use a phrase from Spock is illogical. The effects are nothing special, because I've seen Next Generation episodes that are just as good, that is, good for a television program, but not a big movie. The plot is laughing as the gang first wants to stop Spock's brother and join him on his quest for God. Yes, you read it correctly. The Klingons are attacking the look, which will actually set the much better uncovered Country movie. All in all, you know it's bad when the best part of the movie Kirk, Bones and Spock sings, and drives your boat. Well, Spock didn't really sing, but questioned the lyrics.
