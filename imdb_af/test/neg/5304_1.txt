OK, I bought it a few Xmas' ago through my son-in-law, who took me to see 'Shorty' in the cinema, where the lust of the "uber" was impressed. And look, both become short and cool to each other. I have read reviews from people who have not seen, become short and thought this movie was pretty good .... I just think his other way for film industry to deceive the paying client. All I have to say about this movie is WTF? After almost 10 years and Chile Palmer became a vagina. The script was basically the same. They have teamed up Travolta and Thurman after their success in Plup Fiction. They threw some big stars (plus a barn cargo nobodies) and thought it would be good ..... Vince Vaughn's character was just annoying, despite being a fan of both him and rock, both actors were a way that was unused and unrealistic. Actually, I'm glad it was bought for me as a gift as if I had paid money for it, I would have been very irritated.
