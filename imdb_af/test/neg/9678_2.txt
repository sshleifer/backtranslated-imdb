Recently I borrowed a copy of this junk from a movie, which took me three sessions over three days to go through. This is another comment in the making. <br /> <br /> But what I first wanted to comment on was the messiness on the special features of the DVD. It included a game memory that prompted the player / viewer to guard pairs of animals so they could board the ark. Each time it reveals the selected animal, the screen asks the player to find (or congratulate the player to find) "it's mate." This is a spelling error as it must be "his mate" as possessive pronoun, not a contraction for "it's not." It's an annoying mistake to repeat 16 or more times to complete a game. Of course, it's really a child's activity, but teaches children wrong spelling. <br /> <br /> And, oh yes, the game never changes. It's the same game every time with the same places of the same animals. Plus, it doesn't count as the number of moves it took to fix the game. So there is no lasting value or challenge. It's just a feature to list on the packaging. <br /> <br /> Simply put, there could have been more thought and care in this "special" feature, just like there are more thoughts and care in this tangled movie.
