Well, in all honesty it's beyond the bounds of stupid, but "Killer Pussy" is still a bad entertaining little movie. No plot, tons of calved cha-chas, cheesy effects, and a penis eating monster! What is not to love? Pretty much - a few explorers find these creatures who like to put themselves in a woman's cattle curtains until a pregnant man is unhappy ... ah, squeezed into his mouth. It finds its host who is later frozen in a deserted house by a group of moronic guys and their equally mindless, friends who break down. The creatures jump from every girl as they all play like drunken rabbits ... There are some cheap gore, girl-on-girl "bloodthirsty", KY Jelly vomit, sock-puppet samples and lots of soft core sex. Ridiculous but a cool waste of time ...
