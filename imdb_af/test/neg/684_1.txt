This movie is really bad. I like to flip on the TV while napping and this movie looks like it would be good to sleep through, and boy was I wrong. My body literally awoke me from sleep and said, "Hey ... this movie is terrible ... you should see it". I love bad movies with bad actors and stupid sites. Something about unintentional comedy let me go. This movie is incredibly crazy. I really don't know how to print it properly unless you recommend, just look to see how bad it is. I mean seriously, you have to see it with people. I made the best jokes during the movie and nobody was there to hear them. <br /> <br /> Worse than Swimfan. It's so bad.
