This movie, while it can be considered a good comedy, is not what made the previews. The first half consists of typical Robin Williams, who is on the right track, though he didn't really do many votes. He was always good at one liners and hitting the punchlines. Somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program used in the election. here is where the net 3 comes in ... a woman who helped with this program wants to tell the truth and the evil corporation wants to lock her up ** spoilers ** her boyfriend even helps them, although it is not even fleshed out ... this movie could have been one of political brilliance (perhaps with sorrows at dominion), but it falls short in a stew made by too many chefs
