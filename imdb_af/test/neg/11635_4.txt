1st Watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): The fast-paced animation effort by Ted Turner's animation group plays a lot like TV cartoons and leaves much to be desired about characters, but certainly has extremely indifferent villains. I'm not even sure why the kids want this movie, because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know little or nothing. Moderate effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to Disney efforts such as Aladdin and Lion King. Don't let it fool you - there's no story or quality comparison.
