a very horrible movie about a 30 meter long shark. bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing ending a complete. a means of time in my view. I thought it was a TV movie, but when I saw it, I couldn't think I was paying to see this patch of shit. Avoid this movie at any cost. Even if you like jaws, you have not seen them, even if you are interested in palaeontology, you should not see it, even if you like wheat movies with corn factors and do not, do not repeat, do not contaminate your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a sci-fi animal player, but some people gave it a 10 ranting ... don't know if they were serious or not (but sincerely expect them to be)
