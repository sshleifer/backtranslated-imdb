WARNING: SPOILERS Dear Roger, <br /> <br /> During your excellent career, you have made a wide variety of entertainment, some good, some notsogood. "Night of the Blood Cattle" falls into the latter category. It's not as indescribably awful as saying, "The Phantom From 10,000 Leagues" or, perhaps, "The Dunwich Horror." Nonetheless, one of my biggest criticisms of this movie is that I made it faster, better and cheaper for you. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the predictions and titles. Roger, the rocket sequence looks like something of Disney's man in space, not so good. The futuristic rocket looks like nothing in today's 1958. Why didn't you just use a Vanguard, Atlas, or even a Viking launch? Better yet, why not completely detach from the launch and start with a shot of space and the capsule floating in it? That's what I did for you, Roger. Secondly, why did the spaceship crash on reentry? Even a middle school physics student could have told you, your astronaut would have been extra-critical and largely uncovered on earth. I would have shown that your astronaut is "owned" by the monster (perhaps using the "negative / positive" big things you used in the "Satellites War"), contact with the earth and landing in the lost desert. It will also explain how you can "fertilize" your astronaut during the tremendous heat of rainfall, but still be destroyed by fire. Even with these stupidities. The first half of your movie is pretty good. Spending money on decent music would have been as good as a mediocre episode of "Outer Limits." But again, your writer describes Ed Nelson as the designer of the landing system, and then gives him some dumb dialogue about magnetism. The biggest problem with the second half of "Night of the Blood Beast" is Michael Emmet. He is horrible as the doomed astronaut. You had to fire him in the spot and replace with Ed Nelson. You could have combined Nelson's responsibilities with that of John Dunlap and save yourself the cost of one actor. I don't know if you've actually paid any of these people; But at least you will save the cost of catering three meals a day. I also exhausted the "seasoned parrot" costume and spent the extra money with makeup to turn the astronaut into the "blood cattle". Perhaps it was a bit too close to "The Creeping Unknown" for you, but that would have helped the second half rate tremendously. if you have a blood clot, would it not be a good idea to show some blood? Yes, I know the title comes from the embryos in the blood vessel's blood, but Kowalski could have done you a little better work if he threw a little chocolate syrup. After all, it looks like blood in black and white. What has your food, maybe two dollars? I would also have used some closeups. For some reason it doesn't seem so uncomfortable that the dialogue and bad acting in the close-ups do not occur. Watch nearly 70's TV series and you'll see what I mean. Oh, Roger, a note for your writer. You can't use a fluoroscope to show some poor schmuck full of alien embryos if you don't have any electricity. Remember, you roasted the generator in the first coil? Oh, and I almost forgot. Roger, can't you afford a fake knife? You know, the kind where the blade goes into the handle. I had one of those when I was 9, which was also the "Night of the Blood Beast". It was possible. It may cost another two dollars. I think I knew enough to make you a better movie. I know I know enough to do this now. So, Roger, if you decide to recover "Night of the Blood Beast" or if you are looking for a writer / director to work with you on another project, then I'm your husband. I will work cheap because I want a movie for you, Roger. Make. <br /> <br /> I give "Night of the Blood Beast" a "3". SPECIAL NOTE: If you want to see kitschy movies like "Night of the Blood Beast", the DVD I bought was $ 3.99 very good. You can also get Night of the Blood Beast along with many other horror / scifi movies in places like Bestbuy for around $ 6.
