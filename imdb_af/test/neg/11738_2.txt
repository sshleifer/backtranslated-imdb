This is one of the stupid ideas for a movie. Repeat a classic movie shot-for-shot. I hope nobody tries this technique again. In 1998, "Good Will Hunting" director Gus Van Sant tried to recall and fail Hitchcock's 1960s classic "Psycho". What on earth was Van Sant thinking? These remakes do not even come close to the original. The few changes made here were no help. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is obvious. See the original. <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
