Some of the secondary actors are really trying hard. And camera shots in the desert are very beautiful. Otherwise, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur writer. He is also a psychopath, a man who literally escapes from a spiritual institution. Is the point of this movie that amateur writers are writers? Harvey will do anything to read his book and turn it into a movie, even if it means a movie staff is being taken hostage. Do amateur writers ... grovel? Maybe they do. <br /> <br /> The movie's setup is far too long. We don't get to the point of the story until the second half. The first half darts and flash under assorted characters. <br /> <br /> "Shooting or being shot" is considered a comedy, but I totally didn't find it funny. Dialogue does not contain any subtext. None of the characters are credible as real people. They are all stick figures that perform "action" in a way that looks like cartoon characters. Indeed, the movie is basically an adult cartoon: stupid, dirty, bird-colored. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some actors are in this movie. They need the money or the exposure. But what do insiders Shatner and Harry Hamlin do here? Maybe Shatner wants more comedy roles. Is it the best he can do? Is Hamlin Desperate for Money? He was a respected actor. What happened? <br /> <br /> Although the story is supposed to be a satire, it comes more than a defeat of amateur writers. Maybe it wasn't the intention. But it's definitely how the movie can be interpreted. As such, the writing was very, very poorly written.
