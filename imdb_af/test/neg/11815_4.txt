Pam Grier is the super soul sister of the 1970s, which is featured in many blaxploitation films recently discovered and appreciated by a new generation. I can safely say that SWART MAMA, WHITE MAMA can be the worst Pam Grier movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; They were two female prisoners escaping from prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the road wagon. Connected together, the film becomes THE DEFIANT ONES for women, but has three separate stands: a fat criminal (Filipino sleaze star Vic Diaz) wants to kill Lee, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent Sid Haig) looking for the two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends are looking for her. The film eventually becomes so complicated and uninvolved with the two women that the title of men should be male. Grier, an action star, gets no chance to participate in any of the many (elongated) action scenes. Markov is excellent because Karen and Grier are OK as Lee, but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots. One interesting scene has the bounty hunter who forces a police officer and his captain to lower their pants so that he can shoot one with the smallest penis (judged by his whore), but is easily forgotten amidst all the chaos. <br /> <br /> BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA starts well as a woman-in-prison movie, complete with lesbian wardens and a shower scene, and then completely lurks to a hunting movie. If director Eddie Romero (known for directing Filipino horror films) just kept the WIP theme, he would have been good. Instead, BMWM actually gets real guy fast and the surprise ends up just making the audience wonder why they are sitting by ending a 90-minute movie for this like this! Another problem: where is the film supposed to be introduced? While some of the accents are Spanish and cities have Spanish names (Los Robles, etc.), all the natives are obviously Asian! Hmmm ... Recommended only for the hard-core Grier fans, who will even be disappointed.
