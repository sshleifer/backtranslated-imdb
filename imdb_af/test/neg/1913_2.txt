I hired the movie the other day b / c I love romance stories, but it must be the worst I have ever seen in my life. I find it hard to believe that Sam would fall in love with Kelley after they almost didn't say more than two words, when she had a big long-term boyfriend who totally dedicated her. I thought Kelley was a big lick in the movie, and he never changed. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett. I thought he did a wonderful acting job, and I'm going to watch more movies from his look.
