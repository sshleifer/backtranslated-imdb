It is definitely the worst vampire movie of all time. I saw it immediately after the interview with the vampire and I was thoroughly disappointed. Not only did this movie's script have craters as big as the big canyon, but the movie jumped from one scene to another, making the viewers confused. The vampire Lestat played by Stuart Townsend was terrible. Having a good body doesn't make you an actor! The end of the queen was too easy and suddenly insulting the viewer's intelligence. I will give this one star because Aaliyah tried his best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. Otherwise, I would advise Anne Rice to take an ax and start hacking those who destroy her brilliant story.
