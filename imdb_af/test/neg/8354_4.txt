Rich businessman's daughter, who, as a young girl, caught a rheumatic fever and now had a short breath, discovered that her marriage with a beautiful ne'er-do-well was arranged by Dad (who she referred lovingly as " Darling "); Worse than that, she can only stay a few weeks to live, leaving her husband to marry her royal romantic rival. Pure bunk. Paul Osborn's script (via Jerome Weidman's thin story) proud of the redundant kickbacks in the second half instead of continuing with the plot, suppressing the already-soap scenario in the turbulent talk. Why go backwards when we find out what happens to us? It is a "woman's whip" without faith in his target audience, so simplistic is the set-up. Dorothy McGuire, who has been wearing fur most of the picture, is not a clever, smart heroine at all; when she is upset, she turns inwardly and stiffly. After she realized, her marriage is actually a sham, she shrinks away from her husband like the complete virgin (well, that is a possibility, she and Van Johnson sleep in separate beds!). Ruth Roman has the best moments of the movie as a societal shark with her trap that is for Van, but what do these women see in him? Johnson can be charming if needed, but put him in a melodramatic environment and he also goes stone. MGM production values ​​just as well, but director Gottfried Reinhardt tries to add a visual flavor to the jump-back win and he tries a lively pacing for the film's first half hour. ** of ****
