Director William Shatner presumably had a much darker movie in mind when it came to Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, but the paramount packs, and looked at the huge cash receipts received by his humorous predecessor. insisted that the new movie also laughed a lot. So what we get is probably the worst and goofiest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are many good ideas, along with a few good things, and if you are in a charity, you can watch The Final Frontier just as you would like an episode of the TV series. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a good actor and gives one of the best guest star performances in any Star Trek, big or small screen, really standing there with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His portrayal of Sybok, Spock's half-brother, lifts the film consistently when it threatens to sink, which happens too much. Charles Cooper is also good as the old Klingon General Korrd; too bad his role is not as big as he is. If the story of Shatner's intentions is true, then I owe it to him because I was prepared to blame for the incessant folly and non-convincing action scenes on his feet. The reason for this is that I always felt like all the Trek regulars, Shatner was least agreed on everything Star Trek did and made it special for his fans. After reading his Trek memoirs, it is very clear to me that he has seen the show as another action adventure series that has only a science fiction environment. He chose Gene Coon's vision as Gene Roddenberry's; Coon was known for his work on the popular Western series, The Wild Wild West. Shatner also mentioned that a favorite Star Trek episode of his "A Piece of the Action", a crazy second season episode written by Coon, was written. So, finally given an opportunity to direct a Star Trek feature film, Shatner won't follow his instincts and create a movie with action with a lot of humor in the cheek humor? Well, somebody did, because that's what 'The Final Frontier' eventually became. Shatner himself certainly comes back to form as The Great Ham, and as Leonard Maltin points out, suffers from the film of a bad thing from the cutes. In the opening scene at Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say what's worse, the super-cheesy special effects or the divine dialogue. Running gags over equipment wrong on the business ran all the way from 'Wrath of Khan' and with that the fifth Trek movie ran into the ground. So has the idea of ​​a 'skeleton crew'. One new development is a seemingly romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura and it is enough to say that one does not burn the flames of passion between the two. It's a useless subplot and doesn't add anything. The climate scene where 'God' is found also doesn't add much; Whether it's a good idea or not, is debatable, but the scene itself doesn't make much sense. (The characteristics of the 'God' creature seem to be needed at the moment.) About half of this is a tired correction of the climax of The Search for Spock. Leonard Nimoy manages to save Spock's integrity, even as he spits such spotty lines as "Grab himself, Doctor." And DeForest Kelley, as usual, surpasses both Shatner and Nimoy; He really acted as an actor in the final Trek movies. So this trek trip is not terrible, it's just not very good. There had to be one more original Trek movie before the baton was passed to the 'next generation', and it was much better suited to the task than 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.'
