Director Todd Verow's unexpected turn in sentimental drama emerges gives a predictable outcome: nothing new to see here. Attractive but unconvincing leads - these 20 somethings are supposed to be at high school? - dribbling banalities over confused, adolescent sexuality does not strike me the best way to investigate the promise of Anonymous, but it was equally self-interested, but also honest, raw and, by comparison, not all that maudlin. I have no idea what to do about this lethal and uninspiring movie, except to hope Verow is still a career. Sure, it's pretentious, but so is Mike Huckabee. <br /> <br /> However, no feature is as horrible as Jim Dwyer's chintzy, electronic full-length score. of this movie. If I saw this and heard it in a theater, I'd have gone out. Fortunately, on my laptop, I could touch scrub and mute.
