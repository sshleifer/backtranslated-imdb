This thing, it should not be called a movie, is almost worse than "Manos", but just watch it hilarious. If you see it at the video store, rent it, if you see the 10th birthday edition, yes, there is a special issue. For less than $ 10 buy it, if your friend borrows it, just watch it. The acting is so bad, and the gore is so fake. After watching it, would you ask yourself why did they make this insult to film art? It seems that your face doesn't melt like the Nazis in "Raiders". If you do this, you should vote this movie as 1 (terrible) so that it can make the bottom 100, it really deserves a place there. I'm surprised it's not number 1, right now.
