OK .. At the time of writing, 65 people voted for this movie, which earned it a 5 out of 10 rating. My guess is that only the movie staff voted. So I'm here to fix. <br /> <br /> Never a movie elicited the audience's intelligence beyond that one. Given, I laughed hard, but the movie / story didn't really need me. <br /> <br /> I saw a VERY bad movies. VERY. But man, this one blows them all away. <br /> <br /> Speak '96 computers, acting ridiculously and wheelchair hunters - and we have young Tarantinos who can't fund their ideas. Yup, life is a cruel joke.
