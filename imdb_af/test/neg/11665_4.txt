It seems to be more of a woman's romance-soap-tension movie than I hoped it was .... just a tense thriller. Yes, the last 20 minutes were exciting, but many of the previous 75 were just as boring. <br /> <br /> Rider Hauer was a bit too muffled and didn't play his normal intense character. Natasha Richardson looked a bit silly most of the time and her character was very unattractive. <br /> <br /> The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I am, but it's definitely not something I wanted to see again, and the back of the VHS describing this movie was misleading.
