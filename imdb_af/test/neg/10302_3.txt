This movie starts on the wrong foot and never really gets going. The first scene shows a Lewevlug helicopter landing and just outside the window you can clearly see mountains in the background. For those of you who may have never been to Houston, there is no height change. The city is just above sea level and a 5 slope is considered a huge hill. To go with that scenery, tell any shots outside the hospital immediately to the viewer that they are not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or pine trees, and not Houston. Even the hospital itself, on the outside, is very incredible. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the top hospitals in the United States and is located in the center of the Medical District just a mile from the center of Houston, but every outside hospital indicates that the hospital is out in the suburbs or even the countryside. <br /> <br /> Obviously, anyone in charge of the real tropical stormy part of the movie has been eliminated because the many shots of radar are all wrong. The first radar image in the movie is that of Hurrican Hugo who beats South Carolina. Later we see Kris Kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is moving south over Houston, but the radar image he shows has clearly moved Alison north of the Gulf of Mexico to Houston ... probably the initial landing from Alison. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, it's not that bad. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder are all doing a decent job, as this is a straight-to-TV movie. The plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a little more entertaining. My one problem with the acting is the portrayal of Houston's with big thick southern accent. The actors all sound like they're from Birmingham, Alabama and not Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> The movie gets its point over and for the general audience it does exactly what it is meant to entertain. If you are looking for a factual version of what happened in Houston in June 2001, you'll be disappointed. One thing to keep in mind before watching this movie is that it is solely based on the evacuation of Memorial Hermann Hospital and not on Tropical Storm Alison and the impact on the Houston metropolis itself. If you are looking for a factual version of the tropical storm Alison's impact on the Houston subway, I suggest watching the weather channel's story stories for tropical storm alison. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of *****
