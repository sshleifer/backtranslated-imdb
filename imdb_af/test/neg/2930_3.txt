Well, I usually like Iranian movies, and after watching Kiarostami 10 "last night, I expected a good movie. I was very disappointed. It is by far the worst Iranian movie, and one of the most boring Asian movies I've ever seen. If you've never seen a Kiarostami movie, look at 'Ten'. If you want some good Iranian movies, you can also try "Sib", aka "The Apple". This movie is divided into 5 parts, and only the fourth, with some funny ducks, is worth watching. If this is the first Iranian movie you see, you'll probably no longer want to see it. I don't blame you, but you'll miss some good movies.
