The film opens with a cult leader trying to raise a dead member with his followers who sang for his rebirth, while the sun is inundated in the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) believes wholeheartedly in his power and is so tackled that he collapses with what appears to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, all involved, doctors and nurses are sentenced for attacks with Reanhauer's devilish spirit entering the curly body of Nurse Sherri. It targets everyone who uses her as a tool of revenge. Forced against her will without the memory of causing such damage, Sherri's host body murdered selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's fellow co-worker, Tara (nurse) Marilyn Joi, started a bit of booming romance with a blind patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Molded), once a star soccer player, whose mother is a practitioner of voodoo was. By passing Marcus's knowledge from mother, Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she unknowingly killed everyone. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land), worried about her current condition and well-being. <br /> <br /> Well, this was my first Al Adamson movie and I have to agree with his opponents that only from this movie alone, he seems to stick with paper pieces and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the spirit takes control of Sherri, is over and terribly laughing. A little soft core nonsense as stuffing, some demonic possession thrown into the mix (Sherri actually speaks in another voice when owned), with naughty nursing behavior (the three nurses focused on the movie are all very sexually active and free spirited) and a bit of violence / gore. The film is essentially shot in small rooms with a dull dialogue of a fairly common role. The sexual situations are not so difficult and they often shoot without revealing much. The movie looks shamefully cheap and there is an absence of excitement, although the cold score (which looks like Dark Shadows) helps a bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomania if she even screws a dirty patient, always complains about diseases he really doesn't have, with enough breast hair to declare him a Neanderthal) That's not bad, and Adamson's storyline, though weak, is somewhat coherent (it seems he rarely sends movies). Overall, the movie looks like it costs $ 5 and Adamson just can't overcome the budget constraints (... or, in my opinion, creating an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes obnoxious, boring and boring scene that doesn't make much of the story) . John F Goff did not believe the role of the hospital's psychiatrist Sherri would commit to being owned. He continually pushes Peter over her. I watched the unprecedented "lost" version I think is the right version to watch Nurse Sherri.
