"The Love Letter" is one of those movies that could have been really smart, but they messed it up. Focus on a letter that causes devastation in a small town, and the movie has an all-star cast with nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond were recently co-starred in the super-hilarious "In & Out" (also about a troubled little town), in which they were both good, but here they seem to get drugs. all over the place. I can't say what the people behind the camera are trying to do here (if there is anything), but they certainly haven't achieved anything. How tragic, that a possible laugh-riot has become so sad.
