This movie was so bad, I thought I was going to shout in the middle of it. That was all I could do to put it through. The start of the movie where they were in the war was promising. First, it made me a private Ryan saving ... or at least an attempt at it. Only we do not care for these people. There was no build-up for the characters. The child who dies, I think was crying ... but for some reason it all got irritated. Then we should listen to the line for a line of juicy dialogue that is urgently trying to mimic "Wuthering Heights", which was also quoted in the movie. Go figure. There was nothing original about the movie, it was like sitting through the everyday parts of every war movie ever made, with a bit of humor being thrown in to hope you get better. Unfortunately it is not. 3 hours later I left the theater feeling cheated. Anthony Menghilla must be shot to try to duplicate the English Patient, as it was a good movie, but now I'm wondering ... should I rent it and make sure I'm not trapped in the HYPE? Maybe I was, but I was definitely not trapped in the hype of this movie. I really went to the theater to want this movie. I'm a strong Nicole Kidman fan. Save your money, rent it on DVD and laugh at it, as I did.
