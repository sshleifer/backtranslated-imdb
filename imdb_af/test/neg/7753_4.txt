I bought the DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well, I spades it. She was nice in the romantic scenes; Bad Bill Paxton has already flown on the autopilot. I almost lost my lunch when he packed his big fat white behind his flight. We will realize that Julia was very good at French. <br /> <br /> I realized Julia was very skilled in French while watching her in Sabrina. . I watched 'Sabrina' with the French soundtrack to see if Julia called her own dialogue. They used someone else. Anyway, Julia was chosen for this Dutch film about a native French speaker with enough English to communicate with the American kite. Perhaps they wanted at least one well-known name for the British / American market. To my unknown eye, Julia's functions for Belgian success. <br /> <br /> The whole movie had a strange nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium in World War II. I would imagine that national pride would require a theme of heroic Dutch resistance to German invaders. The Belgians were much more passionate during the profession than the French or Norwegians. The most brutal battles of all came in the Balkans where Tito's communist parties fit the Germans. <br /> <br /> I noticed in another review that 'dbdumonteil' Julia Ormond believed to be an American rather than the real British nationality. Perhaps Julia's acting skills were big enough to leave the impression. <br /> <br /> Having watched this movie several times, it suddenly saw me at stake how out of season the movie is. It was set on Junuary 16, 1944 when the American plane crashed into the Belgian farm. The trees fall in the middle of autumn with lots of leaves and the weather is warm. People walk around in light clothes and the grass is still green. There is not the slightest trace of snow or ice. It had to be the mildest winter ever in Belgium. <br /> <br /> The real plot of the movie was a mess. Where to start? For anyone interested in World War II history, the film came as a farce. The scouting level used was a large 4-engine converted bomber. Such aircraft existed, but they needed a massive fighter plane to have survival. In fact, smaller and faster aircraft were readily available and would be much more suited to the task. The important codebooks in the movie would never have been on the plane. The crew did not need this information to complete their mission, while compromising this information would have been a great intelligence defeat. Even if the movie is the first item to be stripped from the plane, the codebooks will be. They were on their way to Berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of the German troops at the scene of the accident. <br /> <br /> The Daussois House, where Major Brice was a refuge, was a farm where nobody was the least interested in farming. Food would have been very little at this time. The Germans needed substantial amounts of locally-produced food to support their forces. The family truck would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the American kite. There was no fuel available to manage it anyway. <br /> <br /> The plot turn where Henri Daussois turns into jealousy in the US is pathetic. He had to reveal everything he knew about the resistance to be allowed to live. He would have to function as a double agent to frustrate any effective opposition. The woman with the secret radio would never have survived the war. <br /> <br /> "Major Brice" was captured in civilian clothes at the end of the film. It made him a spy under the war laws and accountable for execution without defense. He would not have softly surrendered to face questioning, unhindered by the Geneva Convention. Better to force them to kill him and, if possible, save his friends. <br /> <br /> I didn't read the novel on which this movie is based. If this film is a faithful adaptation, it shows an abnormal lack of development in the novel. Regardless of the novel, the writers can easily have made a better script that won't waste this opportunity to deliver a much better movie.
