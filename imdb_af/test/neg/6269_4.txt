It's amazing that in 2005 there were two films with the same story. This one came out with Tom Cruise a day before the other. Didn't they do the same year with Truman Capote, and the Zodiac killer last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> Author / Director David Michael Latt did not have Steven Spielberg's budget and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. It is a light imitation of the storer who is $ 588 million worldwide. <br /> <br /> The action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of Rhett Giles, who played a pastor who gave up his god. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey was creepy as a lower LT.
