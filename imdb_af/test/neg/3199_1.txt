Quite possibly one of the largest waste of celluloid over the past 100 years. Not only does it suffer from a painful (and highly predictable) print, but it is clearly a carbon copy of Alien II. Within five minutes I correctly predicted who would die and who would not (and in what order). The special effects are laughing; There is a scene where one crew member (convincingly) is leveled by two Krites who look like some teddy bears, and the sparse humor is misplaced and terrible. There are better things to do with a VCR remote than using it to watch this movie.
