(HR is what Himesh is called in the movie. I think he likes it too.) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall into the same trap. <br /> <br /> I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he did. No one in recent years has returned from the desert and made a point for himself. <br /> <br /> And I really expected a good movie (What about the 50 Cr budget and the cute actress). As intense as Reshamiya I thought, he would excel in a sentimental and emotional role. Ironically, he is portrayed the same, but for what care? Simply incompetence, indifference, horrible acting, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain. <br /> <br /> Blunders arrange. (For example, how can German police issue public instructions on a speaker in English? They communicate in English!) Unfortunately, this incompetence has become the standard in Bollywood. There are some excellent directors, but also very bad. The worst thing is that the majority just don't mind. <br /> <br /> Songs are the only saving grace ... <br /> <br /> Don't repeat this MH and find yourself a good director (low budget. No problem). <br /> <br /> The villain must have really shaved his head instead of the wig you know. After all, it's a 50Cr movie.
