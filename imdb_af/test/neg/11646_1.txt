Stay away from this movie! It is terrible in all respects. Bad acting, a thin reclaimed plot and the worst ending in film history. Rarely do I look at a movie that makes my adrenaline pump irritate. The only other film that comes straight to mind is another "Airspeed plane". Please, please do not look this one, because it is completely and completely pathetic from start to finish. Helge Iversen
