Well, it's about 1000 years in the future and we finally left the broad distance between galaxies! But unfortunately we still use guns that shoot dots, black men still call each other, and get high, stoned, fight, etc. Ordinary stereotypical urban black men still get the shortest point of the stick! Babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they come from Baywatch are close to the coast and the crew. Disabled people still need wheelchairs to move, no fine cures, implants or robotic legs. Dracula still looks gay. Should I go further ... In short, this move was shot at a typical scientific set of low budget props, actors and no real special effects to speak of. The beginning, the middle and the end were pathetic. I have to go and shoot myself now there is nothing left to live on.
