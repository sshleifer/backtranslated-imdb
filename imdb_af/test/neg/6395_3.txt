This movie should be called, Blame it on the Script. Directed by Stanley Donen, of Singin 'in the Rain fame, this celluloid middle-life crisis is not bad. It has some sumptuous scenes from Rio de Janeiro and several slenderly dressed extras that slope around and around the beach to the heavy sounds of Samba, but there's just something to look at fifty-something Michael Caine is going on come with whiny teenager Michelle Johnson It makes you feel ... well, sleepy. This storyline is also a complete stretch. Nobody, but perverse and in vain, old studio executives in Hollywood could have made this embarrassment green. Perhaps they are so used to having young bimbos as candy because they forget it's their fat purses that hold the key to their appeal, not their big Larry King-style glasses and yellow cigar-bleached teeth. It's one thing for a young boy to have an older man, but for her best friend's father who gets married? And then to throw her shamelessly at him? Ugh! There is nothing entertainment about it. It's pretty pathetic and grotesque. Take note of a young Demi Moore's emerging * cough * talent.
