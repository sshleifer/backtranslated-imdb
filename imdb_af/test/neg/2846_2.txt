Bridget Fonda is the sexually satisfied woman of attractive Hart Bochner. One afternoon she came home, called him "honey," and made him quiet a drink, just to find that he was sucking. Minutes passed while she stood still with his silence. Suddenly he burst into anger, accusing her of infidelity in the absence of any reason to do so, calling her the C word, hitting her head against a cabinet, turning her around and turning her on the second floor off balcony, her break hand and some ribs. <br /> <br /> She wakes up in the hospital where she seems to be deaf, although we see his lips reading perfectly. It avoids all the discomfort associated with an ASL interpreter or with her squawk words in a language simulation room. <br /> <br /> Good. Let me just explain the basic elements. This beautiful and dedicated disabled woman is beaten by her husband, betrayed by her, betrayed by her elderly mother, betrayed by her sister, betrayed by her parent, her bank account emptied by unknown hands, almost raped by a fat man in a bar accused, presumably killing her now missing husband, and being pursued by two policemen (Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber), one of whom is only interested in justice while the other apparently likes all women and is ashamed of their presence. The end finds her alone at a deserted bus stop with a handful of cash - alone, slow but brave. <br /> <br /> Now, a pop quiz. There is only one multi-choice question. "This story is written by: (a) a man or (b) a woman." Not to sound sexist. One can easily set a scenario about a decorated military hero and trained warrior trapped by his enemies, betrayed by his organization, beaten and tortured, escaping to exact revenge and excitement with the woman he loves. He thought he was lost long ago. <br /> <br /> The direction is functional and conventional. When Fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed, we see from her point of view the faces of the anxious doctors and nurses who look at her - it's at the camera - an echo of every scene in many secondary movies in which the gurney hurries quickly. drove into the corridor and wore striped white coats, and hung with stethoscopes over the camera. <br /> <br /> Hart Bochner played some interesting people in some interesting ways - some of The characters are stupid ("The Hard") and some are rather rude ("The Sea Will Tell"). His virile handsomeness has some kind of evil on it. It would be too easy to throw him as a hero. Beautiful, deliberately blatant performance by Steven Weber as the dumb cop - perhaps the best in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda is also interesting. Her acting range is limited, but it's on full screen. What makes her an object of interest is her almost stereotypical beauty. She is like a high school prom queen. Very female. Of course she can't help if she turns around or moves her hands so gracefully. She can't do anything about her nose either. For most of its length it is completely normal and attractive, but at its tip there is a bulge outward that follows the natural flare of its nostrils. The tip of the nose is full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> As for the movie - Pfui.
