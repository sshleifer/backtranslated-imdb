This is one of the stupid and worthless movies ever. It doesn't really qualify for movie status. It is VERY cheap (apparently shot at video tape), acted horribly and just rotten. I couldn't believe how cheap and improper it was. It looked like a home video! I believe I believe a man I know made a couple of houses that dug his video camera in 2 or 3 hours. It's so bad. I saw the name from where it came from? Asylum? And I will never rent anything with that name on it again !!! If you rent a movie, see if it is from this "company". One thing is true - if you like horror activities, amateur movies, then you might like this loser. It is absolutely boring and awful !!! You have been warned !!!
