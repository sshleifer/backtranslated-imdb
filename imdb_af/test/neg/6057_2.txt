It is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I've ever seen. It completely fails as an adaptation of the original myth, find out some nasty twists and reduce the 12 jobs ... 3 or 4, I think. It makes absolutely unnecessary things to try to integrate other myths into awkward ways, enabling the writers to read the myths ever, such as changing birds to harps, lions to sphinxes, the Oracle or Delphi to Tiresias and bulls to " a pedantic version of Proteus, even integrating aspects never seen outside of Sam Raimi's entertaining series, regarding his first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the Furies, so that it is suitable for the period. <br /> <br /> I could accept a lot of it, but it also goes completely into pure film standards; Most painful is the dialogue, led, pain-colored pseudo-Shakespeare triple. This is a poor reinterpretation of the myths, which is a sad attempt at the kind of postmodern revisionism that Crichton's "The 13th Warrior" attempted with regard to the Beowulf legend, while the strict mythological elements such as clear interference of the gods and magical superpower. A sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience, which I am sure many of the quality actors concerned are deeply sorry for.
