I really tried, but this movie just doesn't work for me. The action scenes were dull, the acting was surprisingly poor, and some of these characters were also stereotypical to be funny. Pam Grier tries, but if you have nothing to work with, even her great talent can't be a disaster. Even according to the standards of this poor genre, this movie is pretty bad.
