My faded childhood memories kept the echo of the Belfégor culture series in the French 60's ... so I was eager to see the big screen adjustment. I had to keep my money and have a walk in the Louvre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the scenario is still very pleasant and interesting (Le Louvre's fantasy), but the adjustment is ridiculous. The dialogues permanently hesitate between the French irony and serious "American affairs" without failing to reach, but not without asinine. <br /> <br /> Stay in some way or other and special effects are slim compared to what you can expect (low budget?). <br /> <br /> What remains of everything. Not much outside a few good shots from Paris ... which is seldom a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Belfégor was more than worth it. <br /> <br />
