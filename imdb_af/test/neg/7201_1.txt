If that were possible, I would have apologized for a movie of a NEWS star. It was by far the worst I have ever seen. It was as if it were a home movie that some high school students were bored, decided to joke. The "acting" was terrible. The "actors" did not even respond to the fact that they were murdered. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I bought this movie by accident. The Spanish title said Jeepers Creepers 3, so I thought hmm, maybe it would be OK. Wrong. It was honestly the worst ever. I didn't get more than 20 minutes of stupid movie. I skipped chapters and nothing was interesting. <br /> <br /> The camera camera was also terrible. It was like a home movie. I would never recommend anyone to see it. Terrible horrible moronic movie.
