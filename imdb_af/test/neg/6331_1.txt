La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, or Terror Express! As mentioned on the version I have seen, as several passengers, a long-distance train begins. Three-inch idiots, Dave, Phil & Ernie (Carlo De Mejo) counsel and it is clear they are there to cause problems because they intimidate the other passengers and staff and verbally abuse them. As the train soon becomes, things become bad when a prostitute named Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses sex with Dave, and he and his friends decide to hold the whole train hostage so they can have an orgy with Juliette. happens apart from a hero cop and his prisoner who decided to save the day. Erm, it really is ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was directed by Ferdinando Baldi and is complete and complete crap from start to finish. The script by George Eastman and Luigi Montefiori can be described as easily as a very boring porn as much as a horror / thriller. It's boring slowly, it's 35 minutes ahead of anything that even takes place. As a whole, the film lacks the kind of exploitation elements that Italian sleaze & horror delivered at that time. The film can be compared to another Italian production that made the Infinite Better The House on the Edge of the Park (1980) the same year. This is a very broad comparison, but if everything The House on the Edge of the Park made, the infamous film It is absent from La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, there is no blood, no gore, almost no violence, there are only a few very easy rapes. The story has no turning or turning and it is incredibly boring to watch. Italian sleaze & horror of the late 70's and early 80's is not known for its strong story lines or big scripts, but these movies really kick the bottom of the bar on all counts. The character is horrible, the film spends the first 30 plus minutes to build them up and gives a little background on why they are on the train, but it is soon forgotten and comes with absolutely nothing. I also hated the lame end and I do not know if I missed something, but was given a reasonable explanation why these three lambriens would cut a train? I don't think there was, was there? I'm sorry, but because your prostitution is not a reason for a prostitute, the filmmakers would definitely be more interesting and interesting if it was no longer likely. According to me, this movie is stinky, it's as simple and straight forward as I am afraid. <br /> <br /> Director Baldi does an OK job, to be fair, he only has one go and a few train compartments to work with so I will pinch him down because he said the movie is very be repeated. There is no style and he films the sex scene like a bad, soft core porno, complete with horrible romantic piano music. There is not a single drop of blood throughout the film, it's not a single drop. Forget about any gore or violence, because you will be very disappointed if you do, as I did. There are some rapes, but they are amateurish and have zero impact, the nasty exploitation and sleaze of saying I spit on your grave (1978) or the last house on the left (1972) is not here. <br /> <br /> Technically, La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is good and it's pretty good about what a low budget should be, but the environment obviously helped to keep costs down. The acting is poor as usual, but since the recording, the original performances have been lost. Fans of Italian horror will recognize many of the voices here. <br /> <br /> La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a horrible movie, it's just my opinion, but I was bored to wait for tears for something to happen and when it finally I never cheated, I want have those 80 minutes of my life back. This piece of crap is not even suited to satisfy the 99p VHS bargain bin in your local Blockbuster, one to avoid.
