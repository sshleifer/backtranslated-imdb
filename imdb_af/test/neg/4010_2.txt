This senseless movie was a complete disappointment. None of the characters is at least similar, so you watch what's happening without really caring. What was the worst was renting this movie to a gay owner, but only to find that this story of male hustlers was filled with homophobic young men who were engaged in many scenes straight sex and not a single scene of gay sex.
