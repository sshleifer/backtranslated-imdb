I have vague memories of this movie funny. <br /> <br /> Once I saw it again, I also changed or I totally thought about another movie. <br /> <br /> We seem to be sympathetic to Jackie Mason's character, but nothing in the movie actually gives that emotion. It is striking that he is really the only person who has a dialogue with loved ones. No one else's character may rise to the status of even vaguely human. <br /> <br /> I don't even like golf, but like the movie, I really chose myself for Robart Stack and the club's guys, really hoping they would repel Mason and Chevy Chase.
