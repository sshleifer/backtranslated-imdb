On the bright side it ended. Of course this is the only thing this movie is about. <br /> <br /> It's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen bad people. This movie is actually so awful, I went and changed my kids rating for the living dead to a 2 just because I wasn't Raptor. <br /> <br /> Official single-handed rating: "Come with me to another movie if you want to live."
