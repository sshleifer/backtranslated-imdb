Poor action movies are the cemeteries for martial arts star aging. In such films, they struggle to maintain that dangerous behavior that made their early work successful, but they all end in failure. Seagal is too old for this type of role, but he won't leave ... no matter how stupid he looks. Some hope his present work will somehow bring the magic back, but there is no magic left. The late 80's and early 90's belonged to Steven Seagal and his work made me a fan. I could see him fit in a slot on The Sopranos where his overweight body, jowly features and struggling posture could have found a home. I wonder what the return on his run is from direct to video? Because he produces it, I assume that the $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ is more satisfactory If it's the deal, we'll be subject to poorly done Seagal stock movies well in his late 60's and 70's. ...
