I'm sorry to say that these movies were one of the biggest disappointments of the year. Following one of the biggest disappointments in the movie sample, history is up to you, thinking you would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into much of the same staircase, the plot line is completely forced, the dialogue was so bad that the movie could be better dumb, and the action was confronted and far from the heart which shone brilliantly from each and every original movie. The best part of AVP-Requiem is actually the trailer that you go through the movie, finally realizing that almost every death and every really cool shot in the movie has already been shown in the trailer, which leaves little to be revealed and little to excite. be. I gave the movie an extra star to show the extra hot woman in the almost naked. The movie has emerged as a color-for-number sci-fi monster celebration that also played in the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened, because you saw it a thousand times before. The main failure with both of these movies is that the creators thought that setting up the movies in our time interested us in the story more than it could happen to us one day. But what people in the day they returned the arcade game was that it was similar in an over-futuristic version of the Alien Trilogy Timeline that allowed more of a suspension of unbelief. this is where the future movies should draw inspiration. To be honest, since a waitress was murdered by the Alien who we all feared since childhood, it doesn't really matter to us. Return the series to its roots. learn from the former masters and do not mess with a winning formula by making a 'bold new vision', we have kept the original for a reason, we want to see it again. Lastly, the end is the real WTF moment of the entire film, * SPOILER * after the great climax, the survivors are caught by special Ops soldiers, justifying their terrible actions by saying, "We've followed orders" and then a dime is turned on and both start acting well and are being changed into rescuers. then after the long trek back with one of the ominous in-heaven survivors, we cut to the most bizarre rock hanger I've ever seen, with characters you've never seen in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude) not seen The subtlety of a punch after the face, they reveal that there will be another movie with the hint of a plot line that will blush a sci-fi channel's original movie and raise its nose. So, in summary, if you have to choose between this movie and do any other activity on Earth, skip the movie and do the other thing.
