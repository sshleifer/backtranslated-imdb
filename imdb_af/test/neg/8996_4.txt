Naach A more detailed overview can be obtained anywhere else on the web. This one is a good portrayal, though I don't quite agree with it. Taran is a commercial man and therefore only views from his corner. Ram Gopal Varma (RGB, like a political party) created a wonder in Rangeela, so it looks like a pale reflection of it. one in some parts ... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara. Both are good! The former has better acting talent, although the latter emerges nicely. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like Anthara's character. She is faithful to her art, not touched by any unnecessary emotion and certainly not too practical. She is a dance scientist, actually she is so sure of her theories that it is even compared to a scientist who would insult her. Hey .. Donald Trump. Maybe you should be Melania, here is Anthara and you have already built a Taj Mahal. Isn't that that easy? Abhishek on the other hand is a practical fellow who has money, power, fame, etc. Want. That's why these two struggle to get a break in the film industry. They can't get together, given their different styles and approaches to life. It's very typical, but what I like about the movie is that it says what an Abhiman would say in his total runtime, in one scene! What's new? This movie takes a different angle from the movie industry and how different people are touching it. There is always something different about RGB's movies, this one is different too, it is far too slow for its standards. In parts it almost skips one to sleep. <br /> <br /> Striking It's hard to see anything other than Anthara in the first half of the movie. I think this skin show was needed for the particular dance series :-) Also, it seems that Anthara is a pro in Yoga, she is too flexible, almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby improves as an actor with every movie. I'm sure his filmstar blood pays off rich dividends. The title song was really good, the music was generally above average.
