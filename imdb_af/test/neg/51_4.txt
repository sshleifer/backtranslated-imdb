One of the last surviving horror screen greetings - Conrad Radzoff - dies and put his body in a mausoleum with television-before-death snippets of the big Conrad greeting you while you visit. Unfortunately for him and his prisoners, Conrad's body was borrowed by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a large shepherd's house where they drank with him, toast him, dance with him, laugh with him and then sit down. and he sits down in a coffin just by lying in a room upstairs. News from the missing body reaches Radzoff's widow and her friend (who is skilled in the black arts) and she holds a kind of ceremony that Conrad lives again, so that in his own words he sees an eye for a tooth, a tooth for a tooth. "Well, Frightmare is an interesting" bad "movie, certainly, it's cheap. The sets look like they're borrowed (what I'm sure they are), and the special effects and blood and guts are liberal and unreliable. The acting is averaged below average with a few exceptions, but Jeffrey Combs or Re-Animator celebrity is in the drag, but really he does little in this rather ungrateful role as a horror obsession teenager who has a dead body for kicks to steal, not one of the "kids" except the pretty girl Meg plays is good. Nita Talbot plays the "friend" of the Radzoffs with confusing interest. policeman is playing Porky's self from Porkys, but grateful to all of us, one thing above the material rises: Ferdy Mayne, an often overlooked Germany actor who owns Christopher Lee, has a vampire in The Fearless Vampire killers served, do more than l worthless work as the aging horror icon in public life and a true demon of a man in private life. . Conrad Radzoff in a bad person alive, living only for his own pleasure and we see him kill twice before he is even dead (of course, not one of the swinging teenagers at that time). Mayne can look very regal, speak very elegantly, and surrender with ease. If for no other reason, you should see Frightmare for his performance. I do; however, believe that when they showed Radzoff's black and white cuts they used Christopher Lee footage (anyone has any thoughts?). Anyway, one can guess what happens and it does: Radzoff goes out and goes to the children who disturbed his peace. Again, the formula is thin and overused. The acting for the most part is anemic, and the direction oh so ridiculous. But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ​​incompetence. Definitely worth a look. Watching Mayne put on screens in his mausoleum, every time I brought a smile on my lips.
