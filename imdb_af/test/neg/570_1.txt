Don't waste your time. The plot draws, the characters are wood and uninteresting, the motivation of their actions is completely unclear. Wait for the "romantic" or "comedy" to happen, and nothing has happened. Even worse, the love letter is not even romantic, but it seems written by someone desperate to make a deadline. Did I mention that the "plot turn" we saw of 15 minutes in the movie was "Hollywood Smart", which means it's shocked to shock, but with the Hollywood mentality - nothing of the sort, and instead it is vaguely offensive. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth the $ 2 rent. Don't bother to see it.
