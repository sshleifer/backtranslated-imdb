Corny and awful, I was not surprised at this short show program. I remember fine when Tales From the Crypt tried to reuse these calf episodes as they were scary. Along with bad plays and bad music, I was surprised that this crummy scene was ever devised. It never appeared again, and one can only be grateful for these circumstances.
