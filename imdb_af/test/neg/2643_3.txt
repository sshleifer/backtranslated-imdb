If it wasn't for the very handsome Jennifer Jostyn starring, I would have turned off "Milo" after the first 30 minutes. But as easy as she is, she's not enough to save this movie, not with a long shot. <br /> <br /> Milo starts with a group of young girls who accompany a "supposed young boy" in a yellow glib to a house in the woods where he shows their embryos in pots. Apparently, the deal was that if he showed them the pots, Milo gets a gynecologist exam on each one. One of the group of volunteers is Milo's "first patient" and he leads her behind closed doors. Moments later, blood flows beneath the door and we are beaten in the present. Enter the sweet Jostyn who plays one of the girls who grew up in the present day. A level-trust substitute teacher whose closest friend apparently is a goldfish, is invited to return for a friend's wedding. Yep! You guessed it. Return to Miloville. Milo, who allegedly drowned years ago, seems to have a dilemma that dies and begins to terrorize and murder the girls, he has not been investigating these years. <br /> <br /> The character Milo reminded me of one of Cronenberg's mutants "The Brood." He could have been frightened, but how scary could a villain be wearing a yellow raincoat? The plot even confuses itself and the conclusion made me leave me 90 minutes back. I send Milo, an intrepid slasher movie, to stand in the corner!
