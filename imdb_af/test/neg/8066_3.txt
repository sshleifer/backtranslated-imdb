This movie was a mess. There wasn't anything really going for it. The only character who had an appeal was Bobbie Phillips' Maya, and she wasn't even worth it. <br /> <br /> The plot is standard, double-cross the double cross double cross. With a few too many double crosses to make sense. Sometimes it means "keep you guessing" in this case, it "keeps you waiting". By the end I just wanted everyone to be thrown into jail or lap.
