I haven't reviewed IMDb yet, but this documentary document is so over-rated that I felt compelled to wait. I won't even be ready to see if I wasn't a guest at someone's home. The film was on very low levels: First, Treadwell's video was confronted. The more I watched, the more he seems to act as a person desperate to be famous instead of one who comes out of conviction. <br /> <br /> Second - The other in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the pilot pilot, was just as confronted and stubborn as he was. God, it was artificial. <br /> <br /> Third - Treadwell's mission to protect the bears does not even make sense because it has done more damage than the trees get used to in human presence. I believe that Treadwell loved the beer, but there is a lot of research that suggests his efforts were wrong. Sometimes we really need our enjoyment of wildlife. <br /> <br /> Fourth - The entertainment value of the movie was not half that of other wildlife films such as "March of the Penguins" and "Winged Migration". The filmmakers, in my opinion, had a poor work of sequencing and had little incentive to watch. <br /> <br /> As a person who likes Alaska, Bear and other wildlife, I'd like to see more people dedicated to the conservation of our wildlife. Hopefully their efforts will be less human-centered.
