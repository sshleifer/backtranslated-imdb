I watched the directors last night ... glad it was free hire, even a dollar would have been too much to pay to watch this "no noir" attempt. The anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me, not smart, looked more like budget constraints than anything else. I also derived the "non-traditional" casting. If I had to stop following the story to wonder: "What is the black chick / drag queen doing there?" then the storyteller failed me. Again, not clever in my opinion, but annoying and annoying, and many film school final project is. And for the sake of shooting in black and white, use at least some of the techniques used in old movies, which are fully used to not color. There was no use of nuances in the lighting, no shades of gray, no depth, no texture ... just black and just white ... boring!
