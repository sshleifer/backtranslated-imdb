Although well-produced for television film, Dying to Love You series with low grade melodramatic beauty. <br /> <br /> The film opens to Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, who looks much older than I remember him) who is a struggling businessman leading an empty, lonely life after his wife, Ruthie (what looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold), leaving him with speed. Now all Roger has his cats .... and his ad in the newspaper. <br /> <br /> Once his ad is answered, he calls Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa-oh, no matter I am who you want me to be-Lawrence. Then ... they have phone sex. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where you came from or when you were born, but I remember the phone was playing sex by the late 80's. I'm sorry, but it was trashy. <br /> <br /> Soon Roger and the broad hook and have a whirlwind romance. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas, and then some sex with Roger's son in the other room. She binds him to bed and grants him. <br /> <br /> Roger is just as stupid that he doesn't realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a bimbo who loves to sleep. God forbids women sleeping just with one man. Soon, strange calls will begin. Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute volatility, and she keeps shouting about her ex-husband who used her to beat her. It's funny to see Roger believe her through all these things. This is until a busy co-worker tells him to sneak a housewife through her possessions. He takes her advice and looks and sees, he finds a suitcase that crawls with fake ID cards, wigs and guns and a crossbow. He immediately took the bag for the police and arrested her. Even though this jazz, he still likes the dumb broadband. She tells so many lies, her tongue seems to attack fire once she tells the truth. <br /> <br /> Roger continues his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela who looks like Gremlins 2. She also has a child and Roger loves her a lot. But something in Roger's subconscious keeps him in touch with Lisa Rohn (if it's even her real name) and he goes back to see her. <br /> <br /> Now, Lisa is the "ex who doesn't go away" if she deserves a sales-free card and appears on Roger's doorstep and his son, Matt, is checking her out, he saps all over the floor. IL Rog is so stupid, he throws Lisa out and doesn't even change the locks. Boy, if all people were so stupid, I wouldn't even write this review. The end of this movie is such a boyfriend, you won't believe it. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson is a TV Movie King. He looks like a dull mummy in this movie. He is a little wood and stiff. The brilliant Tracy Pollan works well with her role and her trampiness is true. She is very beautiful and I see what Michael J. Fox sees in her. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to watch when you are at that late night, but then you can fall asleep again, considering how boring and thin it is.
