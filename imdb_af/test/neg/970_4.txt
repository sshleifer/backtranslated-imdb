Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that results in a good comedy. Great expectation often leads to dissapointment, and it seems to be the case. <br /> <br /> When Eddy, as a police officer, cheats a drug deal made by detective Robert, it stumbles so badly that they eventually show a live action reality TV cop. Logic is not a big component of this movie. The super rifle they spend the second half of the movie confirms it. A twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheet metal and three will destroy a home in about a minute (without reloading) is just more a fantasy than science fiction. A five-pound gun, which shoots hundreds of shots per minute without any setback, is definitely the weapon of the future with the technology of the past. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie is designed for non-adults or children, so if you're somewhere in between, it's the movie for you.
