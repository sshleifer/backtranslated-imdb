This movie is so bad, there are no words to describe it. If I had a monkey video camera for an hour, it would be a lot more entertaining than that. The plot is so boring and unimaginable, it's not even worth mentioning. The best part of the movie was when the credits rolled in and I have a rogue knowing that the main characters were James Bond III. Just trust me and stay far from this garbage dump!
