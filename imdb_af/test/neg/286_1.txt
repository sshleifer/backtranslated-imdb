I had very high hopes of going into this movie. After all, Ocean's 11 was a true Hollywood product. His quick fire jokes, incredible strength and stiff writing made it one of the nicest caper movies I've ever seen. Of course, with all the money that made it was a successor on the way and I was excited. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I was absolutely blown away by this movie. Hidden by how terribly wrong things can go. This movie had everything for it; the return of the entire original cast, the same director, news reports of crazy on-and off-set antics. How could it have gone so wrong? <br /> <br /> It immediately starts with one of the most uncomfortable and unnecessary opening series ever and goes from there. After a pretty crazy short play between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the film spends Andy Garcia waltz from scene to scene a few minutes and tells every individual member of Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back have. Believe me when I say that these scenes are just Andy Garcia's running time here, because without these ridiculous uncomfortable shots his screen-time will be good within five minutes. <br /> <br /> This leads me to another great grim I have with this movie. The pacing is so uneven that characters are completely dropped out of the story, and sometimes brought back later. Bernie Mac's character is taken off the script well in advance, and never comes back, except for 2 short scenes without dialogue. Garcia appears for the first few minutes, and comes back for a special short scene at the end. Roberts shows up for about 5 minutes, and is not even mentioned until about 20-25 minutes are left. Even Clooney herself spends a large portion of the film in jail. <br /> <br /> It'll all be excused if the movie is funny. Some Sins. 90% of the jokes are completely flat and the one who works is at best a rogue. The "plot" is undoubtedly worthless, and has deceived me. At one point in the film, the team is taking a $ 2.5m job from the nearly $ 100m they need to collect before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even recognize how absurd the time is to do this job, but they do it anyway! More than 30 minutes of the film revolves around this work they don't even have to do, and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot has just been added to fill the current time. Furthermore, the equipment they use to deduct this work costs only millions of millions to fund. Just wait until you see what they are doing to get this job done and realize that it will cost much more than $ 2.5 million to deduct. It is clear that they therefore have to make several jobs to make the money. The beauty of the first movie was the one big head and how ingenious and complicated it was subtracted. Here they draw so many jobs in so many different ways that they all rush because they explain that they will make the film for a few hours. <br /> <br /> We all know that they are in this movie, that there will be a big spin at the end. So is the nature of the caper film. The turn at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe how cheated I felt. I won't give it away, because I know most of you will be foolish to throw the money off to see this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> What I will say is that most of the 2 hours you have been completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see this movie after I had the Ocean's 11. I felt the theater as if I was the victim of a real big concession drawn by the film. and the crew of this movie thought to think that this movie would actually be worth watching. I've never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com, but there is a first time for everything. Consider yourself ... 1/10
