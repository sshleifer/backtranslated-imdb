Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "Zombies") is a rare find ?? a movie that promises one thing, but another one delivers. This is one of the few genre films made by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio renowned for making several B-grade stock movies and players, some with action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Karen Tunny & her two daughters Sarah & Emma arrive in the Pennsylvania village of Addytown to move into a big house that owned Karen's closest husband after finding a miner's act. Once they arrive, they find that the house is very old and needs repair. But the condition of the home is the least of their problems, as they discover that the area is prone to disappearance and Karen is confronted by the area's owner and commands to move out. Once the night falls, the Tunnys find the reason behind the finish: a group of zombie children killed in more than 85 years in a mine strike in the area, come from killing anything in the bush. With the help of a grizzled neighbor, Karen tries to stop the curse before her and her children. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD and expected a movie with carnivorous zombies, but was let down by one thing: the movie is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie movie, with the dead kids the personification of a curse that haunts the bush, revenge on anything moving around at night (although the internal logic is somewhat flawed? the children can only be saturated by the sacrifice of animals and are repelled by the bloodshells on doors, The same way that vampires are printed by garlic and mirrors. Should these children not be zombies?). The plot as such would not be a problem and would actually be entertaining, but the biggest problem is that the producers have adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film, just with this effort flat on their faces. fall. <br /> <br /> As such, such a movie would be like a ghost story, but because of a poor writing, nothing more than a completely routine effort. The movie's greatest power is the play, with the role of better performances than the movie deserves. Of particular note is Scout Taylor-Compton, who does her role very well ?? It's a pity she's devastated her genre credentials with a very poor performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombie's script).
