Ram Gopal Verma usually makes so-so-cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from a Hollywood movie. Its every movie after Shiva is in the cookie cutter genre. Sometimes he makes a really horrible movie like this one. <br /> <br /> For the first 55 minutes we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast who is conquered as a skilled dancer (go figure!) and a wannabe actor trying to get it rich to make in Bollywood. They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer / gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, anxiety, the usual sadness, more gymnastics, anxiety, song, dance, anxiety, more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, again sleeping. And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT bid from the leading lady-cum gymnast cum dancer. <br /> <br /> But hey, you're not alone !! The editor, director, photographer, in fact, the whole role and crew sleep through the whole production. The only difference is that they are paid to slumber while paying money for this shit, so you lose. Ha, joke is on you. Don't feel yourself, but for our poor Gal broke, as she sees daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest leotards and exercise clothes. Puh reading, when will the poor get a break, she's STARR-WINNNG? <br /> <br /> Antara Mali can't act. RGVs lost their marbles. Abhishek tried hard but failed. No plot. No story. Nothing. She must have paid HSRC well to make these relentless things, in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting bench. What a great deal. No need for an acting career. <br /> <br /> Of course, such an absolute rubbish can only be made "Made in Bollywood"!
