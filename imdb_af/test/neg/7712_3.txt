Isn't it strange how shit films always tend to be a little better when you start to look at them like "boy, it's going to suck harder than what ever sucked"? It is quite impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high quality? or even remotely positive - expectations, as "House of the Dead 2" is a sequel to something commonly regarded as one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever released. The horrific reputation of the original was actually a great benefit to director Michael Hurst, as it easily surpassed the quality of his predecessor. And exactly how embarrassed it must be for your Boll, huh? To admit that a straight-to-video sequel without starry force or promotional campaigns is much better than its own pretentious video game interpretation? If anyone still doubts: NO, "House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" is not a good horror movie at all, but YES: this is definitely better than the first and even worth the rent if you are looking is after a tireless plowing movie with very gory blow, sleaze and silly humor. There is no real connection to the events in the first film (another benefit) and this part two is like a typical rancid sex comedy on a university campus. The male fraternity club plans to attack a girl's house exclusively occupied by blonde cows with huge breasts, but the party is interrupted when a mad professor (Sid Haig!) Runs his car over a girl and takes her back to her. lab to turn her into a zombie. This is the start of a rapidly spread and deadly epidemic, but no worries, as the government is willing to send their best scientists and soldiers to the campus to look for survivors and bring back blood samples for an antidote. The hunting of zombies looks like the most common thing in the world for this squadron, they even call them Hyper Sapiens, but their ever-increasing amount eventually endangers the lives of the hardest soldiers. Director Hurst has happily found his inspiration in the more distinguished classics of the genre, such as James Cameron's "Aliens" and ?? of course - George A. Romero's death trilogy, especially "Day of Death". Fortunately, he did not make the same mistakes as yours Boll, which in his movie (why?!?) And * slightly * exaggerated with the use of CGI techniques videos of the actual video game. HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence, such as chopped female bodies and detailed amputations, but it never really becomes misleading or shocking. Of course there is not the slightest tension to enjoy and every horrible horror clich√© here too. The film is very enjoyable as long as the story writer Mark Altman does not try to explain the origins of the zombie epidemics. They walk corpses with their brains hanging out of their skulls, so we really don't need to know what caused their death. Especially when the explanations are given by a blonde girl who is unclear what all the medical terms mean. Just avoid being bitten, honey.
