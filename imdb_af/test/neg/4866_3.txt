This movie starts with a pedestrian setup before it comes into the standard type of action where an office worker is trained in secrets. Collect. <br /> <br /> I couldn't say the acting was bad - there were some good "surprising" faces by Hamilton and Sheen - but I really didn't need it. <br /> <br /> At least risky finals gave me a good laugh for my pain. Still, if my life flashes before my eyes, I think I'll be moving this 90 minutes forward. <br /> <br /> I still need to write two lines of text to get this thing published. Yes, very resistant pack that wears luster. I made a special promise to myself to never watch a movie again.
