I was a fan of AMERICAN WOLF IN LONDON movie and so was curious whether a 16-year-old prosecution with the French language could be done and put local, supportive and minor characters back in the role. Tonight I watched the "Edited for FOX Network" version which was a kind of curious hybrid of several hyperactive successors. The authors and directors pay tribute to some of the key concepts. Tourists get wolfbiting, full moon coming out, boy meeting girl, boy being animal, boy dying heroic death after help of ghost victim. To me, the strangest aspect of this "formula" teenage horror special effect was the decisive part of the school teacher love interest of the TV comedy "ED" as one of the werewolf's inexorable victims who were more or less totally impersonal in the writing lines that they handed over. I haven't seen a horror flick yet, but this framework is a sequel (a vampire fighting spot titled BLADE), but I think parts of its plot line should explain how villains (it's ghostly) the " good "werewolf during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris metro train, a la SPEED. This 1997 studio product is a strange hybrid of a film, as significant technical effects are shown for scary purposes, but the authentic horrors of the original have been completely undermined, I think. Such a strange rewriting of the werewolf legend and "movie mythology"!?! My suggestion for those considering it in the video store - go for a classic "top of the line" Thriller instead: Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!
