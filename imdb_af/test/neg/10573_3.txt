I thought it would be funny. I have. I don't know what happened. But I think a lot of the problem is unhappy with the casting. I don't know who this kid is, he can be a very nice person, but he wasn't right for this movie. And the supportive role was great, which just made it clearer. For example, there will be a scene with him and his love interests and your mind just start to deviate, but then Keith David speaks, or Leslie Nielsen or Marion Ross, and it is as if someone has lit a light and suddenly you can pay attention. give it again and you think it may not be so bad. But when they return to the main characters, the lights go out again. <br /> <br /> The spoofing material available in the superhero genre is abundant, so the fact that most jokes were a leap makes you wonder who wrote this thing. I mean it had some funny pieces, as I remember laughing a few times, but now I don't know why and it was just a few days ago. <br /> <br /> I'm really giving it a take it or leaving it rated, but I think most people just have to leave it.
