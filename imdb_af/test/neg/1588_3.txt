You would think there would be a business that would really make fake kids for the movie business or maybe they could film some scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I think it's too much for the budget. <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting aspect of the movie is the attempt to cover the idea of ​​exactly what is right and what is wrong in society and how the law goes into it and try to do justice to it. despite that. <br /> <br />
