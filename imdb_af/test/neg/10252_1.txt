Is it possible for a movie to get worse than that? There are a lot of monkeys wandering around, mumbling b ******, which is probably stupid and we have to laugh? There is no plot here to keep you in the first place. Even when the women finally act, there is no sign of improvement; The most anticipated thing happens and by the time the movie is over, you may be asleep. Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, it's a trash! I can't believe there's even a sequel to this! <br /> <br /> 1
