My friend and I rented this movie and within the first 5 minutes we didn't know what was going on. It felt like it had to be within the first 15 minutes. It was a terrible movie, my little brother could have been a better actor than some of the movies, and the plot (if you could call it) was full of holes. I will never recommend this movie to my worst enemy, but anyone I really want.
