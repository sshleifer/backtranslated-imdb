How LEARNING DREAM managed to get into the Laemmle 5 in West Hollywood is beyond me, because it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I had known when the first scene opened, Eugene, Oregon, that this dud of a movie with characters you'd like and feel sorry for their exclusion days of high school, but can't, as they are such losers, so timid and horrible with past dialogue. <br /> <br /> Then, clich√©, the three high school graduates end up in LA, and here is where the movie could have been realistic if it showed they were trying to find a career in acting. But no, one job as a used car salesman, the other is a real loser in a garage call center selling magazines. Even the bastard who runs the place has heard more appeal than that terrible actor with the terrible foreign accent. And they get fraudulent money from an insurance fraud to set up an Executive Recruitment Corporation without any experience, showing just a good life in LA nightclubs with such wood and bad players, they better not have SAG. cards ... <br /> <br /> I could continue on this bad movie, but eventually I went out of the theater, which had six people in the beginning, and when I was away, four men were the only ones in the audience. I wanted to keep this movie, but I couldn't find one in the story, characters, writing, dialogue or the actors. Whoever casts this role must retire. Amen ... enough ...
