Now it's a movie I really don't like. It is one of the most boring 90's horror movies, mainly because it starts slowly and centers in a boring atmosphere. The settings are not even attractive to the eye and do not serve the purpose of the movie. <br /> <br /> The dolls look really cheesy, not in a good way as in the whistles of Poppespier 80. What did they do to our favorite toys? <br /> <br /> The story is lame, not interesting and never explains the sinister origins of the dolls. There are no deaths as in previous movies and the f / x is terrible. <br /> <br /> I first fell asleep when I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.
