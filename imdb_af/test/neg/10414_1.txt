I was attracted to this movie by its horrible, low-key, 'real life' story line. It's a twenty-something-old flops in the Big Apple and comes back home to stay with his parents and even more floppy brothers. It can only work, but there is a problem. And the problem's name is Casey Affleck. <br /> <br /> Casey Affleck is almost catatonic in this movie. His acting mantra must at all times "do as little effort as possible". Or "why talk if you can mumble?" Or maybe, "put yourself in a coma, as soon as the camera rolls." Lips move when you talk? Rare. Facial expressions? None. Muscles in the face? Dwindle. Something? Nothing. Anything? Zip.
