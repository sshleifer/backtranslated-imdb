Cimarron was painful to go through. Although Irene Dunn does a good job with the hard-hitting script, Richard Dix's pompous and exaggerated role is brutal. Over time, the character of Isaiah, as well as other races and religious concepts, has not been addressed, although the film is somewhat progressive on the roles of women and the abuse of native Americans. Editing is especially poor. It is without a doubt the worst of all the "best" pictures.
