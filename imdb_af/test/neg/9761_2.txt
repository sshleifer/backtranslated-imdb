Don't get caught up because the premise of this movie is a good one. That is, but it doesn't make a good movie. <br /> <br /> Comedies require a healthy writing and masterful direction. Unfortunately, this poorly executed film does not. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not deliver in his comic performances (Les Bronzes series is another example). <br /> <br /> The comic timing is awful. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are from other movies again. Others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh. The plot has messy subplots (the allergic daughter, the lesbian co-owner) and only develops the stocking. It's not funny and it's not a second credible. <br /> <br /> Compare it to any comedy by Billy Wilder (Some Like It Hot, A Foreign Afair, etc.) Or by Leconte's compatriot, Francis Veber, a true GENIUS at the French comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre, La Grande Blonde, etc.) And you will see the difference in their strict scripts, great comic acting and timing. joke leads to the next one. <br /> <br /> If you watch Mon Meilleur Ami twice, it is cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign for a comedy.
