O my god! The Beeb hit a new low with this atrocious act of political correctness. A mixed race family living in Birmingham, with a disabled child who has been well thrown in. Anyone who has appointed this trip must be hunted and thrown to the dogs. The usually funny Jasper Carrott is about as funny as piles in this show and doesn't let me start over the other. They have the timing and subtlety of a nuclear bomb. I just hope that comedy will get better, but with that of Little Britain and Catherine Tate, I seriously doubted it. I think you'll be better off setting the box for a decent comedy of years like Fawlty Towers or Bottom, if you want a laugh. <br /> <br /> BAN THIS SQUEAKY CLEAN RUBBISH!
