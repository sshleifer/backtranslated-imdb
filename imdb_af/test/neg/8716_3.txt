But even caricatures need a plausible plot line. I suspect that in 1934 part of that audience would enjoy this clumsy farce long ago. It doesn't age well. It gives Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts experience and experts support players in the forefront. Pendelton, which is prominent in the Thin Man series, is trying its best, but is being persuaded by a relentless plot. With the background is a stage game with gang members, not exactly original material. Movie's saving grace is the ever-outstanding Edward Everett Horton in a wasted show. But don't waste your time watching Everett in this movie. I would encourage someone to see him in his holiday attempt, with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. The same era in 1936, but much better writing and storyline. Better gags and unnecessary to say stardom.
