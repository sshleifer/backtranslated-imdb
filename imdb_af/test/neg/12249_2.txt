There are times when I start wondering less than halfway through a movie what the creators think, they decided not to burn every line of footage, but rather to release a movie that has no real merit. And I mean any kind. This movie doesn't even stick to porn movies. In fact, Heavenly Tears are completely and completely boring, and sometimes a little disturbing in his naive. The girl, who, as I recall eighteen, masturbates while I think of an older Nazi who hit her with a car - the "syndrome in her room as a way to introduce ourselves" to sitcoms and Robert Zemekis films. Then, on their second or third encounter - get it - he is the shame, the one who resists the sexual advancement of the girl, and all she has to say is, "I'm old enough. I want to," and he took her in bed. Then, after sleeping with this girl, he almost knew, he felt ready, as if he could die with her in bed and he would have lived a full life. It's like "Lolita" without a bit of social and personal comment. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is the most boring part of the movie. No interesting angles or originality, even for the sex scene, which is supposed to be the mainstay for these types of movies. The masturbation scene is just a camera that surrounds the girl's bed (look very fake, as if on a stage), and it gets confused with her fantasy that the man falls into a waterfall. The play "I'm finished" is just a close-up of the girl's right side (head to her breasts) with the man on top of her, and it's the same shot all the time, though there are recurring cuts to it. A fairly unrelated scene of the Nazi older sister, who has some kind of turbulent loved ones on him (she is ridiculous and stupid, so it doesn't matter). I think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes, and it isn't brightening or revealing.
