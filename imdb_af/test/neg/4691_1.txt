Not many people remember 'The Carey Treatment' and I can't say I'm guilty of them. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards did it during his leaning years - it's between Pink Panther movies.) And for a doctor's story, detective (Coburn) worked to get a murder in his hospital too loose. It's actually pretty forgotten. <br /> <br /> Coburn is reliable as always, and O'Neill is beautiful as always, but there is just something missing from the proceedings. The story turns and turns are not very involved and even the climax, which is supposed to be nerve spot, is rather tiring. <br /> <br /> A blessed event entirely and unhappy with it, as it was based on a Michael Crichton book. <br /> <br /> At least, Crichton didn't write a sequel to it. <br /> <br /> A star. "Carey" up, Coburn.
