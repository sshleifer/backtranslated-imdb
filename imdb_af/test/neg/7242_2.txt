The Salena incident is in Arizona where six deadly prisoners of state jail are being transferred for reasons that have never been explained. Driving the heavily armed prison bus gets a flat and the driver is forced to pull off the road. Then two blonde birds arrive, and after the unauthorized prison guards are seduced, they get the best, six prisoners are released, but in a shooting their breakaway car is damaged and they are all stranded in the middle of the Arizona desert. They decide to go to the nearest town, Salena, a few miles further and take the police with them as hostage. Once they reach Salena, they find it strange that the place is completely deserted with no other person in sight. They soon discovered that the whole town had been killed by meat eating aliens and they were firmly placed on the menu. <br /> <br /> Also known as Alien Invasion Arizona in the US on DVD and apparently with the title Terror Town This rubbish low budget sci-fi horror flick is co-written, compiled and directed by Dustin Rikert and has no real redeeming features. The Salena Incident is the kind of movie that gives movies a bad name. . The movie can be roughly divided into two parts. The opening of forty or fifty odd minutes focuses on the prisoners in a thrill of the thriller, the guards and the escape, although it is very poorly written and performed. The dialogue between the two blonde birds and the prison guards is so bad, it is unintentionally funny, as the two fit birds talk to the two non-fit prisoners. Funny things actually, unfortunately, the Salena Incident is supposed to be a sci-fi horror movie, not a comedy. As soon as the escaped disadvantages and their prison guard guesthouses arrive at Salena, it goes off in a sci-fi horror when the strangers arrive and begin to kill our cliché character, because it's good because it's annoying. Look, the whole movie sucks as it is badly written, thought and made. I can't really be bothered to trust why, but trust me. The Salena incident is terrible at every level. <br /> <br /> And just a bad, boring and silly movie. The Salena incident was also poor. The plays of the action are terrible, the strangers look terrible and never appear on the screen, along with the human character and it is sometimes difficult to tell what is happening. The special effects are also poor, the aliens seem rubbish and the CGI computer effects are also absolutely terrible. The editing is poor, the cinematography is poor, the sets are cheap and the whole thing is really a look. There is a little gore, there is a gunshot wound, someone is halfway torn and a cut hand is seen. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it's shot at a low budget. The Salena incident has low production values ​​and looks cheap from start to finish. Filmed in Superior in Arizona. The play is horrific of no one I've ever heard, although the actress playing the female doctor looks pretty. <br /> <br /> The Salena incident is a dirty sci-fi horror movie that is just about every way, not worth it, 90 minutes of yours, mine or anyone else's time.
