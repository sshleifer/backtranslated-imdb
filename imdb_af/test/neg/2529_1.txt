I can not believe it! Were they crazy about filming a movie about Connecticut in southern California? For the sake of God there are palm trees everywhere. In one of the opening scenes, a man says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws a newspaper down, the newspaper says something like "Greenwich Herald". Greenwich Connecticut does not have a "Herald", it has a "Times" as in "Stamford Advocate AND GREENWICH TIMES." (Refer to Stamford, Connecticut Newspaper). Perhaps the filmmakers should have done some research, I mean my God, at least get the name of the newspaper, or film in places at least at the distance of Connecticut.
