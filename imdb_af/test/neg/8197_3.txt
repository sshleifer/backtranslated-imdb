It is a movie that was probably made to entertain high school, early high school parents. Maybe it's funny to them, they can even even see something about it. For me, the play is poor, and the plot is poor. There is not much value for the adult viewer. I saw this movie so weak and boring. Sometimes there was the possibility that the movie might be interesting, but it never really materialized. The creatures look pretty good, but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't look like anything else. Sometimes I wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy, or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again. This movie was just not good for me.
