This movie was terrible. It was too much to center on Eddie, Clark Griswald's brother-in-law. Eddie works much better when changing good quips such as "Christmas holidays" and "Holiday". <br /> <br /> I really don't understand how a movie like this will give the thumb. Now, don't get me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but just felt this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general. This movie leaves much to be desired and really needs some bigger name players.
