Get Shorty was an excellent movie. It was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comic acting and a serious plot. Be cool is like a few cheap kicks to pass for a successor. John Travolta as Chile Palmer seems to forget he's ever been in the crowd. He played it as if he was a bored movie, rather than a bored movie performance that was previously a Shylock. Uma Thurman, big in almost every role she's ever played, is so tense and confusing. Is she supposed to be this or smart? The chemistry between her and Travolta is tense and uncomfortable. Other than that, just add every movie clip you can think of. A well-educated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer, an indecent gangster wannabe in Andr√© 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian, a gimmicky black man who was in Vince Vaughn and a stupid celebrity cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was the Rock, which gets its own new client as a gay Samoan bodyguard wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: it makes no sense. Get Shorty smart with Chile and play one group against another and get up. But this movie tries it with about a million different characters. And even Chile doesn't seem to know what's going on. Fans of Get Shorty are warned: this is a very different, much worse movie.
