I was very excited when I saw this movie in competition at the Montreal Film Festival. Along with Elephant and a few others, I thought the issue of US gun violence / culture would be intelligently addressed and in a fashionable way for filmmakers. The press release has promised (in not many words) a "Red Violin" for the gunmen, something to remind us of our NRA-shoot-up mindset in this country. <br /> <br /> After I waited for 9:15 for a 9:00 screen (what technical issues they would have experienced, it's beyond me), we were finally let in the room for the movie to see on DV (where did the advertised 35MM print go?). I think I just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is a horrible mess. We get the "rifle", in a vignette with the most unrealistic "biker" I've ever seen (and I know more than a few). The movie does not fall into irrelevant "character development" because the characters are also a. stereotype, b. losers, c. stereotypical losers and / or d. caricature. It takes another 30 minutes to get the plot motion, and once we get there, we wish the inability to talk between the couples and / or the cyclists and pawnbrokers. <br /> <br /> The movie finds it, but not without making a clich√© unmarried. I didn't care about the white rubbish characters that came into contact with the rifle and the portrayal of the minority characters should immediately scream the NAACP. All these people will pursue a rifle because they are at the bottom of the common rubbish dump, and will look for an opportunity where it is found. would have provided at least some soul research on that part of the characters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the promise unfulfilled. The plot sketch was wonderful. In the hands of a P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt, it could have been a powerful piece. But due to bad script, direction or both, the thing is an unmade rubbish that must be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My bigger question is who thought at the MFC it was competition material. Better bury it on Showtime at 3:00. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
