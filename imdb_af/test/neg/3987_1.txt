It was supposed to be in the "Bible belt" of Northern Ireland. Well, as someone who grew up there and was a child in the movie era, it just didn't come true! The accents were all over the place - anything other than County Antrim / Derry. The church didn't look like I ever saw. "The Church of God" is a fifth denomination, but one in the movie was definitely not the Pope! The early minister was dressed in the clothes of the Church of Ireland (Anglican) - and no. C. or I. would call himself "The Church of God". The minister was often addressed as 'reverence' - they may do it in some parts of the world, but I never heard it when I lived in that area. Ministers were addressed as "Mr ......" <br /> <br /> This movie was very badly investigated and thrown - quite typical of the Irish cinema - annoying! A movie can have a good plot, but if it doesn't look authentic, it's rubbish.
