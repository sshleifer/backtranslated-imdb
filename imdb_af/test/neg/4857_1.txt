I must say that this movie was really awful. The acting was average. The performance of the movie was terrible, as well as the soundtrack and cinematography. I found myself bored in most parts of the movie and the clich√© lines did nothing to me. The two boys who starred sometimes looked deviant and did not pull off the emotion needed in the movie. The girl was sometimes scary and looked like a doll that was scary. the end was not satisfactory, although the film was over, I didn't make anything for the characters. this movie was boring and didn't do anything for me, i didn't recommend this movie to anyone.
