* SPOILERS! * When I first saw the preview, it looked like a good old-fashioned movie. I like bluegrass music, so I can't wait to see it. When we rented the movie, we read the back and it sounds even better. The movie was rather boring for the first half, and now and then a song will be played. Then (I'm shy to type it) saw a lesbian love. I did, however, have something more than friendship among the teachers, but I certainly didn't expect nudity and lengthy sessions. I looked at my mom and I was ashamed, because I chose this movie. But it was also a good movie. The acting was good, the actress playing Deladis was great. To be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. I don't mind seeing the movie again, but I bought the soundtrack that day after watching the movie. And there are continuation chips that follow. If I were you, I would overshoot the movie and just get the music.
