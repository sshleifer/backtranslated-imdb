I'm quite surprised that someone touches or moves this movie. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the movie sounded like an excellent, but challenging, idea for a movie about a rare kind of relationship, but one (if I can judge from the real examples I know) is very deep and loving. <br /> <br /> However, the film was written cheaply - poorly written - and although it has a number of pretty shots, I haven't found it as something special. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem is that it's too short and weak to give his audience enough time to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we don't really care about any of them, and so Do not really touch their stresses and obstacles. <br /> <br /> I think a recovery - from the script - with some character development by some very good writers - can greatly improve it. It is instructive to compare this movie with Brokeback Mountain, which the authors have taken on elevated levels as the author of screenplay writers who were clearly aware of how to write a classic tragedy and accomplished their task of care, planning and excellent workmanship! But people just want to retry the movies they don't need! You miss nothing really if you hit this one: I found it very disappointing and it was only saved to get a 1 star from me because of the daring and foolishness it took to make a movie about this sensitive subject.
