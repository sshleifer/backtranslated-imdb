Although I rarely flew, I am very interested in aviation ... and this film has been added to the precious aviation theater company. <br /> <br /> 1. Why does the captain check the ground? Why does he even measure the oil level in the engines? With turnarounds up to 15 minutes in commercial aviation, this is not a typical pre-flight check. <br /> <br /> 2. WHY does the captain beat the aircraft tires? Strange kind of check check. Or rage management :-) <br /> <br /> 3. The cabin has a crew of 3. All the big, western, two-edged jets built since the 1980s have a crew of 2 people. Now try a guess how old the film script is. <br /> <br /> 4. A helicopter is driving along with the airliner. Must be a quick one ... and the captain's words to explain the "maneuver" to the passengers is indeed hilarious! <br /> <br /> 5. With arrested lift grids, it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft. This happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than the stall. <br /> <br /> 6. The lift grilles have hydraulic drives. After the collision with the business fly, it would probably have cut the hydraulic lines and thus make it useless for management, but it will NOT restore them in some position. <br /> <br /> 7. The fire in the back kitchen was a stupid idea. It is designed to show that only the gentleman asks for the extinguisher and fights the fire, no matter who is actually trained to do so ?? the flight attendant. <br /> <br /> 8. By the time of the collision, the aircraft's lifts would have been in a neutral position. The movie could have ended here ... <br /> <br /> 9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cabin) has three bars on his uniform. In fact, flight engineers have two. <br /> <br /> 10. Why does the captain cut the cabin with an ax to examine the damage behind? I thought it would have been the flight engineer's duty, as he had to do technical checks before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. There is no unused space in any aircraft. At least commercial aircraft can't afford the luxury of a water-filled compartment. <br /> <br /> I could keep on and on ... but lastly, I laughed hysterically about how scriptwriters present aircraft disasters. ! Woooohooo! Most aircraft disasters happen in such a short space of time that you can't just make 90 minutes of them. But you can always fill 90 minutes with sensible and insane crap, regardless of the genre.
