Throwing large ensemble, but unfortunately a lot of undeveloped ideas make the role of the movie. One does not feel at the end after waiting for some kind of closure, closure or at least an ironic twist. <br /> <br /> It felt that familiar "Curb" without daring it, Larry says as the annoying polar opposite.
