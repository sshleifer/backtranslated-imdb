Well, I saw this movie at the last San Sebastian Film Festival. The reaction to that was ... we say as funny as the movie is unintentional. It has happened that they have shown a copy of terribly wrong Spanish subtitles. They were a translation of Chinese into English and then into Spanish. It was all confusing, the sexes switched over (girls appeared as boys and boys as girls), and my friends and I remember good lines ... but because they were so absurd. All in all, it's not a good movie, but if they ever show it on television, and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (not so much with the movie), go ahead, "Visible Secret" is your movie.
