... when baptized in another language. Let's look at it: Nielsen or Schwarzenegger are not really good actors when it comes to dialogue. And given the campaign lines they are supposed to explain, it's a loose situation. Any kind of voice ear is certainly an improvement (and that is actually - at least in the German version). <br /> <br /> But that's just a small point. The acting is bad. The accelerated battle order is pathetic. Nielsen could not use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag. It becomes painfully obvious compared to the fluency of the movement exhibited by the child (who had no training) and the athletics that Sandahl Bergman showed. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger does his Conan thing - nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some of the footage is nice, I'll have to allow it. The dragon skeleton bridge looks cool. But more often than not, the plaster is too clear. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is not worth seeing. Even 'Conan the Destroyer' is better than that (although only marginally). I'd rather have seen Bergman rather than Red Sonja than she originally had to, but I doubt it could save the movie, oh well. <br /> <br /> 3/10
