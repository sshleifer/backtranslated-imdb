Well, I like to benefit from the doubt. I watched his performance. <br /> <br /> It's not funny to me. All I remember was very "strange" sounds and screams. I don't think I even cracked a smile. The only thing that looks a bit like humor was his Anjelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston bit. I think you can get thinner at the moment to watch it. <br /> <br /> What's the "Ask Whitey?" Article? Is it a ripoff of "Ask a Gay Dude? / Black Man?" from Chappelle's Show? Isn't that so obvious? But when Chappelle did this, he exposed the ignorance of the subject. Like Borat. But how about picking random people and shouting at them? It's not funny, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And I'm pretty sure I've heard some jokes from somewhere. a "hard" scream. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it wasn't funny. Seriously. Don't waste your time.
