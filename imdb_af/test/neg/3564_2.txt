A depressed, flu teenager does a lot of bad things to a socially active older lady who doesn't like using shades or curtains in her windows. He steals all sorts of things from her, peep at her, calls prank and plays a variety of unpleasant tricks on her. Strangely, he doesn't like her a secret. Initially, she didn't look to somehow make him bother her. Then she later seems to respect him for his brutal celebrated activities. <br /> <br /> There are some illogical items to notice. One is that the man comes through a glass panel from the brightly lit side at night. In real life, such a thing will not happen. The brightly illuminated side of a glass panel serves as a mirror. He will see nothing. Also, everyone in the night will be able to look inside him who sits in his well-lit room. <br /> <br /> Another illogical item is that the creepy teenager takes a job as a milkman and his one and client only every morning seems to be the woman he picks up. Easy work, if you can get it. <br /> <br /> I saw a short movie about love on a public show. By the end there was no single open eye in the house. A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE is the odd language film for those who don't like to read captions. Not only are there very few words spoken in the movie, but much of the movie is silent. A peaceful rest in peace.
