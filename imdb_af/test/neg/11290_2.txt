I must admit I was deceived by the title and summary on the back of the box. So I printed it in the UK and kept waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting for something good to happen. But that doesn't mean of course. The makers of this movie must be attached to a chair and made to save 'Private Ryan'. Maybe they'll learn something.
