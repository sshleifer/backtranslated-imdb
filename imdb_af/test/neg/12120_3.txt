Most of the positive comments posted here are as amazed as the movie! It takes a long wind to appreciate a boring and boring movie, one supposed. Some just called the film 'contemplative', meaning slow and without plot, but one Dutch judge hit the nail on the head: this is an important event that has changed into a dim film, the tone of which in the whole first scene. Here, a young couple is shown a flat by a broker who is predictably speaking, without starting and regardless of what is going on. So it's just about every other character! <br /> <br /> The only silence in this picture is dream series - Soviet propaganda snippets - and it's also the most interesting parts of it. It tells you something about how viewable the rest of the movie is. <br /> <br /> The device of filming most of the scenes in extreme proximity - as if watching through the blinds - turns old quickly.
