I saw it because I never saw Tel-Aviv, where the story was set. I was disappointed as it does not offer many views of Israel's largest metropolis. It's also pretentious ?? one of those movies that makes you guess to give his meaning until you finally give up with a shoulder from the shoulders. <br /> <br /> The main character is Batya, a woman in her twenties who works as a waitress at weddings. Her parents don't care about her, and if a girl with an inflatable ring walks around the sea around her, she needs to look after her. The little girl is not talking, and Batya can't give her social services because it's the weekend and the agency is closed. So she took her back to her apartment with the leaking roof, and if it was time to work in the morning, she had to take the girl with her. The boss is very unhappy about these and other shortcomings in Batya's performance. <br /> <br /> Another main character is Keren, who is getting married. At her wedding party (where Batya works of course) she breaks her legs out of a ladies' boxing door whose door doesn't open, and so she and her new husband can't take the Caribbean vacation they planned. They end up in a pleasant beachfront hotel without views. It smells bad, there's noise from traffic, and Keren complains all the time. Her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman? a writer ?? who also lives in the hotel, and Keren worries that he slept with this stranger. <br /> <br /> The third main character is a Filipino woman named Joy who looks after old people. The old woman she is hired to care for is very tight and does not speak English, only German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English, but no Hebrew or German. Joy is mostly concerned about how her son goes back in the Philippines, and wants to buy a toy boat, as he asked. She finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it. The daughter of the old woman, who hired Joy, is an actress who appears in a sort of post-modern "physical theater" adaptation of Hamlet and doesn't come with her mother. <br /> <br /> The road in which these three stories ?? being briefly crossing, solving themselves, is supposed to mean something profound. I didn't find it. There is a fantasy element for Batya's relationship with the girl, and perhaps Batya's non-existent relationship with her parents is somehow reversed in this relationship. When Joy sees the toy boat in the shop window, a strange effect is used where the small sails are waves as if blown by the wind, and it is as if they are on the scale of a real ship. Keren pulls the perimeter of a bottle around a ship that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room, and a tale of the strange woman's poetry calls a ship in a bottle. But what does it all mean? I thought about it for a while and realized I was not going to lose sleep in the process. If someone out there has a clear idea of ​​what it's about, they might fill me in.
