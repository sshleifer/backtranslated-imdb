Fortunately, you don't need a lot of book learning to understand where this thing is going. Clearly, a cash poverty on Universal's big hit THE WOLF MAN (made just one year earlier) is found, the always -Watchable George Zucco in another of his patented "crazy doctor" roles as brilliant , vengeance scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who envisioned a wetland store, is Louisiana Bayou, claiming revenge against four of his former counterparts who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job. You see, they mocked at his claims that he could mix man with animal to create an unstoppable army of wolfman beings who would be useful during wartime. Fortunately, Cameron found the ideal subject for his wolf block injections - a hollow, childish half-white called Petro (Glenn Strange). Petro is pretty clueless about what's going on, doesn't ask too much question and lets the doc tuck him on a table and shoot him with everything that happens in his spray. This leads to a time-varying change of man that changes into a werewolf. Cameron lets him out of the house using a secret passage, so you basically get a big guy (Strange is 6'5 "), dressed in overalls with bushy beard, hairy legs and a set of plastic teeth that Excessive, most of the time, when an eyewitness sees the animal and kills a little girl, the local population beats their guns and organizes a post to hunt it. Whip with a whip, also has a handy antidote to reverse the effect, Petro also goes to the big city to try and trace the professors who made a mockery of his original theories and she the home is Cameron's daughter, Lenora Anne Nagel, as well as Lenora's neutral reporter boyfriend Tom (Johnny Downs), whose first tendency is to deal with an upright walking prehistoric essence (!) <br /> <br /> Although a typical chintzy-VC flick is in many ways, with insignificant sets, cinematography and mock-ups, as well as a fairly blooming supportive role, keep it awake, thanks to the histrionics of star George Zucco. I have no idea why Downs received top billing; He shows in half an hour and really doesn't have much to do, and he's not so impressive to do it. It is Zucco's performance altogether, and he is wonderful and screaming, talking to himself as he fantasizes that he is talking to his friends. "I'm not interested in your imbecile mouths!") And slipping in and out of mind temporarily. Strangely, he seems to be his performance as the hilarious, naive and slow, semi-delayed country bumpkin around the entire oeuvre of Lon Chaney Jr., in turn as Lenny in OR MICE AND MEN, to his performance as the aforementioned WOLF MAN. Anyway, Strange and Zucco do a pretty good job playing each other. My favorite part is when Zucco calls him a "guinea pig" for a colleague while Petro just sits there and stares at a doorknob. From the misty marsh stations are also nice atmospheric.
