I have to agree with the other two comments. I waited more than a month to see this great new show, A & E was hiping. What a disappointment !!! The show is almost all about Ryan Buell. His voice remains champion, not creepy. It sounds like he's talking in a look. Like the second episode, which is about 30 minutes or so (if you take out the ads) he is being pursued or followed by something he knows is demonic. He can't say the name, every time someone names that name, they write it on a piece of paper and give it to someone else. Not particularly informative or entertaining or credible to the rest of us. Why can't he say the name? ... it would give the devil more power. Funny, I always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities. Knowing the exact name of the devil does not make it easier for you to throw it out. Now, the next episode, which is just a short while ago, is titled "exorcism". So does Ryan need an exorcism? Not to say that it couldn't happen, but the performance so far has given no evidence or evidence of anything. I can tell Ryan that if I was a little kid, hell if I was an adult, and someone gave me a small bottle of holy water to scare something that frightened me, I'd look elsewhere! Except that, if you do not have holy water and blessings, etc. Using the right way, do you not only hinder even more slandering things that are already evil on you? I will probably look tonight, but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it will probably be the last time I see it!
