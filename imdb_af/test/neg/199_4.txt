Just watched UbuWeb this early experimental short film led by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read it right, Orson Welles! Years before he became known for the radio's "The War of the Worlds" and his distinctive debut, Citizen Kane, Welles was a 19-year-old who just found his mouse. Apart from Vance and Welles, another player here was one Virginia Nicholson, who would become Orson's first wife. She plays a woman who sits on something that is given back and forth with an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton in black). During this time, a man (Welles) will pass her by (for the sake of the scene repeatedly). I will not reveal anything except to say how interesting the silent images were when they were constantly jumping. It's not saying it's good, but it was fascinating to even watch the guitar score (by Larry Morotta) added to the 2005 print I watched. Take a look at Welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avant-garde.
