Some slap this movie because it was made in 1979. It said a lot, it's really scarce. <br /> <br /> Remember the feasible back projection or the horrible, horrible camera- Detecting supposed "in-flight" objects, these are the stunts the Concorde takes that will cut you into disbelief with the absurdity. Barrel roles, loop-and-loop and violent "elusive" maneuvers have surprised me why the world's Air Forces did not only fly Concordes as their main fighters. <br /> <br /> Here are the important lessons I've learned from this celuloid cheese festival: <br /> <br /> 1. The Concorde is at least as agility as a Ghost 4-jet fighter. <br /> <br /> 2. You can fire a firearm at Mach 2, simply open the cabin window and extend your arm. <br /> <br /> 3. If the blast gun fails to get rid of it, don't drop it, as it may go off. <br /> <br /> 4. The Concorde can immediately get rid of two Sidewinder missiles. <br /> <br /> 5. A flame will divert a heat-seeking missile each time. <br /> <br /> 6. To eliminate your aircraft engines is a safe way to throw off heat-seeking missiles from the track as 5 (above) failures. <br /> <br /> 7. When carrying out an accident landing in the Concorde, it is apparently impossible to pre-spray your fuel. <br /> <br /> 8. Concorde pilots are all cattle-trained veterans. <br /> <br /> As you may think, this movie isn't very realistic. The consequences are primitive according to contemporary standards and this, together with the nonsense acrobatics that the Concorde does, make it a movie that deserves little but mockery. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended!
