Anyone who writes that this is a good thing the child can work on or put money into this godly college experiment. It was mean, slow and painful to watch. Running time of just about 84 minutes, it feels like three and a half hours. The only guilty person is the director, who knows nothing about how to set a scene, where the camera should be placed! 95% of this horrible movie was shot by long masters. Two or three people talking or shouting in the frame forever (or forever), No close ups !! No medium shots !!. There are two so-called battle scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would shoot some close-ups or medium shoots for them. They looked at many amateur people. The scenes with the father and the boy shouting at each other would have worked better if a cut of just the father or only the boy acted or reacted. Tri-C must be very annoyed to show this true. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, some of them are fun because they're so bad, it's not one of them.
