.... is where I assume this movie comes from. I mean, I've been watching many B movies over the course of my young life, and I won't even classify them as a B movie. I remember remembering movies in my high school mass media class that surpassed this one. <br /> <br /> So the point of departure ... a lot of dance numbers and goofy crap happens. Women in bikinis, who are not even so nice to start, dance in the beginning and sing. Children with furry coffins appear and girls with patches in the sunlight. I mean, I can hardly take a coherent sentence just to think about this movie. According to most people on this site, Manos is the hands of Fate and Pod People the worst movies (MST3K classic :-D). I was one of them. Then I saw this movie. Usually I don't try to get a movie dirty, but the people who made it really deserve it. It's so bad and IT unbearable, and I assume that the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who has rated a ten of them.
