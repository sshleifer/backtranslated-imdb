The revisionist history - which makes the evil Marquis de Sade is a semi-heroic romantic - is fascinating enough. But the terrifying acting, amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this movie painfully bad. The only reason to keep up is that almost all the women in the movie are beautiful. And incredibly tortured for days, hands tied overhead, apparently not detracting from a woman's beauty, hairstyle and makeup. My guess is that the producers are mostly filmed in Russia, choosing women for their appearance - and willingness to work cheap - rather than acting abilities. If you decide to watch it, because you have nothing better to do, or a movie student looking for bad examples, fast forward through any scene that doesn't involve nudity.
