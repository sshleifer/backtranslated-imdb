[Warning contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I didn't have any sympathy for any of the characters, including the most important one about the death of his girlfriend's friend v.quickly (but that's good as he gets up with an ex prostitute of the casino to which he works). The main characters are portrayed as this wonderful intelligent writer who is drawn into a web of fraud, although his monologue of the book he is writing is running. I can't say I would buy the book, maybe it would have been like the voice resort (which came in annoyingly to tell a bit of the movie you might not have been able to understand through his book) had 52 different personalities ... to represent each card in the deck, but I deviated. In the end, there was a twist that the main character was set up by someone close to him, but since I failed his character on this point (I found it impossible to keep anyone in this movie, the characters all one-dimensional zombies) I really don't mind, and were happy the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Plus points: The English actress from ER does a dodgy South African accent. Points: An annoying movie
