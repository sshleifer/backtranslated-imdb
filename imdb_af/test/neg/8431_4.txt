GINGKO BED is a strange movie. It's very complicated, as if it had many ideas, but didn't have the ability to bring them all into a coherent story. Instead, we get several plotlines that differ in their own separate little movies. Oh yeah, finally they finally get up, but it looks rather ... superfluous. Of the note is the girl and her problems at the hospital. Was this ... interesting? Then there were the "we are spirits, so we have no physical" elements, which leads to the same problem people had with GHOST, namely: If the characters have no physicality (it is not a physical shape) that is not, how exactly do they stand to fall through the floor, or raise the ceiling for that matter? <br /> <br /> GINGKO BED was highly regarded as a new breed of South Korean film. There are many special effects, but the movie itself is hollow and the faux melodrama will just "touch" those who are easy to touch. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed overview of this movie and reviews of other foreign films)
