Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It's just as bad. Actually, an uneven and unfair depiction of "bad" versus "good" in the wine world. Have noticed that the filmmaker is trying some of the leading protectors of individual wines and terroirs. The work of the camera is at its best dizzy, while the content has long been able to sleep. This is not informative journalism. What I got from this movie was that the filmmaker is trying hard to make a point about the worldwide wine by showing, for example, that the Mondavi family owns wineries in all parts of the world. All right, it's a good start. So how do these wines compare? Taste the Mondavi Napa taxi like their Italian wines. We never find out, because no one in the film commented on this. Instead, there is much insinuation about Nazis and fascism. Well, those things don't grow grapes. Hmmmm.
