I'll put it straight to you, this movie is boring boring. It's about a flood, that's it. Blah blah a bit about family, blah blah blah boring. <br /> <br /> Blame everything on the weather, poor sweet. Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is a hard ass who expects everyone to be brighter, an annoying character. <br /> <br /> If you are from the UK, or anywhere it may flow, you may like this movie. It's kind of like earthquake movies are most appreciated where earthquakes happen. <br /> <br /> It's not actually an action movie, where the weather is the enemy and you have to overcome it or literally overtake it. It's more like a time bomb that needs to be disabled. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, it's understandable why the UK thinks the world is overcrowded, it's not, but it's for them. <br /> <br /> Really, the movie is about as exciting as picking heads and I can't recommend it. It's more than 100 minutes, far too long. <br /> <br /> The problems with the movie; I will not come in because the film does not deserve such dissection. Tip for your Londoner's - buy more boats. Bringing kids to this movie will either fall asleep or become uncontrolled screaming devils.
