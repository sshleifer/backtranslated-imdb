Without a doubt, the biggest waste of the film of the year. This movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with unlikely characters. In addition, and perhaps the worst crime, it is uninteresting and highly predictable. Once Bill Pullman's character died in the picture, the word of "evidence" changed to "violence" and I figured out the whole plot. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to see this trash. The only redeeming feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and didn't waste any money. I would really be angry if I paid to see it in a theater. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this thing really needs to get out. A terrible, horrible movie in every possible way.
