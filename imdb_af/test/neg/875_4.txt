I had high expectations for this movie, although I didn't read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together - must be good. But the film does not deliver the promise. I waited for more depth on the characters and there was. I have no problem with the fact that it just fell in love with them for a weekend. This can happen. But we never know the characters. I would have liked more focus on them. The movie reminded me of the places of Bridges or Madison County, and that movie was much better. I really felt for the characters in that movie, and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that there wasn't between Gere and Lane. Each of them are very good actors in their own right. Usually not the right movie for them.
