First of all ... I have to say it's not very good. Miranda Cosgrove is the main character, but is not such a good actress honest. Spencer, her brother is a much better actor. Spencer is easily my favorite character, as he is probably the only one who knows how to act. Carly on the other hand is trying to work out her heart but ... sorry, it's just not good. Sam doesn't even get credit, I mean, come on ... ANNUAL ... pretty self-centered eh? Freddy is not bad, I have no comment. I must add that Carly and her puppet Sam change their attitude when they get a webcast, they are going to call out their lines. It's a bad influence in a way, because Carly has a web application and if kids copy it, they can give their own information and it's not pretty safe. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing is that it has some funny parts of the show that make it entertaining. At least this show is not boring, it has nice plots, quite strong. Many children will like this because they are not looking for mistakes. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a bad performance, but it's not boring.
