I hired this stack of sewage waste and hoped for some good laughs. With a title like 'Zombie Bikers from Detroit' and with Dead Alive productions printed on the cover, you'd think it might be a funny / horrific movie, but no. It's the worst movie I've ever seen (and yes, I've seen all the Police Academy movies.) The story (it's a joke in itself) and the dialogue is horrible. The composition of the so-called zombies looks like they used one of those two dollars. Make yourself like a Zombie kit you buy from K-Mart. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch Beverly Hills 90210. while listening to the Backstreet Boys and being beaten by a 400 lb birthday birthday card model than putting another minute of this pathetic excuse for a DVD. Honestly, I can make a better movie with $ 3, a few popsicle sticks and a slinky one. I feel as if 90 minutes of my life has been stripped of me and taken to the land of Suckdom. I know the labeling of the Dead Alive production does not guarantee a good movie, but you expect to earn your money. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me happy (except for the terrible mass of elephant feces) was that it was not "Biker Zombies of Pittsburgh". I feel for Detroit people who have wasted their hard-earned money on this one. Unless you are lobotomized. Don't buy, rent if you need to? But ??. You will regret it.
