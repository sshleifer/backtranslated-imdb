To rebuild 'lost horizon', it was necessary to have a musical composition of Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. That made my favorite thing about "Lost Horizon", his score. It's just that the score doesn't fit. Made from mostly non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, all are baptized, and still don't sound so good). <br /> <br /> Honestly, the novel, on which this, and previous non-musical movie versions were based, is mediocre, at its best. While the possibilities for a really good, cinematic musical version exist, they are not realized here. The film manages to be a good, rainy vehicle to pass the time. Otherwise you are better off, buy the CD from its soundtrack. Only recommended as a curiosity piece, due to the film's terrible reputation. I saw much better; but I saw a lot worse.
