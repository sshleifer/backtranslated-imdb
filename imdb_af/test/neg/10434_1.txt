I don't agree to call it a stoner movie just because the weeds also make a look. I can't imagine approaching even stoner classic. It would be like a "grunge movie." The movie definitely goes with a dark plot. Sometimes I wondered if the script was either released and shuffled or they'd completely lost it and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me to watch children play and set up the story as they go. <br /> <br /> The characters are wood, the dialogue is burdened, and the whole story seems to be completely loose. Who was killed? When? What? And this is how you act when your friend overreacts? Full lack of emotion and absolute disconnection of reality. <br /> <br /> As for the drone guitar soundtrack that accompanies every scene: enough! It was like looking at the opening screen where the same track runs endlessly in the background, not forward or backward. <br /> <br /> I kept looking and hoping that the plot would somehow fall to order, the acting and dialogue would improve or something, somehow this mess would focus on a coherent film. After 112 minutes it never happened.
