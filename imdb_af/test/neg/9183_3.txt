This movie is stupid and very short to be a funny movie. Unhappy 'oriental' is not satisfied with the west; so they hire a drunk wagon master (John Candy) to lead them back east. Sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one. And Richard Lewis gets your nerves very fast; but then I do not like him anything he does. Ed Lauter is hilarious like the bumbling villain. <br /> <br /> The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died 10 days before a massive heart attack before the movie was completed. A stand and digital improvement saw Candy's character in the final scene. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us some good knee beats, stomach laughing in his career. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie you will recognize: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
