You know this movie is in serious trouble when the BEST acting work is Arnold Schwarzenegger's supporting role. While still relatively early in his career and not the best actor, compared to Brigitte Nielsen, he is Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film proves that the only reason she received a lot of attention was her boobs and because she was involved with the incredible self-destructive soccer player, Mark Gastineau. So, instead of being her "outbreak movie", this and a Beverly Hills Cop movie is as high as she did in her one-note career. It was also obvious that the finance wizards also gave up on this movie, because the supporting role (except Arnold) is pretty lame and the writing is boring, boring and boring. Fans looking for another CONAN movie will undoubtedly be very disappointed in this slow and unmanned movie.
