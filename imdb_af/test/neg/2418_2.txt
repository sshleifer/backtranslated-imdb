Where to start? This movie is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby, but if you live outside of the US and follow the game, it's laughable. Several rugby traditions such as the "Haka", presented by New Zealand "All Blacks" and only by the All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori family tree. It is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and is abused and represented by the author. The movie itself is fairly well aimed, but it is the poor writing and remaining performance that makes it heavy. Taking into account the fact that it is based on a true story, it has many cliches in the storyline. I would strongly suggest that any American who is interested in rugby, see this movie and see which rugby is actually on Youtube, because the rugby depicted in this movie is distorted and skewed as far as it really is.
