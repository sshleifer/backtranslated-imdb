I have always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to infamous bad and unpopular movies. I've always been so badly cut, you look at someone who actually had recent cheese filling children like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). <br /> <br /> So I watched it, and it seems that all the critics have right over this one. It's a big flop, but unlike many flops, it's not even fun at any level, not just fun. This is just one boring cringe festival to the other all the way through. <br /> <br /> I was warned. I didn't listen. I'm a fool. <br /> <br /> Don't be foolish, don't waste time and money on this heap.
