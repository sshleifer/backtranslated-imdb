What a sucky movie. This is without a doubt a low-class B movie. The German elite StormTroopers attack Russian bunkers and much like an old WW1 battle. The acting is mediocre, the plot is thin and threadlike. It's sometimes difficult to follow where it's going. The action sequences are fairly worthless (if any), except for the fact that they use authentic WW2 equipment / vehicles. It is by no means the same level as "Save Pvt. Ryan" or "Platoon". Very worthless attempts at character development, which does not lead anywhere. Old theme good officer / bad officer highly predictable. Even the action ranges look like a 12-year-old kid they've set up. I could have done better. It's a pity, it's the same man who did "Boat (The Boat)" because it was a good movie. He had to participate so much successfully because he probably lost his contact when it came to this movie. I bought it on DVD, better to rent it earlier.
