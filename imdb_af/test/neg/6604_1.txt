not many people outside of Poland had the opportunity to become acquainted with andrzej sapkowski's brilliant writings. He is very popular in Poland for his fantasy short stories (I believe none of them ever translated in English!). To make a long story short, wiedzmin - the main character of sapkowski's books - is a travel monster star, a man of extraordinary strength and skill: he's pretty much your favorite tolkien-style cool man. Unfortunately, no one will find out after watching the movie. 'Wiedzmin' the movie is nothing but a collection of random scenes, with wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowski's writings, but not remotely like the plot and dramatic fit of the original. the fact that some of the shots in the film dress attractive women do not add any quality to it. the movie gets worse and worse with every minute, and doesn't even meet the requirements of 'so bad it's really good'. If you are really into fantasy work and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books earlier.
