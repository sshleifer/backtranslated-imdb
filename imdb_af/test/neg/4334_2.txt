The evil bikie gang in this movie is called the Savages, hence the title, but Minor Nuisances would have been a better name for this sorry crowd of bad actors who look dangerous. When they wanted to kill someone, they drove their bike very slowly, so their intended victim could easily avoid them or push them off their bikes. Their leader had a bad limp, but still thought he could take the hero and win. As for Karen Black, she didn't know where she was for most of the movie.
