Eight teenage damages are brought to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it up as community service. They soon discover that it is the residence of a Hulking psychopath (Kane) who has a thing to pull out and collect eyeballs. It doesn't help the guard who watched them (Steven Vidler) four years earlier had a previous entry to the animal. <br /> <br /> A guilty pleasure from me is slasher movies. Most of them are poorly directed and acted, but they still appeal to and entertain. See No Evil is a good example of this. It features horrible writing and acting, but the dead scenes are pretty good and the movie seems to be entertaining. The premise sounds like a mix between Friday the 13th, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea, but it didn't work out too well. It was just a bunch of clich√©s and everything was predictable. Writer author Dan Madigan just focused on the dead scenes and nothing else. The dead scenes themselves are pretty good and horrible. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he acted with a few creative victims. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty vague and imperceptible. That's because all the characters are one-dimensional and we don't know many of them. It was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikely. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I expected his screen to be more scarce, but he didn't do a job well. A second rate Jason Voorhees, if you like. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this movie will probably not help or hurt their careers. <br /> <br /> While the deaths are stingy, they are not terribly needed. There is really no tension, just a few stingy deaths. As a result, the film doesn't like much of a repetition value. Also, if you don't like treasure movies, don't waste your time with this one. It will do little to change your opinion. In the end, Sea No Evil is a decent slasher movie, but it's generic and forgetful, so it's not exactly worth watching. Rating 6/10
