The people of ABC forgot to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were simply wrong! The actor playing JPII was very strict, there was no personality. It is very clear that this movie was at the bottom of the programming totem poll, the move is so low budget. The writing is terrible. Conversations like: "You have to follow the rules." "No, the people are hungry." Lamb. In addition, the movie jumped like crazy from event to meeting to fit in the two hours. Terrible! A better use of your time would be to watch a PBS documentary on JPII. Also, CBS made up a miniseries on JPII, which is better than ABC by far. JPII was a wonderful man, and it makes me hard to imagine that my grandchildren might get this ABC movie and think that's what he really was!
