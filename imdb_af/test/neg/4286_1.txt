Blaming this horrible movie lies with the director, Martin Campbell. After looking at some of his credits in later years, it had to be one of his first legal services. He had a more than decent throw to work with, but unfortunately he had no idea what he did. There were screens that had absolutely no meaning. Where was his head ............... was he on drugs? I was looking forward to this movie just because of Oldman & Bacon. Maybe it was a short shooting schedule and Campbell just had to "eliminate" it. I can't imagine that the story that Campbell even directed came near the story the author wrote. Oldman & Spek, along with the rest of the casting, had to slide under their chairs when they went to the show. As one poster pointed out, Karen Young did a pretty good fight with Bacon. She really "let go". It is a pity that I have to fill more space just to stay within the guidelines of what the IMDb requires, because I really have nothing more to say about this uninspiring movie. One does not have to be forced to be a windbag when a terrible movie is criticized and wish the IMDb will change the amount of words to fill a criticism.
