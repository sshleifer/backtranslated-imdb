This movie was over, it was a pimple on the a * s of the film industry. I know every movie isn't a hit or even average, but the responsible parties gathering for this epic dud had to see that they had a ticking time bomb on their hands. I can't help but think that the casting will come together and console each other to be in such a massive hope. I can hear it now, "are you paying?" "No, you?" I understand that this movie is more than likely made on a shoe string budget, but even with that in mind, it could have been even better. You are waiting for the appearance of a monster / creature and when you finally see it, it is a great gift. I'm so fond of myself spending 1.07 on this stinker !!!
