I followed it along with the rest of the Marx Brothers kitten, and I was very disappointed for a night at the Opera. This stinker is certainly the worst I have seen of them so far, with the clever lines left out and the characterization being angry. The playwright is so exaggerated in this play, it's hard not to tackle the television and try to strangle him. <br /> <br /> As it is, the Marx looks better than outsiders have brought to destruction and is much better than having a good gag or two. The material here is, of course, written to anyone, and it really touches Marx's talent. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
