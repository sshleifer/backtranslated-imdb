The film adaptation of Heart of Darkness is disappointing, both as a movie and as a representation of Joseph Conrad's classic story. <br /> <br /> There are several minor differences between the book and the movie, but it is expected in any book after movie transition. Kurtz dies at another place; the driver does not accompany Marlow on his journey; Kurtz's mistress spends much more time with him than in the story. The real problem is the amount of footage placed in the movie, but has no basis in the real story. For some reason, the director finds the need to focus some of the scenes, add drama or action that rarely makes sense and is always unimportant to the story. A few examples to keep in mind are Kurtz's "mistress" who knocks Marlow over the head and knocks him out. Nothing happens while he is unconscious and Marlow did not even challenge the attack. A few hours pass by and he wakes up: total waste of time. Kurtz has a pet monkey who kills for a few random reasons. Also, if Marlow leaves Kurtz's station, he makes the "noble" decision to leave behind all the precious ivory he has achieved, for there is no real reason. Another mistake is Kurtz's character. John Malkovich is a terrible choice to describe the man described as long and inspiring: a man with a commanding presence. He whispered practically all his lines, which could be thought of in a more skilled actor's hands. I can't remove the image of John Malkovich to play a mentally handicapped farmer's hand in Van Muise and Mans, as I look at how he influences Kurtz's role. Over all, I would rate the movie at 3 out of 10 stars. It's a great movie if you have read the book and want to see it in film form, perhaps to help you visually help the scenes, but as a source of entertainment, I will never recommend it.
