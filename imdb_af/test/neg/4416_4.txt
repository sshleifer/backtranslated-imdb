After searching for this Briploid for months, and when it accidentally bought cheap, it was disappointing. I heard about it on a DVD-R website, and it went crazy crazy. <br /> <br /> But no, what I got was a very bad martial arts movie. The kung fu wasn't bad, but the rest of the movie was pretty awful, and the movie looked really long, much longer, then it was 85 minutes long. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the monkey was funny for a few seconds (especially if I think they have the only neighbor of his face from another movie) and the black man halfway through , was funny because of the one rule he said, which unilaterally made all black people look like complete simpletons. <br /> <br /> But that wasn't enough, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> 4/10
