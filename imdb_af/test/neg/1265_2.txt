I happened upon a scarce copy of this early-anticipated Almodovar movie. Almodovar is an outstanding contemporary director, I enjoyed his 1988 film "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and I have one or two very positive reviews of the movie. Well, I had completely missed the humor the judges have seen in this movie. I just found it incoherent, tasteless and boring. Yes, there are many inducers, people in the mourning and rough sexual situations, and yes, these elements shocked audiences in 1982 (it was almost certainly Almodovar's intention), but many of the shocks are likely to have occurred over the years. wiped out, leaving a slack storyline. In addition, the whole movie was very chaotic, none of the characters was particularly sympathetic, and for a "comedy" - even a dark one - I didn't find this movie funny. I think it's possible there is a very select audience for a movie like this, but I'm just not part of the audience, and not sure I want to be.
