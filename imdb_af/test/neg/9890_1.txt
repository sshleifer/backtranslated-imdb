This movie is supposed to be in Milford NJ. I know the house on which it is based as well as the person. As you see at the end of themovie, she died in the world trade incident. I know this because I was one of the police officers who helped identify her remains. (She was the only one lost in our environment). The nudity in the movie went a bit far. I'm not a prude, but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two women without showing the whole thing. This movie is in bad taste and I can't see her family blessing it. This is an insult to the person on whom it is based.
