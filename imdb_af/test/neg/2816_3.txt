While watching this movie, I never thought I'd defend it. It is fair enough from the beginning not to have much of a plot. There are no real characters to capture except the killer. Some of the plays may be better, but most of them are capable. <br /> <br /> I know, three out of ten aren't sterile, but there are reviews that say it's poor and completely useless, etc. . I think it explained to do what it is supposed to be pretty good. The lighting is sometimes less, more natural than most audiences are used to, but it's supposed to look like a snuff movie from the camcorder. In fact, the quality is probably still too high to be true, but no-one will do so in a minute of camera work that is so bad. <br /> <br /> It's not very scary, but it is sometimes save. There are one or two characters that do not become so credible and the soundtrack sometimes becomes difficult, but overall it is cleaner than many camcorder movies.
