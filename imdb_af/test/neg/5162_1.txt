It's great to hear the 3 or so remarks, which indicate what women's soccer players are saying. The title alone, discards any alleged equality women in the media industry or society, and reduces them to two-dimensional caricature characters of how men think women should act. It is a postmodern moronic farce. It can be called, "Footballers Wifey who lives at home and knows her place". <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it can actually be a kind of parody on the UK, celebrities, and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society. Such women can undermine stereotypes by acting like such stereotypes and possessing the image created by people's desire for them. No, it would be ironic and clever. I also sound like I should praise it. <br /> <br /> Zoe Lucker is easy to camp and on top to take seriously. Just like an even cheaper Cruella De Ville. She only needs a few manic, derogatory, but at the same time self-judging laugh to portray her true play. Oh, does she? Right. Anyway, it's just about some who are aimed at it. Or 'smart smart' journo's, who think it's an exciting release of vaudevic relationships, or people who think it's 'really'. "Finest actors"? OMG !! Stop following this aftermath of a pantomime and get a life. <br /> <br /> It's quite sexist and of such a low quality that maybe those who like it are "in" on the "joke". Are the actors really caring or understanding what they communicate? It is so humiliating for women and men. They are not all self-centered, selfish, soccer-loving materialistic jokes, who think women are nothing more than another trophy to be exhibited to the public. It is so humiliating. I'm sure Mrs. Lucker can easily get up in her "real" life and turn them around her finger as it is so easily done in "Footballers Wives". <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean really matter. I just mean this is a T.V. program. So please leave that aside. It is terrible and will only be looked back in the same unbelief that 'Prisoner Cell H' is so remembered. <br /> <br /> What happened? It is certainly not subtle or complex. It may just come from the same thoughts that FHM magazine reads and thinks it is good to watch softcore, and "do" so many women who "want to" bow and patriotic and racist remarks when they "soccer team losses / victories" It's totally crass.
