I was on a bad series of movies. It is a vowel over an arson pot and a psychopath. Tom Skerrit, who I really enjoy, was very young here. He is a builder with a passion, but he has a partner whose profit motive includes convincing and burning. In the mix comes an agent, who drowned, his daughter, and her fall guy. James Mason plays the insurance investigator. Any idiot, who gave a little warning, would know that something in the country of Australia was rotten. Yet they are bumping their way. The most interesting thing for me was that the big hotel to be built could never be more than a few sticks. Low budget, I think. The plot could have been interesting. Maybe they should have hired a movie editor (the one?). Half the time you didn't know where the characters are, but I guarantee a five million dollar installment would probably have guarded the structure. It doesn't work. Although there is very neat fire.
