I actually belong to the demographic Zoey 101 who is specifically trying to target so I can see that as much as it relates to people of my age, the premise is just too ridiculous for an average person to relate. The show revolves around the richest boarding school that exists, and the beautiful, incredibly brown, attractive gang of one-sided characters living in it. As is the tradition among children's networks, the role-play is a variety of skinny white children, of course with the token black man. <br /> <br /> The story lines revolve around Zoey and her gang friends who stumble upon or create a kind of small dilemma, such as not attending gym class, resulting in Zoey developing a scheme to save the day for all her friends. There is generally a B-line to either a one-sided guest character, or placing supportive characters in totally unrealistic situations, such as having a wasp hive in a dormitory and no one noticing. These plots often play stereotypes, such as any character who draws good grades in math, should by default have no social skills. Most episodes have the ongoing and overused will. They are not dynamically won by Chase-Zoey. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the characters are all incredibly one-sided; There is Zoey, the perfect girl with a solution for literally everything, Chase, the still lovesick still, but rather engaging Best Friend, Michael, the token black man (Kudos to Christopher Massey for managing some funny one liners), Lola, the theater chick (which means she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of the observatory, despite the fact that she does nothing in real theater), Logan, the finger narcissus, Dustin, the Spazzy little brother and Quinn, the scientific neck. The few words I spend on each of these characters add up every character. <br /> <br /> Zoey 101 sometimes succeeds in entertainment, but the serious errors in the system of values ​​it promotes are a major departure. Zoey, who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and portrayed on the surface as flawless, still manages great shortcomings. For example, when Lola was first introduced, she believed it was a goth girl. Zoey tried to use it as an excuse to kick her out of their shared sleeping room because it was "freaky". <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, Jamie Lynn Spears has named this landing role, not because of talent. Although she has definitely improved as time goes by, it is clear that she is not a born actress, which significantly affects the quality of the show, as most plot lines revolve around her character. The supportive role is surprisingly good, especially in view of the material they need to work with. They provide quite a few good one-liners for comic relief, if the plot has not yet dared to darken. <br /> <br /> Overall, Zoey 101 is a lack of high school life and anyone beyond their limited years shouldn't expect much from it.
