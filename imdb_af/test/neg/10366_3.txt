This movie has some flaws, and most of the flaws are a lack of anything that happens. Perhaps the biggest movie to show the dirt in Fly-Over Country is "Rolling Kansas," a movie in which nothing happens and you don't care about it. Like life it begins, it moves, and then it ends. Some attempts at humor are made, but everything falls flat. Occasionally, the viewer just reminded them that they could waste their lives, except to buy this movie and the one rock song they bought and used in each case. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch good movie. It's free and repeatedly frequent on Comedy Central because no one is going to see it, no one wants to see it, and it's slightly better than the dead air. Not to be damned with dull praise, but the movie's one rock song is worth listening to. Sorry, the movie is not worth watching.
