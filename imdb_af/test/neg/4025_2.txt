I rented this DVD because I am a great science fiction fan, but this thing (I won't call it a movie because it was apparently shot very quickly on video) or made it up. I'm not sure what it's all about. There are these guys dressed in some strange S&M outfits, and I think they are from another planet. Anyway, it doesn't make much sense in this low, low, low, budget film. If it were their first movie, I would have slipped them a bit, but I think it's like their 5th movie and it's really VERY bad. Very bad acting, not one good actor is this movie. This director had to be out of his mind to even do a horrible movie like this. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD, people do. It's not even worth the .99 cents I paid to rent the DVD. In fact, I'm going to tell them the DVD is messed up to get my money back. I don't believe I give a bad review, but I have to go here. My advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship - please find another call to enter. How can you make such a rotten movie? I'll give these negative stars as possible, it's so terrible.
