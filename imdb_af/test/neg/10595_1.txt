I watched the movie for the first time the other day and was bored with tears. I think I was just looking for a glimpse of the wonderful series I remembered. I watched The Mod Squad television program religiously in the day and it was fantastic. It was action packed and the relationship the 3 with Greer had was encouraging. There was nothing in it. When Greer was murdered, you get the idea that this 3 could care less. The actor who portrayed Pete is a very good actor, but they wrote his part as he was spiritually challenged. Pete in the television series was quiet and serious, but also had a funny side. They acted this man as if he were on drugs at the time, drunk or just ignorant. I would not recommend this movie at all. Especially if you were a fan of the TV series. This will be a complete lapse.
