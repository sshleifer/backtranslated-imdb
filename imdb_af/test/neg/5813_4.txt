I worship Hedy Lamarr. I think she was very active in the 40's as an actress. She was Nastassiah Kinski of that era, and critics didn't take her seriously. All that said ... this movie is a BORE. When I first looked at it, I was shocked at the lack of continuity, not only in story but in makeup and costumes. Hedy's makeup changes from shot to shot. So have hair length and style. Reason: This thing has had so many writers and has suffered so many times and it is wonderful that they have ever released it. Her "Lady of the Tropics" started filming AFTER this one started, but it was released before "I take this woman." In fact, then, it was known in Hollywood as "I take this woman again." It should tell you something. I'm also a Spencer Tracy fan, but he's here AWFUL. In several film history I read that he absolutely despised Hedy Lamarr, and it looks perfect on film. NO chemistry whatsoever. The story blows around for reel to rule and just ends to a very strange end. I can't recommend it at all.
