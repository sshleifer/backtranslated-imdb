This movie is highly unlikely. Read the other reviews to see why. <br /> <br /> I'd say most characters were plastic, but they didn't even afford those little ones; they work just like cardboard cuttings. Of course, they had to get real surfers for the following game roles, so it's a crap shoot or they can act. At least Occy didn't give a shit and just went with it. But "Lance" ??? Fuhgeddaboutit. <br /> <br /> The one character who walked was portrayed by Gerry Lopez, who didn't really act, he was very much himself. He is fairly used to bumping people. :-) The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because I had a newsletter on my laptop when it was some cable channel. This saved me from having to pay full attention to this foolish pastor. No way I would go to see it.
