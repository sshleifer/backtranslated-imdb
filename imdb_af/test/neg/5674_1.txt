This performance is based on the concept of hard + unpleasant + repetition = funny. The comic writing does not exist, in fact I see serious repercussions by even comparing it with entertainment of any kind. Here is the point of departure. Two girls accidentally get their phone on the Internet, and their hair follows their initial success. They fight the idea that they should make a webcast to show their brilliance. <br /> <br /> OK, so where should I start? Let's start with the laugh track, the often used but never successful reminder that we should laugh at the audience. According to the foley guys, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. We must all drop loads in our pants because of the brilliance of the humor placed before us. The lag track goes serious after every few seconds. It's probably Scooby-doo who bridges the king of laughter. <br /> <br /> Then, the in-your-face-screaming-on-the-top-of-our-lonely-craziest group-of-words-to-like-crazy trick is also employed to little to no success. Whoa and let's not forget to create new words to sound funny tricks. This is web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What the hell ... <br /> <br /> Finally, the acting. I can't complain completely here. The actors are young and inexperienced, but need to be corrected by good professional help. Because of the inexperience, the actors must help the actors define their craft. Instead, the actors are usually placed in front of the camera and said for an act. Generally, the robotic outline of lines, missed timing and overall epic failure. <br /> <br /> The lack of anything in this show makes it a disgusting idea of ​​how not to be funny. Don't waste your time. This show is lacking for all mankind
