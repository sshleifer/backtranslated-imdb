it's just me or all the "horror" movies become nothing more than tits, slapstick and a top culprit who can't be killed. this movie had no point. Whatever happened to the days that a person can escape from the killer, as in residence. and make the killer a little more realistic. Victor Crowley was the worst killer I've ever seen. he reminds me of a devil who grows between quasimodo and leir. It was on top of that, while the victor had set fire to it, no one thought to finish the job. and the end was the greatest disappointment of all those reminiscent of the soprano's final. I had to come with the fella behind me when he blew ... WHAT THE F ***! if I could give the movie a negative score, I would have looked after it.
