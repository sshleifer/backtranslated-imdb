I'm not picky with movies, oh I saw so much crazy how I could see something. Perhaps that was why I looked at this one to the end. I'm also a big fan of RPG games, but this movie, it's a shame for any self-respecting RPGer out there. The security camera recording of a game game will make it feel more realistic than this movie does. The lines, the cuts, the sound, everything is wrong. In some scenes you can see that it is filmed in a photo when !!!!! (forward spoilers) !!!!! People running around do not disturb people sitting near computers. I mean, will you continue your job if you have ninjas around you? oh and the jokes about pirates, it's the worst one yet in movies !!!!! (spoilers end) !!!!! At least the first one felt like a documentary, now it looks like someone's video experiment. You can get better movies at youtube. Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, it's as bad as it gets.
