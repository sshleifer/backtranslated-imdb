I also made the mistake of thinking I was going to see the 2003 swim with Geoffry Rush. It was worse than many student films I saw. The writing was forced, the acting was subpar and the editing was annoying. It was so slow that I just managed to stay. But I always give a movie a chance, so I suffered to the end. Apparently there was a memo about this movie because my friend and I were the only ones in the theater. Why didn't someone send me this memo?!?! That's why I post, as a warning to others, to think of good money to see it. I just hope you actually got this page and didn't get stuck as I did by looking at the wrong "swim upstream". P.S. Sorry for the cast and crew when you read it. I know you worked hard to do this. I know what's going on in making a movie ... try it!
