This one is a poor attempt to turn the old 'closer to good gauze', which we saw so many times before. This actually reminded me of the American series 'The Players', but nowhere near as well. Omar Epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the cluster, as Ribisi, whose attempt to become the funny man, is lost along the way. Danes' performance was fair, and you can see from this show why she was thrown into Terminator 4. <br /> <br /> The MOD Group is a film that lies in a kind of gray area between serious thriller and comedy. Sometimes it takes itself seriously, but at other times it tries to be humorous, but fails. The movie had a kind of half-finished feel, as if it was stretched to the 90-minute point. <br /> <br /> You'll be disappointed.
