This is the first porn I ever tried to review. This requires a different approach than usual, as the allegory will not reward dissection. "I'm American. I'm a prudish virgin." "We are European. We are cultured and sex-crazy." "It's nice if we screw one another." Lots to talk about! Well, there is indeed kind of relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. And the digesting patina of 'class' produces at least clean, detailed compositions. But what is the thing to say about a porn? OK then: The only scene I really got (rhetoric) was the first time Brigitte Maier entered. There are attempts to throw in a good variety of race and age, while no two men are close to each other; the one black man suffers from a premature reason for editorial coitus interruptus. And multiple or not, perhaps an indescribable-on-IMDb law seems to have been partially simulated by a surgical snake. Yet I stay awake, and that was eight in the morning ... but what does the last shot mean?
