yeesh, talk about craptastic.this thing is brutal. terrible voice dubbing, even more horrible acting and no observable plot. There are some big chase scenes, but the problem is, you have to go to that point first, and I just couldn't do it. I think I could send it quickly, and I recommend doing the same, unless you have a very painful tolerance or a masochist. does not fall into any category. I still have a migraine of this thing, so I'm about to do a dental surgery without anesthesia, just repair the migraine.bottom line, horrible. 0/10
