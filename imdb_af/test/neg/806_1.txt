who is responsible for these things behind the scenes? who are these actors? did they crawl out under rocks? "You, very yoke!" no. no yuks for me. Only disgust and shame that I am a human being. I have to turn my eyes off the set, it's so embarrassing. In fact, I changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I've always had a problem with Robin Williams' 'non-stop' I forgot my lithium's rantings today, but at least he's funny once in a blue moon. Looking at someone who is not funny at all is like slowly and sadistically pulling every tooth in your head, without novokain, forever. <br /> <br /> Please stop making these absolutely horrible TV movies. please.
