My girlfriend and I are really into cheese-free horror flicks. Especially children with very unnecessary nudity. When we watched the box for this movie at the fair, we thought it was a perfect movie for the night. We started looking at it, and didn't expect it to be BIG, but thought it would get our interest at least. 20 minutes in the movie we realized that the pace will eventually not pick up and that it was an incredibly boring movie. We tried to get it, but the plot made very little sense, even though we read the back of the DVD box over and over. The movie was shot very dark and it was pretty annoying to try to find out what was going on in every shot. Every violent scene was very hard to figure out, and you never actually see the violence you expect. It is definitely a film without motive that is weak and very out-dated. Each scene was about 20 minutes of the same thing and I felt I was getting the point to the first 5. Skip this movie and look at another Freddy or Jason flick and you'll be much more content.
