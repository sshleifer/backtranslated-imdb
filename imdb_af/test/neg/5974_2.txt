I'm sorry to say that, but it's actually one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Because of the name "Darwin's Nightmare" I expected a documentary on Nile tree problems in Lake Victoria. <br /> <br /> What I actually saw in this "documentary" is a loose accumulation of individual stories, most not related to fish or more. And for the most part, you can hardly call their stories - it's more like some accumulated scenes that have a meaningful connection ... <br /> <br /> Why this movie expires time: - Show us non- relevant information about the families of the Russian pilots (for example, a few minutes are wasted on their private photos of women and girls). - Raw death of an African kid bitten by a crocodile (as if it could not have happened without the Nile) - Show us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport. - Show us strange religious events for a few minutes. - Discuss the life and death of a whore at the airport. - Talk to children about their mothers, fathers - what they work for. and / or how did they die (well, guess what: some died of HIV - who would guess?) These are just a few examples, I can go on for several pages ... <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely unfocused and does not know what it means. If you've never heard of Africa and have no idea that this continent has Social / Health / HIV / Violence / War problems, then this movie might be right for you. If you haven't closed your eyes for the past ten years, 90% of what this movie shows will not be new - and the way it is presented here will do its best to make you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my expectations of this movie were too high, but I really didn't like it, though it's a topic I find generally interesting. If this film wants to show how poverty is related to the Nile, than it might have had to spend to discuss that matter ...
