Perhaps it is spoiled, so do not read if you do not want you to just watch the TV news, everything has already happened, a big tsunami hangs over a city bay and SNY, to see no more, Tokay a big earthquake, has anyone seen more than the 5 seconds I saw? If you want to make a love story, make a love story, but if you want to use a ramp title, please watch the COMPANY, pd to the movie, watch JISHIN RETTO or any GODZILLA movie to share what was willing to see screaming and collapsing buildings that didn't have a chance in this movie. Don't get me wrong, I love disaster movies and I love the original Nihon Chimbotsu and Jishin RÃ¤tto. I even like the latest Poseidon, not too much of a story, but a very good and graphic disaster series. New Nihon Chimbotsu loses the point as many times as pearl harbor or tomorrow, but at least these two movies show good rhythm series, and enough with the expensive FX that didn't show anything, give me false buildings if you want as long as you destroy it properly I know I have to sound like a sadistic freak, but I actually look, if I wanted to see a romantic movie, grrrrrr even kimpachi sensei cries me and has this movie. There is also a TV series called Nimbing Chimbotsu which was made in 1975, I have DVD and it is much better
