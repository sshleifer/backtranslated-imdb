First of all, I want to make it clear that I voluntarily submit myself to the viewing of terrible movies. I saw what I thought was the worst of the worst. In my mind, movies can't get worse than those of D.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood, and Terror Storm. Until I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Without any exaggeration, the Pirate Movie is the WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD. I was informed before I watched that the movie was indeed terrible, but I didn't believe the allegations. Believe me if I tell you that this movie is just an abomination to film. <br /> <br /> It starts with a 3 minute clip of a pirate boat, apparently in the middle of a battle with themselves. "The end" splashes over the screen. Unfortunately, this is not the real end of the movie. The film is about an unpopular, uncomfortable girl named Mabel, carrying a ghetto blaster. It is attracted to ambiguous homosexual pirates. She drowns and has an excessive hallucination in which she dies like a slenderly dressed shank that falls in love with Frederic, who just crawled out of the ocean. He may actually be homosexual. The Pirate King has a ruby-and-diamond irrigated headboard. It sharpen and squeak when it is pressed. <br /> <br /> There is singing in this movie. You may have the impression that this is a hilarious musical. It's not. Trust me. They are the worst songs you've ever heard, and by the end of the first original tune you'll find objects that pierce your thrombus. <br /> <br /> There are references to other movies in here. With references, of course, I mean "obvious rip-offs." The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau and the Lightaber was actually anti-hilarious. <br /> <br /> In his better moments, the dialogue is painful to hear. The direction is flat out terribly, and at one point you can see the stamp block in the scene, which is not well hidden. <br /> <br /> Finally, if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie, get rid of it. There are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this movie is not worth it. Put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again. If you cherish your mental capacity, I beg you, never watch this movie.
