My friends and I often talked about the fact that movies are real-time. But this movie is really ... They'll literally have nothing but a man digging his hands in the ground for 4 minutes. It has no plot, and an incredible amount of gratuitous screaming. I honestly do not believe it won a claim for the alleged tension. If you're like me and have seen the first movie and loved it because it's terribly acting, accidentally hilarious one liners, and everything about a low budget "ness" doesn't matter; it's so bad it's bad memories can even wipe out and pollute any good memories you have from the original. You will be more entertained if you are staring at an empty screen.
