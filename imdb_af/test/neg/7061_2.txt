In a happy household comes the gypsy girl, played by Myrna Loy. With her incredibly wild hair and voice that sounds very loud and strange, it's hard to believe it's Loy !! She didn't look like the refined and funny character Nora Charles she played in the Thin Man movies. Instead, she convinced so much that you almost expected her to be in an Ed Wood movie. What a big difference a few years in quality movies made, she had as well as her acting ability! In addition to the terribly silly character, the film also fails because it is just not interesting or exciting - just a lot, a lot of dumb and stupid. The only good thing is the Vitafoon sound system. This makes the sound quality of this turkey the best I heard from 1929. Heck, it was even better than most 1930 movies, so the sound technician has at least something to be. proud of - everyone else, forget it. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that even refers to the host of Turner Classic Movies as a "guilty pleasure" because the movie is so bad! And after I saw it, I didn't agree ... slightly. The movie is simply bad.
