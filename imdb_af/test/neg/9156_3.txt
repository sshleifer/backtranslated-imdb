It was the first Chan movie made by Monogram. What comes down to Fox values ​​and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first Monogram after watching the big Fox movies. It's boring and uninspired with wild music playing as Chan runs calmly across the street. Chan is now working for the US Secret Service rather than the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who for the first time No. 3 Son Tommy plays. He also has a daughter, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown. He is a taxi driver in Washington, DC, here, rather than the later driver to Chan in later movies.
