I bought this DVD for my young boy who loves the ToyStory movies. I never expected it to be in the same league as the Toystory movies, but what I got was just a lazy Disney cartoon that was much less than I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is original, the characters are boring and two-dimensional, the animation is under par, even Buzz is not so good. The movie could have been so much better. I especially hated the paint by number story. I know it's meant for kids, but even kids know when something stinks of this level lameess. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed some aspects of the movie, I really enjoyed the opening of the movie, with the turn of the mutant monster, just subtracting it from there.
