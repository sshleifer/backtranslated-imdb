The most worthless movie of the decade. The responsible parties should never be allowed to film again. I have no words to describe the lack of entertainment that this movie offers. You can't pay me to watch this movie again. Frankly, I think I would be a better person if I didn't see it. If I mentioned it offensive, I would fall into a category of emotionally weak extremists. I would say this film goes as far as damaging the industry. There are movies that I refuse to watch, since I feel they can be this tasteless. I feel like an idiot I didn't have the good sense to walk out of any of the many moments I was forced to do. Yes, I saw the end and was ashamed of it, like anyone else, including the author. I'm in awe ...
