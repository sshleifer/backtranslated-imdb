They have taken a story to the people of Edinburgh's heart, a true story and change it like Hollywood has done before to make a great story. The end result is a movie, but well done for those who do not know the story completely different and inaccurate. The original movie of this story that Walt Disney surrendered himself used the right breed dog who was critical to this story and did not make John Gray something special, he was a poor Shepard who died in poverty at the inn. If you like the story, look at the Disney original for a better heart warming story. It's a Shame the cast and the potential was there for a terrific reminder of a classic story. Read the book for an accurate look of the story. And if you really like it, you can visit the real Kirkyard in Edinburgh.
