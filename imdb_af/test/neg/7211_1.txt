"Direct-to-video" is a phrase never promised to the consumer unless it is a direct-to-video sequel that goes directly to video in the first place. Despite this, studios have insisted that over the years, many direct-to-video successors have released cult hits. I don't think it should even be mentioned, as it continues under some of the worst titles of all time, including THE HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It is fitting that ROAD HOUSE 2 is covered by Scott Ziehl. because he was also the man in charge of the Cruel Intentions series. Like his entry into the Cruel Intentions trilogy, Ziehl takes elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE a good old flick and bring them back with no success. It's not a sequel, it's a remake all the way. Several lines of the original are repeated, plots are cut and pasted, and scenes are almost shot for the first time. The one thing that couldn't be duplicated was the wonderful battle scenes, which PADHUIS made what it was. Here we get awkward battle ranges that are too short or too long and are expected to be planned and shot within an hour. Compare it to his predecessor's battle scenes that seem to have taken months and months to prepare. Ziehl is able to act as he did well with the 2001 repetition of EARTH VS. THE SPIDER, but none of the talent shown there comes through in this mess. It's not quite his fault, as the script is very, very poorly written and many. I don't care if it goes directly to video, a good script is still needed. Someone should think about it while constantly working out this low-budget, direct-to-DVD movie. Skip it all over. 10/01
