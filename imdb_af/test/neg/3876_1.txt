I'm not sure this movie could ever fit the first one, even if it stole the original seven (despite the fact that four were killed). It just doesn't have the spark and chemistry. All the actors seem tired and seem like they are just going through the moves to get their salaries. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how Yul Brynner is "wonderful" in the original film, but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel. Still, when he died in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s, his character (in the same matching black pants, shirt and hat) called the same secret and presence of the 1960 film Chris Adams. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this 1966 flick to make it look even on the cable.
