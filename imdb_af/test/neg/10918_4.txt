CUJO is a film adaptation of a novel by the same name written by Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I've never read the novel, but just the scanning of the comment sheet gave me insight. I have seen a reference to the change in the end. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is as follows: A St Bernard dog is bitten by a rabid bat and goes on a deadly spree. <br /> <br /> The plot sounds rather worn, already done in several movies. But it might have been something new when King wrote the novel. Or maybe King's novel is about the story that's never been shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie, is nothing but calling the others if the dog is bitten. Nothing else happens - nothing scary, nothing funny, nothing to add the characters depth and nothing else interesting. I found this section difficult to go through and was constantly yelling at the TV, "come on, start!". The events I saw on the screen reminded of a TV movie from the drama genre or an extensive episode of a TV soap. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the film that gave any focus so it couldn't even work on a soap opera level. The dog was the best character in the movie, but it didn't have enough screen time in this section. There was nothing to indicate why this dog would later go to a deadly spree. <br /> <br /> After the 40 minute point, something finally happened. The dog suddenly changed from a lovely pet to an unholy murderer. It started to attack some people. There was also an interesting cat-and-mouse hunt when two characters were trapped in a car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. Even in this excessive second half, the tension will build up well before we die again. It was just a stop-and-repeat that was repeated over and over until the film came to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Without making the end, I can tell you it was very formative and unworthy of a Stephen King story. <br /> <br /> The tension scenes when on the screen are exciting to watch. Some large camera angles threaten the dog's evil nature when he attacks people. This is especially important because, as others have mentioned, a St Bernard dog is nowhere as scary as a Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the film fails to use exciting music to support the images on the screen. The music is much too melodramatic rather than exciting. It may suit a TV movie, but it looks incredibly eye-catching that a dark-colored movie has to be a live nightmare for the viewer. <br /> <br /> This brings me a wider problem with this movie - photography. The camera work and especially the choice of colors makes it look like a very inexpensive TV movie that one expects to see as the day movie on Channel 5 here in the UK where I write this comment. <br /> <br /> The top two actors are performing well-acting performances that help blow life into the movie's dull segments. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should get credit for a good job with the poor materials they are given. I could forgive a few brief moments of handing over to the dialogue, which I believe would not allow any other interpretation. I will not judge the other actors judging because they are given virtually nothing. <br /> <br /> If someone who is a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING is both movie adaptations of well-known Stephen King novels, I had high expectations for this movie. But it seems to be a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Overall, I don't recommend to fans of Stephen King or horror movies in general to watch CUJO. This is one of those moments where I should recommend the book rather than the movie. Hopefully it brings the story to life in a way that the movie failed.
