Significant Spoilers! <br /> <br /> It's a sick, disturbing movie ... just like the sick, distorted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this movie a score of 2. This is not the fault of the actors. The role players portrayed their roles well. This is the way this film was written and how the characters were written as the benchmark of a really sick mind. <br /> <br /> I know I have never ever seen another film written or ever seen under the direction of Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is a sick, twisted, dirty mouth, deviant thinking deviant. She looks, talks and sounds like a biker chick with her brain-fried brain running for 20 years. You can clearly see what kind of person she is by looking at the DVD's special features section of "Surveillance: The Watched is Watching." You can see and hear her for yourself. She was just as bad as I had suggested writing this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not shocked by a bad language, though this director definitely talks like a sailor. It goes far beyond a simple bad language; worse than any other movie. The level of implied sado violence and perversion she includes in every character she writes is of the genre that is even illegal by default. These perverse, disturbing thoughts are evident in her own personality and things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was looking for. It's a snap movie. <br /> <br /> Make sure you listen to the endorsed and alternative end after her story. This director / writer is really a sick person. I can't believe anyone will put her in control of a movie, much less pay for it. You can be sure I will never see another movie she's linked to. In the thousands of movies I've watched and collected, there are just a few directors and writers who deserved this kind of boycott. She is offensive to anyone I've ever seen regarding filming a movie. There were a few bad directors and writers, but no one could compare to her sick, twisted mind. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, which was just one killing ramp to another. As soon as it got past the hotel murder ... then the sick police fired on and brutalizing managers for kicks ... the holiday family with the bad parents (who had no business in the presence of children) ... followed by the drug addicts .... the movie then proceeded to the (even more) twisted, deviant serial killers. <br /> <br /> As I unveiled the serial killers, I began to wonder what kind of really sick thought it was. Movie. These were my real thoughts while watching this movie. I fully intend to find out which writer had such a sick mind ... because that writer must be seriously committed to long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it was the director. When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD, I realized my estimation of the author was right on the nose. On the DVD she was indeed the sick, twisted person I wanted to write such a disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> While the girl, Stephanie Ryan Simpkins, really stole the show ... I can "I don't believe her real parents would have endured this sick, dirty mouth, director to get anywhere near their daughter don't be. <br /> <br /> This movie is disturbing, sick, offensive, twisted and the director's writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility. <br /> <br /> As far as the end of the movie ... the alternative end, the result of this terrible trial had to be. There was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the movie by the death of the other character. I'm surprised that any studio really spread the movie. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the movie was heard was because of the clever word-for-word and creative portrayal on the trailer. The trailer is not representative of the movie you will see. <br /> <br /> Unlike the child ... every character in this movie was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverted, violent sex freak and their characters reflect the minds of the writer-director they created. But if you look carefully, even the holiday-family's parents; the sick police take shots; the serial killers suggest alternative roles; station police; and even the station dispatcher ... every single one of these character roles included a sexual, twisted, violent pervert. I'm not sure about some of the actors after watching the filming of the movie and the Canadian village in the Special Features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> This writer-director has such a personal spiritual disorder, no matter what she writes, each character role has the same envelope domes. The only character who did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Look carefully and you'll see it in every character. Then listen to the director's talk about the DVD Special Features section and you'll understand what I'm telling you about her spiritual condition and psychological issues. She won't be tolerated in too many decent homes if she's not a Hollywood movie family. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch doesn't have much of a filmography ... less than a handful of things. As she copies the disturbed features in all her character roles, I don't think we'll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her father, director David Lynch, helps her. I would recommend staying away from any movie she's involved with. And I'm not sure his dad's movies will be better. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
