Filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once showed a light, sardonic touch with deceptive material such as "Whistle Down the Wind" and the original "Stepford Wives", all in here. Not only is his direction, he also adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel. the results are horrible. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist who is estimated to be killing one of his patients; Rod Steiger, who chews the landscape, is a hot-under-the-collision police spokesman (it's easily his most embarrassing theory). The only actor here to exhibit a little life is Elliott Gould, who knows a thing or two about a bum script. Vaal, handsome, and produced on the cheap. NO stars from ****
