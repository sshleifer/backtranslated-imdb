After finishing his career as a romantic leading man in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson played in many different projects, including TV shows and less films. However, I believe "Embryo" is his only turn as a crazy scientist, and that's probably a good thing. I think he needs the job. <br /> <br /> The brilliant dr. Paul Holliston (Hudson) travels along a dark and stormy night and hits a Doberman, whom he brings back to his lab. thanks Midwestern basement). He then manages the dog's unborn puppy outside the womb, so of course he decides to do the same thing with a human. He raises Victoria (the beautiful Barbara Carrera) of a fetus in the same way. Victoria is growing at an astounding pace, and soon blooms in a beautiful young woman. <br /> <br /> Predictably, things are going very wrong. After a halcyon, Holliston's son-in-law Martha (Diane Ladd) begins to wonder where the young woman came from, and Victoria starts showing signs of instability and violence. The final order is one long car hunt straight from Smokey and the Bandit, after which Victoria? What's shocking in a few minutes? Attacked by an insane Holliston. He tries in vain to destroy his deformed creation. with his unborn child. All of these are accompanied by screaming tires, roaring engines, a car fire, and many sirens. The slack end? A lot of paramedics working at Victoria, while Holliston is in regret, is more difficult than creepy. <br /> <br /> Although made only in 1976, this movie is very dated. The only difference between this and the very bad scientific films of the 1940s is that Hudson plays the lead role rather than Boris Karloff. The sets are fairly inexpensive and very outdated to today's audiences to the extent that Hudson's reel-to-reel tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator. Much of the action takes place in a poorly lit laboratory. Hudson sleeps through his sordid role, giving the impression that he is really a thrilled movie star, while Ladd and Carrera are much more credible. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowall appears briefly as a chess player. <br /> <br /> The Passport Video Transfer is very substandard, and seems to be made of a poor VHS copy using home equipment. If you're nostalgic for 1976, just look once to say you've done it. Otherwise, look at a soccer game or soap opera.
