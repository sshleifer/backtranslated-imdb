before I watched this movie, the 1998 version was my only experience with this dickens story. I did not enjoy much of the movie, but this adaptation of 1974 is tackled in a particularly tiring way. <br /> <br /> The actors don't shine, the main couple Michael York and Sarah miles are mostly woodcuts. the only real interest to me was the anthony quayle's intelligent hunters. <br /> <br /> The so-called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is a wonderful one. It's a real lesson about how your distorted values ​​and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and don't care what other people are saying, you are what you are, if others can't take it, **** Pep was told early on, but he didn't listen. <br /> <br /> The girl who was adopted by the strange old woman reminded me of the old kaspar hauser story, not at the same terrible level, but in The way she formed the child to to make the executor of her personal vendetta against the opposite sex she thought had deceived her. Pep's childhood didn't show much better. the end does not seem to fit the rest of the story's style. The sets look cheap and I don't notice. I'm not surprised to see that it was indeed a TV movie (which I didn't know when I borrowed it from the library). <br /> <br /> Live and learn. so many good movies, so little time. therefore the reviews are here. so you won't have to waste your time on these movies. <br /> <br /> 3/10
