I mean, nothing happens, 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana ... it could have been fun if it wasn't for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the windows weren't even half an inch of fun. The only thing I almost showed my teeth was when the stupid cops stopped the teenagers in Oklahoma or Kansas. The plot could have been fun if it wasn't wrong. If you even think about watching this piece of crap, don't do it. How stupid it is that the man gets away from the police by telling them he is gay, as his friend did (just that he didn't pretend ...) and there is that stupid dumb joke about the different meanings of the word "gay". I laugh my hair ....... NOT ....... Anyway ... WORST MOVIE I've ever seen !!
