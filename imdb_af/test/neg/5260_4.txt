Drug runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug queen Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually a sheltered police officer. During the bust at Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. He survived the wound and later arrested Moses. Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit, with his comedies either loving his fans or hated by everyone. This one is not as stupid as its other movies, but still can't overcome a lazy manuscript. The direction is incredibly lazy, with fast action sequences making way for the slow comic exchange between Sandler & Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes ?? a plane with no engines flying, chasing a car at night through a forest? is quite absurdly confronted. The play is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans making a great combination. In short, the movie is stupid, but fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Degree: C + Overview by M. K. Geist
