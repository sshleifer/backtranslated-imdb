I took my family to see Barnyard last weekend. We looked that way, but my kids were not there, my husband and I would be gone. From a farming community, we found that all the male beef in the film that pulled out udders was a bit disturbing. We felt like we were watching crossed cows or something. It was just strange to hear that a male voice comes from a female body. After checking some of the production notes on another site, I felt the animators might have slipped into this fact. I know it's just an animated, humorous performance, but by placing female body parts on a man, I had to suspend my unbelief so much that I couldn't just enjoy the movie as I might have. I know udders can be found funny, but they are definitely used. None of the other animals in the movie pulled their body-specific body parts on them and I would have preferred the bulls in this show to have at least the right ones if they were not to be pulled up at all. However, the children still enjoyed the movie, but we took the time to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
