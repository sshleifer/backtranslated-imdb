Following World War II's attack on US forces at Pearl Harbor, "The Eastside Kids": Leo Gorcey (as Muggs), Bobby Jordan (like Danny Connors), Huntz Hall (as Glimpy), David Gorcey (as Peewee) , Ernest Morrison (as Scruno), and Bobby Stone (as Skinny) want to serve their country. But both the US army and fleet reject them as too young. The "boys" still want to turn a million japs ​​off, "an Asian clerk attack, which seems to be Chinese. The unfortunate incident, however, leads the gang to uncover some really nasty Japanese and German people. <br /> <br /> If "too young" is defined as "under twenty-one", only Mr. Jordan and Mr. Steen would be rejected for military service. But it is possible that recruiters are turned off by the office manners that Mr. Gorcey and Mr. Hall is displayed. "Let's get tough!" was made during the writing accurately describing "open season on japs" - for this and other reasons, it did not age well. This is a wasteful effort, but the regular work wise, with Tom Brown moving the storyline, like Jordan's spy boom. <br /> <br /> Let's get tough!
