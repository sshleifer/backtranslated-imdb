Problems: 1) Although a great tribute to poverty is, much of the old footage isn't even out of poverty driving movies. Many of them are from RKO's "The Dangerous Game" (1932), with some from the silent (!) Version of "The Lost World" (1926)! <br /> <br /> 2) Much of the old footage is only used as stuffing (the old board material) or as silent shots (for example, Bela walking, watching or staring) are often repeated; <br /> <br /> 3) Where is the Pantheon of Poverty Row Master Thespians (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney, Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.) lines for the "new" characters jokes (as in Woody Allen's "What's Up Tiger Lily?" or Steve Martin's "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid")? Even Mike Nelson's poor commentary on the colored "Reefer Madness" is funnier than that. <br /> <br /> Highlight: The long but highly enlightening lecture by Gregory Mank, giving you new respect and admiration for Bela, John Carradine and George Zucco. This is the price of the DVD alone!
