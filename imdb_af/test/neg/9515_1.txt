When I voted "1" for this movie, I noticed that 75 people voted the same out of 146 total votes. This means that half of the people who voted for this movie feel it is really awful. I didn't see it at a film festival long ago and I was really unaffected by his poor performance. The cinematography is incompatible, the sound is bad, the story is cut and pasted from many other movies, and the play is terrible. This movie is basically a poor rip-off of three other movies. NO WONDER IT IS NEVER PLACED IN THE USA.
