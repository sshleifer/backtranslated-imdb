Alexandra Ripley wrote a terrible successor to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece book in the 1930s. Margaret Mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and for big money Alexandra Ripley allowed to write a piece of junk book, even worse than Barbara Cortland's romance novels. I was a huge fan of Margaret Mitchell's book, and Alexandra Ripley's successor was written for cash only. <br /> <br /> Although I always admired the acting talent of Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, this is a really horrible movie. The writing is terrible and full of clich√©s. Ann Margarets came when Belle Watling was so terrible that I wanted to hit her. <br /> <br /> The only valuable thing in the movie is Sean Bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy, wild villain Lord Fenton. Sean Bean's show is in line with "The Man You Love to Hate" and depicts an insecure sex symbol. <br /> <br /> But Sean Bean is only in the first half of the movie, so you should be tormented. with an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an indifferent boring script. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie unless you're a tough Sean Bean fan and just look for his amazing performance.
