Two Stars <br /> <br /> Amanda Plummer looks like a young version of her dad, Christopher Plummer in drag, stars in this movie with Robert Forster - who really had to put a little shoe on top of the bald location. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Amanda Plummer in a good movie. She always plays these slightly meager characters in movies that don't quite add up, and she does it again in this one. <br /> <br /> First, we have two young women, who don't look like Amanda's character, Sandra, at least have a good reason to dr. Allow Jake (Robert Forster). to pick her up in the first place. She walked off the road, apparently through a maniac, and her car was pretty destroyed. <br /> <br /> Warning - Spoilers for! <br /> <br /> But if we go further, we realize dr. Jake no longer plays with Amanda as Amanda. He makes every decision based on a coin. <br /> <br /> When dr. Jake and Amanda arriving at a motel, who we see the maniac's car, and what Amanda does inside his station wagon and starts walking around. What her motive was to do is never clear, as the man is dangerous and can try to kill her. One would think the last thing she would do was put herself in such a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> Not only does she snoop around, but she finds money and takes it. <br /> <br /> Shortly afterwards, we have several other things that don't add up. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake, with Amanda as his passenger, is out of gas, and the two of them leave his car and start walking. One would think of stabbing a desert, he would have checked his gas meter - it seems very unlikely he can do it. Then he later saw the same car. When or how did he get the car back? <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake told Amanda he knew she had taken the money. Now how would he know it? He did not see that she did this as far as I know, and she did not tell him she did it. <br /> <br /> Then we later have a character called Santini (David Thewlis), the man who was driving the station wagon gives the two of them a lift and I will be darned if he doesn't know that Amanda also took the money. How would he know it? <br /> <br /> When Alice, Amanda's sister (Fairuza Balk) gets into the murderers of the killer and throws her fate over the coin - one will think she'll be very careful that the coin she exchange for a trick coin, definitely the trick coin - but apparently it's not. <br /> <br /> It crushes things like That, which destroys any credibility this movie might have.
