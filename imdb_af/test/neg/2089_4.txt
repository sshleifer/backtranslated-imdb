I picked this DVD for 3.99 at the rogers video to get enough points to get a better movie for free. I never really planned to watch it, but it started to attack my curiosity and I finally decided to pop the DVD player into it. The effect in this movie is terrible and cheap. Some of the dialogue in this movie looks like it was written by a curse of happy 12-year-old boy. The acting is in some parts very cheesy, and the "action" scenes are completely laughable. You will erupt, and this is a positive thing for me because it made me slightly entertained. The plot is a girl has a curse on her that causes his snakes to build up, so some shaman must get her to Los Angeles. There are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people who are unimportant to the plot. that there really is a plot. Don't expect anything from this movie and don't listen to the cover page. There are no 100 passengers and 3000 vipers. There are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes. <br /> <br /> As far as the DVD is concerned, there is a trailer that is almost as ridiculous as the movie, a blooper that is just one shot over and over from one actor trying to say train, and Deleted Scenes Are Really Useless When They Exit It is not good enough to stay in this movie, it must be pretty bad. There is also a very bad thing about featurette that doesn't show much, except that the people involved in this movie were kind of idiots. I can't recommend it unless you want a very bad movie that you can laugh with friends. I give it 2 kitty cats 5.
