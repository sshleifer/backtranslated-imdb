First of all, I want to point out a common misconception: It is not unrealistic that the Zoey school will give students laptops. At my school, those in Grade 7 and above must have Apple Macbooks (this is paid in the entry fee). Moving. This display is very irritating. It has boring, predictable plots and bad acting. Often in the show, it brings "girl power" to a new high, with girls beating guys in everything they try. But that's not the worst. The worst is that girls are still portrayed as focused on their personal appearance, and shouting when they are happy. Except for the one smart girl, portrayed as a freak obsessed with ugly boys and science. However, this performance is very addictive. I don't know why, but it is. Although the most recent season was so terrible, I resulted in the stereotypes, boring plots and bad plays that I never thought, and unfortunately I'm no longer addicted.
