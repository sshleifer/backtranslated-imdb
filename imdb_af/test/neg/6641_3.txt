This movie is stupid. It was not lost. But this is also stupid and stupid. Note, Dumb and Dumber is much more fun than this. But I love the one who sees silly movies (Tail Sting) and laughs with a group of good friends about how bad it is. Call me, but see this movie, and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead.
