I just watched this "latest" version of Macbeth and was pleasantly surprised with the solid acting and obvious effort that had to change a low budget historical piece into a full-fledged viewable movie. <br /> <br /> One note, however, the music was very lame and didn't add to the intensity of the movie and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a lot of samplers as opposed to a complete orchestral count . I think Paul Farrer must get his act together!
