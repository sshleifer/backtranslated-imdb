It wasn't necessary for this movie, simply and simply. The original, though hated by some, was something I really found really entertaining, mainly because before Jim Carrey really lost his touch, and Cameron Diaz was good, "Smoooooookin!" "Did Nuff say. So why make a sequel / prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey wouldn't do that, should have been enough that it didn't deserve to be created. But then they just make mistakes Jamie Kennedy Why can this man still breathe? The writing and the story: Terrible. Why do I ever want to see a baby wearing the mask? Why, why do I want to see it fly? Have you ever? How did anyone think it? was a good idea?! The acting is contemptuous, almost everything about this movie is, I try to keep calm, or IMDb will probably not let me put in. Bottom line: don't see this piece of garbage, pick up the original, look how good Cameron Diaz watched and how Jim Carrey had a career and laugh, don't waste a second of your time on it.
