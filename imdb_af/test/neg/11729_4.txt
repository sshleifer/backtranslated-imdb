Dodgy plot, dodgy script, dodgy almost everything in reality. The most compelling show is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even that doesn't save this useless and nasty movie. The director's implicit invitation for viewers is not just to suspend unbelief, but to suspend judgment. <br /> <br /> Presumably, it is meant to be steamy and threatening, but although the film has its erotic moments, they are little and far between. This kind of thing is done better by many others. Don't go out of your way to see it.
