Two years after this film was made, "The Juror" came out. Don't waste your time on this one. Rather see the "Juror". "The Judge" is essentially the same story as "Trial By Jury," with better acting, better directing and a much more gripping aura about it. William Hurt was not credible, and Armand Assante could not be opposed to a bully, if they put him in a clown outfit. You didn't get involved enough with Joann Whalley's character to be so upset about what happened to her. The way she interacted with the jury was also in no way compelling or interesting. Kathleen Quinlan's role as a hooker / killer is not full enough and was frankly unnecessary to make the plot.
