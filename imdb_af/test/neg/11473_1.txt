I heard this movie was stylish and intriguing, but I just found it annoying. It's been a while since I saw it (and hopefully I won't find out all my memories are wrong and I condemn this movie unfairly), but my reminder is that filmmakers challenged Leopold and Loeb because they were plagued by " an anti-gay society, and that it somehow caused their terrible crime. I totally disagree with this view and find it unfair for both homosexuals and Bobby Franks, the true victim of the story. I can't imagine why anyone would claim these two as martyrs. I also thought L & L was portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they actually were - at the same time they were teenagers living at home. The film puts them in a kind of fantasy world that looks like Morrissey has to achieve. <br /> <br /> I just read an interview with one of the filmmakers who implied the film's anachronisms, like the pushbutton phones that used characters, were meant to add Brechtian distance. They certainly did, but I found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> Apparently, a number of people have found this movie interesting, but I would have preferred to have a less "attractive" and more realistic section on homosexuality. may have played in the Leopold & Loeb case.
