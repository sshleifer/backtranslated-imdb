This version of Noah's Ark has retained Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation for about 100 years. The production, however, has its bright side ... a learning experience for neophysic film entrepreneurs in "how not to make a movie" <br /> <br /> Where in the annals of biblical literature and common sense one can do this find quotes and situations: <br /> <br /> "Okay, let's sit down." "It's too bad that God created the sun just to shine during the day we needed it at night." "We're not kissing. We just whisper in each other's mouth." <br /> <br /> Wood for building the Ark with "Georgia Pacific" stamped on it. Metal nails. Kids are flying kites. A Peddler (how can James Coburn then sleep) selling Chinese hats. Pirates attacked a wooden Ark, which they wanted to capture, with flaming bullets shot from fire from catapults. Glass Bottles of Wine (Noah was in a constant state of inibriation. It was a wonder he could see the Ark, let alone.) Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg in a blonde wig revolving around the Ark on a white horse. .. Still rated G) Hand of biblical pirates with an iron (teflon fed?) Frying pan. Landing on Mount Ararat after passing through the Straights or Hercules. <br /> <br /> Etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> Special effects ... you need to see it in Order not to believe them. <br /> <br /> The list goes on. This movie should not be missed; But if you want the full TV version, you need to call NBC for the screen version ... but only if you agree that NBC is totally responsible for firstly airing the thing. Only the extinct version exists in video stores (no pirates, etc.) ... these are the video stores that dare to collect it. <br /> <br /> Marvin Cohn <br /> <br />
