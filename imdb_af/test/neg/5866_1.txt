Human beings I start, all about this cartoon of the episodes, the stories, writing, an animation is to me the stupidest, stupidest and most annoying cartoon that Walt Disney Television Animation ever created and created. I'm so glad Both Toon Disney (2006) and Disney Channel to stop it in the US than this May 2008. <br /> <br /> Believe me it's a wise choice to throw it out and " hitting a black cloud of a cartoon if you see it I do not say I gave a warning. <br /> <br /> Get in for a boring and dull and confusing time, I wish and pray that I have never seen one episode of this cartoon. . If I could I removed the part of my brain that remembers watching it, yes it was and it was bad.
