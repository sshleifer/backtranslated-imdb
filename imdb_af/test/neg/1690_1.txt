this is a terrible adaptation of Charles Kingsley's story. The animation is, to put it unclear. And the songs are a shame to sing movie songs, epsecially the "high cockororim" song they keep repeating. I feel sorry for Jon Pertwee and David Jason, 2 of Britain's leading talents, who offer the voice for the depressed animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins is trying his best to play in this terrible production, but fails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it's the last movie on this planet!
