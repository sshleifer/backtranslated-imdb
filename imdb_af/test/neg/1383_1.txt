The tagline for this show is: "He speaks in his mind. We hire extra lawyers." Looking back in time, a classical comedian never considered him controversial. Richard Pryor's tagline was not: "I'm rough, racist and daring." It's basically how Comedy Central markets this show - in your face, non-computer and honest - but how can a television program be proud of this? Where is humility and humility? And what did Carlos Mencia suddenly make this big figure for Comedy Central? Let's start at the beginning - Dave Chappelle cancels his performance (which has become indifferently popular and controversial) and Comedy Central looks around to print someone else. They hire this man named Ned who claims to be a Mexican, even if he is not. They picked his face on a few TV ads and made them seem "daring" by luring him to the public. <br /> <br /> I saw many hateful topics on the forums for this show and I disagree with Mencia's opponents. It's not a terrible show. It cried me several times in the laugh. When it's funny, it's very, very funny. Yes, it's youthful - but so was Chappelle. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlos is that he uses a lot of the same material over and over again. And he is too obvious. The open marketing set aside, "Carlos" has now said that the bower has lost so many times. He tries to make it the next known line (like "I'm Rick James, b ****!"), But that's too clear. <br /> <br /> In terms of himself, Carlos uses a lot of same jokes over and over. For example, on one episode he said he would like all Mexicans to disappear overnight from America. He would wake up and an American guy would say, "Room ser'vuce!" in a southern accent. <br /> <br /> He used exactly the same joke - verbatim - when he appeared on Adam Carolla's talk show. It was a lot less funny the second time because he was more desperate. <br /> <br /> Is "Carlos" funny? I think so. There are some outrageous moments on his performance. But he focuses too much on trying to be controversial rather than just going with the flow and of course making his comedy progress. Repeatedly faint little catches over and over, along with goofy faces and loud voice screams, become really old, very fast. I just hope Carlos - or his writers - can give a new look to this show, as it is now falling into hell.
