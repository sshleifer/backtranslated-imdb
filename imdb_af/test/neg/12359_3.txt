So I caught this one afternoon when "What Lies Bo" is and actually watched, because the beginning was somewhat promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountaineering expert ... but it doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb. When she goes to get help and return, he disappears from the mountain, never seen again. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Diana is still a climber ... but she doesn't go near Snowman's pass. This is until Curt Seaver appears and tells her he can find the look of her in love fiancé with a new satellite program. She agrees and they take the mountain down with Curt's two assistants: His "guard" Hugo and the computer Tyler is. From the start you know there's a little unreal motive going on, but unfortunately the turn is not good and leads to a laughingly bad chase sequence that lasts the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The big disappointments are the red herring, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come into being. The object from the sky that fell in the mountains (which doesn't seem so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass was, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream series halfway through the movie. But what most disappointed me is where they dropped the ball. The majority of the movie turns to the search for Brian. Therefore, I cannot begin to understand why my mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was never resolved through the film. This was the main plot. That's how the movie STARTED! How do you pack it? <br /> <br /> I won't tell too many people to bother with this one ...
