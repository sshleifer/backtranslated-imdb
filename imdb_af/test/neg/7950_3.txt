I found this movie at a XXX store for $ 1 on VHS. The interesting thing about it is that Camp Video bought the rights to it and slapped the credits on a 1986 copywrite date. Anyway, enough of strange facts. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely not scary. Calling even this horror or a thriller is ridiculous. There was only 5 minutes on most of what you would call abomination in this 80+ minute movie, and it consisted of acting, because it was HORRORIBLE! All the glossary was aside, the writing for this movie was also absolute rubbish, just as the special effects and makeup were laughing. No wonder it's such a dark film. Probably the director has scoured the country for all the existing copies for the past 35 years and burned it in one large pile so that no one else could be exposed to it.
