I never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that I was enrolling in the HBO service. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favorite actors, but he can't even save this part. Not that he tried. Jack plays his usual Eastwick type Wiitches. Unfortunately, it doesn't transfer to the US southwest. He is about as credible as a cowboy desperate as Pee Wee Herman. There is no edge on the show and therefore the comedy fails. He's almost goofy. The remaining part of the cast was worse. Timing in the delivery of lines is apparently something that the leading lady has not made perfect since 1978 and the other just seems to be happy to be there. My recommendation to those interested in watching this movie is that you save your valuable time for something like drying paint.
