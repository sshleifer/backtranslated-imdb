This movie should be the biggest disappointment I have ever experienced with a movie. The acting is horrible, the tension builds on minimal, and the plot in general is ridiculous. I found myself sacrificing and becoming a victim because of course she had to be exhausted from her misery. Anyone with thorough knowledge of how the world works, will immediately be disgusting in the jumps that we need in logic, and the so-called exciting build-up will be happy to get a 3-year-old worried. I am shocked that a successor is planned because it means they will ask us to swallow a subpar plot line again. If it's an example of Raw Feed's work, I think I and all future movies will be avoided by them.
