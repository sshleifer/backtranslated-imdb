Oh man, this movie was bad. Bad look, horrible story ... the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's supposed to be a comedy and everything, but something that tells me that this movie was supposed to be the right deal. The movie certainly doesn't start as a comedy, but more than an adventurous movie featuring fun elements. You can especially say that it was serious about it through the play, it was in a serious and non-comical way, with the exception of a number of successive series of course. It was me who initially tried to make a real and serious adventurous science fiction film, perhaps even a franchise, but soon started to see how bad it was and simply decided to add more and deliberately overly comical sequence. making the movie look more like a comedy and preventing it from becoming a complete disastrous mess. <br /> <br /> The movie is a strange attempt to mix adventurous swashbuckling pirate movies with serious science fiction action. The film is of course inspired by the Star Wars movies and its success. The film is not even ashamed to copy the entire series and even the way the story progresses, sets, characters and robots show similarities. They tried to hide it by including some spooky sequences, but I didn't fall for it. The film is not even original, despite its original concept. You can say that this movie is a poor man's "Spaceballs", without really being a spoof. <br /> <br /> The movie is worse, with some video games special effects (in some rows even literally) terrible looking costumes (jacket post and swords in outer space?). The sound is sometimes even laughing. Seems to have shot some series without sound and then forgot to add all the desired sounds later into post production. the mixing is also very bad. They tried to hide it by sometimes limiting the sound to a minimum and by adjusting the Bruce Broughton musical. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is so busy making the movie humorous that it completely forgets to tell the story. This makes the story of the movie look extremely messy and poorly written, with an almost completely undeveloped main plot. It also doesn't help to make the movie really flow. Many things are not explained and some are even dropped after a while. The movie starts out as a pirate movie, constantly searching and stealing water, as it is scarce and there is only one planet in the entire galaxy that remains to have water (yes right!). However, this plot line is soon abandoned, especially in the middle of the movie, where the movie looks a whole different, with different motivations. It's just like one weird and bad, dull drive to another, without really making a click. It also cares for the characters so eagerly and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Sad to see actors such as John Carradine, Anjelica Huston and another young and unknown Ron Perlman attached to this disastrous film. /> <br /> OK, I admit I liked the moments, especially the end when they went through the timing, was original and fun, but really, it wasn't enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't even keep the movie in a camp. <br /> <br /> 2/10
