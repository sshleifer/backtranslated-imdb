Overview: The follow-up of the famous Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal, is a huge budgetary production that completely fails to deliver; It's not just as clever as its predecessor, it's not even a blast or thrill or horror movie, just a totally boring time warmer. Don't be fooled by the media hype, and especially the stories about people throwing up in the movie and being mentally scared for the rest of their lives because of the brain-eating scene. In the movie it just looks like bad bad SFX. Why do so many people in this forum claim that H is "not bad" and "worth watching on the big screen", etc., is outside me; and it's not "so bad, it's good" or it's just boring. I normally respect other people's opinion, but in this case I must say they can't tell Shine - Ola clearly. Perhaps they have previously fallen into the media hype, perhaps they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie and were impressed by its excessive use of backlight, smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans. H is completely without tension; Instead, we get endless scenes from Lecter swan by an English-speaking Florence, a totally unconvincing and unfinished plot with more holes than a fishing net. After I saw H, I actually woke up half the night to find all the holes in the plot. , and when I wrote them down, I quickly filled 6 pages in a small type before I forced myself to stop). Rather than wasting your time and money to see it on the big screen, I would recommend waiting for it to come on TV in a few years; and then go to bed early. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here are some extra legs I should choose with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - H_is_ the successor to SOTL, despite what some people in this forum demand. And even though SOTL was a very tough one to follow, there are follow-ups that are similar to their predecessors (SOTL itself was the successor to Michael Mann's "Manhunter", based on Thomas Harris's "Red Dragon", and although the first one episode was a very enjoyable movie, SOTL was even better, another example would be the Alien series initiated by H's director Ridley Scott - so much for the theory of diminishing prosecutions). Anyway, to be a successor, is no excuse for the fact that a movie is full-blown. <br /> <br /> - This movie has a well-known director, it is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the role is strict A list, great cinematography, big budget, first-hand authors, yadda, yadda , yadda, and the end result is simply a speed in the church. So what went wrong? I think a lot of the blame should go to the film's producer, Dino DeLaurentiis. Here's my interpretation: DDL manufactures "Manhunter", which was a commercial flop despite all its features. Disappointed, he awarded the rights to the Hannibal Lecter character to Orion - free, so Jonathan Demme can make SOTL, and the rest is cinema history. DDL had to wait another ten years (he is now 81) until Thomas Harris finally turned up the sequel. I think at this stage DDL has lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get its cuts off the cake before opening its cork. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect that I find really annoying about this movie is that it is given so much undeserved hype in the media; I mean, it's boring, yet one of the highest productions ever, so it's not necessary to give it free publicity. And while most reviewers are harping on how Dantesque is the scene in Florence and why Jodie Foster didn't participate, the simple fact that this movie is a complete, complete, UTTER flop. But there is more: Hannibal is not just hipped by the roof, it is also used as a media agenda for a plethora of "documentaries" (usually the remains of similar productions in the aftermath of SOTL) over serial killers, cannibalism a profiling. Nonetheless, H doesn't even pretend to be realistic; Lecter also ceased to be a serial killer (he is just essential, or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need for a profile) and there is also no cannibalism: Lecter feeds the printed Paul Krendler his own brain, making it unconscious of vivo - auto-cannibalism. Try to make a documentary out of it. <br /> <br /> - A lot has been said about the play: whether Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays Hannibal Lecter's head) is often given much praise. I think all these discussions are good. There are several of my favorite actors in this movie (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore), but the writing simply gives them nothing to work with. The same for Hopkins: there is no development in his character, and he is in no way challenged. And by the way, he plays almost identical characters in all his movies. Just in H he has to do the strange little murder and pay the neat $ 11m to do it.
