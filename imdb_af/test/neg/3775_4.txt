Veber is not known for his outstanding legal services. In fact, no one cares as long as they laugh, much here to be honest, spread throughout the process, thanks to Depardieu's half-white characterization and Veber's dialogue in his mouth. <br /> <br /> But it's not enough to make a big comedy, because there's no movie out of the ordinary Veber starting point: a tough man is doomed to join with a very naive character. work. In L'Emmerdeur, La Chèvre or Les Compères there was a real story about the fire versus water performances. Le Diner's drawbacks, although it was a play, could create a real strain on Pinon's next disaster. In Tais-toi, the background to the revenge is superfluous and too weak to cause our interest to arise. In addition, the heaviest on the screen and in the screen is paralyzed. <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Veber wraps it up and creates no action, no rhythm. Instead, he uses systematic and bridging ellipses (perhaps he met William Goldman in Hollywood) and the "music" really highlights the lack of nerve and spine in the story. <br /> <br /> So be content with Depardieu's performance.
