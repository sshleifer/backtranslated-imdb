As a result, the protracted update goes through the head and shoot. It is rather likely to consider the unfortunate state of this movie, a sequel to a movie that didn't need one. <br /> <br /> What really irritates Robocop 2 is that the makers didn't understand why the original was as good in the first place. Robocop (7) was a witty, lively satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. <br /> <br /> Thin in dialogue, especially against the boring, shooting-final, it attracts little interest and has none of the energy or spirit of the original. The spoof advertisements, now a bit tasteless ("Warning: continued use will cause skin cancer") just look like an afterthought. And calling a new designer drug "Nuke" is nowhere as subtle or as funny as the original's family board game, "Nuke ?? em!" <br /> <br /> The stop-motion animation ?? the worst element of the original? is used more extensively, while this humorous successor fails to include a credit line, making it even more cheap and fast. Oh, humorous? You might say. But how about the funny mayor, or the way Robo is reprogrammed to sprout? Yes, there are attempts to get light relief, and Robo also makes a screwdriver ("we are just human") for the film's punchline, but nobody will probably laugh. Like the rest of the film, they are sturdy and moronic efforts to entertain. <br /> <br /> The third and final film in the series (called Imaginative Robocop 3; 5) left Peter Weller, replaced by Robert John Burke, who does well in a particular role. With toned-down language and violence, it was a clear plea for the kiddie market, a robotic action figure applied everywhere. With his social conscience over-emphasized, and Robocop's new-found arm attachments and jetpack becoming stupid, the final film was never destined to be a masterpiece. Another fluid direction by Fred Dekker and a fluent fit makes this one nice to throw away. <br /> <br /> Robocop is then the movie. Robocop 3 is the sequel you could see if there was nothing better. What makes the second film hang in the middle, an unshakable jiggle of a picture. A franchise vehicle that has nothing to say, except for the pounding signs. Irvin Kershner is not Paul Verhoven, like comic artist Frank Miller and partner Walon Green are not the writers Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. A tragic waste of a good, if limited, concept. 10/04.
