It's a bad excuse for a movie. A movie noir done by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget about the plot, a really simple version of a cynical, difficult man who, in the love of a beautiful blonde, has changed into a saint. Yechh. What makes her despise him to love him? Along with a group of other guys, he helps to drown a child, as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive, as the water is cut down. It's not exactly heroic, but she's suddenly hit. It's really painful to see how Claude Rains is trying to portray a hard-bearded, stubborn, noir-type cop. An oblique grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting instrument, along with a rough voice. Most of his energy seems to be trying to hide the intelligence that appears in all his other roles. How he ever spoke to take this job, I will never understand. Enjoy it if you can get the old cars and gas pumps for some time, but don't expect a decent movie experience. It wasted 1-1 / 12 hours of my life.
