Undoubtedly, at least among the Spaghetti Westerns, I've been watching lately: basically a low-brow rip-off from Leone's THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966) with three different characters protruding from each other (and sometimes form alternate alliances) in their quest for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin gave it a BOMB; While it is innocuous, it is also completely routine and deadly are the three main roles of stereotypes, that is, uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee with ideas about his shipment being transported by train; Gilbert Roland is the "legendary" but aging Mexican bandit (his regular decline in Spanish when excited, is quite calming!) What apparently is still irresistible to women; George Hilton as a mysterious bounty hunter is trying too hard to imitate Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name figure. Director Castellari - which I saw at the Italian B-movie series held during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, where he was present as the most beautiful of the cult film directors! - Shows little sincere feeling for the Western (based on two above-average Franco Nero efforts in the genre, I ordered his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... I keep my fingers over!) and the movie's Text the in-cheek approach is equally sad.
