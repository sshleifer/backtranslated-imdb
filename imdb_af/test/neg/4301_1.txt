I can't see why anyone would make such a movie. From start to finish, this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> The characters are all very level, terribly actionable and straightforward irritating. There is absolutely nothing under the surface with any characters or plot. <br /> <br /> The "humor" if you can mention what is aimed at an adult audience (I suppose the language and nudity) though it comes mainly from toilet noise and has problems even a smile of " a half-witted 16-year-old. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. It has nothing to appeal to a film fan. Non-existent laughter and a plot that almost exists lead me to ask, "Why was this movie made, why, why, why?" <br /> <br /> In the full time, I expect to see this movie above the top 100 worst movies.
