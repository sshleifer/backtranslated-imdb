Man, I went to this movie because of the big preview. It looked like it had a wonderful story and good special effects. <br /> <br /> I was wrong boy. I wanted to go out of the theater because of those terrible special effects. A cartoon dino, from the cardboard board would even do a better job than this. The story was good if it were to be adopted by a big film producer. Who would put more money in the hand to make the effect more life. The only thing I like about this movie is the plants that pop up everywhere. <br /> <br /> Even worse where the cars, in one scene, run 2 characters along the street. If you see those cars, you will see: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tri-pod, big bus. And about 4x in a row! <br /> <br /> Then there is the "butterfly death" that will make the whole "evolution changes" progress. If the guy didn't walk on the butterfly, the next dino would have eaten it anyway! So this is absolute bull. Then, if you change something in the past, the future will be different in the same moment. Not in those "time waves" they made. But hey, if the future changed in a second second, the movie would be even worse, but more realistic. It's just one of those movies you should see if you want a good laugh. I spend a lot of money on this movie in the theater. And then they tell me this movie has a $ 80 million budget. WHERE DOES EVERYONE MAKE THIS MONEY?
