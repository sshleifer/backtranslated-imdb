The movie has strange annoying characters, weird inexplicable slapstick, and an insurmountable amount of dialogue on smoking. The movie has a confronted plot of a bitchy, leprous woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn) looking for love. Although who ever likes Jeanne's character, personality or reading of the dialogue, I really can't say. Besides that she likes to smoke. <br /> <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker gives an interesting character performance (which likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look beautiful and soulful (as he smokes). And hey, what does Jennifer Aniston do there? Oh, it's not really enough to care for her. (But she likes to smoke). <br /> <br /> It's a waste of someone's time. I don't even know how I could read as much of the movie as I did. I can't even believe I spent the time writing it except to warn others of its banality. Anyone needs a cigarette?
