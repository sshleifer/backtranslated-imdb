This movie was just so terrible I couldn't get through the whole thing without switching it off, it was just as bad! When I watched it, I thought it looked like a very cheap movie made in the sixties, or something with the terrible special effects, but then I realized that it was only made in 2001. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and the acting were very terrible and the plot was almost non-existent. I didn't think anyone would go back to making movies that look so cheap and old, I don't know if they've deliberately done it or if they really didn't have a budget for this movie. It really looks as if it was shot on someone's video camera at a local person's home or something. Maybe they thought they were retro or something, but it just came out and looked really cheesy. <br /> <br /> I really don't know how anyone ever really likes to see it. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5 * s.
