Webs started in 'Chicago: Present Day', like four electricians, Dean (Richard Grieco), Ray (Richard Yearwood), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) and Junior (Jason Jones) about to break the electric to ' an unused building scheduled for demolition. As they search for the cables and things involved, they come across a set of doors that, according to the buildings blue interest should not be there, be neat and everything they force to open the doors and a room full of computers and scientists machinery. As they break around with a few buttons, a portal opens to a parallel universe, Dean & Junior accidentally "falls" with Ray & Sheldon who are looking for their friends shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, they all ended up on an exact parallel Earth that was taken over by a mutant spider that changes people or them into mutant soldiers who use them to protect themselves and do what they want. In a desperate bid for survival, they end up with some of the last remaining people, including the original inventor of Dr Richard Morelli's portal (Colin Fox), who says we could possibly (yes) to build another portal to bring them back home ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by David Wu I thought Webs were beautiful, it's as simple and straight forward as it really is. Grenville Case & Robinson Young's screenplay is ominous to say the least and has holes in it, you can pass a tank. For example, this movie is really trying to recommend that some mutant spin things out bigger than some people in size have taken over a whole world? How did they do that? If this parallel Earth were the same as us, where was hell the army? The police? All our weapons? A few fragile spider stuff against literally billions of people? The whole faulty, stupid and straight naff concept has bent me throughout the whole film. Remember that there is an interdimensional portal to a parallel Earth in the basement of most buildings that have been undisturbed for decades and remain in perfect working order, right? Then there is the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase, the fact that an electrician can accidentally clean it perfectly, because he pushes a few buttons in a room that is likely to have 100's over decades of equipment and what about it. wonderfully considerate man who makes an explosive baboon in his base without telling anyone who, as one of his friends, has turned it off and bombarded himself with their friends homemade bomb? You will not please the best? What about food? Do they increase themselves in small vegetable pots? All day long I could go over and over the bugs, poorly pregnant and poorly written Webs, but I can't be bothered. The character is clich√© and annoying as the film as a whole, which of course does not help. The only half decent thing I can say about Webs is that it is short and it is moving at a fair pace, but when all is said and done, it's still crap. <br /> <br /> Director Wu needs a great deal of blame here, for a start, the movie looks cheap and the editing he credited is awful. There are many annoyingly inappropriate slow motion shots that come from nowhere, the action scenes are almost identical and get boring very quickly. He uses the highly annoyingly fast cutting technique along with a bit of the old rough camera movement, now I don't know about anyone else, but I hate this editing style, as it just looks like a complete disjointed debris. In fact, I don't know a single person who does such things and I am mysterious about why filmmakers think people are doing. Forget about any gore, just a few shotgun wounds to the spider zombie soldier guys and they don't have red blood anyway, so it doesn't relate to reality in my mind. <br /> <br /> Webs are made for TV, the American Sci-Fi channel, I think and it all looks cheap, low budget and rushed as you would expect. It's so dirty, forgetful, flat and boring. The special effects are far from special and the spider thing has no imagination when it is finally revealed. The acting was OK, as everything else was so poor and I still can't believe the jersey that Grieco wore in this one. <br /> <br /> Webs are crap, I can't really say anything good about it except I have been through worse movies and that is the only reason I don't give it a star and a quick look at the IMDb user ratings for Webs confirm what I already knew it has more '1' votes than any other and there is very good reason why ...
