This movie is ideal for any aspiring screenwriter, actor or director. Watching this movie, you will see all the things that are wrong with the movie industry as it is today. There are so many clicks that it hurts me to pass this movie. Nothing about it was original and every single line spoken was cut off from the cliché films we all saw in the 90s. Although it is a few inexpensive laughs, it is incorrectly wrong wrong. I was so bored and the film was so predictable and pathetic that I actually noticed how much makeup on Tara Reid's face was shattered to hide the massive bags and wrinkles of her endless party. Seriously, she wore so much foundation, you could literally scrape it off and fill a whole bottle of it. <br /> <br /> However, what shocked me was that so many of the talented and popular role-players would be joking. And I don't know how through the terrible shout that Ashton Kutcher does, do you know when he's like evil or something and he screams his words in this annoying way? Ashton's horrible "talk", Tara's face is ten shades darker than her neck, a stunned owl, a writing that looked like the work of a three-year-old ... <br /> <br /> Serious, in All my life there was no movie I watched that I didn't enjoy somewhere, no matter how bad it was. It deserves an award to be the first. BATH BATH BATH ... I don't think there is a single word in the English dictionary that might describe this trashy movie. Today I tried to look at it again, but I had to switch it off like ten minutes because I wanted to cry from the overwhelming amount of cliché. <br /> <br /> Don't even bother renting it from your devastating, it's not worth a penny, and I'm actually willing to pay someone there to consider seeing this movie so they can Go, do something decent with their lives.
