Regards; <br /> <br /> I never thought I'd see the day if I were so disgusting for a movie that it would be a burden to finish it. I was always a fan of horror movies, B 'C and C included. But in this case it is difficult to describe how a movie can fail to qualify for any letters in that scale ... <br /> <br /> The movie is centered on a poorly developed story, a mix of folklore with a taste. And to do this, the performance of the actors is doubtful. Horror B movies usually fall into two categories ... 1) A jewel watched below and under funded 2) So bad it is funny, laughing or your money back. Well, this movie falls in between. I was not scared, didn't laugh ... So I think if you really need to see it, you can but I recommend you not ...
