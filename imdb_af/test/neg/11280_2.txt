I gave these 2 stars out of a possible 10. <br /> <br /> I didn't realize what it was - and discovered that it is a kind of African musical - as people break into song every few minutes. </ br /> <br /> None of the songs rhyme, but most of them don't really say anything meaningful, and they all have the same non-existent melody - if you call it a "song". <br /> <br /> Karmen is a long, spectacular young woman, with the longest stains I've ever seen. [The actress seems to have done some modeling.] <br /> <br /> The movie opens in a women's prison, though not like any prison I've ever seen or heard - the prisoners carry everything they desire - and apparently a party. <br /> <br /> Karmen does some winding dance, and the women's actor, Angelique, is definitely erotic interested. She and Karmen dance together. Later, Karmen visits the room of the keeper and they make love. Unfortunately, the scene is not detailed, and it is very short, although there is some nudity. <br /> <br /> Karmen then escape from jail and then we see her dance in front of another group where a man named Lamine, perhaps a colonel - it was never really clear who he was, watch her. He is with a young woman who doesn't like Karmen's seductive dance and there is a dance-down between the two women. <br /> <br /> Then the story [as] is obscured even more. <br /> <br /> With Lamine in jail, out of jail, and who knows where. <br /> <br /> Karmen can be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> There's more singing. More dancing, and a scene by Angelique, of course, is suffering from sadness. <br /> <br /> The movie obscured its way to an end, and I had a sigh of relief that ended it. <br /> <br /> <br />
