I thought the movie was sub-par. The acting was good, but not good, the story was funny but didn't come out like that. The director dropped the ball on this movie. It wasn't James (Jim) or Tea. IMHO it was the music that killed it. There is a scene where things are going down and Jonny Cash is playing music - the man who was depressed (not funny) killed my mood. Then the movie can't be restored. The deportation scene has a potentially funny situation, good acting good setup - I even smothered, but the music was not suitable for the scene again. <br /> <br /> I said it has potential but was poorly done, I would even say it was in the final production. Kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist: the beginning. The theater release was good, but I have seen it after watching it, but the movie release exorcist: rule was a lot better. Same story, just another director. The same must be done here.
