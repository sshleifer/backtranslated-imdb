There were many movies on the American dream. And this is one of them. <br /> <br /> First, on the technical side, there is a lot of wrong. The sound is bad, I find it difficult to understand the dialogue here and there, and the camera positions could have been better. <br /> <br /> But they really tried to make a good movie, but for example the part where they show Jonathan losing his dream, with girls, drugs and alcohol, is doing very badly. The acting is also very poor in all the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> I was having a hard time watching it, and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. <Br /> <br /> If your expectations are low and you're bored on a bad weather Sunday, watch it. If you're in a deep story with action, then it's not your movie. <br /> <br /> Usually, I would not give a score of 1 but 4.5 for this movie. But the reason I gave it a 1 is because of the bad sound and the camera is used, not to mention the bad cuts.
