I looked back the first few episodes for a while and felt I couldn't take it any longer. The terrible search fights are the worst I've ever had in my life. About one third of each episode is dedicated to Flash Gordon and his "mighty" struggle. I know that battle choreography from that era is not exactly aware of today's standards, but it is ridiculous. They don't even try to make it look realistic. Flash Gordon, who looks almost like a fighter, uses his drunk slow moves and barefoot to knock out four or five guys with knives, guns and other weapons. Give me a chance! There is also a scene where he does a similar action in the water. Basically every episode has screens similar to that. As for the rest of the episode, there's not much else I remember. I basically saw it as curiosity about what science fiction looks like 70 years ago.
