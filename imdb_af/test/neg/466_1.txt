I have a lot of hope to see it, because I always enjoy Paul Bettany's performances. I thought he was very good like Darwin and did his best to consider the terrible material he had to work with. <br /> <br /> Darwin's book The Origin of Species was one of the most pioneering, controversial and innovative publications ever, but you will never think based on this boring movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. There is virtually nothing about Darwin's five-year journey on The Beagle to the Galapagos Islands, for example, certainly of great importance to the story, as from his wildlife investigations that he began to form his evolutionary theory. br /> <br /> It is just one long, brave, domestic drama portrayed with Darwin as a slightly clumsy eccentric, seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionally disturbed wife. Jennifer Connelly's depiction of Emma Darwin is nothing short of horrible and has little connection with historical descriptions of the true Emma. There could have been an opportunity to propose the creationist interpretation of life on earth, either Emma or the local priest, as Jeremy Northam played (a shining-and-miss part that is a complete waste is a talented actor) to act as a counterweight to Darwin's views, but it is not recorded. <br /> <br /> The story focussed too much on endless mawkish sentiment about Darwin's grief for his daughter Annie, and too much time was wasted in Darwin, whether he wanted to write his book or not. Eventually, I was so bored that it was difficult to care. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a bit like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours fighting on him with a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist.
