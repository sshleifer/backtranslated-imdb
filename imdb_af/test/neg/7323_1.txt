Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. She is so boring and foolish. She is the same on and off screen. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and she behaved exactly as she did in movies. Her foolish facial expressions allow me to change channels. She is in some good movies, but they would have been better if someone else was chosen for the part. Steve Martin doesn't add much to the movie either. He also deals with the actions and also ruins an old favorite. The ridiculous part Martin Short plays adds just more idiocies to the movie. I tried to watch the movie twice, but both times had to turn it off.
