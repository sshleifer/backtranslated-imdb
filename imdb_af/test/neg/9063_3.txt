As a serious marathon, I was seriously disappointed in this movie. The target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon or beginner marathon. Following the stories of 2 first-time marathons, one senior, one injured runner, and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago marathon, the film pays the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is because there is no " a better word is not. , boring. While enjoying the brief glow in the Deena Kastor training sessions, the brief history of the Boston marathon and marathon in general, let me emphasize: This was short! If you watch Joe Runners prepare for a Saturday run with their water bottles and talk about how they see the marathon, it's not inspiring. And the nonstop clich√©s about performance and gourmets will make you think the movie is about an hour shorter. If you are a marathoner for the first time, this movie can give you a feeling of "I can do it." For anyone else, run away.
