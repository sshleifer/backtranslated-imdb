This movie is an absolute disgrace! I thoroughly enjoyed the original airport, and I can't believe how the same people could produce this nine years. First, the play is bad. The original had actors who had previously done quality (non-disaster) films, but this one uses actors who have already done the disaster film track (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). Also, George Kennedy's character, Patroni, seems to be advancing very quickly. He's now starring in the movie, but his character is not strong enough to carry it off: he has lost the charm and humor of Airport (1970), and the character is just boring. Did I call the plot? Is it anyhow credible that someone will send a missile to the Concorde? NO !!! There are too many loose points; scenes not at all relevant to the plot. The scene where the hot air balloon lands on the runway, the pursuit of the thief in Charles De Gaulle airport is two such scenes. Both would be interesting - if they had anything to do with the real story. There are also many unanswered questions: Why does Patroni open the window and burn a flame in the other plane? Why does Robert Wagner's character kill himself? (He must have a stupid and expensive way. Why are the back projections so bad?). It looks like a cartoon rocket is following the Concorde, though it works well. When the plane lands in Paris) Why does Patroni think he's in a flight simulator? (When he leaves the Concorde) Why does he get a hero in the cockpit of the plane after he frightened the passengers? And why is the end so poor if it can end? Given their one-dimensional nest, no one looks at it. The boy who gives the girl's coach to the young couple on the plane is scary, the man who plays the saxophone is annoying, and the woman with the bladder problem is simply stupid. The scene where Susan Blakely lies on the roof of her conservatory and when she tells Wagner that she still loves him, it's pretty terrible. This film had to be the climax of the previ of three airport films: instead, it is a deadly, sub-moronic, complete and total waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and talent. !!!!!!! Remember when Patroni asks the French pilot if he ever landed on his stomach? This movie definitely makes the belly flop, and flat on its pointed nose ...
