Isn't it depressed how the most violent cartoon on Cartoon Network is aimed at girls? While I was not watching soldiers being shot and traced on Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on TV that I could see to satisfy my violent urges. And something I wouldn't get had fun watching. I saw a few episodes (I really have to be shot) and had to sit through the movie (now, where do I get a gun?), And it is clear that this spark lost after the first few episodes. If you like to see 500-foot samples that can destroy big cities in a few seconds to be slaughtered by toddlers about one foot, it's a must see. But it gets very boring after a while, and with such a show, even original ideas are boring. The movie felt like one long episode (I can't remember anything), and the villain had to be much more intimidating than a green monkey. This view is a laugh file. It looks like the same episode after the episode, and although it may be secret and intriguing at some point, the end will always be the same. "The Powerpuff Girls save the day!" Everything is good and good, but everything is very, very repetitive ... I give it 3 out of 10 because I'm the only draped cartoon on CN to turn violence, though it's aimed at girls, so I won't vote in for ever. I established myself as a fan of war and violence films and I will not destroy that reputation ... 3/10
