Man oh man, it was a piece of dog sh # t. I've read some reviews here after seeing the case in the local video store and thinking to myself ........ Oh, it looks like a half-decent movie.Vampires.Swords. Thailand. How can you go wrong? Right? No, no, it's not wrong. Jesus, if I could just disassemble my eyes and don't remember this movie, I'd be happy. The main actor ever had the ugliest, gayest voice. Man! It was really bad .... "Amandaaaaaaaa ....", "I have to save my girlfriend ..." F * ck off! My partner and I actually changed the Audio Track on the DVD to Portuguese so we didn't have to hear the man's voice. Subtitles and everything ... and it enhances the movie. I'm serious, if you're anything like me and wonder what this movie was. STOP WONDERFUL. I got the answer. WORST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER! No good action, not a good thing and just the smallest sobriety. Just pure k * t for 90 minutes. Don't rent it, buy it, think about it or watch it at 3pm. It just doesn't cut the cake ...... at all. F * ck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You will have a better time. I'm sure.
