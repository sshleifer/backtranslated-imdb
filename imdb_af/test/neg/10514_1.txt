I deployed a year in Iraq, and among the hundreds of movies I've seen here, this gem was Vampire Assassin. To judge from the front page (African American with maize rows with a curved blade, leather jacket and the imagination of a badass), I expected a Blade coaching. Good enough. <br /> <br /> So I pop it in and notice a frontier-weight African-American with no blade, no cornrows and, well, nothing, really except ... I don't know. If you've read any of these other reviews, you'll get the core of the movie. It sucks. Not bad. Really bad. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was the Highlander esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire, or the karate kick sound effects for camera zoomers, or the twenty dollar props on props, or the "ok, we have 90 minutes to film it before being caught in a Johnson & Johnson parking lot," or the martial arts that are so exciting and faster than two old people having sex, or the 7th grade talent, or the eccentric Asian Master who is either senic or acidic, or what, but the movie can force you to question your existence. And it's wonderful. <br /> <br /> Not many movies can be so bad that your head like Scanners will explode. If you're with your friends (or MST3K), it's the movie for you. I've seen it three times, and I think it can cause permanent damage to my psyche. If you still have no idea about the quality of the movie, people try to give it away for free and no one will take it. Not even by force. <br /> <br /> Long story short, watch it. Either as masochistic pleasure or punishment. It will rock your skull (and for the most part, for all the wrong reasons).
