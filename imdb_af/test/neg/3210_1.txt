Now it's a real turkey by over-estimating director Franco, who gave us so classic as "Las Vampiras / Vampyros Lesbos". Yes, I think bad movies can be very nice. I adore the hilarious howlers from Doris Wishman, Dwain Esper and Ed Wood jr., But this one was too much for me. This is the first movie I've rated. 1. Where do I start? The script is ideal to the limit. The dialogue is incredibly bad. The direction seems to be inconsistent. The best music cue (repeatedly in this movie) was taken directly from the film "Der Hexer" (1964). And it's USE! Poor Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one shot, Sanders reads a Popeye comedy while his henchman tortures a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie). The only thing that surprised me was that Franco immediately showed female nudity when I thought the movie would get it - it's real direction! Still, I'm afraid that a movie in which actors pretend to shoot with machine guns by shaking them, isn't really worth it.
