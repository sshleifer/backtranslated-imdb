Respected western author Budd Boetticher is out of place with this shaky modern policeman and robbery story suffering from a strong lack of emotional credibility. Boetticher turned out to be the rehearsal time deviated and established for the first time as a result. Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming did little effort in their roles, giving line lines without energy. <br /> <br /> Soft-mannered employee Leon "Foggy" Poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and his wife is killed in the process. He escaped from prison and immediately killed the wife of the detective who killed. Hundreds of policemen are mobilized to keep him from coming to the house of the intended move to another place, but if you do not know in the last phases of the movies, we have a dull back foot behind the victim (somehow thinking of taking a bus back to the house was a good move), while a company watched and stomped on what action to take. Sound ominous? You have to see it. This is all and more. <br /> <br /> Lucien Ballard's camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs, but the editing is infallible and formless and it leaves the film from its tension and pace. If Poole, Wendell Corey, is the best thing in the movie to bring about great sympathy as he passes from soft soul to killer. These features individually fail Killer uniform in construction and execution that makes his message clear. Going Western Old Boeder.
