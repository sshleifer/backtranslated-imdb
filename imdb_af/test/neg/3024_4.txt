Disposal is just that, a waste of time. MTV is making up for TV movies against a pretty clip. A friend of mine recommended it and I hired it, unnecessarily to say I would soon no longer accept recommendations from her. This movie shows the rollercoaster of drug use. The problem is that you don't really care about any of the characters because of a lack of believabilty and their own self-discipline. This movie is in a word that is annoying to watch, from the horrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pacing. The 'digital' format tries for realism, but comes in distracting. If you want a true scope on drug use, see Requiem for a Dream.
