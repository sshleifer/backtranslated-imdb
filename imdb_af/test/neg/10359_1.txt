I read the positive comment on this movie. I suppose people who were in this movie should come to this site to give it a good impression, because it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I always look at the whole movie despite the quality or lack of explaining why I watched this whole movie, but I don't think I laughed once during this film. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had a few promises, the delivery was down. If you like, you may need to put the buds in place, because you have to keep the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left. This movie has a poor writing, bad acting, poor directing, poor plot ... nothing of virtue and no entertainment. If you haven't seen this movie, don't do it.
