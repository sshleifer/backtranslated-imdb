The only good thing about this movie is its final twist. In 97 minutes of film we can only save a single idea, which was totally wasted in this movie. For over 90 minutes, this movie is just a collection of clicks, bad acting, stupid ideas and revelations, complete lack of tension, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; All this in a pathetic and inexplicable plot ?? Until the last three minutes, where, FINALE, a good idea appears! It's nothing outstanding or an extremely original idea, but at least a "decent" good idea, the only one who has the whole movie! I won't spoil it, but I have to say I think the better plot idea, better FX and definitely a better play, will be a good movie. If you watch this movie and it can stand to the end, you will know what it is ??
