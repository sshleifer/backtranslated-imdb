While babies are working at an isolated Colorado home, a teenage girl becomes a terrorist murderer on the phone. <br /> <br /> Repeating the 1979 classic horror movie basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original movie and regions It's an 87 minute duration! It is therefore unnecessary to say that the plot of these remakes is quite thin. There is little in the way of originality or interest in this movie. There is a lot of Camilla Belle who is wondering around a dark house and wondering who is calling her and experiencing all kinds of fake terror. All this is repeatedly and routinely following the first 30 minutes and never succeeds in finding much. It definitely never reaches the intensity of the original movie, especially as it changes the lash out and one important plot point of the original. I think we thank the PG-13 rating for this. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there is an impressive set design and a dark atmosphere. Unfortunately, there is not much to do about it. sub-par. Belle's performance is also fairly mediocre. <br /> <br /> It's just another insignificant remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
