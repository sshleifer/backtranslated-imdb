Great D.B. try to keep peace between the settlers and their red brothers. <br /> <br /> Boone (an obsolete Bruce Bennett) should try to prove to local Indian chief (Lon Chaney, Jr., who seems to be drunk as usual) that his son was murdered by the tribe's leader, who also deals in gun deals when no one is watching. Faron Young, even though he holds his gun as it is a mop. <br /> <br /> OK western adventure directed by two guys and not many credits on his resume but this movie is not bad and it has a nice short time of 76 minutes.
