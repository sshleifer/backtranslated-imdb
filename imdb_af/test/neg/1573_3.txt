Bette Midler is the best aspect of this movie. It is a NEW second from the original from 1962 with Natalie Wood as the Gypsy. The songs were much better done in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was wonderful and she looks better in most costumes compared to Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who did not see the original would find it a good movie. <br /> <br /> There wasn't enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl. When Natalie Wood was gypsy, she was just as beautiful when she first appeared in the dress with her gloves in the dress. When she has her hair occasionally magical, it's all beautiful and she looks so elegant. This is an important aspect for the movie, as it is also the first time that Gypsy considers herself something special and that she can actually be a star. , not just a bad substitute for her sister. And the scenes where she becomes more and more familiar are overwhelmed. It was an important part of the movie and they slaughtered it. It is critical to show that she becomes more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are wonderful in these scenes in the original. It was a huge expectation to see it unfold in this movie. I was totally disappointed and not for Bette Midler. I would have closed the movie.
