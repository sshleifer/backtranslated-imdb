The plot captured something about white hunters by a tribe of white women in the African jungle / plains. It's a turkey and one. What it really is is a desperate footage of early sound and silent movies mixed with a bad shot of recent (to release) footage of men on a safari. There are scenes of a man in a gorilla cost, in the seaside natives of the sea (representing people in the middle of Africa), women in bikinis, horrible narrative and a man in a loincloth cloth covering his entire body exist. insensitive I think so). It's a movie to sit down and have fun - just with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends. At any other time it will be a core to go through. It's a bad, bad, bad movie. In addition, I am speechless
