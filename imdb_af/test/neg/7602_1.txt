This movie was so bad and so cheap and such a boyfriend, I saw this movie as one of the movie's fastest, fastest 80's movies I've ever seen. I like most 80's cheap horror movies, but I'll never rent this one again. It just didn't make sense. A family living in the bush invites their son, his wife and their daughter to spend with them for the holidays, and during the film, the mother and the daughter-in-law did somehow not fit together well. We never know why until almost to the end of the movie, but so far everything we see is the fact that the mother has a form of ESP and the daughter-in-law has nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to unfortunate victims of this "thing" that we do not know what it looks like is all we see, a bright light that indicates its approach and everything we hear is a cheap interpretation of Darth Vadar voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror films. Then, when we finally find out what and who it is, I just laughed. This "killer" seems to be a kind of weird Japanese warrior from World War II who apparently came back to claim the mother and her family. And all the mothers do stand in front of the lounge with her hands on fire, or something like she's in some kind of convulsions. This movie is pathetic! Avoid it, it's not even worth renting.
