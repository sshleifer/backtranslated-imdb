Interesting plot but painfully boring. That writing lacks ... lack of acting. For me, this movie was compared to "Made for TV" type movies. I was fortunate enough to survive the film without sleeping in my popcorn. I watched this movie with my family. It's pretty safe to look with your kids. (only 1 semi-sex scene) If you want to see a young Meg Ryan, watch this movie. Very 80's. You will like this movie if you want the combination of depressed people at Christmas, liquor, super gum and tar. Or maybe you're like me ... and you have a higher standard of acting in movies. But I did like the way the movie started and ended! Mark.
