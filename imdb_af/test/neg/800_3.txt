A button with a button offers some the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they have never met. It's a very boring movie to watch. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a movie without any payouts. You are taken on a journey of slow builds, one after the other with lesser revelations at its best. At certain moments I thought to myself, it would ultimately have great significance but nothing to do. The movie only makes one think, "This story could be told within 30 minutes, without all the vast nonsense." I hope you avoid this god-fearing movie and maintain your common sense.
