The assumption of the film was very promising - kind of a gay Napoleon Dynamite-type movie. And to be honest, there were a few funny moments and funny lines, but it wasn't really good at all. The script and dialogue felt like a local sketch production, full of claws and scenes that were predictable. <br /> <br /> There was enough amusing though, that I was trapped to see how it was done, as there were hints that something special was happening at the end. But it seems the movie doesn't have the money either, or the author has cleared out ideas, because the end is extremely sudden, and it shoots directly down which looks like the main conflict in the movie to the final credits. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was very disappointing, but not completely incompatible.
