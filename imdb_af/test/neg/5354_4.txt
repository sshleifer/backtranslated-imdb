A time to die is based on John Grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one who didn't make him known. (This would be achieved by "The Firm"). That's why this movie wasn't made much later, after Grisham was without meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head. Unlike most of these, this book was actually about something. It had meat, it had weight and it had heart. <br /> <br /> But it also had a fatal error, and this deadly mistake is being translated into the movie. With this we hit a black man (Jackson) for the murder of two white men who raped and tortured his 10-year-old cruel. daughter. We have a lawyer attorney (McConaughey) who stops the big bad system to save his client. And oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, complete with CCK men doing burning crosses. <br /> <br /> In other words, we have to sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We must believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. We must feel the injustice of a system where a racist all-white jury could judge a black man who just tried to avenge a cruel crime. We are supposed to feel standing next to the people singing "Free Carl Lee". <br /> <br /> But the racism problem is a smoke screen, and the whole thing is confronted. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante. Yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he was not innocent. It would have been true no matter what its skin color, or the skin color of the attackers of his daughter, judge, jury or anyone else. <br /> <br /> And what is so heavy about this movie? is that someone who believes that Carl Lee should be convicted is a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe that the law should not be taken in people's own hands, then you can also burn crosses on a lawn somewhere. <br /> <br /> It's not the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won't be the last. If a movie remains A Time To Kill remains true to the book, and the play is not half bad. But it really did. Even a good throw cannot raise bad source material.
