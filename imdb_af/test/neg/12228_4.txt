It was just a matter of time that a spoof of sports films would be made! And there are lots of movies being mocked. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it remains with the recognition of movies. The director and writers of "The Comebacks" somehow forget to become creative. While I must admit that I laughed at some scenes, the return could have been so much nicer. The actors forget to make their lines serious and face straight through the movie. A spoof requires it and that's the main reason why crazy jokes work in such movies. Due to the failure of the cast to do so, the jokes never hit their point. Some scenes take forever and usually in spoofs that don't have a problem. Take 'Naked Gun' for example. They are always something that happens on the screen. In "The Comebacks" they didn't even bother to make things happen in the background. Only a few factors make this movie worth watching! It's still fun to see the movies being made fun. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody on Cuba Gooding Jr. if Radio was hilarious! He was the only one in the throw to get the idea of ​​what a spoof is about. Not quite bad!
