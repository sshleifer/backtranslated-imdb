It's a classic B-type movie you'd rather not waste. It started well and I thought it would grow up as a good excitement, but I was wrong. All movies for a long time will make you feel that something interesting will happen soon and it will suddenly become a thriller, but it doesn't happen. It runs slowly and quietly to the end, with nothing interesting in it. Only the end was unexpected and original, but it is. Voice: 2.5 out of 10. O, another thing. Why is this movie R anyway ???
