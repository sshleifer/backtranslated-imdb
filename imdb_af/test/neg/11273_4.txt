A little too much mediterranean machismo for me. The movie was beautiful, fun to watch in all the romantic scenes. The place was beautiful with blue sky and blue water. It was not convincing to me that such a selfish worm was nothing but its building, attracting so many beautiful, vulnerable women. Just in the Mediterranean, I think. Certainly in no world I am familiar with. The macho men were really unpleasant, and I found it hard to believe that the female characters could be with them for so long. The script, cinematography, director, etc. Made to deliver a Class B movie. The central attempt is to show scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts. It was aesthetically pleasing for a while, but it couldn't maintain a very mediocre movie.
