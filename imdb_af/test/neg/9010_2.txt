I accept that most of the enemy's horror is not frightening according to today's standards, but what is hell? If you see a title like this, you expect to see blood and a bloodthirsty animal. Instead, we don't get blood at all and an animal that wants to take over the world or live in peace on earth. Yes, that's what the people wanted. <br /> <br /> The overall story is good with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast .... but the title really killed the movie. Night of the Beast would have made the fans more happy because there is really no blood to talk about. <br /> <br /> I love how the 50's had movies ending up leaving room for a successor, but never showing one. This movie is not the worst I've ever seen, but it's almost up there. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
