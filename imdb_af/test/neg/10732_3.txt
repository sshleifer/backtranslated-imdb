A killer (John Karlen) with a fondness for many bad disguises (afro wedge on a white man?) Cross in his quest for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the point and finds the killer pretty easy by just hanging out at the local pool and looking for someone who looks strange (again the afro wig comes into play). By tracing the killer to his home, DeCarlo decides to set up a risky sting that includes a female police officer. <br /> <br /> Inspired by Ted Bundy's crimes before being captured, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a fairly predictable and inexpensive killer movie series. Director Jeremy Hoenack has no idea how to fit a movie or even make tension. He does know how to show a lot of murderers of the killer turning all his hands! The only thing that really goes with it is the captured 70s atmosphere (look out for the bathroom paper). Well, this and a shrewd end. The Media Blasters / Shriek Show DVD has lots of nice stuff, though a sound commentary by Hoenack and Karlen, plus video interviews, trailers and an alternative opening.
