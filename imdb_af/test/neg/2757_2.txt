It could have been so much better than it turned out. Tom Pittman gives a good performance and some of the older actors do well with what they have to do, but it just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are too old to play high school. students, especially Howard Veit (Vince). He looks about thirty. Secondly, it is difficult to sympathize with poor Marv, especially since Betty is not so hot. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ****** The end is so strange. . It seems as if the director intended for Pittman's character to be shot, but there are no gunshots ... he just hit the cement, where he lay until the ambulance drivers picked him up and put him on a stretcher . . What were his injuries? A skinned knee? Simple! Vince had just shot his daughter, without any remorse. Yet, he just moved Marv to the ground and chased off, despite not making the secret of the fact that he hated the child. And to make matters worse, Marv asks the police to tell his father that he is sorry. (Duh! Hey Marv. You just beat. I think you will have many opportunities to tell your dad you are sorry ... in person). And this writer didn't get an Oscar nomination? Save it unless you see it on MST.
