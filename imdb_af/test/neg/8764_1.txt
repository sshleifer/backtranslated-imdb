I watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time. Emmerdale's girl she was fat so she had to be a fat friend, but no one lost every time. <br /> <br /> Like Itv made a big mistake with it. Bad Girls is 100 times better. <br /> <br /> I feel that the whole show is just about big people trying to lose weight, but they never tried to have love story, oh my God who is a waste of time and airtime. This show is not repeated on ITV2 / 3/4 yes that's how good it is. <br /> <br /> I will say, not by the box just a waste of money. <br /> <br /> BEWARE
