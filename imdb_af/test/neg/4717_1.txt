You know those movies that are so unspeakably bad that you have to laugh? Half cupboards were not one of them. What sounds good, right? But no, it's not. It's not a bad attempt to make a horror movie, it's fun to watch because it's lame, or not well done, or has bad special effects or anything else. No, half cabinets are just boring. They don't even try to be terrifying until the last 20 minutes. It's just kids running around in the African bushveld, and for the first 75% of the movie, it's high in elephant dung. And it's not even funny. However, the last 20 minutes are HILARIEUS. I have no idea what happened, but it was really fun to see CGI leopard sticking out the throats of all the white guys I could not disassemble anyway. If you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, don't hire this one because you're going to sleep before they get to the fun stuff. If you rent this movie by accident, I will be redirecting in the end and switching any scene in daylight. You will not miss anything. You won't have an idea of ​​what character is or exactly what is going on, even if you look at the back story.
