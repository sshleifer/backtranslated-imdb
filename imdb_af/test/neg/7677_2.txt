All the airport movies are stinkers, but this one is the biggest turkey of them all. The formula was different for this one because it focused on TWO disastrous flights and many plots on the ground, while the other movies focused on just one disastrous flight and less plot on the ground. The stunts with the Concorde are worth watching for the laugh, although the special effects aren't as terrible as I expected for a movie of this quality made in 1979. George Kennedy's sexist remarks are disgusting and his rendezvous with a prostitute in Paris is completely unnecessary (and made a little bit of my gag). Poor Martha Raye was relocated to a role where she did nothing, but her bowel counted over and over in the Concorde's bathroom. There are no big stars in this movie compared to the previous movies, and give you another reason not to watch this one.
