Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the everyday biggest comedy team, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a range of cheapest. Many of these were parodies of great Hollywood features. Most of Laurel's 'parody' movies are just pretty funny, and even less funny to modern audiences who haven't seen the original film parading Laurel. Fortunately, 'Mud and Sand' sounds make a movie still known: 'Blood and Sand', with Rudolph Valentino. "Blood and Sand" was released just nine weeks before this parody and gave you an idea of ​​how quickly Broncho Billy's movies were ground, edited and distributed. <br /> <br /> Various sources (including IMDb) state that Stan Laurel's Character in this film is called Rabarber Vaselino, with a final 'o'. I checked a print of 'Modder and Sand' with the original titles (in Hobo-type font), and I report that Laurel's role was actually called Raubarb Vaseline, with an 'e'. But I agree that 'Vaselino' is more fun. Laurel copied the elaborate sideburns Valentino carried in Blood and Sand (he had to make them longer!), And there is a parody of Valentino's dressing scene from the movie, which female filmmakers swore in 1922. A Senorita named Carmen in the original film is parodyed here as caramel (a girl I like to sink my teeth.) <br /> <br /> This movie (like the original) apparently takes place in Spain, but there is a ban effort. Laurel uses a distinctive hat doll gesture that could be a trademark for him (like Hardy's distinctive tie), but I have never seen it in any other Laurel movie. There is an amusing dialogue: Rhubarb Vaseline tells the other matadors to save a bull for me. 'When Vaseline becomes a successful toreador, he says' The bull is without, sir'. It's funny, but I was disappointed that Laurel didn't answer 'Without WHAT'. '<br /> <br /> There's a funny moment here, almost certainly not planned, when Vaseline arrives for the Bullfighter auditions. Laurel swaggers in the bullring, and before he can say 'corrida querida', he throws a bull over the fence, where it is near the other audition with a drop of land. The bull is of course a fake, but the gag is funny anyway ... and there's a title card with a joke about the 'throw of the bull'. The serendipitous moment occurs when Laurel repeats the gag, and Vaseline strikes a second bull over the fence. This one landed on its buttocks and balanced upright for just a moment before overthrowing. Very funny! If someone planned the gag in this fast-paced comedy, I greet the unknown gagsmith ... and the technology man who directs the bull into that position. More likely, it happened through happiness, and the director and editor were clever enough to keep it in. <br /> <br /> During the silent era, when Hollywood made a big-budget movie, where people didn't stand, English didn't speak, it was a common movie device for a piece show text or an inscription in the local lingo, and then fix it to a shot of the same text in English. I was surprised that this low-budget comedy spent the money to copy the device here: we see a notice board outside the corrida with a message in Spanish, then it is solved on the same text in English. Unfortunately, photography in this cheapo movie is so dark that the effect is lost. <br /> <br /> The actresses in this movie are appealing ... including Broncho Billy's wife, Leona Anderson and Stan Laurel's common law wife, Mae Dahlberg; The latter briefly does a nice dance. (Mae danced in Stan's vaudeville scene.) I was surprised to see Charlie Chaplin's half-brother Wheeler Dryden in a short role, as Chaplin had nothing to do with this movie. In 'Mud and Sand', Laurel gives a funny show that is quite different from his famous Stanley character ... but this movie is much less funny than his brilliant work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: just 3 out of 10. TRIVIA NOTE: Twenty-three years later, in Stan Laurel's very last American movie - The Bullfighters (1945) - he played another Spanish bullfighter (with his Spanish voice after -baptised ). Coincidentally, the movie used stock of 'Blood and Sand': not Valentino's movie, but the Tyrone Power remake. 'Mud and Sand' is more funny than 'The Bullfighters', but not much.
