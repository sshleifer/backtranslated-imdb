It was unbearable. (SPOILER # 1) Protagonists avoid the useless disclosure of indignant truths to their loved ones so they did not surrender the status and accept the roles of Antagonists. (SPOILER # 2) The authors will believe that the exposure of various offenses, by the offender, is a threat, and causes a retaliation of the primary victim of the offenses. (SPOILER # 3) Until the last 15 minutes I expected a score of 6 to 8 out of 10; Instead, it was kind of the discovery that Lieutenant Columbo's dog is the true killer. The story just wasn't credible, and I don't think the world's best director could save it without much editing.
