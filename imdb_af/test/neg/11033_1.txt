Avoid this movie if you are looking for entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's full of wannabes trying to be something they aren't, and Emran is just wasted in the role of a tour guide who falls for a newcomer who needs to go to the acting school. Seriously, where do they get these people? Just because you're beautiful doesn't mean you can act or be an actress. <br /> <br /> Asmit Patel must send a letter of apology to anyone who accidentally watches him, makes a fool of himself in this poor apology for a movie. He plays an undisputed wannabe gangster who drugs drugs and forces them to fall in love with him and sell it to the highest bidder.
