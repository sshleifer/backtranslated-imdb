4 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This movie wasn't funny as a whole and it wasn't worth investing any kind of emotion in the characters either. Eugene Levy is probably the funniest one .... The rest of the actors do their job, but the story never really touches and there are many holes in the plot that are never filled. It just wasn't fun, though it was sometimes funny. <br /> <br />
