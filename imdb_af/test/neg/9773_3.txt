The name of this movie and the clips I saw made me believe that this movie will have excitement and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The desert stands were interesting, but this movie fits along a snail. It started with an underground cave and something came out, but we tried to get involved with the lives of a few very careless people. While they found bodies, or should I say skeletons with some flesh on them, did they start looking for the reason why? Sometimes it has become somewhat different from what they follow in the desert. Some kind of black ooze or something that would start eating the flesh of people. After the meat got caught up, a bag of legs began to crawl to the remaining people. The reason for this black ooze as we find out was rather bad ants? Unbelieveable! Then the end didn't make sense. I think the motto of this movie will be, if you have an itch and see an ant, kill it soon before the mom's friends smell your flesh.
