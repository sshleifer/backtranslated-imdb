Roger Spottiswoode is not the worst director, and he did a good job on the underrated sci-fi thriller "The Sixth Day" (including "Schwarzenegger's" The Box Office Downfall). However, "Air America" ​​should be one of its most unknown projects. <br /> <br /> It is a merger between drama, comedy and war film - it's not a very convincing mix. In fact, I found it persuasive. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr. (during his lifetime) stars as a pilot recruited in a top secret CIA organization working in the Vietnam era during Laos. Mel Gibson plays his co-pilot and he stumbles on the knowledge that they are drugs and what is not. <br /> <br /> The movie was hoping for release because it knew two well-known faces and re-recorded Aerosmith. The doors classic "Love Me Two Times" for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Transferring the song is pretty poor, which suits the movie.
