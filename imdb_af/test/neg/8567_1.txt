The movie is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it's an insult to the horror genre. Nothing about this, not even near the threshold of scary. <br /> <br /> It's just another case of another teenage horror movie, since one and you saw everything. First few minutes in the movie and you will know what will happen next. The worst part is, the font is blunter than the most recent installment of scary movie. Would have been better if it was written in Spanish. And don't start me with jokes and punchlines inside. <br /> <br /> Although I will give some credit for the special effects. But trust me, like any other Hollywood horror movie, CGIs and special effects have little or no effect on a horror movie's ability to scare. In fact, it makes it worse. <br /> <br /> Between the freshly confronted Anita Briem and the haunting place, there's not much to see in this movie.
