Sorry, after looking at the credits, I thought it would be at least a decent tribute to the retirement of SF actors. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction and story being told about this. POS is terrible. I've never been so insulted by a production. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect and love for many of the actors in this "movie", but have to say they've been banged. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. It's not just two hours you won't get back, but they will also ruin your respect for some of the actors you've ever enjoyed.
