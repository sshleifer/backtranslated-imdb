I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet paper. No respect whatsoever for very important details that make the movie intrinsic. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (which I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names is it? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic !!! As for a name, I laughed and thought about days. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been cases of terrorism done by the Serbs. A journalist like the main character must have known it. Thirdly, the actors playing Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs, nor do they speak Serbo-Croatian. All this aside, this movie is sturdy, but the story is paper thin and full of holes. Sometimes it doesn't make sense at all !!!
