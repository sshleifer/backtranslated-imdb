Totally ridiculous movie that makes fun of the college admissions process. Although it is true that the SATs are not all in the evaluation of a student for college admission, what the film is talking about is completely ridiculous and not worth repeating or viewing. <br /> <br /> College recording officers are made to look like stupid people who have a very narrow view of the whole process. The film is an insult to hard-working high school students who work hard and then suffer from a long process until they receive the letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools for which they have applied. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely deserves rejection at all levels.
