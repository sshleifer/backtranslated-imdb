This is a good example of what happened to Comedy Central after Dave Chapelle's gone. Here's the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his birth name is Ned Holness, and it was known until he was 18 when he changed his name to Ned Arnel Mencia. He was born in Honduras, although he acts like he is from Mexico. He also grew up in the United States. <br /> <br /> I may be able to forgive all that crap, but ... <br /> <br /> He was caught stealing other people's material. Joe Rogan is thus his most vocal critic. The Stereotype Olympic Games was an idea that he tore off some Miami DJs. He stole Bill Cosby's jokes. He stole George Lopez's material in his own HBO specialty (13 minutes away). He believes what he does is so original, but Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli have been in the race for years before this idiot (among others). <br /> <br /> This display will collapse and burn. The word Beaner cannot last long before it gets old. He hasn't done anything new since the first episode. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to hear a joke? A bone that jumps a fence! It's funny for 3 Seasons!" Not. <br /> <br /> Awful.
