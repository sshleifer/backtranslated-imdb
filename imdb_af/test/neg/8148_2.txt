This movie is a laugh and a half. From the first scene, where we are Mel Torme as a big, bad Jaguar drivin-stud muffin gang leader (and this is a giggle party in itself), it looks like the final image of Mamie Van Doren, now a rehabilitated angelic teenager Out of jail (flawless girl's house driven by iron-fisted nuns), you can't stop shaking your head. The movie of this movie is a kaassy list of Mel and Mamie to the talented Paul Anka. All I wanted for most of these movies was just STOP to him!) And the King of Forty Year Old Teens, Dick Contino. Gloria Talbot, with a humorous teenage girl with more than a few characters (judo, not acting). I have never seen in the horrible misogynistic 50-hull. Leech Woman, with a hairstyle so bad, looked like a dead wooden biscuit cut by a Mac. truck. <br /> <br /> Mamie is a bad, bad girl-she smokes, swears, runs wild, saves teachers and runs around with gang leaders. She plunges her idiotic Jaguar driver Chip (who we see in the first scene, trying to rape a blonde girl before he falls from a cliff-like man), and continues to take Dick Contino instead. Whether it's a step for her, is someone's guess. Mel appeared at a festival with her new beau, accusing her of pushing the nasty Chip off the cliff. While I'm sure she wanted to, she wasn't there. A stupid scene between Contino and his gang and Mel and his jazz freaks occurs, with some hilariously bathing moves on both sides. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Mamie is sent to a girls' village, a reform school. Walk home to persuade girls. Walk through Sister Iron Pants and her co-sisters of correction. She irritates the nuns (and us) by estimating, throwing out one-liners, and usually just how bad she is. She runs fast in Gloria Talbot, plays one of the relentless girls, giving her a khaki, so she knows her place. She meets a nice noodle from a girl who is obsessed with Paul Anka's character (why?). This little drip becomes her 'henchman'. <br /> <br /> There is a long movie where nothing much happens, except that St Paul of Anka continues to show and prove how sacred he is. He sings too much in this interval until you want to hit him in his big snozz just to stop him! And Mamie's little sister, played by Princess of Father Know's best fame, calls her to tell her she's in trouble. It seems that it was Sis who went out with the Chipster, and now Mel's extortion because he found out. The girls are all going to save, with a hysterical battle scene between the girls and Mel and his sons. It is after a race between Mel and Dick, who is just as stupid as to overpower the mind. The surviving teens in this kieckliek have a fantastic good time to find out what is basically a fool, badly written and morally preaching film that has achieved nothing but its goals, unless its purpose was to make you laugh out loud .
