I'm a fan of good, probable action movies. And I'm a big fan of the military military units like the Navy SEALs. Finally, I'm a big fan of Michael Biehn. Unfortunately, nobody allowed me to really enjoy this movie. I recently gave it another chance when I bought the DVD. Here's the trouble with this movie in a quick list: 1. It's a poor man's spit, for example a virtual music video from the SEAL team playing golf with a soundtrack of "The Boys is Back In Town". It ends with Charlie. She makes a zealous chase to get his towed car back. <br /> <br /> 2. It's simply a Charlie Sheen movie, when Sheen tries to be known before he starts doing things like Hot Shots. Reports I heard indicate that Sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and direction of the rest of the actors in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Biehn is the head of the SEAL team, but Sheen rarely obeys him. Any SEAL that shows the lack of discipline that Sheen's character does or has endangered the team would not even allow BUDS training. <br /> <br /> 4. SEALs are cross-trained on weapons. But in one part of the movie, a SEAL has to find out how to use a US Stinger rocket. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in the movie. The attack at the beginning, Bill Paxton as "God", and some of the footage in what was then Beirut. Overall, however, this movie is a loser.
