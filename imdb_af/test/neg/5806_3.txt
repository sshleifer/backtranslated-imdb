What can be expected from any Adam Sandler-made comedy, grandma's son is predictable and so stupid it is sick. Allen Covert starred as Alex in the movie, a 35-year-old pothead who works as a video game tester and moves in with his grandmother and her two roommates after losing his apartment. There are a few common plots: he has difficulty adjusting his new life situation, which in turn causes problems at work. This is especially bad because he is trying to nail one of the office's new consultants. Throw a strange boss, almost alien company star, really nerdy best friend, a couple of scenes at the burned-out dealer's place, a very big party scene, and an original video game that Alex is trying to make is has Son as a whole. Allen Covert makes a slightly good lead, Linda Cardellini is cute enough for her role as the one-of-a-kind office consultant Samantha, and some scenes manage to make a crook or two, but nothing of it makes Grandma's son worthy of anyone's time. Most of the supposedly funny "jokes" or "gags" or whatever you want to call is nothing more than "humor" that anyone at National Lampoons would be ashamed to look at. Joel Moore is incredibly unfunny in his role as videogame master brain JP, and the entire movie actually runs boring on top of not funny or substantial. Well, grandmother's son did at least something for someone: Adam Sandler could get some salaries from his friends, David Spade, Kevin Nealon and Rob Schneider.
