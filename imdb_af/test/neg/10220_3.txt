About the GW is a near-miss of a debut feature, not because it doesn't without trying. Actually, it is. It's a pity, because it's author / director / technical general Nick Gaglia has gone through the same rehab cult he portrays in the movie. Sometimes a first-time filmmaker, full of power that comes with an inch or two of fellow movie students, is head-on in style that is too different, uncertain and dramatically frustrating is the personal side of the story, the very personal side , become spot on in order to tell a good story. Gaglia, who was 13, placed in a horrible program that basically tortured and crushed their "patients" with crazy horror tactics, psychological mind-f *** sessions that could last for days and attitudes of rehab leaders who Most Nazis finally escaped when he was 15. I'm glad he came out, though it might help if he is now going to a real rehab for his film skills, just for a few days, to learn things like saying, structure, proper lighting, liquid camera movement, subtlety with actors and other basic principles that are always lost here. <br /> <br /> It's all the more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a topic that needs to be shown to the public (a Newsweek article recently published for a similar AA cult rehab refers). Many times one wonders whether certain personal character studies can work better than documentary works as opposed to narrative dramas. It's an eternal sensation across the GW, where it almost feels Gaglia wants to tell the truth, but doesn't know how to properly communicate it through its characters. The character one would think is closest to him, Bronx teenager Tony Serra (Gallagher), taken by his mother to a rehab in New Jersey, would be closest to Gaglia, is much more of a one-dimensional being, where there is very little storytelling (we see a short outlook in black and white in his old house) and a bit related to his mother (Moriarty), who has more potential never of a cold stone do not abandon her children to another. But there is a story to go with his two-year crisis, I think. <br /> <br /> Right of the bat touches things roughly (a nudity in the first five minutes), and soon it is clear that instead of medical care it is more like a cross between riot management and a bizarre religious sect, where the chief doctor Hiller (Insinnia) is a total over-wage. But soon, Tony's sister, Sofia (Donohue), will be thrown into the program, and unlike Tony's repeated moments of indignation and supposed non-compliance, she goes through the provoked three-step program and is released once. Sometimes there are bits in this broken nightmare, where there is one woman, a 22-year-old mother who is already in the program, finds a year and a half find she has become a prisoner not allowed to leave and when the father of the chief brothers and sisters come and pay an angry visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to them. It contains some raw power, very short cans that Gaglia is capable of at least leveraging pure melodrama. <br /> <br /> But these are moments few and far between. It is not only the unsuccessful characters, which are mostly reduced to stereotypes such as hysterical D.A.R. frost-offs (perhaps some of them, such as an evil black youth, the passive aggressive counselors, or even Serra's older sister who is being exterminated by the brothers and sisters after getting a joint and almost throwing in the program would resonate more if more time was given to develop any of them. It's that Gaglia is so indifferent in its multiple roles on its small $ 30,000 budget that can't pass through any potential talent it has. He uses shades in general, mostly with a shadow covered with urine, he lights his handle DVX camera as if it were more intense, Ala City or God. Sometimes a character just pops randomly into the frame, his choices of music are like the worst choices possible from pseudo-indie soft rockers, and there is even a false interview screen with Nicholas Serra (inspiration?) And Krakowsky what feel as fake as possible. <br /> <br /> Can't Gaglia just get any interviews with the real victims he was and the resort for artistic Catholic plan B would be? Bottom line, no matter how much of the true life stories you have at heart, you can't see in the theater or even in the theater, unless you love a final scene with two kids looking out for the digital - hued Hudson river sunset with the final words read: dedicated to the children. Oy.
