This criticism tells the story of 4 small friends who are going to watch Angels and Demons on the movie the first night it came out, even though it was a school night, because "Angels and Demons are worth it." Two of the four read the book. Of those who didn't have a man, pink skinny jeans wore. It was the least eventful part of the night after watching the horrible Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in a laboratory where the antimatter is created while another process is underway. And apparently someone knows about it or something. Notice how much I am confused. I don't get what happened: they just made the antimatter. Vittoria finds her own father dead ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT, not a fire on someone's chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They take Maxmillian Kohler out. They, pretty much, take out CERN and the associated symbology. They took the Hassasin out and replaced him with a religious British man. They take out the Illuminati diamond. They take out Vittoria's rape zone. They take Langond's fight with the Hassasin (now British man on crack). They take out the press woman they follow. They take the death of the fourth cardinal. They take the fact that the Camerlengo pope becomes. They take out the Camerlengo's big scheme. They take Langdon's creature out of the helicopter and land on the island at the end. They assume that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take Langdon's pleasure out and unfortunately, they take Vittoria's sexual appeal. <br /> <br /> Unlike the movie, the focus completely loses the details, and the movie is acting HORRIBLY. One must admit that there were good things. For example, the Sistine Chapel recreation had to be very difficult and it was done extremely well. The explosion scene was MIND-BLOWING. Other than that, WRITE THIS MOVIE TO READ THE BOOK FOR MAN.
