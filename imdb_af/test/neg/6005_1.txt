OK. Firstly, I just wanted to see if this movie has an average score below or exactly -1. But 5.9. This is worse than any of the murder proceedings. It made me know what people have written here. Which ultimately made me account for giving me 2 cents of truth in this "good of error", I find here. <br /> <br /> How dare you even MENTION this movie in the same sentences as eg Seven? The only thing they thought was that they showed several crime scenes. This is it. And "Best Player of 1999!" ? Have you seen another movie form that year? Or any other movie in your life? 1999 is not a year where people are reminded of RESURRECTION. What are the real movies like 8mm, Eyes wide shut, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (They are actually more of a "thriller" than this one could ever be ..). Resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to a SECOND of 1999. <br /> <br /> Really, you can't be serious. I watched that movie with my girlfriend yesterday, highly recommended by a friend of her. A "big movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... what I haven't seen yet? Hmm. <br /> <br /> Look first at the covers: OK, nothing special. At second glance, you don't have to realize supernatural powers that they just reflected Lambert's head, it cut his nose a this, and then he made a delicate negative pattern to get the murderer image on the COVER. You might even think they had a little pupil to eat a bunch of marshmallows, just about the mouthpiece that crooks (booooh! -.-) mouth .. whatever. Turn it around and the plot starts with .. "it rains in Chicago ... blabber blabber". Come on, a six-year-old could have made that snippet sound more exciting. Now, with this immense excitement coming from the movie's fantastic presentation, you want to start watching it. Because it can't be that bad, it's still Christopher Lambert. That assumption of mine was wrong. With the "proven wrong" I thought it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable play ever known to mankind (every actor, but the tops are "I can do 1-Liners!" police chief, Prudhommes Wife __ actually a better detective than Prudhomme when she recombines several incidents into an even awesome unknown tip in the case !!!! -.- __ and .. yes .. Prudhomme herself) with a squadron of inhuman fake feelings, logical mistakes in 1 minute bikes, light-years far-reaching conclusions that, in my view, are an insult to any thinking person and finally a camera man who was, of course, a hyperventilating kangaroo. Oh yeah, and if you don't turn off your brain completely (it's not a place to see it), then you need to know who is who and what is at the maximum. 30 minutes, simply because you know any scene after the first. This is exciting. Exciting because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: It's by far the worst movie I can remember. Believe me, I've seen a lot of terrible movies that were somehow at least just bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. Resurrection, however, is the best example of how to fail in every possible aspect. It was so bad that, after being shocked by its incredibly low quality in e-e-r-y-h-i-n-g, I laughed more often than any recent comedy, simply because I was fascinated by the crew's courage to publish such an extraordinary film strip. Good thing for Lambert, he was in Highlander: Endgame a year later, so he can be forgiven. ; ^ O <br /> Anyway, I recommend watching this movie to everyone. In the end, we really enjoyed watching: ^ D. I guarantee you, after looking completely at Resurrection (be brave, can you do it!), You will worship the level of acting in any given daily soap. <br /> <br /> Just go once to a high lander ... that's what I'm going to do.
