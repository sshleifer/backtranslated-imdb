Leonard Nimoy director Star Trek III, who was not half bad. Perhaps William Shatner thought Nimoy had done so. After watching this movie, he had to reverse that decision. <br /> <br /> Star Trek V The final border is the worst in the series. The actions of everyone involved and such include Shatner and Nimoy are bad and washed out and make them look like old ones as they are in real life. The special effects are tough as when Spock Kirk had to save on a jetpack when he dropped off the mountain. <br /> <br /> The attempts at humor were unfortunate and the story is so terrible that it should not be thought about what basically a Vulcan is stealing the Enterprise to find God (seriously). I just didn't do it. Take care of any of this movie and oh not to speak Uhura does a belly dance to derive male guards. She seemed to have participated in a grandmother's competition. If they meant to make her look sexy. They were wrong. She looked big-eyed. <br /> <br /> How it came on production or even written ... well, it won't consider it. The only place that is good for this movie is in the garbage. Worst of the series.
