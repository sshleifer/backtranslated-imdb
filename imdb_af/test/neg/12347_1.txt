A friend and I went to see this movie. We have opposite opinions about Fujimori, but after we watched this movie, we agree on the following: the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to make a foreign country where you were not present when the events happened don't have, how talented or how much you invest in the movie. If you are really looking for a different history from another country, look at what has been made of that country's inhabitants, or you will not be able to walk away from your bubble. And those who try to force their views and opinions on something they don't belong to really abuse their power. To make matters worse, the director decided not to talk about the embarrassment of the CIA with Fujimori's regime. She decides to evade to deal with the only subject for witch who explains her country much to Peruvian. But it's not surprising, because both the director and the CIA violate Peru's sovereignty by naturally influencing the democratic processes at many different levels. <br /> <br /> If the director is really interested in helping Peru, she would have funded a native to make the documentary. In any case, there are many Peruvian documentaries, films and books on the subject. These include "Ojos Que No Ven", "Dias de Santiago", "Montesinos-Fujimori: Las Dos Caras de la Misma Moneda", "Montesinos: Poderoso Caballero" etc. The director of the "Fall of Fujimori" should spend her time analyzing the many problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the affairs of other nations.
