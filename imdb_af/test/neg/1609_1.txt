I begin by acknowledging that I tend to enjoy really active movies (military or other). I'm an old man. But this drink was terrible. I saw it for free, showtime or hbo and still feel I paid too much. It was a long episode of general hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1, just because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. How or why 59 others would give a score of between 5 and 6 boggles. Unless they are all relatives of the cast or crew. <br /> <br /> It may be, this movie was so bad, many ran out ....... and so it was too hard to bother. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Repeating, but the 10-line minimum seems stupid because it basically comes down to a warning ......... hoping to get the other 2 hour to save black hole, represents this movie. Believe me, staring at an empty wall, they will be more action.
