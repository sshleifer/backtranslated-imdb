You just can't touch NRFPTP! The new crop is just terrible. The jokes aren't funny. Some of the troops make me stop watching TV all together. Lorne - you let your creation go in the toilet. The guests are sometimes good, the tires are mostly rubbish. Weekend update, Seth must tell the audience when to laugh ..... Seth will get a proper reception in a Baghdad cafe ... Make sure Andy goes with him ... The show has about 10 jokes in everyone and they just keep it over and over. Even the segments that are of course not funny. Criminals have become the name of the game, but they can't do it right. Just offensive. I'm so disappointed with what happened at the show, but now I know it's safe to go out on Saturday night!
