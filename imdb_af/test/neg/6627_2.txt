Or at least compulsory retirement! This movie is horrible, terrible, terrible, rank, rotten, uncomfortable ... well, you get the idea. Under these circumstances, do not take care of this rotten rubbish rubbish unless you have a death visit, as it is certain you must kill yourself. (I just survived because I missed the first half hour.) Carrot Top is a bad comedian, and an even worse actor. I can't believe he has someone to fund this huge waste of time and money. It just goes to show that some people haven't crawled when they think they can make a goat or two (literally ... I can't think it made more than $ 2!). <br /> <br /> And please tell me what possible motivation Courtney Thorne Smith (a half-way actress, definitely above) has to miss out on this bumpy hop. Was she bored during the 3.5 second dry game between Melrose Place and Ally McBeal? Or does she owe a kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet (aka root leaf)? <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10, and it's probably too high. I try to save my '1's for movies that make me vomit, and since I haven't seen all of this, my stomach contents happily contained it. I don't think I'll look it up again to find out if it's really a 1 worth!
