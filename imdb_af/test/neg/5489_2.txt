'Illuminata' extended the boundaries of John Turturro's mediocrity from the second-rate actor to the third course director, writer and producer. This movie was terrible. It is incompatible and flashes from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main story. <br /> <br /> We are served with a smorgasbord of fragmented scenes, each a non-sequitur for all others. The only thread they see is that they occur in the lives of members of the same theater repertoire company. The few scenes that are important to the plot are so complicated that you often can't know if the dialogue is out of the story or that the actors are performing their lines for the play in the story. <br /> <br /> If this story were a person, it would be a schizophrenia with a multi-personality disorder. It cannot decide whether it was a drama, a romance, a comedy, a tragedy, a sex farce or a parody of the theater. Turturro was lifeless and untouchable like Tuccio, presumably a complex and passionate writer whose play gets its chance when the current performance has to be canceled because of the main actor's illness. Susan Sarandon performed well as aging actress Tuccio tried to seduce for a role. Unfortunately, she found it necessary to go topless, which only illustrates that the hardware of obsolete family symbols is much better left to the imagination. Christoher Walkin delivered a stunning performance as the acting theater critic who makes passionate treaties to a member of the cast. Beverly D'Angelo and Ben Gazzara also had small roles. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2. Unlike Walken's vignette, there is really not much to recommend it, except that the dolls used in opening and closing Credits were phenomenally lifelike and beautiful. Avoid this movie like the plague it is. <br /> <br />
