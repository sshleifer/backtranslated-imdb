I watched the sci-fi channel when this steamy stack scratched. While it's not as bad as Wynorski's "Curse of the Komodo", it still sucks ... BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in the "curse of the Komodo", as well as the same actors and homes. The effects are also (surprising), but that's about it ........ I don't know what to say about this movie ....... o yeah! As in the "curse of the Komodo" the government becomes involved and decides to bomb the island! Also .... when I saw this part, I laughed hysterically ... A KOMANBRA !!! (partman, komodo and cobra!). Overall, this movie is completely crap, even on bad movie standards. Just remember if Jim Wynorski has nothing to do with a movie .... Steer clear .... To avoid falling asleep, repeat. "It's almost over. It's almost over ...". 0 out of 5.
