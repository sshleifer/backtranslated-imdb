The only reason there is a question mark in brackets is NOT because I have not seen all the movies released in 2001 until now. This is because this film was first made ONLY in 2001. The rest was stolen from Roger Corman's OTHER dinosaur films, Carnosaur 1-3. <br /> <br /> I have a confession to make. "Carnosaur 2" may be one of my favorite B-movies. It borrows so much from James Cameron's "Aliens", it's not even funny. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It just works for me. I like the sets, I like cinematography, I like how they borrowed from "Aliens". It's a little ironic that at one stage Cameron was a suppression of Corman's, with films such as 'Battle Beyond the Stars' (1980). <br /> <br /> I own the Carnosaur trilogy on DVD and the most I can say for part one is that it has moments. Most of what I can say to the third is that it took me five years to find it. <br /> <br /> Now we have 'Raptor', which doesn't continue that series. Instead, it borrows ALL scenes from the Carnosaur Trilogy and builds a movie around it. And somehow Roger Corman could get Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen to do this. Now I'm not saying Roberts or Bernsen is high on any kind of career. But they were both at one point called RESPECTABLE actors. Not here. Certainly, actors respond to effects they won't even see while filming all the time. Here, however, they respond to mismatched footage from films that are between five and eight years old. There is even a sheriff whose costume is modeled directly on Carnosaur 1 characters. Apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back. <br /> <br /> When "Raptor" was announced, I was a little excited. However, I was disappointed when Corman said they would use the old "Carnosaur" dinosaur models. Apparently, Corman decides after this interview was conducted that he wouldn't even do it. And it's not that he couldn't find an FX crew to do it. The writing for this is clearly written taking into account the fact that the story had to be built over existing stock images. <br /> <br /> Don't compare it to Ed Wood. Ed did better than that. At least he used the Bela stock exchange once, in one movie. There are ways to incorporate stock footage into a movie, and "Raptor" takes this cutting edge technique to new layers. Even if you like Carnosaur 3: Primal Species, stay away from "Raptor."
