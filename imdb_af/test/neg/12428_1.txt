OMG, another bad movie by Larry Buchanan. That guy didn't learn to stop, did he? First, he gives us zero budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead people, and now he makes the Loch Ness monster extremely bad. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is basically about some of the southern US states that they are camping Scotland at Loch Ness. Unfortunately, from the fish hole, oops, I mean Loch Ness Lake, there's a killer inflatable monster that mutilates itself to be Nessie, and gets out of the way to kill people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the crew of MST3K has never heard of this movie. Yes, it's also bad.
