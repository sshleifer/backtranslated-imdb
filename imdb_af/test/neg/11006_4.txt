Director John Madden, from Shakespeare in Love Fame, gives us another nice movie in Ethan Frome. The plot is centered around a new pastor who comes to Starkfield town where he learns the story of the local cripple Ethan Frome's sick wife and once-off romantic darling with the girl. Adapted by Richard Nelson of Pulitzer's award-winning writer Edith Wharton's novel, this film is no less interesting, thanks to an abysmally poor writing and poor direction that despises screens that are supposed to be in spectacular imagination. There are other aspects of the film that is working - the movie is well done, Rachel Portman adds to a great score, and Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan don't work well. their roles. But in general, Ethan Frome is perhaps worth the effort and is easily forgotten.
