This film revival march in a bad movie industry and Saudi Arabia, I want to know how the director for people of the industry can stand after making this film, work was so bad, we don't know how cinema Saudi companies like Rutana and others do not support yang movie makers in CSA like UAE. We hope in the future to make a prosperous film industry in Saudi Arabia. But without such intervention. Fool traders and idiots make our bad movies do not pull out the reputation of the cinema in Saudi Arabia. is like the Roman and Iranian theater. At the same time, you make simple experimental theater in Saudi Arabia like Abdullah alayaf And others to reach the dream of a good film industry to participate in festivals world away from the big companies interventions stupid
