they (dueringer, dorfer) are good uprising comedians, young, not ugly, have money, the girls like them, the audience appreciates it all and <br /> <br /> and then they made this movie. <br /> <br /> No story, some jokes were old in the fifties, the acting is terrible. Save your money for something useful, like a gift for your girlfriend.
