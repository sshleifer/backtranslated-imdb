The main issues of 'Saw' relate to the tremendous writing errors that only an uncritical spectator will prevent. The main question is what is the purpose of the killer in his light in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killer's goal is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he likes to play with other people's lives and control their fears and deviations. So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters? A Big Improbability: Can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even breathing not to be discovered by two men in the same room? It is no use at all, except to be the final (d) effect of the movie. The killer always seems to have control along the plot and if it is like a dead body, it cannot be. Finally, it doesn't work. The right place for the murderer had to be a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow (the male nurse), but not the floor of the white room. The director should not have shown the murderer's face and perhaps the place where he was hidden. Then the movie would be a very good excitement. Saw, however, is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please come back.
