Seriously ... I'm surprised at all the good feedback this show has here. All we have in this show are two stupid kids who still do a nasty laugh and they do OOCIAL funny things just like ... 2 of the shows, while most of the others sucked ... like them then comment deliver on music videos I can't stand personally while they either love or love. <br /> <br /> In most episodes, the only things you will hear are the reaction: "Let's score with a few chicks", or "I'll kick your ass beavis" or the better but overall and common quotes "it was cool," and above all, their annoying laughs. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park, this show is just not the time or energy it takes to watch this horrible MTV show of truth , was not.
