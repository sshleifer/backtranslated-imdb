In 1976 there was no reason other than to keep the set of dressers busy, "The Box" was directed by Richard Kelly ("Donnie Darko"), and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple which is supposedly struggling financially although they both have successful careers - she as a high school teacher, as an optical specialist at NASA's Langley, Virginia, Research Center. They have one child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). <br /> <br /> One day, Lewises found a packet on their doorstep, with a black box with a big red button. There is a note from a "Mr. Steward 'indicating that he will return at 17:00 to explain the box. <br /> <br /> The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, shows at the set time, nagily in an elegant Savile Row suit. He is polite, but businesslike, but his most notable feature is his face, half of which proved to be inappropriate and unduly attended. Langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie, but unfortunately he is set up by his own makeup. It looks like Harvey 'Two Face's Dent (Aaron Eckhart) from Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight." It's like the elephant in the room: One can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distracting. <br /> <br /> Steward explains that he will return within 24 hours to collect the button. If they decided to unlock and push the button during that time, he would give them $ 1 million cash. The only catch - and that is a great one - is that somewhere a stranger will die. It may be over the town, it may be on another continent, but Steward assures them that the victim will be unknown. As a proof of good faith, he leaves them with a sharp $ 100 account, to keep them pushing the button or not. <br /> <br /> Arthur and Norma are skeptical, and believe the whole thing to be a scam or an extended hoax, but it's not long before they start wondering what will happen if they press the button? Will they really get a million dollars? Will anyone really die? Tired of speculation, Norma hit the button. Nothing happens. However, their initial relief gives the opportunity to alarm when Steward appears the next day with a briefcase full of cash. They decide to call the whole thing, but Steward tells them it's too late. "You already pressed the button," he explains. As Steward's limo moves away, Arthur marks the license number, which he later discovered, was registered with the NSA (National Security Agency). <br /> <br /> At this stage, the film begins deep in unfinished territory as the secondary characters begin to blow nose and flashing peace sign. Meanwhile, the town is being penetrated by grim, slack-jawed geeks in bad shirts that Arthur begins to follow as a game party for a zombie-alien nerd race. Arthur is finally caught up by the impending bookworms in the library (?) Where Steward's female wife arrives - who we haven't seen so far - and informs Arthur that he is coming out of the library, must step into one of three vertical columns of cheese-like digital water effects. "What happens if I choose the wrong one?" Ask Arthur, who seems to be less oppressed than he should be under the circumstances, and certainly far less bewildered than the audience. 'Eternal damnation', the spider says ominously. <br /> <br /> Arthur rises in the middle column of digital liquid effects, and after a short absence suddenly comes in his watercocon, which moves over Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble blows and Arthur tumbles into a water drop on the bed, which, oddly enough, still drips from the overhead water pipes just outside the room range while a healthy Marsden and Diaz flop around the bed. <br /> <br /> It's confusing, I know. <br /> <br /> Finally, we learned that Steward once was the public relations officer for the NSA until he was hit by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face. He was declared dead, but later returned to life, transformed into a kind of superman who now serves those who lighten and whose powers enabled him to take over the CIA, the NSA and NASA. by himself. <br /> <br /> And what is the point of all this nonsense rubbish? Apparently, Steward's mission is to subject people to some kind of Biblical character test (eg, the "Binding of Isaac") to determine whether humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, Steward's divine survivors will save the race. Unfortunately, those who push the button, such as Norma and Arthur, must be punished for their moral spinelessness, to what end they are subjected to a series of sad 'Lady of the Tiger' trials that spell out as one of those 'Saw movies,' except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> 'The Box' represents the kind of unrelenting spiritual masturbation after which the freshman philosophy of the students remains to a few beers. Richard Kelly's boring exercise in existentialist pettifoggery eventually falls under the weight of his own incomprehensibility; The tortured blend of indisputable ideas eventually comes together as if mixing too many colors into a winding gray goo of a movie as indifferent as one of the narcotic in-flight movies, the plot of which is no more or less There is a point in 'The Box' where Arthur, a technically sensible man, becomes curious about how the button works. He opened the unit. He is disappointed to find nothing. <br /> <br /> After seeing the box, I know exactly how he feels.
