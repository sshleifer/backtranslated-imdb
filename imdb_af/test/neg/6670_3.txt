As I write it, Norman Wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours and screams old catches at his increasingly suicide nurse. <br /> <br /> Indeed, by the time you read it, you will probably have joined the afterlife and the death toll will take up a close 80-year-old career of hysterical joyful funster with the curvy checkered cap. What most of these obituaries will not remind is how Norman Wisdom committed suicide in the 1960s with this exaggerated, yet strangely compelling, background to his film career in the late 1960s. <br /> <br /> The signs are ominous from the down "Tony Tenser Presents" goes the titles. You scratch your head? "Where did I see that name before?" Well, on the titles of many cheapest, crappiest British movies of the 1970s, just take your pick. <br /> <br /> Then say it ?? "A Menahem Golan Production". Oh, dear. <br /> <br /> What I found out is a combination of Confessions from a Holiday Camp and Last Tango in Paris. Sponsored by the Southport Tourist Board. <br /> <br /> Norman Wisdom is very versatile to be Norman Wisdom (or a variety of such) here. Even in garbage like this, he is never in shape and somehow watches through divorced fingers as he paws and dribbles over a (plainly insane) Sally Geeson. Tony Tenser and Menahem Golan were among them responsible for some real movie horrors, but the bedroom scene in cinematic horror was born again. Sally, Sally plays the role of a lobotomised sex toy very well. <br /> <br /> I wonder if any of the crazy young cats populating this movie's party tones might have thought of themselves "Umm? old Norman + sex + hippies. Get me out of this mess! "I think it was a payday for them. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for The Pretty Things. They probably thought, "Yes, it will do for us what Blow Up has for the Yardbirds" <br /> <br /> And so old Norman's leading man's career ended. Freeze his little balls in Southport. <br /> <br /> I went there once. It was a depressing place.
