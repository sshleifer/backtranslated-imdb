As I was through the channel, I came to a channel 124. It's an urban channel. I saw this movie and decided to try it. I almost became a mass murderer because of this movie. I did home movies and they are Oscar quality compared to this great mass of Dookie. The lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely inexorable. I'd rather look at Star Crystal ....... Holy cow maybe that's not a good example. The main question I have about this movie is ... Was it a moral movie? The reason I ask is because there was one rule where this woman in a wheelchair says, "I would have been another gang statistics." Oh my head is getting hurt. After I heard that line, I went into the kitchen and put out a knife to dare anyone who dared. But a little sense kicked in and I just changed the channel to watch the man with the aphrodisiac. Well, that's all I have to say about this movie. If you want to endure this pain, it continues, but is not recommended for those with short securities or a bad tourette tour
