WARNING ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> God knows I've seen bad movies in my time and this one just makes me angry. It's an insult to people looking for a bad movie. The "story" involves a flight attendant who discovers her boyfriend (heavily acted by otherwise great Robert Wagner) is a murder, thief and just an overall face. After the Concorde took off, he sent guided missiles to destroy the Concorde. So while the Concorde is moving at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with utter stupidity, George Kennedy) opens the window into the cabin and puts his hand out of the window to fire the missile! I'm not a rocket scientist, but it seems his hand will at least get a wind burn. Then in the direction of the final "climax" when the Concorde is heading for a disaster and everyone will die, a passenger turns to his fianc√© and presents the marriage. A priest just happens to be sitting in the next row and continues to marry them as the planes collapse! (I don't make it up). Wow, the man who wrote the script, had to sniff a week for a week.
