I was actually looking forward to this movie. After reading a number of reviews before release, it sounded like a really nice movie, one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting role player (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.) <br /> < Well, that might have been all those things, BUT it is so boring that I almost defend someone to sit down and pay attention to it as a whole. Also, Cage's attempt to speak with an Italian accent is embarrassingly bad. He is such a good actor that I had every time he spoke in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Disappointing" is the most frequently used word used by reviewers to describe this movie, and I totally agree. <br /> <br /> It didn't take long to find out how bad this movie was, because, like Cage's accent, it didn't do well.
