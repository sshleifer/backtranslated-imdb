Usually I like to find old (and some non-old) westerners I haven't seen, to be entertained for the night. It's such a great way to sit back, relax and escape politics and world problems for a few hours. But this was not the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven. The decisive and storyline of this series now follows the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment. Good old, fair, revisionist history, where the bad guys are all white, masculine, confederate (in this case) and preferably Christian (if it can somehow be worked in writing). It's sad, really. The best movies there are now and have always talked about a good story on the big screen - not about sending someone's political ideology.
