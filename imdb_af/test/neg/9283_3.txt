Anthony Wong stars in both this and the original (far superior) Untold Story, but the deals stop there. Of course, Wong does not repeat his role, and rather plays a clumsy policeman who is involved in a fairly suspicious woman, Fung (1994's Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun). But her wife jealously "wants to be with a man who is with a girl" murderer is not as close as compelling as Wong played in the first one. The movie itself seems tired and by the numbers. Yeung Fan, as the physcho's love interest's unfaithful girl tries to keep one of total boredom by ironing when possible, and Sun has a nice hole, but even that can't save the dud. <br /> <br /> May Degree: D <br /> May / May DVD Extra: Subtitled interviews with Cheung Kam Ching & Paulyn Sun; Anthony Wong filmography; a very brief summary; Theater trailer for the movie; & trailers for "Chinese Erotic Ghost Story" and "Twenty Something"
