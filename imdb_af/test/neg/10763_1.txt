I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. The special effects are not worthy of a grade school production. A toy boat that represents a truck moves at speed boat speed on flat water while the wind is floating in the opposite direction. The red and blue floodlights add that extra dramatic touch. Which cabinet Vincent Price was supposed to bring as a narrator is completely overshadowed by terrible production work. To call it a documentary is to call Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes into it something got me so funny. Perhaps it was Price's excessive dramatic intonation of the often used line. "They disappeared into the devil's triangle! [After I started laughing, my friends went together. Next time Vinny said the critical line, someone shouted in the back:" Okay! "Then it almost made as much laughter as" A Marx Brothers movie, no-one remained for the terribly serious second feature "Gods trucks".
