I mean, come on! This movie has such a good potential, but it's like they ran out of money to complete the screenplay and just telegraph the entire damn rest of the movie over 2/3 of the way. Characters start spraying these movies the whole reason for the existence of other characters who have not asked for the information on extremely poor sites. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior, as it should be what is expected in this movie's genre. It's really pretty sad, because this movie could have been so much more. <br /> <br /> I really hope it will be a great movie. There were some good plays. Mark Hamill does an excellent job until the movie falls apart, including Sally Struthers. It was nice to see them work and make them successful. Majandra Delfino was a good while, until her lines just became untenable. I felt sad for her that she had to say these lines that made the whole movie credible to any thinking movie-goers. Brad Hunt does a great job. He really has a surprising variety of talent judging by some of his recent movies, Lucky 13. (which was a piece of crap). This guy can be a star if he can choose the right scripts and be happy with the right director. <br /> <br /> Almost forgot! The music was so heavily handed that you might think this project was handed over to a minor film school to be achieved. I call this kind of music "Teller Music" because you can only tell what comes next, based on the music. Less is sometimes more. <br /> <br /> Cut half the music from this movie, get a good movie editor, rewrite a little or two and it'll be a great movie.
