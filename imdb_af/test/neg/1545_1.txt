The worst movie ever made has delivered nothing. Give yourself a bang on the back if you can possibly sit through every painful painful minute of it. Except for the bit where the hard-happy loser turned the psychopath of forced medical experiments, she threw pea soup on the doctor's head and laughed like any good, scary ... this is all.
