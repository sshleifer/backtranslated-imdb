I won't even comment on what piece of garbage this movie is, as it's already fixed. However, when I look at my friends, we all laughed aloud as the head girl made a Shelley Hack referral while on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her in the mix. We can only assume he had a Charlie's Angels fixation at one time. Based on this reference, we suppose this film should be made around her Charlie's Angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what I read here, it was made around 1987. Surely you can't tell it about the poor production values. It seems to have been made by a college student for a film class. And although I don't expect a low-budget trash like this to be politically correct, the rednecks in this movie really made a deviant gay comment. Still, I will still only make it as the 2nd worst horror movie ever, the second only for "Nail Gun Massacre."
