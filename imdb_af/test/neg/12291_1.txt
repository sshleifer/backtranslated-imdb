I'm sorry, but I can't understand what people smoke when they wrote how well they thought "Ethan Mao" was. I saw better acting, character and plot development in porn! WARNING: I am going to give away an important element to the "plot". After Ethan kept his family last night, Ethan let his dirty, evil, hated, stepmother go to the bank - ONLY !!! - to get back the piece of his mother's jewelry he wants so desperately. Guess what? She calls the police! Wow ... what a twist! I couldn't see it at all. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Pure, untouched litter!
