*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I read a bit on Dahmer and saw the new Dahmer movie (of the same name) earlier. This film concentrates heavily on the victims and murders, too little on Dahmer himself. The film called "Dahmer" had the opposite problem, it was too little about its crimes and too much about itself. <br /> <br /> I didn't find the play to my satisfaction, it also felt a certain amateur, especially the probation officer. It also seemed as if the Dahmer play had grown worse every time he played against the probationary actor. But this can be wrong for me. <br /> <br /> What irritated me was that some of the screens were very disturbing, but the filmmakers were trying to show the "real work" about what he did. It's okay - but what I don't understand is why the man who ran away from his apartment while Dahmer didn't have beer wasn't portrayed, because that's how it happened. This is not a big problem, but it only eats on the movie quality that such details are omitted. What was not shown or even really appeared was Dahmers' sexual obsession with death. Again, I don't care, they didn't show it, but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in some way. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think the really good Dahmer movie is still being made, a movie that not only includes Dahmers crimes but also who he was and why he did what he did . I think 1.5 or 2 hours just isn't enough to understand its complexity. This movie was just an excuse (excuse the pun) of Dahmer's life and personality and does not give you a good understanding of his life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
