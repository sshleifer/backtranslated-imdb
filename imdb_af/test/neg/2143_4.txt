Ahem .. I think I'll be the only one to say it, but yes, I was bored lil during the movie. Not to say that this is a bad movie, it is actually a very good attempt to portray the inner emotions - dilemma, sadness, love. This is the director's debut (read somewhere, is it true?). I felt that something was not quite right, maybe it was just me, I was not drawn to the characters to deepen my world. It's a simple story, about ordinary people, ordinary lives. Through simple and short dialogues, the director tries to relate a simple man's life, and how about the news of his illness by laughing each time. Oh yeah, his laugh was kinda cute, but I get it gradually, such a deep sadness roars for a gentle man! I have to say, I didn't feel the impact most readers felt. In fact, I was more affected by the trivial scenarios such as spit of watermelon seeds with his cyst that clearly show they are comfortable with each other, the grandmother who came back for another shot - it's a bit melancholy, the thoughtful gesture to write the procedures for his dad - hmm but that's predictable. Do not misunderstand that I am an action lover. Independent movies are my cup of tea! Perhaps I have only a very high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger images. Some Asian movies worth the watch: <br /> <br /> Tony Takitani (show loneliness). Road cloud (just 1 dialogue). My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (loneliness too) 15 (Gangsters live in local area) Before sunrise and before sunset (I just have to mention it, although they are not Asian movies.) Fans will understand!)
