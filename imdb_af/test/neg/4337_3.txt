Well, here's a very brief review: this movie has been flowering. I wish I could only have a review setting this simple principle, but I have to lead you with more bad review types of words such as "terrible" clich√©d and "unwatchable". It's the type of movie you're watching when you're drunk or stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do. Here's the premise: the vice president is caught by a terrorist group at a play hockey game and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Really terrible, but then I didn't pay to see it for the first time and just my dad felt the absence of perimeter in his wallet to this movie. I hate being a Republican and everything, but then he spared me the horror of paying this garbage. Well, it's enough space to be recognized as a review, so I'm afraid.
