I bought "Rocketship X-M" on DVD in a two-pack with "Destination Moon." Now I see why the distributors did it: no one who ever saw this movie would buy it himself. <br /> <br /> I can't understand which school system the reviewer pointed out, claiming that RXM is big in its predictions of space travel ... "Start straight up and then do a 90 degree right Turn and circle faster and faster until you reach escape speed ... I don't think I remember the Apollo program. Remember, the astronauts must be weightless once they turn off the engines, the gravity changes directions every time they pass through the hatch Go to the engine room, go to the moon, but "missed" it? No problem, it's just a hop-ship-and-a-jump (with a helping hand of divine providence) and you'll be with Mars! And OK, if you want to give life on Mars, given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950, it was a perishable convention for the sake of storytelling, but could you at least make it look like a little stranger? These Martians were right as extras from the cast of "10,000 BC" I can do some scientific e fails, but it will not pass an average second degree. <br /> <br /> And apart from the screaming holes: 12 minutes before launch (as you are constantly reminded by the PA voice saying "X minus so many minutes"), the astronauts are giving a press conference! I think the time crisis is why dr. Eckstrom has not changed his dress and has a tie before he starts in space. And how handy it was, though they were planning to go to the moon and there were print packages for it, they got hikers (and guns) just when they landed on Mars. They are happy to land everywhere, as the method they developed for the landing believes that Dr.E looks out of the window and the pilot (Lloyd Bridges) occasionally tells the gas forces. Note to the designers of the XM-2: How about the pilot's board seat? <br /> <br /> These were the previous remarks about the casual sexism that had the candy. Dr. Lisa (Osa Massen) killed them all by screwing her fuel calculations repeatedly, but it was early in the 50's. She was there to fill her jersey, not a useful feature. <br /> <br /> "Rocketship XM" is remarkable that it is one of the first movies to say "ohmigod we are all going to blow up with this A bombs", but one can watch it that he did not lose such a drink for 77 minutes. By the way, the message might have had a little more impact if there was a bit of money in the budget for the real sets of urban ruins in the city, rather than just carpet paintings. <br /> <br /> I appreciate "good" bad sci-fi, for the unique way the "future" is used, and for the inherent (as deviant) humor you can find when looking back at the naivety of audiences 60 years ago, but this film must have been abusive even then. "Rocketship X-M" is not even suitable for a MST3K style lampoon. Sometimes bad is just ... bad. <br /> <br /> Anyone want to buy a DVD? Only use once, I swear.
