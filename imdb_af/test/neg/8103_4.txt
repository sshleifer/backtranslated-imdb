"Black Dragons" is a second feature of the WWII propaganda film that was popular at the time. It's not as bad as some of you would believe. <br /> <br /> A secret meeting held by the respected dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke) is interrupted by a mysterious unknown name Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly afterwards, the participants of the meeting were killed, their bodies placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) was assigned to the case and met Saunders cousin Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who tried to assist him. The reasons for Colomb's actions are not explained to the final line. Until everything is explained, the story is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, which has been reduced by this time to appear in a range of low budget headlines, is actually pretty good in this one. He was not allowed to do as much as he did and admitted it was going to director William Nigh. Lugosi's character strikes the shadows and reminds of his Dracula even to the tip of the full perimeter of his piercing eyes. <br /> <br /> Clayton Moore, a one-dimensional actor at his best, will be TV's Lone Ranger. a few years. Joan Barclay is a good heroine. <br /> <br /> Although a little dated, "Black Dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour.
