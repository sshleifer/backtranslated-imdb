Clearly influenced by the success of Pal's "Destination Moon" and Lippert's "Rocketship X-M", this one just doesn't make the cut. Limited special effects, a thin story line, lead to a production that can't even save the half-decent throw. Just no credibility here. Nobody is surprised to experience Martians, such as earthly, etc. Etc. Pass it on!
