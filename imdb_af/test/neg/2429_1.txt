It makes me painful to see an amazing movie in a lame, repetitive and lazy series. It's full of plot holes and the plot is confusing, in a BAD way. Whoever was the writers of the slides who decided to make such a big movie in this garbage had to investigate, instead of filling it with one-liners and hollow new characters and the classic jokes of the first movie over and over and over and over WEATHER. Sure, they get a little creative, but it's like seeing the same episode with a little twist. Like listening to Creed, or Nickleback. Kuzco has to prevent himself from failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides the easy way to save time and just use a drink, someone asks the monkey and the mistake. Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she tears him without sounding like a bitch, Yzma shrinks herself as "Prince Amzy" and she calls Kronk and he forgets that she is Yzma. I admit that this performance has the moment. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and Pacha looks .... strange. Also, no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! Their kids who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but I give this show two inches.
