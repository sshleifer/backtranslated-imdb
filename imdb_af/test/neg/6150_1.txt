WHEN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY I remember seeing it as a 16-year-old boy in the theater (see how it painfully clings to memory). Mark Hamill was the older generation of skywalker and was not good at it, he was worse off. Plus a dour soundtrack by Dan Jericho AAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH. There is one movie as bad as what I saw in the cinema Arthur 2 on the rocks. Funny how the question "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" is easier than "what is the best movie?" that varies between Italian Job (original), Untouchables, Casino, Things to do in Denver, Goodfellas (a sense of what I want? - It'll make you foolish!). Find Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge! Please Never Watch this movie or it will remain in your memory!
