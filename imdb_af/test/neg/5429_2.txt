This is one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting, complex and faster through this impressive novel. And about 99.8 percent of what was lost in the movie. Seriously, the script AND the director were terribly and clearly done by people who couldn't understand what was good about the novel. I can't blame the actors because they honestly said, they never had a chance to make this turkey the original work of Crichton. I know good novels, especially those with a science fiction edge, are hard to put on the screen in a way that lives up to the original life. But this can be the absolute worst difference in quality between the novel and the screen customization ever. The book is really good. The movie is just awful.
