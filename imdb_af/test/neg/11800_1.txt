I rented this one by accident. I lifted and watched the video and thought of a shameless Blair Witch rip-off. "Then, in a moment of indifference, I grabbed" The Francisville Experiment "and thought it was something else. come home and realize my mistake, was much more frightening than this movie had to offer, boring characters, bad acting, and a sense of "we saw the Blair Witch Project and can do the same" penetrate into the action up to the point where you look ahead quickly, you will lead straight to the credits, I'm not one of the filmmakers to be lazy or desperate, but after this yawn party I had the need to warn everyone: don't spend your time Don't waste, you have a life.
