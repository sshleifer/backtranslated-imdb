After reading other reviews on this site, we were not sure we could criticize this movie because it didn't sound bad enough. But 2 minutes in the movie, we knew we were in for another flop. No summer is complete without ice, but this movie served a melted, sour, crushed ice cream cone (you know the kind that makes you look sticky and dirty and a wet night). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What was it? It was a psychotic ice cream man who drove around in the area. That's it. Nothing else happens. First of all, what are the qualifications to become an ice cream man in this crap town? 1. Spend a few years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to man. This hospital is plagued with clowns, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers, and excess headaches. 2. Has extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the children away. 3. Make sure your truck is filled with cut body parts, cookies, and don't forget the eyelashes. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie are pure B-movie caliber. Communion with a lot of unknowns, who is different from .... a trailer version of Macaulay Culkin !! Even his sly charm could not save this kick in the pants. There was no rhythm or reason for any of the murders in this movie. The whole concept of the movie reeked! Who would kill an ice cream man in a row by shooting? Gang members? Evil spirits? Vanna White? Who? We are still struggling with this question. <br /> <br /> Whoever was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be listed immediately from Hollywood. Did they honestly think a pillow under a child's shirt would make the audience believe he was really fat? Did they forget about the arms, face, legs and all the other body parts? Secondly, this film was made in 1995, but the wardrobe apparently is selected from a 80-piece lame movie, which is evident from the big brothers' white, cross-hugging high-water pants. While we were watching this shotty production, we both developed serious cases of ADD. We found ourselves leaving the room for purpose. At many points the movie, we found staring at an empty wall behind the T.V. set was more entertaining than the real movie. We were surprised that this movie didn't make it to the Bottom 100. Then we took the tape out of the video recorder and left it on the black top to melt like a sub-standard icing.
