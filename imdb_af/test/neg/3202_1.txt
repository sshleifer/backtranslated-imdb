Didn't the writer for this movie see the other three? I loved the original, I thought 2 was the best, I had 3 patience (it was OK, nothing special). But I hated this one. Who dare to kill UG? It was definitely not the Ug who was almost like Charlie in number 2. Remember his speech? Charlie said, "You won't just leave me on Earth, you will". Ug replied, "Charlie, Bounty Hunter" and said he was now one of them. How dare the authors ignore this special bond between them and turn him into a bath that is murdered by Charlie (in a particularly awkward scene) just because they have noticed the movie is getting boring. In fact, for the first 20 minutes, we get a new role and wait so long until we find out again what happened to Charlie, who was the hero we were waiting to see. I kept waiting and said, "Come on, when will Charlie appear?" Angela Basset should do her best to deny that she was ever in this Turkey. Moving it to the future excludes the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time. I think the authors have decided that their movie will be the last and they can do what they want. This movie is out of line with the first two. And it didn't even seem written by the same people who made 3.3. 3 has at least humor and could easily be seen by younger children. 4 is just ugly and moderate (Eric DaRe) is especially cruel and unnecessary. I hated this movie. Hate, hate, hate it. I hated that anyone could do it and I hated that it had ruined what was one of my favorite camp classrooms. I give it one start, just because IMDb.com doesn't allow me to give it a zero.
