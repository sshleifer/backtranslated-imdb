Most movies are crappy with high production values, this one is without big production values. What sets it apart from the great pool of terrible movies. Just as bad as this movie, I needed to respect Kathryn Aselton, who I believe would be given the correct script, probably a pretty good performance. She plays Emily the girl to the perennial doofus Josh, who often refers to her as "Dude" or "Man" in a non-ironic tone. <br /> <br /> But here Emily is a semi-credible character. which means that Rhett should soon be added to counter this almost credible character against a man who is even more intent on Josh. When we meet Rhett, we learn that he is "deep" because he is busy with a lizard proving that he sees the world "unique". Rhett then shows the band to Emily and in one of Emily's few incredible moments she shows this amateur band of a lizard. WOW, I believe, is how she reacts again without any irony of sarcasm, even slightly implied. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene you are warned that the work of the camera will be open to a shaky proximity to Josh as he attempts to win the viewers by performing GOOFY! Oh, how carefree it is, this is the chief principle, that he will act GOOFY! haha. This movie can almost be a case study in how BAD movies can be (and just how FAR can get bad movies in the ring, I think compared to most power, this movie probably looks pretty awesome). <br /> <br /> I believe SXSW has given this movie a little bit (east south-west, why do they encourage them, it's just cruel). But here's where I compliment this movie, it's the best of the mumblecore movement. Think of all the other mumblecore movies that generally believed and generally included large-scale nudity and incomprehensible bad acting. Yet it is good to be the best of something. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a task yet, but it seems As they might have made some forward, the preview at least made it look patient, where even the Puffy Chair preview didn't really fact can hide that it will suck. I've come down from the subject, anyway, Rhett is probably not portrayed by a professional actor, but Josh is probably not a real actor, but rather the director (or brother of director, there is a few mixed messages there). I think Rhett was somebody buddy and they said why you don't play this guy named Rhett in the movie, the fact that Rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same, unless I'm wrong is what I am not. <br /> <br /> If Rhett shaved the raccoon from his face, you'll probably say he's attractive. So, anyway, Rhett, Emily and Josh brought the Puffy Chair to Rhett and Josh's father. Some things happen along the way, more bad acting, bad supporting actors, crappy camera work, an attempted meaning. This movie would not have been bad if it was not so shameless to seek in-depth self-interest. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is amateurish, if you can watch this movie without paying for it, as if on TV or renting at the library, then consider watching, just to see if you This super cheap style of filmmaking wants. I like what the duplex does, make a movie with no concept, but I wish they would make a movie someone wants to see.
