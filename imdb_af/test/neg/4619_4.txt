It's not a good movie. The movie is cliche driven and in many places it is a copy of the original Carrie. The parallels to the original film are striking, but with a further unlikely event that the telekinetic forces are innate. <br /> <br /> I can't say I didn't like the movie because it took at least a couple of hours ... but it has been successful since one would have a special book on a long train journey reading. That book would not be a good literature but would absorb one for a while and soon be forgotten, as it would interfere with the many other cliche-ridden books. Similarly, the movie was good while it lasted, but it may be forgotten. At least I think it's. I can't remember much!
