This movie maker wanted to make a movie without telling a story - and did it. Really unlikely / inexplicable coincidences and unidentifiable plot lines, all without character or clear motivation. <br /> <br /> We get clich√© snapshots instead of characters. One of the specials is the small and beautiful crime boss who projects an exaggerated "difficult man" person and throws a cartoon-like shadow of intimidation over the really tough guys brought to her. Nothing very surprising to watch in the movie, except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a small suitcase (as in the smallest of a complete US tourist set) in a bright, sky blue, without explanation or excuse. Otherwise, it is visually standard - another exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in CT.
