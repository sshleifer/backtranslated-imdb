Another stinker of the PM Entertainment group, and grateful, one of the last. <br /> <br /> 'Firetrap' is effectively a very low budgeted remake of 'The Towering Inferno' I don't care for Low budget B Movies as long as an effort is being made - there is no attempt at "Firetrap" stars Dean'Superman'Cain, who is an absolutely horrible actor, to be serious, he has all the acting abilities of a pornstar, but he seems to be The best actor here and what says something, the rest is just a bunch of no hope given the boot of several day types. The special FX is just garbage, shots that show the burning building out of the ground are the worst I've ever seen. The fire looks like someone scratching an orange pen in front of the camera. In addition, there is not one character that you actually root. You hate everyone and hope they all do well before the 90 minutes are up. <br /> <br /> The writing is embarrassing. The red herring is well-marked ahead, someone else called it, but "The scene where the officer defeats a burning fire devouring the building with its best ... hilarious, or the same caretaker goes to a room labeled" Dangerous Material, were these scenes supposed to be tongue-in-the-pick? somehow I doubt it <br /> <br /> The one good point and just one good point was that there was a fair bit of action in the day soap drama that kept my attention but so little care was given to everything in the movie, I can't recommend it - See 'The Towering Inferno' instead <br /> <br /> 3/10
