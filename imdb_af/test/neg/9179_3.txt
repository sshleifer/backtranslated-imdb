Fred Williamson, one of two or three top blowing stars. Cynthia Rothrock, one of two or three American best action stars. Imagine a movie with these two for the first time! Imagine now the WORST film that may be compiled for the first time with these two. Welcome to "Night Vision". Of course this film was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime, but that didn't mean they didn't need it anymore - they just needed the help of good writing and direction. They also didn't come here. Rothrock gets some kicks near the end, but this movie is so horrible that you probably won't wake up to see them. (*)
