Of all the great reviews we couldn't wait to see this show. We love humor and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand. <br /> <br /> I admit it may not be a fair review as we first saw the first 15 minutes. But we just couldn't bear misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever had to watch a TV show. It felt like 15 hours. The songs may be (lightly) interesting, but they place for an unlimited 3 minutes in the middle of a story scene. It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> We're trying hard to clear the memory. If you want a wonderful under-temper in a delicious and entertaining movie, you'd rather see the dish.
