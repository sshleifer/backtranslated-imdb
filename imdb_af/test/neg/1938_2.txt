I didn't watch every jackass episode. It was generously entertaining if nothing else went on. But after watching Jackass # 2, I loved Bam and Dunn. They had a nice attitude in the movie jackass, so I thought I'd vote on viva la Bam. Son I was wrong. Seriously, you can link a lot of 2's, provide them with the same budget and bet they can beat something more creative on the screen. I mean, C'Mon MTV !! At 23 where most people agreed, we give us this garbage. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so forced. You don't know the characters, because there is no attitude at all. You can't appreciate Bam or Dunn, or anyone for that matter. If only a little thought would be. Anything we won't forget as soon as the next shot goes on. <br /> <br /> Eventually they managed to create a good shot and you like what is going on. You sit there, just wait for their response, and then some snatch the screens with two lame sentences and popping. Was it the proximity to that shot or what, please? If I had been there, I would explain and laugh. Do crazy things and let my adrenaline pump, but these guys ... just wrote stupid reactions. <br /> <br /> Yes, they get some chuckles from the audience through cheap brutal jokes, or giant jokes that I think are. such a waste of cash. <br /> <br /> Many normal people who have not been taken under the Jackass wing can write a much smarter script in a heartbeat. Or impress with visual camera work. Even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script will get a better job. MTV can in some way bring more soothing material to the screen. You just have to burn the author of this dumb show. <br /> <br /> Some scenes actually require a little courage and therefore 2 stars.
