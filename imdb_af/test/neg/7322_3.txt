This film makes as much sense as an 'Ozzie & Harriet' or a 'Father Knows Best' episode. An old copy of Reader's Digest (about 1962) will give more insight into modern life, or the relationship between a father and a daughter, than this strange conspiracy. <br /> <br /> I was surprised with Diane Keaton. She slept through the movie. (Given the title of the movie, I realize hair was a supporting role, but even Martin Short had a clear supportive character.) <br /> <br /> a good romantic comedy is understood. But this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world. I'm afraid to think that anyone can even enjoy it as pure fantasy.
