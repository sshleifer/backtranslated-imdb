I like vampire movies, I like B movies, I love B vampire movies. But this one has virtually nothing going for it. Some of the plays are terrible, especially by 3 of the male leaders. The story is not particularly interesting. At a relatively short 88 minutes it still looks too long and you will find it fast. There are a large number of kung-fu vampire attacks. Sounds cool? This is not when done on a low budget. It repeats very quickly. There are some small blood and gore, nothing to get excited about. There is good wire work where you can see the wires. There are some good provinces filmed in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> Not worth the rent
