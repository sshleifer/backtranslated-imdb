So I wonder while watching this movie, the producers of this movie have been donated to Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by her "front" clothes from Miss. Extend Congeniality? The Mrs. Bullock also slept through the role by channeling the "front" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have mentioned before, the film is very formative. In addition, the deja vu viewer with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and quickly becomes a snooze festival. <br /> <br /> The two bad boy serial killers were previously done. (and better) in other movies. As the "good old man tries to protect his spouse, despite the evidence", the character has seen before. In fact, none of the characters in the film ever get more than two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes. <br /> <br /> One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Killing one person - even if it is a pre-reported murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer, but you are not a serial killer or even a tramp.
