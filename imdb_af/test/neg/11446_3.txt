This movie really made me think ... but not about the plot, the direction, the characters, an underlying message or a clever writing. Far from it. I left and wondered what went wrong in Sam Hill behind the scenes. It was clear that something was bad from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the positive comments for the movie and for Jodie Foster's performance. From the beginning it was clear that Foster called this one. An earlier comment even made a favorable mention of her facial expressions. I had to watch another movie, since me. Foster (usually a personal favorite) was totally uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward looks as if he is also distracted by her lack of energy and struggles to make his own lines with any enthusiasm. By the time he was encouraged to participate in a so-called desperate search for a runaway Foster, it also seemed that Ward had become embarrassed half-heartedly about the project. <br /> <br /> I think Dennis Hopper is always a uni-dimensional artist, so I didn't expect much from him ... and he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this one reminded me long after it ended. The fact that Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen declined to attach their names to the project indicates that it is a real stinker for everyone involved. But then to learn that the Director prefers to hide behind a pseudonym, volumes speak. <br /> <br /> But why do I listen to me? I always think Foster looks ridiculous in a dress, but she is sensational in lacy underwear.
