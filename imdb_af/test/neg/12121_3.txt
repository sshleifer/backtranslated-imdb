Unfortunately, a boring movie and, of course, the only way to see it, is the massacre bootleg public domain version, which is so vague and dark that you sometimes find it difficult to know where the screen is. The leading actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his screen-time to look nonchalant, charming and sexy, completely forgot about the movie and being a murder suspect because of a lady who played for a goose. The woman herself just walks through the movie, worthy if she isn't looking cute. It's a bit of hard written stuff, never interesting or spiritual. No good camera work, no memorable soundtrack, no glamorous actresses or atmospheric sets. It just scratches the surface of the genre, and nothing happens if you miss this completely missing flip.
