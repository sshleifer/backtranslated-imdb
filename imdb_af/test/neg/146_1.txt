Exceptionally stupid actor with brainedad leads in a story that would suit Spiderman's fill-in problem. The action ranges never really flow as they belong, and leave a few cool pieces of orphans in a sea of ​​sound and anger, meaning nothing. I really wonder how they will release this one in the West. Sam Lee persuades like crazy, newcomer Edison Chan doesn't show any acting yet. The robot is clunky and not very impressive, and the CGI effects (though done by American sfx people) are ridiculous and destroy the remaining suspension of unbelief. I'm NOT looking forward to Gen-Z Cops ...
