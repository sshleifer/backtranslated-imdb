Many flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, very beautiful sets. I don't think the plot supported such a huge expense. The story could tell much more effectively and was more valid, psychologically if not so many macho bombs in the production. Chinese movies tend to be so, in my experience. And I think it detracts from the movie.
