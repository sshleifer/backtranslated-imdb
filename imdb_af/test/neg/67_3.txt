A very bad movie, with very few good moments or qualities. <br /> <br /> It starts with pregnant Linda Blair, who walks in a flight to flush monsters or people with explosives, I'm not sure. She jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant. The degree in which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She and an annoying and possibly delayed boy I thought were her son to a deserted hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most annoying little boys to put their movies in! On the island are David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin (you know how Germans are told to love Hasselhoff ...). He takes photographs, and she translates an esoteric German book on witches. I think too. <br /> <br /> Also on the island is an older couple who bought it, and a broker and a woman I thought were their daughter. She was apparently an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple's children. I think they all traveled to the island together, but it really looks like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately). The hotel looks neat, certainly from the exteriors, but it is not accustomed to any great effect. An old woman in a bad make-up and a black cloak sometimes holds on to the boy and sometimes sniffs something into German, which he eventually records on his Sesame Street recorder. <br /> <br /> People start dying, or in their dreams, or in hell or sucking in. Some of these gore screens are OK, but not enough to recommend the movie. Although the copy I watched, it is unprotected on the box cover, it seems as if the death of one character whose veins are exploding has clipped. Much of the scene shows another character's reaction shots, as we see nothing at all. The creepiest scene is one in which a man or devil rapes someone with a very messy mouth wound. He looks particularly nasty. There is a laughing and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is owned. I wish a horror movie was going to throw her, they'll do something original with her role, and let her exorcist leave behind (except for the annual horror conventions). In the weird, largely Italian tradition of claiming it is a sequel to something unrelated to it, it is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. This is probably a successor to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La ( 1988) - this is also not a better movie than this one). La Casa 1 and 2 were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again not related to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than that). There is also a Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5, which appears to be a sequel to the false La Casa series and the series House: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III, and House IV (1992). How does the horror show fit in there? It doesn't really mean it's a successor, and therefore requires the right series entry to rename itself to cause less (or more?) Confusion. Strange, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Is your head still hurting?
