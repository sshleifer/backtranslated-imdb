It was a mish mash of a movie that started nowhere, lost on the road and suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character was set FINAL. There were so many ugly, hooded guys in this movie, I had the track of who the owner was and who was the supervisor. However, I have a theory about the casting; All the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and one ugly actress) and all the good guys / victims were played by beautiful actors. Indeed, the actors who played the ultimate victims, the slaves, were beautiful as the innocent priest's daughter, while the plantation owner, his minipulative mistress, and his invigilators were quite difficult to spot. On purpose? You make the call. <br /> <br /> I hung there to the end, and some others could do it too. If you just want to look at naked breasts, there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave / master fetish, you will love this movie. Otherwise, look it once, braai, shower and never talk to anyone.
