A few men are destroyed on a remote island. They are then caught by a bad score living there with a small group of servants; while the pit of the castle lives the unfortunate woman of the count. <br /> <br /> The Dungeon of Harrow is almost a hack of a movie. The amateur actors all drag through the movie while an annoying persistent score is constantly playing in the background. The different pieces of action are all filmed in an incredibly irregular way; In fact, the film is generally deadly. It just seems to be dressing. And even if the end is not bad, you will be difficult to care for at that stage. As an example of 60's Gothic horror, this is an example of a basement cellar. Unfortunately, I can't really recommend this one.
