One of the worst movies ever made. If you can go through these movies without falling asleep, you are doing pretty well, since no matter how difficult you reach the volume you can't hear what the 'actors' (?) Are not saying and if you can see what's going on from the horrible movie (I mean hell if you can't find anything that works better ... use a home camera camara ... at least you can probably do it!) <br /> < br /> It's beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slide through the cracks, and escape on video ... and beyond. how do people who make it know how terrible it is? good god ... (!) <br /> <br /> Having just told you ... If you're waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of garbage film, there's nothing to tell . .. A group of campers on motorcycles are lost in the bush and a lot of people are terrorizing them ... or something about it ... what is more such an action movie than an abomination ... this movie? NO interest ... I f someone likes to find what I literally feel for you. <br /> <br /> Absolute Trash ... won't even rent one of those cheap funny movies. 'Plan 9 From Outerspace' and has a ball
