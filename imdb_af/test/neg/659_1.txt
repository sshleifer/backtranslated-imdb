The Cheesiest movie I've ever seen, Not scary, just bad. The first film made by the WWE and trusted by me is the only person that this movie can appeal, wrestlers. It has terrible acting and the worst directing I've ever seen. I laughed at the storyline and the bad actors. I saw that the WWE people tried very hard to kill many of the wrestling movements and various camera effects. I think they copied a lot of quiet Hill. This movie isn't involved either, so if you see it, you'll find yourself tuning out because it's a lack of Suspense. The end is the worst, no matter what you will get to get your money back
