I saw this movie just because Sophie Marceau. But her acting abilities are not enough to anoint this movie. Almost all role-players do not play their character, except for Sophie and Frederic. The plot could give a better movie if the right pieces were in the right places. I saw several good French movies, but I don't like this one.
