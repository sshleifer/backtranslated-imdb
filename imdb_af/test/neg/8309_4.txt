I'm from Texas, so I thought I knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. When she was on the screen, I couldn't concentrate anything but her hair. Take about stage presence! There were also many people with hearing problems in this movie. There was a traffic guard who wrote out a parking ticket, which somehow did not see the owner screaming at the car shouting on his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a man in a phone box who could not hear a giant bulldozer until it was five meters further. All the hits in this movie were a little deaf, no one had to sneak up on them. The one-handed "hero" of this movie was so clever and ineffective that it was funny. The bar battle was pretty funny. There is a valuable scene where the hero and his girlfriend only had sex and judged their expressions, it was not good for either. It made me laugh out loud. This movie is set on the 50 Movie Pack Martial Arts set if you want to see very bad movies (with some decent kids).
