I'm sorry, but they left the impression that these commandos had previously fought zombies. But they probably weren't doing as they even saw a zombie. Jump and turn their backs on them like amateurs. Secondly, the characters are written fairly poorly. The actors did the best they could with what was given, I give bad writing and bad direction. Lastly and here is where the spoiler warnings are the highest. They lose the monster twice and the girl Jennifer Holland does not know if she is little or not. How stupid is that? As much as it gets hurt to be bitten, one will think you will know, plus a void of blood leaking out of your body is a good idea. Dumb, the first movie made it a mistake, but it has a revival, unlike the disaster of a movie I could hardly find once. I give the house of death 2: NO GUTS, ALL STOMIDITY THE CRAP-O-LANTERN
