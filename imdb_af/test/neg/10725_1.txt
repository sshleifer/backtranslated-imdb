A satire about greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes that they try to make pathetic. Jim Carrey's government was definitely short-lived. He is an unbearable on-screen presence. The indifference of his portrayal is nothing but creepies. He also produced this, this "masterpiece" so that he can not blame anyone for it. "The number one comedy in America" ​​screams the desperate TV additions. Of course Jim Carrey was supposed to guarantee full houses, but the game is over. If I sound like that is because I am. I spent a sunny afternoon in California, plus tickets, parking, flat Cokes etc, almost $ 45 on this thing, starring and made by Mr. Carry. No more, do you hear? Not anymore.
