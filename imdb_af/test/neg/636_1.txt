It's much more than I, how this script was ever sold, which is less produced and distributed. The dialogue was so bad it was sick. The train and helicopter scenes appeared on high school students on flashcards. Lou Diamond Phillips should have hidden under his seat like this --- this "movie"? was shown on a private screen, after which he probably left behind at the back door. The only emotion that aroused in me, was sorry for the cast, they had to bite the bullet to get through this one. I couldn't stand it all, it was so predictable that it was funny. Who knows, maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy.
