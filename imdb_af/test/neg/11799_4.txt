Ted Nicolaou made great horror and fantasy movies. I'm looking for all his movies to watch. I couldn't find this one for 3 years until I found it unexpectedly in YouTube. To tell the truth, I wanted to see more ghosts and less talk here. It looks like in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis, maybe in money. Its features of this time look more like the real low-budget thrash z garbage movies. But I do not claim to be a bad director this time. Everything happens. The end has some nice creepy details and tensions, but the whole movie was long dull dialogues. <br /> <br /> Only for the true Ted's fans. <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
