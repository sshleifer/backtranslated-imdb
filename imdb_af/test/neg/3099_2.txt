What's the story that's on the screen. Initially I have to say, don't touch this movie, it's for your own good (it sucks). And really what's the story, in the beginning it looks good, but after 10 minutes it gets worse. And that's not all, you can hardly see what it is on the screen, it's too dark all the time. <br /> <br /> Don't touch.
