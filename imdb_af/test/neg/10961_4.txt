Well, here we have a zombie movie that may not even be much of a zombie movie. The whole movie is in a zombie-paved near future, but the film goes very little with this concept. Instead, it focuses on a zombie hunter trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters. How good is money anyway if almost the whole world has gone to hell and villages are mostly desolate. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place. If people were not to kill these dangerous threatening monsters if they were not paid. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the story for "The Quick and the Undead" is far from a tight one. Of course, it is not filled with the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's not a horrible movie though. It's certainly not as bad as some people try to make you believe it is. It's a very nice one, or rather the movie has at least no cheap look at it. Its effects can be a little over-utilized, yet it is pretty good as well as the makeup effects as well. <br /> <br /> However, the movie wasn't what I was hoping for. The title may indicate that the movie takes place in the wild, wild west during the days of the cowboys, but the title is just a deceptive one, no doubt chosen for it. I went for it and expect this movie to be a combination of a western and a zombie horror movie. <br /> <br /> For the fans of the zombie films, this movie will mostly be a disappointment to watch. Of course, it doesn't add anything new to the genre, but it doesn't have enough of the genre itself to regard it as a good one. <br /> <br /> Not completely incompatible, but also far from recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
