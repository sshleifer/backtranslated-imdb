The only reason I even give this movie a 4 is because it was made in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The horrible direction is slightly overshadowed by the characters who are unable to act. The lead role is an actor I have never seen in anything else and show it. No chemistry with the love interest and so greasy you almost don't care what happens to him. Dick Sargent was not convincing as a villain. Less of all this man was supposed to be angry. He was more annoying than anything. Peter Graves was the only person who was not the movie, his part was small and even he could not compensate for his fellow star's lack of talent. In 2004 someone tried to make this mess again. It's called The Island. I didn't see that movie personally, but from what I understand, she's the same movie. If you want to laugh at this movie, the MST3k episode gets its really funny ... full of conquered and biographical references that show it
