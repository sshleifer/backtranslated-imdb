this is a movie reminiscent of avatar main characters rajesh khanna from the 80's. The issue of parenting children is interesting, but has been dealt with in a very non-original way. The characters were not fully developed and the kids apparently kept love in the first 15 minutes of the movie to be totally unaware of the parents, this transformation was not credible to say the least. They examined it a little more. amitabh and jaya were overlooked as this helpless old couple. Firstly, amit was not too convincing in this role because he just didn't seem to be helpless. I mean why not just go back to work where he wanted instead of w / kids they didn't want. Hema was not convincing as a 60-year-old ... she didn't look more than 50 a day. Then the whole book of the book Baghban won the book winner and asked credibility. , a movie that deals with an important issue, but cld is made better, I give it 5/10
