I attended a show of this movie. Travolta came to do a Q&A after the movie ended. It was a small showroom in Tribeca. Out of courtesy to him I did not go out what I wanted to do. It is producing films at its worst. To begin, the writing was poorly written. The author writes in one voice. The dialog is styled and clicked. How this writer / director Scarlet Johansen, John Travolta and Lions Gate Entertainment has to support her, is the only brilliant thing she has achieved in this fiasco. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all aspiring author writers. , directors and filmmakers. Because if you are told that you are wasting your time, it will be impossible to reach your goals. Hey ... just look at this shit and tell yourself ... if they can do that, it's possible. <br /> <br /> PS-Travolta has done a good Q&A ... he was comfortable, spoke freely and was a nice old man. The director / writer was on the sidelines. When John tried to engage her in the conversation, she stood back like a piece of wood and never joined me. I looked at her and I thought ... how could this person successfully pitch for agents, studio executives, top talent ... if she couldn't open her mouth at the show of her own movie. The conclusion of some of us present is that she must have strong family relationships in the business. <br /> <br /> After watching it, follow it with Guy Ritchie's zero star masterpiece "Swept Away" with the most inadvertently funny and worst performance by Madonna's wife. She's so bad and looks so bad in this movie. I think it's her way of coming back to her for all the abuse he takes from her at home.
