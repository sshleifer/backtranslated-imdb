First - Nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. They didn't have to predict the bombing. <br /> <br /> Secondly - hasn't anyone seen these six industrial / lawyers for a long time? They were killed * before * the operation took place! Thirdly - how did Lugosi get out of the taxi without being seen? Fourth - why did the Japanese not only kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a convenient corpse and his surgical kit? Fifth - oh, what's the use? This movie has some interesting moments in it, but by the time they explain what's going on, you'll probably have stopped watching. If not, you won't mind.
