I really don't know why I write it. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say this: <br /> <br /> Once I watch the movie, I like it. As time goes on, my opinion about the movie changes. This happened at the end of the days. This was my first time seeing it. I thought it was entertaining. But a few weeks later my opinion changed. To solve this, I looked at it again at a friend's house. Well, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I'm a logical person. If I see a logical hole in a movie, I try to ignore it. When I see two, I start getting annoyed. More than two and I'm down. End Days turned me off after my second show. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is a bit depressing. Everything about it is sad. Everything about Arnold's acting. But dark search movies don't bother me, but have something else ... <br /> <br /> If Satan can revive his wounds, how can you possibly kill him in his mortal form? If you shoot him, his skin grows back. If you cut his head, a new one must come back. So question: what is the point to even try to kill him? I'll tell you why: because it's a silly movie that has a regained villain. This is not the devil my friends. It is a reminder of the Bond villains who give the whole scheme to the hero. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's worth a look, but don't see it twice, because it's crazy.
