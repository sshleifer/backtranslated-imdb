Pretty eleven made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic. Rosemary's son Adrian grew up and is embodied by creepy Stephen McHattie. After the elimination of Rosemary (played here by Patty Duke), a witchcraft, led by Minnie and Roman Castevets, is preparing Satan's son for world rule. It is not a pity, and lighter years less miserable than its predecessor. Instead, author Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan-worshiping thriller full of many candles, lots of candles, and Ruth Gordon tries to act boldly at the same time. Gordon is the only one beyond the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy and a lot of hammy Ray Milland plays Roman Castevets, who participate in the late Sidney Blackmer. Latest McHattie is the only true saving grace of the movie. He is very shaky and looks really sinister without doing anything. The music by Charles Bernstein is properly creepy, but so overused, it is ultimately intrusive rather than effective. O'Steen, who changed the earlier Polanski masterpiece, shows no flair or subtlety.
