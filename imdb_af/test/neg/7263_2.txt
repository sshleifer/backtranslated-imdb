Roy Rogers (as Roy) and sidekick Raymond Hatton (as Rusty) join Teddy Roosevelt's "Rough Riders". Soon they will be suspended to round-up the murderer of partner Eddie Acuff (like Tommy) next to the Mexican US. border they discover sharp gold runners in the process. Notice how, even suspended, Mr. Rogers can get the Rough Riders to join his Round up! <br /> <br /> It's not one of the better Roy Rogers Westerns. The fighting scene looks like choreographic dances. Rogers sings / yodels "Ridin 'Down the Trail", one of two relatively common songs; And, an outstanding moment, overall. <br /> <br /> ** Rough Riders' Round-up (3/13/39) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, Raymond Hatton, Lynne Roberts
