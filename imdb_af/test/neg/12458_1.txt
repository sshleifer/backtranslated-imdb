Why do people make bad movies? Didn't anyone working on the photo know that what they made had no point? There is something about this picture that has thrown me off, in addition to finding this "movie" to be unrealistic, pathetic and poor. I admire them for the three, but the "actors" in the movie sometimes look difficult and no one character has substance or say anything softly intelligent. This movie earns zero stars. But I didn't have that option, so it gets a 1.
