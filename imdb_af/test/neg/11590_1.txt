Where do I start? First, the story sucks. The acting suck, the effects really suck, I think I'll start with the story. The story for Komodo vs Cobra: number one, it doesn't explain how or when the Komodo and the cobra even came there. Or for the matter, how it was created. The acting: DIFFERENT! The director seems to have just pulled a few people off the street (which is probably what he did). And finally, the consequences: they're so terrible that the komodo doesn't even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur, which looks incredibly unrealistic. The water does not even move when the cobra appears. All in all: terrible piece of crap, don't even think about renting it.
