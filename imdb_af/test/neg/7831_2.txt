You should start worrying if you see Michael Madsen leading the movie of any movie. I'm not going through the list of shame that is her film career. <br /> <br /> I watched 45 minutes and wasn't sure what was really going on. The film consisted of a love-hate relationship between Madsen and Argento. In essence, Madsen was abusive to her, threatening violence and usually treated her like dirt. On the other hand she loves him, then she doesn't, then she does, she longs for him, then she loves him again ...... what's wrong with your wife !!!! <br /> <br /> The Script is terrible, funny soundtrack and useless aggressive and coarse sexuality that I believe has been added to attract some viewers as the movie has little to offer. I would have given the movie a 1, but it just got a 2 with a little excitement over the last 20 minutes. It actually answered one question in the last few minutes, but I'm not going to share it. I'll make you the full movie like me.
