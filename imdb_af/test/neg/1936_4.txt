Take me: Even wonderful underwater photography can save a well-known script and paper-thin characters. <br /> <br /> For those who don't have enough of the FREE WILLY photos yet, FLIPPER can provide a decent rental. Others are (strongly) suggested to stay away. Although FLIPPER is harmless, it doesn't show anything to the adult audience unless it's your first time to see a dolphin. <br /> <br /> A repetition of a 1960s TV program and movie, FLIPPER may be like a good idea then: A Dolphin charm the life of a boy and a girl, they help prevent the environment by only getting rid of poisonous waste thrown into the sparkling waters of the Florida Keys while simultaneously bathing a shark and salt sea, which is the one responsible for the poisonous spill and also hate dolphins . But even for the 90's, especially when a fair-like movie like FREE WILLY was a recent hit, FLIPPER is just another harmless, but occasionally empty, summer movie for the kids. Although the animals (it is indeed the main wolf, an awkward pelican and a realistic chicken hammer, such as the villain) and the pristine underwater cinematography steal the shoulder, there's nothing in FLIPPER to steal anyway. br /> <br /> The story is completely predictable, something like today, even a 6 year old, can be clearly seen. The (Human) throw, led by a pre-lord of the Elijah Wood rings and an out-of-work Paul Hogan, seldom has anything to do but stands around and looks beautiful. Their acting skills, whatever they may be to this movie, are rarely revealed on the screen unless you consider the "acting" talents of cheerful Bottlenose Dolphin. I don't think trying to recommend FLIPPER, since sensible family entertainment won't be fair, but someone over the age of 10 (No, make it 8) is better off renting or buying something else. In addition, the film is about 95 minutes tops. It just gives you enough time to give something elsewhere without worrying about your children. This alone can be the rent. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
