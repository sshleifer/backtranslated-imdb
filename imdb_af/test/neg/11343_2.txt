Ladies and gentlemen. Be sad (or be happy!). We are in the disgusting forensic T.V series ERA !! Join me now and highlight our happiness: <br /> <br /> "CSI: Crime Scene Examination", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Crossing Jordan", "Da Vinci's Inquest Of In the late 1990s to the late 2000s, we have almost the same series of genius criminologists with a partner (or team) who will solve crime by investigating the autopsy. And what a misleading mission to do. You will certainly have many and very repulsive scenes where we see the most horrific shots in the history of TV clearly, accurately and terribly, about GOD, as soon as we have had the big days, the good policeman (or detective) ERA such as Columbo, Kojak , Magnum, and Simon & Simon, or the good old Sci-Fi ERA, like The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Knight Rider, and oh boy, we also have the hot and sexy like: cover, The Love Boat, Baywatch, even a flop like a thunder in paradise. <br /> <br /> All those things were memorable, original, good. Every good thought, action, women. Until the XFILES came. And then it was the start of the accident or to be exactly: The Disaster! <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, X files were one of the biggest, but there were a few minor drawbacks, we have agent Dana Scully (medical doctor and FBI agent) at every episode that has an autopsy. And of course her lap (as the series succeeded) became part of our living room. The thirst for money producers loved it with all the physical terror + the exciting hunt for the truth. Therefore, they tried to repeat it in another not too far classification: The Forensic! <br /> <br /> But it has become so ugly, full of deformation, and very rough like BONES. Plus the unsexy presence of Emily Deschanel, and bleeding as David Boreanaz (he was much better in the angel), and all these bodies. So far, every time I watched it, I found my screaming AAAAHHHHHH !! What a terrible gross !! <br /> <br /> Please cancel it. You canceled for real, good performances like (The Lone Gunmen) or (A Man Called Hawk). Here it is a bad one. So please. Little compassion and enough with the Bones-ERA !!! .. or we will die ourselves of Nausea and Monotony !!
