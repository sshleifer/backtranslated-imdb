After watching this piece, you will know why the limeys are on the left side of the street. This movie is an absolute NO-BRAINER! The jokes (if it's the right word for it ...) are mostly substandard (about 98%) and don't miss a punch line at all. Save the money and get drunk. You may enjoy this completely wasted movie, maybe!
