***** Spoiler or two, it doesn't matter ****** <br /> <br /> Two things stand out about this movie. First, it is titled "Bruno" and "The Dress Code", and if you have seen this movie, you will take in the irony. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it's all about the issues. The adventures of a graduate school cross is not something that needs a filming need for a movie, nor a subject that I think most people would be interested in. Shirley MacLaine manages to walk around the issues of gender by tying Bruno's desire to wear a dress of religion, which probably opens a thinner canine worm - what does she think? <br /> <br /> Yes, there is humor and it's not directly offensive, but the kind of startling feeling just keeps on growing. It doesn't do much, except to repeat the liberal mantra that "different" people must be accepted (or perhaps excluded?) No matter what. <br /> <br /> What is good ---- but to be able to live in a society, everyone should give a little to go along. Bruno doesn't just want to wear a dress, he wants to show up as a miniature Gladys Knight on awards night, and his last costume makes him look like a Koolpatch Cowgirl Doll. But all the other kids dress and act like ordinary kids. So what gives? If that comes down to it, we can all explain or behave specially and in any way we feel, and the result would be total chaos. <br /> <br /> This acceptance of people who are "different" has also been fairly carefully defined. I doubt if we will ever see a movie about a child who finds his true self and wears it, wants to wear hunting gowns and goes to the tractor, and demands everyone else accepts him just as he is. "Bruno" is a silly movie, and a total waste of time.
