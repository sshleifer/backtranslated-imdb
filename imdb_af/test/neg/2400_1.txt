The filmmakers neglected the dots - this is the sequence of events and choices that led Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet mujahdin to Al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden and finally to 9/11. The filmmakers obviously fail to tell us the story - why was the Soviet Union in Afghanistan? - But that failure falls compared to the fact that they ultimately do not reveal support for Islamic extremists in Afghanistan in the name of racial anti-communism. strengthen the hand of the anti-western forces and was a major contributor to the mess we find today (9/11, terrorist networks, a long war in Afghanistan, etc.). Because these effects are not spelled out, the movie makes the viewer sympathetic to Mr. Wilson (hey, look at his latest projects on the internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions are in conflict with the best interests of his country and the West as a whole.
