When I watched this movie, it was an afternoon after I got home. I love horror movies and have seen some casey people, but it takes the cake. The plot presented to the viewer at the beginning of the movie looks a bit interesting, but as the movie progresses, the screenplay makes a wrong turn with horrible clicks and bad performances, making the movie completely boring and boring . I don't mean to criticize the script and plot, because I don't think it's the worst part. I have to say in its entirety that the acting was not terrible for the start actors, and I was impressed with Taylor Locke, which is one of his first movies. The worst part of the movie was the special effects. They were burdened with a low budget and really spoiled the viewers even though he was remotely interested. I recommend watching this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot. Only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors.
