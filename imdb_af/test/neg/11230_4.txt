Ken Russell directs this strange (not many) erotic thriller and if I didn't know I would have gotten the life of director Brian DePalma. Absolutely everything about KRIMES OF PASSION shouts DePalma, from the gaudie cinematography that is a little too bright, to the household story that becomes a stem and slash plot, even the title it screams: "Depalma, DePalma, Depalma "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as poor men over the years, Russell had to try to emulate his own style. Probably an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would be bizarre with a capital B, but at least it would have been a unique movie experience. Stories about prostitutes experiencing a dangerous dual life and being stalked by a religious maniac were all too common in the 1980s video market. O and Anthony Perkins play the same role he played in virtually every film he made in the 1980s. Excavated <br /> <br /> The only thing about any real note to CREDITS OF THOUGHT is the controversy it caused. I think the studio was the happiest people to hear this as no publicity is bad publicity, but for the controversial sex scene ... What controversial sex scenes? There is no and the only controversy I can think of is that China Blue dominates a policeman with a trunche. Needless to say he did not come down HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
