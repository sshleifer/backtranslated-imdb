My qualifications for this review? I own all the Alien and Predator movies and I've read almost all the books I can find related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can safely say this movie is a Stinker. Save your money and don't waste your time. Keeping in mind, mindless actions, no plot to talk about and like to be taken by Hollywood, see the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a serious Alien series fan, send a message to the crowded, over paid packages in Hollywood & 20th Century Fox and don't give them a penny. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many plot holes in it that you can sift through paste. Read the other negative reviews to get the big picture, it's all said accurately, so I don't have to repeat it. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are cardboard. You want them all to be dead. And the film doesn't disappoint, almost everyone dies. Even the hot, bubbly blonde. Do you feel sorry for her? Nope. No plot, no character development .... who cares. The predators are now also idiots. They scan everything except their own dead warrior. They're supposed to be a high tech community, right? In the Predator movie, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. Trophy dead. In AvP they scanned Charles Weyland and let him go because he had Cancer. Great plot hole! <br /> <br /> The R rating is also because they have kids in the movie who get a face, many gore and violence and there is one hospital scene where a lot of pregnant women are injected. with chest. She is implanted by the hybrid alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth-to-mouth love-scene orgy and they breed everything, say 30 seconds. Sensationally gore a big, nothing more. These scenes are laughing, not serious. It's almost like violence takes place and the Alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, a thumb or a nod of some sort. <br /> <br /> The Aliens in this movie are all about performance-enhancing drugs. They develop quickly and spread quickly across the town, tons of them, everywhere in record time. Pathetic because it does not stick to the series story line and adds nothing to the Aliens, Aliens Predator continuity. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the positive reviews were written by people who love the gore. Laughable. As a movie, as a continuation of the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator franchise, this movie is at best a cheesecake clich√©. If you followed this series faithfully, all the rules are broken and the Aliens and Predators are reduced to cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> There is not one fantastic, memorable action scene. There are almost no special effects worth remembering. There are no trademark actors. The plot is as thin as onion paper that eventually ends with a, "We have two choices to get out of this mess ... The hospital or town center!". I just watered myself. The city center means everyone is going to visit Big Brother who somehow knows the town is infected because they have an AWAC in the air that can see the contamination on a radar screen in special effects Red Spots. I almost fell out of my chair. Special effects save spot alien radar on an AWAC across Central America. I cut out my stomach. <br /> <br /> Getting to the Helicopter Pad smothered me on my popcorn. Has anyone played a game called ZOMBIES? You have to get your playing pieces on the Helicopter Road to win. I almost made myself laugh wet. <br /> <br /> The end is enough to shake your head in wonder. Who hired 20th Century Fox to write this script! OH, OH, ask me .... a Grade 5 student. There can really be no other answer. Oh yes, there could be another answer. Low Budget Cheesecake Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> The end? "Col. Stevens takes the Predator rifle to Yutani (Francoise Yip). She tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents. Col. Stevens knows Yutani doesn't want to use the technology on earth." You're joking, right? Mrs. Yutani? Who's me Yutani? (forshadow: Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She is in the movie exactly 2 seconds and yet, in her infinitely distant eastern wisdom, she says the world is not ready for technology. Seriously ?? !! The Brothers Dweebs (Strause) as directors? Who is responsible for this bleeding abortion of a movie? They are Doug and Bob McKenzie of directors and yet Fox entrusted them with the flailing Alien franchise. They are named specialist experts and yet the movie is all the low budget special effects. Hmmm, I see a pattern. Laugh Portable. <br /> <br /> This movie is just made to lay your wallet. It serves no other purpose. It has no plot. It does not contain any main characters. This is incompatible. It does not meet any of the character principles established in previous films. It does nothing to promote the franchise. The special effects are lame, minimal and low budget. And it has no end to talking. It's a low budget and is strictly designed to take your hard earned money. Nothing more. <br /> <br /> Save your money. See if it looks on TV where it will end very soon. Buy a bootleg or completely miss out on this blooming ulcer. There's a reason Fox doesn't preview this film to critics. The critics would have eaten these rocks alive and no one would have gone to the theaters to see it. JR Giger, the original creator, is currently leaning on a toilet flushing his lunch. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox, this movie is a stinker. It's as bad or worse than Alien 3. You insult us. <br /> <br /> Now rinse ...
