I enjoy gay-themed movies where the characters are not stereotypically gay and this has attracted me to this movie, it and the main actor. This is the only reason I give this movie one star than it deserves (although not because of its acting in the movie, let me tell you). Many people complain about cinematography, but the video camera's feel of the movie added to me some "underground" quality. There are a few scenes, usually around sunset or sunrise and under trains that will blush any screen. <br /> <br /> But the play is cardboard, the music is repetitive (I watched a soundtrack from another movie through the last half of the movie), you have to wait nearly 20 minutes for any dialogue and then this is uncomfortable and amateur. The subject of graffiti could have made this movie wonderful if it was exploited gracefully and the art itself was intriguing, but it is not. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, there's no climax; There wasn't really a plot to start with. The movie just crawls back into his shell of silence and dies. A forgetful movie.
