The St. Francisville Experiment claims it's not a step in the woods, a direct blow to Blair Witch's face. Where Blair Witch proves to be a movie that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, the St. Francisville experience the patience of the viewer. One has to say, however, that this is a classic camp. <br /> <br /> Warning: Spoiler is coming !! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in a local theater in which the movie's "paranormal consultant" Troy Taylor talked about making the movie. If anyone wants to see this movie without knowing the upcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist, read on my friends and everyone will be told. <br /> <br /> Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather unpleasant ghost stories he claims, is all true, the audience informed at the show that the St. Francisville experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know ... he informed us that all the frightening discoveries made by the contestants were all performed and presented by the film producers in advance. In fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana but rather in California. All four participants were true actors (I didn't say well ...). One of the participants is actually a specialist technician at ER. <br /> <br /> What bothered me about this movie is that it says everything is true. It was trying to break the Blair Witch Project by claiming it was true, while Blair Witch was a hoax. The wonderful thing is that nobody can believe this movie for a moment. Filled with terrifying acting and hilarious lines like "surround yourself with white light" and "I love the ghosts". The St. Francisville experiment should join at midnight, so the crowd can attach, buoy, pity and chorus. the ghosts! "<br /> <br /> Talk about false advertising. True stories aren't filmed with increased special effects that the Boy Scouts neighborhood has set up a haunted house. From the bug in the sandwich (ooh ... scary ...) after the annoying Madison, of the "seance" playing nothing more than the four on a Oujia board, while the two mice under a bed, The St Francisville Experiement is an embarrassment of a movie Lion's Gate would be wise to dump or advertise this thing in the nearest garbage manufacturer as it really would be: <br /> <br /> "The St. Francisville experiment: a comic look at not making a movie ".
