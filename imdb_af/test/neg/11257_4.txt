I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It has been billed by the host as the "world premiere" of the movie (although it appears that people have seen it before). I have to say, I don't really know what to do about the movie. I'm not familiar with the book, but buy the ticket just two hours and have only limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, as it turned out, since I had trouble getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes told by Jones's character, but somehow that perspective doesn't suit me. And I really can't say whether some of the laughs the movie was getting, calculated or not. The cuts were sudden and disruptive, the screens sounded somehow and the storytelling did not always make sense (even leaving the supernatural parts). The actors were really good, but couldn't really save the movie. It was entertaining, but sometimes just in the sense that I sat there thinking of technical details of film making and what went wrong with this one. I still don't know what kind of mood the director wants the movie. It was a strange mixture of light, dark, supernatural. Unfortunately, it didn't make me notice me and I looked at it with a technical eye. But to think about what is wrong with a movie while it is watching is the best sign that a movie has somehow failed. I would definitely have expected something different with the actors involved ... too bad!
