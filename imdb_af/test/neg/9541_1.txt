If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in danger. I'm a big fan of "B" movies, and I've seen my share of bad people, but there's not a letter in the alphabet that adequately describes this rancid piece of solid puke. This movie even outperforms the "so bad it's good" phase and goes straight to the "so bad that your world will look a little less meaningful as if you watched it" phase. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say what's more upsetting: .1. The fact that the people who wrote this thought their political satire (I use the term very, very, very loosely) was spectacular to film. They could find so many other people who agreed with them to work on this garbage for obviously little or no money. That someone actually thought it would be a good idea to pick up this crap for distribution on a horror anthology DVD. <br /> <br /> If I were a weaker man, I would probably have stuck grapefruit spoons in my eyes and then Blindly I waved into elusive traffic after watching it. However, as it stands, I live, but I'm always afraid of the experience.
