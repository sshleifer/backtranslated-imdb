We have chosen to watch this movie as an alternative to The Polar Express, which is shown at our local IMAX theater. What a waste of time and money! First, it's not cute. The snowman looked at times demonically. Other times he was merely a zombie. He didn't show any expression or emotion most of the time, and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy. <br /> <br /> Second, Santa State at the beginning is a movie about the spirit of giving. Santa and a snowman who declare war on each other is a movie about giving? I'm all for a little parody, but it wasn't just funny or entertaining. <br /> <br /> The idea that the Snowman's whistle is his voice is different. Sorry, you never see or hear the snowman playing his whistle ... not even a "thank you" to Santa. <br /> <br /> The only funny parts of the movie were the "outtakes" at the end of the movie. Badly they didn't use them in the movie. It would have been better.
