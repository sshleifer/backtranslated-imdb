I grew up in the 90's; therefore you must understand that I have seen the premiers of the greatest DCOMs firsthand. I was there when Brink! appear, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc. These films form my childhood. When these movies were going on, I didn't just have myself, but whoever I attended, standing in awe of 1h30, was talking about it for the week to catch it again next weekend. I don't think words can express the amount of excitement Zoog Disney has brought. <br /> <br /> Even when I see it now, the dialogue doesn't look that much (so effective I actually remember parts of conversations literally word by word, from movies I've seen ten years ago). The characters are credible, funny, have given a bit of stereotype, but that's what makes Disney's charm. <br /> <br /> I put my little brother in front of the Disney Channel to try and convey my feelings to DCOMs. Get stuck in the suburbs ... my brother looked at me a little surprised and asked if I was always gay. I feel more disappointed and betrayed now than what could I compare it to? When Han Solo found out, Lando sold him to Father ... <br /> <br /> Half of the movie and I exaggerated are flashbacks. There is no talent at all in these young actors (some of whom are older than me). The plot is ridiculous; it feels like a bunch of old rotting corporate people at Disney are sitting next to a table and asking themselves, "How can we look hip to these young people?" OK, maybe all of the DCOMs are like that, but at least they did a little bit of trouble not to let us realize they were complete idiots. <br /> <br /> And apparently, this kind of movie works ... Fasting in the suburbs is being rated as much as Zenon or Airborne. How is this possible? DCOMs have become even more cheesier and people prefer them now? (Although the lack of swear words seems to be enough for some people to be 10/10) Christ, this is a very different generation.
