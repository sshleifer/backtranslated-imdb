Couple having financial problems gets a box downloaded from their door. If they hit the button, they'll get a million dollars, but someone they don't know will die. Do they push the button? <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie based on a Richard Matheson short story featuring some chills, but mostly it's a messy thing. The problem is that there is so much going on, it feels as if writer director Richard Kelly doesn't know what kind of movie he is making. Is it a straight-out horror movie with supernatural overtones? Sometimes it looks like talking about moral choices, damnation and the afterlife. Is this a science fiction movie? Perhaps there are many questions about the Mars project. And what is the strange appearance that people seem to be in a great conspiracy? Is this Body Snatchers Invasion or a demonic takeover movie? Don't know, maybe. And that's the problem. There are many questions, most of them are intriguing, but there are too many. Little seems to be explained and when we get to the end of the movie, things seem to stop and then end (even on an open end). I'm all making a movie rich in themes and points, but writer Kelly fills his writing with just too much that director Kelly can't handle, or so much so that every theme or plot is ten Minutes get screen time and for those minutes it holds the court before the next piece is dropped. It made me crazy. (I will not lead in the two, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who do not know very well or more likely what to do about the material so moving) <br /> <br /> It's a hot mixture that does not work (there are eventually too many holes). I came to the end and suddenly realized I had no idea what I just saw. I really didn't like it, but it's more in it, it's not good because it rather misses a way earlier. I will pass or wait for the cable where it will cost you nothing
