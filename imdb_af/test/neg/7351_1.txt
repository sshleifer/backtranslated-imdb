I agree with the user "SpecialAgentFoxMulder" that this episode is terribly posh thr worst of the whole show. Now I'm not keen on many episodes of the later series, but this one takes the cookie! It was unsuitable and unofficial. In the end, I'm sorry, but it combined me more than any other episode. <br /> <br /> I think the boys think they meant well, but the end was so upsetting that they think the whale belongs to the moon and over the credits we see it has died. What the episode could have saved was if the pranksters could confess what they did. <br /> <br /> There is no outgoing message. Okay, South Park may be guilty of preaching too much and it's always nice to see an unpredictable one (like Love Love Warcraft)), but this episode was just wrong! Avoid at all costs! Helen xxxxx
