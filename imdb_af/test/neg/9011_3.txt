This film has a fairly decent representation - one that is horribly re-appeared in science fiction films, the most spectacular in Alien - and some decent "male" performances by the male cast. The injured astronaut's wife, for me, is the poor link in the ensemble - she doesn't seem to have to deal with her face in many of her most prominent scenes, for which I blame director Corman. <br /> <br /> Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen shot, "Blood Beast" might have been pretty decent. But the inherent cheapness of the production design and the continuity errors and gaffes undermine the proceedings. For example, every time I saw the comedian astronaut on an "exam table", the width of an ironing board broke out. I broke into giggles, probably not the emotion the crew wanted to call. And the monster's costume needed serious work; Feather-covered parrots are just not scary or convincing. <br /> <br /> However, the point of departure was strong enough to hang up just to see how the plot would solve him, and the alien motives were enough ambiguous. And the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist hit a little, along with the plot development where the alien claimed some of the dead person's personality was assimilated. <br /> <br /> This is Corman. It's cheap, fast and light if you don't think too much or expect too much. What else needs to be said?
