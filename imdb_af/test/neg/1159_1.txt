Ed Gein, one of the best-known serial killers of all time, was the inspiration for famous movie killers such as Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the most sickest and disturbing killers of all time, I watched a documentary, so I know his story well. When I saw this, I was curious because I thought it should be like a documentary resignation, but I have to say that it was just a pathetic waste of time. First, the facts are completely wrong, with some minor exceptions, and secondly, it was just a stupid Hollywood story when these horrible murders really happened and they just made it into a cheap buck. Not to mention that if they did it in a horror movie, it was poorly performed! <br /> <br /> Ed Gein, he lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield, but he has a little secret that the whole town is accomplished by killing dead bodies, as well as the brutal killing of people. Bobby, a deputy, is about to get Ed Gein. No one knows who the murderer is initially, and only finds crime scene after the crime scene. But things become "personal" when Ed begins with the policemen 's family and friends. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is just ridiculous and totally insulting to the true story. I always thought that bad acting was an essential tool for a horrorflick, but for this story it had to be a better recorded movie. To name it, it should have been more of a documentary than a silly clich√© horror movie. Please keep away from this movie, it is completely pathetic and untrue to the story of Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> 1/10
