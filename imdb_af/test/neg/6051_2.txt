I really thought it would be a good movie, boy ... was I wrong! For a fast summer: B grade acting C grade special effects D grade for overall film. Don't get me wrong, the story was pretty good and not a kiddish, so an adult driving it, the "hero" is good so most women will love it :-), not a total chick flag as it has some battle scenes and some blood <br /> <br /> but the way it was shot ... terrible <br /> <br /> the special effects-> would be better suited for TV-> on a children's program <br /> <br /> and lastly ... send some of the actors back to the acting school if they ever attended a class there. <br /> <br /> Trust me there are much better ways to waste 2 hours. /> <br /> You're warned.
