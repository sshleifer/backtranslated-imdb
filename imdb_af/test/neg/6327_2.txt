Okay, the only reason I watched this movie is because Krista Allen is in it. Since I admit I watch Days from our lives ... I know her as Billie. Oh yes, maybe there will be a reason to watch this movie. This will be the soft porn site. They seem to be there. And a little different. I hope anyone is renting or buying this movie rental just for the sex scene. Because if they bought / rented it for something else, say quality TV, they could die from a heart attack. This movie has little imagination whatsoever. While I am doing well, it is stupid, and perhaps I buy it myself, I am a fool. Rent before you buy this one. 2 out of 10. (Note, I still have a movie a 1 star. The sensual scene is alone and has a 1. if they didn't have a straight 1 in the pot and I want a refund if not.
