A day in the life of a discarded taxi driver somewhere around Christmas: The taxi driver gets a prize ... they have a "very informative" interlude ... he drops the fare ... he still packs " a rate on ... Another interlude ... and so it goes for 90 friggin minutes ... nothing convinced (or interesting) for another minute ... SKIP IT!
