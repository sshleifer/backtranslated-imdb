Not even 'less' Hitch, but just a bad movie. The movie-like equivalent of a dirty old man. Ugly in every way: relentless writing, static point of view, thin clothes, terrible hair, unfair actors, and one really free rape and strangulation scene. The director's perverse sense of humor is present, but it is not consistently applied; The movie just comes alive in its cruelty. The women are particularly heavy; "Frenzy" can be used as proof that the director was a misogynist, but a better explanation for me is that it may start with his TV series and "Psycho", which he himself described as a thrift exercise. An experiment to see if a television crew can shoot a tolerant feature. -Afred Hitchcock left much art and established for trade. In 'Frenzy' the great master seems to bow to the convention, trying to deal with the times and giving audiences what he thinks they want - in the form of unpleasant nudity, cuddly cuddles and general nastiness. I don't deceive an old man's rest, but I don't want to remember him tired and sleepy - to look again 'Vertigo'!
