I just messed up and watched me on Saturday night! I have seen the names of Chris Noth (Mr Big, of "Sex & the City"), Robert Patrick (of "X-Files"), decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney and Mercedes Ruehl on credit. a very reasonable IMDb rating (5,6); and very good reviews in IMDb. For my total surprise, the movie is terrible: the characters are poorly built; The story is trying to be funny, but it's completely stupid. Mercedes Ruehl's character is incredibly stupid for a professor in Princeton. So, I decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews, and I found that most of them are made by IMDb users with just revision, so family or friends of the cast and crew, or people hired to promote this garbage. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "As Retorno" ("Without Return")
