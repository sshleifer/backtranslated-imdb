To be a great Laura Gemser fan, I chose it at a lease to see just another Emanuelle movie. Son, did I make a mistake! <br /> <br /> EMANUELLE IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser is there with her husband Gabriele Tinti, but this is the only connection with Emanuelle. Here Laura plays "Laura" (originally, huh?) A beautiful supermodel who visits her rich friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. In the slip, she is a ** ghetto photographer Carlo (a haggard-Gabriele Tinti) and a blonde woman who is never mentioned. Also in Pia's home is Horatio (the sexy but stupid Al Cliver), a mystique that speaks nothing but nonsense. Arrival for the weekend is Pia's two daughters, one a short-haired lesbian and the other a brunette. Many sexes were implicated but barely shown. One beautiful actor plays Ali, the Egyptian servant, who is happy with three of the women in the house. Laura has sex with the lesbian, the lesbians have sex with Horatio, Pia and the blonde has sex with Horatio at an Egyptian orgy, Laura drinks goats' blood and is owned during an Egyptian ceremony, Carlo rapies Laura. It all happens with so little flair that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Especially from erotic, even the actors seem bored themselves during their sex scene. <br /> <br /> Since there were two famous couples in this movie (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of sex scenes available is countless. Instead, a movie that offers a top-notch Eurocult cast and never delivers the goods, every viewer will split apart, except the hardcore Laura Gemser finalist. Otherwise, you should get lost from EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
