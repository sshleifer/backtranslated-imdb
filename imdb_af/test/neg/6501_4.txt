Avida is a game of words that mixes life and eagerness, but I personally think that this movie has been moved by its ambition and does not justify its title. It gathers a set of awkward characters united with incredible links. Furthermore, the way everything is linked to the end is, in my opinion, a little pathetic. The remnants of it were a set of images ... an interesting one, but not enough to make it a good movie. <br /> <br /> I believe this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but I certainly haven't noticed! The nonsense and caricature of the film is actually the only good thing about it, but when it is dragged on and off, it is no longer bearable. I have to say I have fought hard to continue watching it to the end, and I'm still not sure it's worth it.
