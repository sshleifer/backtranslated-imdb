The First World War gets a bright, sepia-tinted makeover in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's relentless, wonderful "A Very Long Engagement". Jeunet's trademark style consists of mechanical, almost clock-like, narrative construction embellished with cute, chocolate box production values ​​and crossed with faux-naive humor. It's an approach that worked well with its previous picture, the romantic fantasy "Amelie", thanks in no small part to the undisputed contribution of Audrey Tatou in the title role. Adapted to much more gloomy material, Jeunet's method comes rather weak. <br /> <br /> Tatou rebuilds here in a variation on the same kind of sweet-beating character like Amelie. She is Mathilde, an orphan who quietly lives with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting, determined to trace what has become of her child, darling Manche (Gaspard Ulliel), a few years after missing out in the war affected. Manech was one of the five soldiers sent to Bingo Crepuscule in a man's land in 1917. He is all declared dead as Mathilde, who has the hope of finding him. The film follows Mathilde's sought-after quest to find out what really happened, and as she delves deeper, she reveals a sad, even shocking, story of high corruption and inhumanity. Mathilde should filter the facts of the fictions arising from various conflicting, overlapping or incomplete accounts of what Manag's final hours look like. <br /> <br /> All these things must be gripping and gripping, but they are often more confusing. to the visual and oral rubbish with which Jeunet pumps his audience. There is too much going on at any time, including an intriguing narrative that adds nothing to our appreciation for the story and characters. Without a moment's delay of information overload, I refused the space to reflect on Mathilde's quest or the room to involve it in my own terms. Jeunet's incessant busy camera spirals and swoops and circles, stroke every surface contour of his beautifully designed production, but it doesn't sing in the soul under the story's skin. The result is deeply disrupted, and worse, grotesque. The First World War was a particularly dark hour in human history. Imagine it being created again as one of those picturesque advertisements for a well-known Belgian bearer, and you have the tailor made of this movie.
