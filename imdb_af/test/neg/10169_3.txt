An antique shop owner in NYC, played by Joanne Whalley (Valerie Alston), gets a US tribunal jury on a trial of a renowned Mafioso Armand Asante (Rusty Pirone), and spins most of this very slow movie to kill Poland's attempts to get Whalley to free him of murder by killing her son and herself. There is a lot of action, involving gruesome mob-rubs, with Willam Hurt as a switch. Much of this foolish, relentless mess cares Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, court soldiers we've all seen time after time, and an end that's incredible. 3/10 is likely to be easy about this waste of time.
