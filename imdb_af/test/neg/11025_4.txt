I decided to watch this movie because I have never seen Carol Lombard in any movie. I'm sorry this one had to be because, honestly, it's a dog ?? and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, who were both good actors. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is simple: it tries too fast in a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who speaks to Jane with Jane within an hour (played by Lombard). What is that cliché? Get in a hurry, repent in free time ... <br /> <br /> In short, the story is a series of episodes that pay the couple's worsening financial status, their problems with John's living mother, their struggle, show. The bills, John's reduced office status, the arrival of their baby son, John Jnr (unexpectedly and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples' anxiety about their marriage, the baby's illness worsening, so A heroic flight necessitated by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and eventually John is accepted as a junior partner at the law firm. <br /> <br /> How many more clicked situations can the authors include? Maybe mother goes shortly afterwards? There wasn't much comedy; the drama was, at best, infallible; The dialogue was painful to hear. Only the actions of the four main players were sufficient. <br /> <br /> That was the period at the end of the Great Depression, with the US out of its long downturn? during which many people experienced all the events depicted in the movie. <br /> <br /> It was therefore meaningful for Selznick to confirm good, homemade American values ​​of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance and initiative. ? all against the background of the "average" American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the film was released early in 1939; so is it planned in 1938 ?? Shortly afterwards, the US started producing production for the Second World War. This kind of movie was therefore a big booster for the general public, many of whom would soon want to join England in the war. As many know, Hollywood and Washington formed an awkward alliance before, during and after the war. <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I saw it? as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. But I will have to see other Lombard movies to get a better appreciation for her acting. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer remarked: see this one just saying you've seen Stewart's movies; Otherwise, don't bother.
