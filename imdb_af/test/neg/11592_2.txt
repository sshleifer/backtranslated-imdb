If you are looking for a movie that is fun to watch, simply because you can make jokes about the not-so-great acting, cheesy "special" effects and typical sci-fi plot ... then this is the movie for you! Not at the acting was bad, in fact, some actors were actually pretty decent. The special effects were not the biggest (to say the least); the animals look completely computer-animated. There was an annoying squawking to cover the curse and there was only one song over and over throughout the movie. Overall, a great movie if you are looking for something totally cheese and fun to have fun. Not a good movie to see if you're looking for something serious.
