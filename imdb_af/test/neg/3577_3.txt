"R Xmas" goes into the life of a middle-class married-to-child family of narco distributors during the Christmas holiday season. There is no story here - just a diverse collection of events.

The players seem to be improving and adlibing now and then for an unconvincing watch. Generally, a poor effort is not worth the time. (D)
