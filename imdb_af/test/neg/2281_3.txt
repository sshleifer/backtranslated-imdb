By-the-numbers, Oscar-hungry biopics about late, good singer Ray Charles. There is one - exactly one - big scene in * Ray *. It occurs during a setback to Charles's youth after the boy became completely blind. He walks into the part-cabin that he shares with his mother, and he goes over a chair and spreads on the floor. He calls out to his mother; She, in keeping with her philosophy that a person should stand on their own two feet, sees quietly and painfully from the kitchen and waits to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources. The boy appears to be on the challenge, with his ears and reminder to place a kettle on a stove, a nearby fire pit, the grass blowing outside the window, a cricket floor over the floor. <br /> <br /> The movie breaks here; it expands; Breathe - even for 40 seconds. The scene is an essential break from Taylor Hackford's otherwise noisy movie. With "noisy" I do not refer to the music, it is of course excellent. I am referring to the sound effects (big BOOMS that precede a flashback) and the inward dialogue ("I'm talking to you as a friend, Ray," etc.). On the visual side, Hackford is equally and senselessly flashing: sepia-colored filters over the camera lenses during flashback; whirling-dervish 360s from camera crane, etc. etc. All the modern amenities. What a terrible movie style is displayed in * Ray *! - a style that is too common in a major movie of the past decade or so (Scorsese's * Aviator * is stylistically very similar to this movie). These gimmicks are employed to obscure the clich√©-ridden scenario. Some of us won't be deceived. <br /> <br /> Some of us aren't quite ready to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything more than beautiful mime. Granted, Foxx honestly looks like Ray Charles: he's walking like Charles, talking like Charles, and even like Charles Charles. Foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect. I'm not cheating on Mr. Foxx's Oscar; he deserved it. (It was a pretty bad field anyway.) But one wonders if Foxx really understands Charles. The actor reaches one big moment when he insists on trying the smack out of his teammates: he registers, just for a brief moment, an aversion to the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness. The film aims to dramatize the struggle in Charles between the clear salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin, with its blindness as the battlefield between the two compulsions. But the damn movie just won't take the time: it pushes from triumph to victory, never really pope for any insight into the man. One must find STRETCH to find the dramatic tension; one must deliver the drama for the movie. One should therefore suggest a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> In his rush to a glorious conclusion, * Ray * presents some good ideas for a movie. the "Chitlin Circuit"; his brave musical innovations for the Atlantic label; the problem of its addiction to heroin; the inevitable artistic compromises relate to overwhelming success; The man's interest in the civil rights struggle (touched in the movie for, o, about 3 minutes of screen time), and more. The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on one of these elements. Two-and-a-half hours watching a man to overcome one misfortune to another can make us feel good, but such a movie is not necessarily a great work of art. This kind of approach certainly does not offer any deeper insight into the film's subject - and shouldn't the insight be the real purpose of a movie like this? If I wanted a laundry list of Ray Charles's achievements, I would simply throw it. <br /> <br /> 3 stars out of 10 - the extra 2 stars strict for the music.
