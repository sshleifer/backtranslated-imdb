It must be the worst movie I've ever seen. Nielson is in this movie. He not only has what he needs to be funny. I think the reasons the Naked Gun and the similar movies are are that they didn't expect Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as right as he could while all the comedy going on was mostly visual. But if you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he's not. The movie had only one good part, and it can be regarded as a spoiler by some, and the initial credits are animated. If the whole movie was animated, it could have been good. I didn't intend to see this movie when I saw the ads there, and the only reason I saw it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio game. It's the first and probably the only movie I've ever come across. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a score of -100.
