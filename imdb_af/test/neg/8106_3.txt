MGM Hodgepodge of Jimmy Durante throws a big party for everyone in Hollywood. No big stars appear - we get the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I didn't recognize anyone else - they were probably unknown (with good reason). The movie contains annoying funny jokes and some really horrible songs and choreography. The only thing that saves it from a total disaster is Laurel & Hardy's "battle" with Lupe Velez and a wonderful Disney cartoon called "The Hot Chocolate Soldier". It's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a big boost. Otherwise, the movie is a colossal drill. There is no director credited - what does that tell you?
