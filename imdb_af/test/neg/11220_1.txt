This movie is so bad they won't buy it from my local CD / DVD store. I just own it because it came in a box set that I bought for the masterpiece "Deadfall". The store bought back the other two movies I sold from the four slides, but they won't buy underworld, and redefine the other two movies, so what does this movie say? So I tried to sell it back to another store, which even bought buy-back DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't buy underworld either. This movie is bad on every level, and is one of those that came out in the mid-90s after Tarantino monastery glory. The only slightly redeemable element is Dennis Leary, who told Joe Montegna that he is a "stinky friend" and calls him "Mister Stinky Friend". The line is so terribly terrible that I can't help it, but at least once a week, when I describe a stinky friend. But now that I have relieved you of the quotation, you do not have to suffer the pain of watching this movie.
