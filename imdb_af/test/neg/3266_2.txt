Caddyshack Two is a good movie in itself, but compared to the original, it can't upload. Robert Stack is a terrible substitute for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while just not being able to compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the film do not have the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example), except for the hysterically funny lawyer Peter Blunt, played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the original humor, especially the scene at his office (I'm not going for any suit or movements. I find out where you live and come to your house and knock you off * Bb baseball bat , make a bonfire with the chippindale, perhaps roast the golden retriever (arff arff arff), then eat it, and then I come up, and I grab you by your brothers brothers pjs and cramming your brand new BMW has tight **! Do we understand?). Offsetting his small role, Dan is Acroyd, who is obviously no substitute for Bill Murray. His voice is rather annoying and everything he does is not even funny, it's just stupid. Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie, but compared to the incredible original, it just can't cut.
