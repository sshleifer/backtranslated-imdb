From the opening shot of the meteor falling to Earth, you know you're doing something special. <br /> <br /> It is an ultra-low budget movie shot of a group of teenagers stranded on a lighthouse island. with some samples. The story is imperceptible and nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before. The acting is not big, but not quite terrible, but the special effects - of which there is a good deal - are at best ridiculous. If you can read this sentence, chances are better than 50% that you can do a more credible work that can create the video explosion and composition effects in this movie as the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The movie's saving grace - If you're in the mood for a Grade Z turkey from a movie, it's always something happening and it never gets boring. And if you like making bad movies with your friends, you might just find the value of a dollar rental. <br /> <br /> And I must say I appreciated the opening joke, "it's the deadliest name for an island. I've ever heard." Probably the best moment in the movie.
