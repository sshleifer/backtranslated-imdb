As we are well aware, movies are not rated as a direct inclusion of history, but it is a shame when a movie is made that has absolutely little or no correlation. I wish the director and / or screenwriter did his / her research on this topic. All this movie is a forum for hate among people, while it causes a gorge that should not be there. This film depicted the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor, while the third group (Hindus) seemed to have not existed in the brutal murders of the people of both nations. The inaccuracies, along with the sear disregard for your faith as portrayed by "Gian Singh" was a disgrace to the highest format. Although on a more positive note, the actors did a good job of playing their roles. Both Kristen K and Neve C played their roles exceptionally. I hope those who watch this movie will not see or use it as a template for the actual historical event.
