I'm probably one of the few people who defend "Frisk" and even the project Todd Verow puts on the card, if that's true. I appreciated that someone had the courage to accept Dennis Cooper and not get away from the material; Verow roles reasonably. Judging by what he has done since then, he is well-suited to that type of material and is likely to comply. "Vacationland", a "counter-outcome" movie, is so misleading in so many ways that it becomes unintentional, and I'm disappointed to report it. <br /> <br /> First, our hero, Senior High School "Joe" is far too old to play 18. When we later meet a man who is supposed to be Joe's teacher, it is confusing as the sweaty face looks much younger than the student he teaches. Joe's mother looks younger than him and doesn't do a parent either. Secondly, in Joe's opening styles he seemed to be playing or actually experiencing spiritual challenges. For his credit he got better when the film went on and I figured he was "young" but it just wasn't working. It was strange. <br /> <br /> It is 15 minutes before anything. reveal who, what and where these people are and why we should care. The second scene in the film is a big part of the business in a men's toilet room, and it is absolutely superfluous, as the story goes later. the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere, even as a "ritual of passage" for our "young" hero ... one minute. Joe is looking nervously with his hand at the bathroom stall (a scene that is not so erotic, it really makes you wonder what someone is seeing in practice), the next moment he is an expert on sexual blackmail and violent double crossing. This is followed by an extensive scene with the character we'll learn later, Andrew is, and it's about everything we learn from him, except he is apparently gay but not yet out. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of plugging in the 1:44 running time (which is about 20 minutes long - I can't imagine how it played with the sensible numbingly long and useless removed scenes of Joe walking around) ); a subplot taken from 'Gods and Monsters', with an older patron who approves of spitting rhetoric from nothing played by an actor who obviously cannot remember his lines (he is conveniently sent in a way Dickens might have turned up with a slow week); a combination of almost four-way between the boys and their girls, a gay-bashing toilet strap, a wise tune in the form of a nail queen (and did not suddenly take over the carnation queen from the "hooker" with the heart of gold "as the most beautiful stereotype?" that is just being degraded; extortion, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and abuse of walking music software for soundtrack recording. <br /> <br /> What you will NOT find in this movie is any interior that creates masterpieces. We are expected to imagine ourselves in an airport, grocery office and classroom, as all the screens in these locations are close-ups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of ​​localities that the production does not state was to afford. One thing they could get was a real gay bar. either it is the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in Bangor, Maine, as the bar never has protection for it. Another good guy came when the actors shouted about dance music, which obviously did not come from the speakers, but was just more of the droning loop music of the "score". <br /> <br /> Plots and characters come and go, emotions are illegible and the dialogue, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, is "movie talk", which means no people actually speak like that. Since we did not provide information on these characters, it is impossible to worry about what is happening to them; It is as if Joe et al appeared one day from the eater and can only cease to exist once the credits roll (definitely the character of Joe's sister, a wannabee Jennifer Gray who is crazy about Bohemia, seems to be just never know where she is in LA or what her problem is ... but again ... does it matter?). Visually, the movie sometimes looks very good, more a testimony to new developments in hi-def video than anything, I suspect. The editing is pretty rocky (there was one big edit; Joe is naked and says, "I wanted to play sports, but ..." and we cut a shot showing his "buttocks ..." ha ha). Composition is also strange (I thought I had watched SCTV's "Persona" parody when the boys talked to bed together and visually it seemed their noses were together for the whole scene!). <br /> <br /> One senses really take it for granted to make a "sober" or a little rougher film as he usually does, and perhaps he shouldn't have held back (the foamy toothpaste / sex fantasy worked well , I thought, though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie) ... he produced and led this "sensitive comedy" story like Herschell Gordon Lewis directed films without gore ... porn movies without sex in them. I laughed a couple of unintentionally and it wasn't boring, it wasn't very good either.
