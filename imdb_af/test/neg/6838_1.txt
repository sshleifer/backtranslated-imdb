Destroyers !! Bruce Willis, part-time Comic and funny guy, plays a Spanish assassin named an African scavenger prairie dog? I think all the good Spanish names like Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpio, Viper, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (whip), Navaja (blade), etc. Was not available ?? And why would some South American killers be familiar with a terrorist from the Irish Republican Defense Force? Last time I checked in, the IRA was not looking for a headquarters in South America. And why would a prison, fight-tired Irish terrorist look like a middle-aged Richard Gere? I thought maybe this movie would be a spoof of The Crying Game when Gere's character was introduced as the person hunting the Jackal. What is decisive! And why would the FBI hire trial terrorists to find killers? It seems like a terrorist is going for mass destruction, and an assassin usually strikes one goal in a non-spectacular manner. But Gere is the only person Willis ever saw, according to the FBI. I thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the great movie "Day of The Jackal", but this movie is just a stupid version of "Assassins" with Stallone and Banderas. Both of these movies are really stupid and part of the stupidity is that we as the audience are forced to watch Bruce Willis go through his routines and we must say, "Wow! Isn't he smart!" THE PROFESSIONAL with Jean Reno was a much better movie about murderers. "The Jackal" is just a movie about two fat middle-aged millionaire actors who can be paid to stand and look beautiful and pretend to be smart! The Jackal is so poor that I expected to see Sly Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Jean Clod Van Dumme, appearing as "other" hitmen or FBI. Needless to say, "The Jackal" has escaped the FBI for twenty-five years, but as soon as Richard Gere comes to work, it is only a few days before the "Jackal" is broken! I think the positive message of this movie is: "Thanks to terrorists, our streets are safe from murderers." Overall, the "Jackal" has no redeeming features.
