You can only describe it with one word and it will be WOW! Wow, I really didn't think a piece of crap like this could ever be released. Looking at a movie titled Ninja, you expect to see at least some cool martial artists right? However, none of these guys know any martial arts and they seem to have gone to China and the first people they saw on the streets and trained them for a day in martial arts, this is the level of their martial arts ! The actors are very over, the special effects are ridiculous and there is no plot that makes sense. This is the worst martial arts movie I've ever seen and I've seen enough!
