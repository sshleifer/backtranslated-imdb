forgive my spelling. It's probably the funniest horror movie ever existed. Think Evil * 1000. The acting is terrible, you can see the makeup line on a certain woman's face. There is a lesbian scene, which doesn't make sense at all. And the end, haha ​​ohhhh the end ... be prepared to hurt your stomach of laughter. If you watch this movie for more than 5 minutes and still expect something, look at yourself and ask what the hell is wrong with you. It's a very bad movie meant to laugh and enjoy its purity. <br /> <br /> Don't forget to watch all the trips to the movie, you can only see how low the budget was for the whole thing. All this movie is a rare jewel to demonstrate the pure and udder lack of talent / care / ability / money and anything else you ever need to make a successful movie. But it's definitely worth watching.
