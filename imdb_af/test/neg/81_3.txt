Okay, so it will never change the world, and it bombed at the till room, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those movies I fell in love with a child (the BBC showed it several times during the 1980s and I had a high quality VHS tape in the machine - fortunately, it!) and looked endlessly. I watched the DVD last night and unfortunately the time was not as good as it would be. Either this or I just grew out of this kind of broad, dull humor. Come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate to laugh, he gives us approaches to novelty breaks with a spectacular slogan, what can you say about the role play or script? Certainly, it is ambitious, interesting, unusual and vast, but it is never laughing out loud at all. I will describe it as a children's movie with a few 'adult' earphones - you can let your young people watch safely, despite the 15 certificate. They won't get the drug referrals, don't worry about it. I had a pleasant surprise when I realized that I just forgot how good the title song and songwriter driver was, "Everybody's faster, faster" song, and not the town of Ticlaw's patriotic anthem. The whole film gives praiseworthy performances, photography is sharp and the atmosphere of the different places is perfect. There is a real capsule about the fashions, the cars, the gadgets (especially the dashboard-mounted drum machine), the interiors and the pop culture references - I was more than a little surprised to hear that the nutty bum in the bench aloud everyone said, "I'm OJ Simpson!", especially now, Simpson's legal process has overshadowed his sporting achievements. The noise is, there is almost no plot to speak of, it is too obvious to be greasy and not funny enough to elicit real laugh. I wish I had left this one as a pleasant memory.
