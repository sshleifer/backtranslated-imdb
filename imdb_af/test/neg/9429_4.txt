If good intentions made a movie good, then this movie might be one of the greatest films ever made. The film has major actors, a master director, an important theme. At least an important theme, undertones of fifties existential world powers, air guards that must excite both senses and imagination, and characters over which one cares. It's about patriotism and patriotism in a healthy way. <br /> <br /> Not quite ten years after the film I knew Air Force officials who told me R.O.T.C. class at university. They were intellectual. They thought deeply about their work. They have sense of humor. One was a crew member on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb. I wondered if one of them died in Vietnam. I think they were flying missions there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie fails. The film lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling and celebration of the much patriotism that underlines the narrative. No actress is worse used than June Allison in this movie. Her Susan Holland is a woman you would flee, not embrace. COL. James Stewart (who as a colonel) makes a good sting in this role as Lt. Col (and later Kol.) Hollandse Holland. But the most interesting thing he does in the roll is biting into a sandwich. I'm not joking. Stewart was good as bites in sandwiches as he did in the Spirit of Saint Louis. <br /> <br /> One might think of Ted Williams, but I don't do when I Steward not watching. I think of William Holden as Lt. Harry Brubaker in The Bridges at Toko-Ri. The comparison is not good for Mr. Stewart, who has disappeared in this movie. <br /> <br /> The screen of a B-36 looks like outtakes of advertising for an airline. Although beautiful, the aerial photographs are commonplace. For the time being, they could have impressed viewers. The accident in Greenland involves unspeakable modeling. You expect the outcome to be good. <br /> <br /> The undertone - the subtext - for the film agrees on the tedium that air force planes had to feel during their long missions and the banality the Air Force used to make its business - good business like any other business . One thinks how a La Nouvelle Vague director can explore this theme and then start thinking how one imagined this film was filmed. Little moments are missed. When teams returned from long missions, the crew members had a shot of a shot and a massage before spending the mission. This may have helped. <br /> <br /> Banality was the image the Air Force wanted and Mr. Mann accommodated the buyer. Maybe the movie works, but not for me. <br /> <br /> I mourn when I watch the movie, because I think we all, director, actors, crew, viewers and members of the armed services may enjoy and get much more than we get here. <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie had to be dr. Strangelove or 2001, both endure it, but it has potential never realized. Yet I enjoy watching. I think of the pilots on their long missions and the ground teams in secluded places. There is a certain honor celebrated here and I celebrate that honor. <br /> <br /> I understand why people who appreciate this movie here and elsewhere appreciate it. If there were no deliberate fraud, it would get a 10 of me. <br /> <br />.
