<br /> <br /> In Japan and elsewhere in Europe, new technology is able to bypass filmmakers the closed store of the Hollywood mainstream and avoid Ed Wood as visible low budget production values ​​to produce compelling films. What a shame that in the UK we can find examples such as "Avatar" (name of a lot of video game) where brave attempts are made to imitate as many movies - and console games that are loved by girlfriends - these are cheap photocopies of clichés abundant as testosterone fueled kangaroos. Look at a bit of synopsis: <br /> <br /> "Set in futuristic London, 2024, it tells the story of a team of virtual reality virus extenders confronted by the ultimate internet virus." <br /> <br /> Go back and read the quote again - avoid guffawing - and try to find a single original idea in it. It should have been a tired, sad concept in 1993. Without doing so. Oh, but there is more - the 'ultimate virus' has already let aircraft fly, the air traffic center, etc. Developed by a 'child genius', it manifests itself as a rogue dressed, athletic, mammalian discount Lara Croft imitator that makes a good line in the cord and cod. Martial arts move straight out of the playground - the living product of adolescent fantasy. Oh, and she is accompanied by 'Predator' such as sound effects to emphasize her remarkable powers. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has a 'futuristic' vision of beautiful originality - the Lloyds building, which is filtered with AfterEffects, is somewhat green. The budget really shows - which does not belong to this day and age. Overall, a senseless mess of cheese, ham and cliché that Roger Corman would have left in his most shameless, desperate moments on the cutter floor. Shame that such an alleged labor of love delivered nine minutes of wasted celluloid. <br /> <br />
