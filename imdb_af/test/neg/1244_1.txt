What on this earth! This piece of gambling theater would have been suitable for the lifetime network. Michael Imperoli is a good actor, but I think his portrayal as "Stu" has become short. These settings were unbearable and too much. The supporting role, where are you? Whoever did the casting should be partially guilty. The cinematography was useless. A dice story with an aftercare feels it. Stories of this kind must be left for the Oliver Stone's of the world. It will still suck ass, but it will be nice to watch. It was an attempt that lost its wheels before the race ever started. Mario Andretti in the 1982 Indy 500 came to mind.
