With Matthias Hues on the cover and only $ 3.00, I had to buy it. I enjoyed a few moments, such as Hawks' annoyance with the pleasure dryers, but I just really looked at the scene of Matthias Hues. I especially enjoyed the show at the end. It was a cross between Clint Eastwood's "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" and "For a Few Dollars Tomorrow" (a 3-man race, with a musical pocket watch used as the counter). In addition, there is nothing more I can add. The actors performed well (except the "Assassin Droid" whose performance was nothing out of comic), but the film had no real depth and purpose; Simply not enough to fill 1 hour and a half of the standard movie time, so we get stuck with the main characters moving them for about an hour or so from place to place until the ball rolls. For example, the main character returns about 4 times to the same strip club, and takes two fifths of the movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery really had depth and creativity, probably due to the movie budget. I don't think we've ever seen this "perfect city" of New Angeles, about which the main characters have finally reached New Angeles. It was in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and roads. hardly the kind of kingdom that the owner / creator of a whole city would live. The "super high security" of New Angeles was also always spoken, but only a total of 15, perhaps 20, security guards were counted even when the alarm went off; not even near Matthias' approach to "at least a hundred men out there". <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of any of the actors / actresses in this movie, you may see it just to add it to the list. However, if you appreciate 1 and a half hours of your time, or $ 3.00 of your money, you can give this one a miss.
