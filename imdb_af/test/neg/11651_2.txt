This movie was useless. I can't even call it sci-fi, as it requires more of a movie than just space. "Max Q" is not even put into space for the whole movie. The story / plot is unmistakable, the role-play is nothing to write home, although it would be strange with a peak in a mediocre movie ... Furthermore, it is not very exciting or well-told. At least it is evenly balanced in a low-quality kind of way, in that nothing or no one stands out. Everything is equally dull. I usually get some quality in "space flakes", even though it is only 90 minutes' half-entertainment pathetic on low budget, but "Max Q" didn't even give me the satisfaction. All in all, a total waste of time.
