Wow, what's on the shelves of the video rental store in front of me? Nothing but a dubious "sequel" up to 8MM. It was not a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definite end and an abundance of emotional depth was much larger than this movie. In the first place, from the plot exposition, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiance, Tish Harrington, venture into the miserable underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who they are having a porn video with a prostitute, Risa, scare them. The whole story is based on the different characters that make up these different sex clubs and slips throughout the city. The mystery is solved when Tish finally realizes that the ransom money for the video and (especially later in the story) her fiance who came out of her trust fund basically goes back to her future husband as the story. unfold to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> I didn't like how it had nothing to do with the original 8MM. The only thing close to the original is the kind of excitement it was, the fact that David ended up with some kind of slavery about him to keep him captive, looks like the kinky world of the first movie and the fact that the The whole movie depicted sex through almost every important scene. Otherwise, it's a totally different movie. It made for a bad love story, even before the end is known, which makes the end more possible because I don't believe the words of David's mouth all the time. But we were warned that he was a liar over most things that could get him in trouble. <br /> <br /> In most of the "shocking" moments of the film, there were ridiculous naaktonele that tried to stir emotions in the audience to encourage Tish to figure out the plot so she " hell "can leave sex loss. I counted at least 11 ridiculously played series when there was nothing but sex to be shown. Even the menu on the DVD is nothing but movie with naked women to make the DVD very challenging. <br /> <br /> David was not a heroic person throughout the film. You can guess he was the biggest problem long before the end. The actors who played every role were all new to me, explaining how they got so many of them to pick up to get a respect. There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so investigated in the dam trying to find a prostitute?) There were cute tech moments ( like the talk email program dressed as a bondage queen, and a gay brother character who shows nothing but how the director tried to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. The tagline that appears on this profile is also a complete BS for this video because it wasn't even a last breath. Nobody really dies. But they had a good car accident series that came out of nowhere ... but it was a good 10 seconds out of an hour and 3/4 long movie. <br /> <br /> Go hire (and maybe buy) the original. It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films. It all got better from this movie. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to compare oranges with oranges.
