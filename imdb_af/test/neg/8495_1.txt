This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. I say this without hyperbola, and believe me, I've seen very bad movies. It is embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars have gone into this film and that hundreds (thousands?) Of craftsmen have spent so much time working on what the writers and producers MUST have known would be a colossal failure. <br /> <br /> When a 90 minute movie feels this long, exhausted, boring and incomprehensible, you know that something went wrong. Also, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I enjoyed elsewhere) is just awful in this role; Of course, he was never given a screen test, because no producer in their right mind would entertain him in any way, especially in the cover of The Mask. Simply awful. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can't wait to see the reviews of major film critics, because I know they do a better job than tearing this train wreck. /> <br /> The producers of this film should be ashamed, and more importantly, may NOT make theater films again.
