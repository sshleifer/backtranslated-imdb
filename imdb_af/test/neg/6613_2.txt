This movie probably looks like a good idea in pre-production. "Let's make a movie about one of the biggest and most controversial athletics coaches of the modern era! And let's throw Brian Dennehey as Coach Bobby Knight!" That's where this movie went terribly wrong. Why is an actor throwing no light on the man he portrays? And then why doesn't this actor change his character in a Coach Knight, but Brian Dennehey in a red jersey? Watching this movie on ESPN, I didn't believe myself to believe this man was actually Coach Knight. He doesn't look like him, talk like him, act like him or even walk like him. I couldn't get past this fact, so I couldn't enjoy the movie. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as criminals Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, we didn't care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters, because most of us had never heard of these men until we watched movie. But with someone who is visible in today's media as Coach Knight, you need to do better. When Anthony Hopkins was thrown as Nixon, it was the same situation. But, Anthony Hopkins made us believe he was actually Nixon. This he didn't even try. What may have been a good movie has become acidic. In addition to the fact that this movie tried to do the four words that "Saving Private Ryan" did for dissolution, it stank. Too little of the real Coach Knight and too much mockery for the sake of shock value, this movie has been switching off halfway through the broadcast in a season. The only good thing about this is that it is a television movie. I didn't need my hard-earned money on this piece of waste.
