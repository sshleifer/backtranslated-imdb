It was a decent movie for the first half. Too much cheap BOO! moments but the tension builds, the bad guys are creepy and everything looks like they are getting up well. The kids are not very deep, but hey, it works for teenagers. <br /> <br /> Then it just becomes ridiculous and tries it too hard - the "why in the world will he / she do it?" Moments overpower anyone's ability to suspend unbelief. The strife involves too many ridiculous accusations. The title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some sense in the film that is going nowhere and is being dropped. There was laughter in the theater at moments that were by no means supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> Great foreground, but only badly written and disagree. Some very nice shots, but they are hard to enjoy while you roll your eyes.
