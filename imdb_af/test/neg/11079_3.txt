A group of plots with a sad history take a writer on a "hairy" adventure through an unknown cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and successors and movie companies are trying to cash in on any winning combination of movie components. The Cavern has had only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave films over the past few years. An X file. I like to give each movie the benefit of the doubt, but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. The camera work can give you a headache because it seems to constantly confuse which path is up. It is not really for me whether the filming was realistic. There are far too many unnecessary PANNICK of so-called experienced lots, in the last half you say aloud one of two things ?? Oh, just stop and concentrate to save yourself, or I hope you all die at the end. It was very annoying for these decent actors to make this movie. A moderate amount of gore and nothing special in dialogue or characters. While you're pretty sure, you know what's going on, explaining all the details over the last five minutes. But I would have had a better opinion of the movie if they had left the cutroom floor last minute. It just wasn't necessary. I suggest that you be eliminated immediately after your suspicions have been confirmed and save you the sequel to the successor. I have long thought that the movie industry should share a modified restaurant industry's cashier scheme. You pay for the material to make the movie before you go, but any profits for the movie come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema. I can't blame what I didn't like about this movie on its low budget.
