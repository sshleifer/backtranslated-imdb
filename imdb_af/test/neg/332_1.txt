In the early 70's, I knew Brad Linaweaver in Florida State when he was an inspiring, inventive writer I thought to get greater glory. <br /> <br /> That's why I rented this video. Well, now, time wasn't good for Mr. Linaweaver. I think the pressure of life makes higher aspirations possible. Another flower of which the flower came and became unnoticed in the summer breeze. Amen. There is nothing more to say. And nothing more to add. A sad drawing on a one-time flowering career as mentioned above. But this is the price one pays to chase shadows without a solid foundation or goals for yourself in life. Because this movie has no purpose, no purpose, and I told myself, what happened to Brad's creativity, his one-off glamor? Gone, gone, years of neglect worsened his once-off shining mind.
