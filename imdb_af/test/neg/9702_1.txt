I think this is something the Bollywood "Bride and Prejudice" has been more faithful to the source material than this Hollywood version did in 2005. I also laughed more at the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you've read the book or seen the 1995 version of the BBC (and liked it), you'll soon be up for a nasty surprise. However, my friend, who also didn't see, was almost amused by the movie. However, if you are a JAE Austen purisus, or even a filmmaker who does not like the historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to go through it. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the writing. The writing was the biggest problem. I think the actors would not have done so much if they had a decent manuscript, perhaps written by someone who actually loved Austen's work. <br /> <br /> What travesties have been committed? Well, you will be forced to endure such incredible lines as: "Don't dare judge me, Lizzy!" and "Leave me alone for once in your life!" Not only are such lines far from anything that could come from Jane Austen's eloquent pen, but can anyone honestly believe that words like those from the mouth of a cheerful young woman flush out of the Regency era? The use of modern colloquialism is one of the most annoying ways in which the screenwriter strikes the book. The author also decided to give characters lines that were completely different in the book and all for no apparent purpose. Worse of all, if they try to keep a little closer to the book's writing, the scriptwriter has a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen's phrases and replacing uncomfortable synonyms for her already perfect words. It was as if the scriptwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when the script was written. Stick to Austen's words; she did it better than you! I suppose this was all done in a "revisionist" spirit and in an attempt to leave this movie from the iconic 1995 BBC version. For me, however, it also made a transvesty of the true spirit of Austen's most beloved work. <br /> <br /> The casting had potential, though it quickly pushed away as soon as the writing started. But Keira, giggling Excessively and to burst your crooked teeth is not equal to charm and vivacity! And I think Mr. McFayden, although I find him quite attractive enough, read his writing incorrectly and was under the impression that he was playing Heathcliff and not the formidable Mr. Darcy not. I really enjoy Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who Collins played. Their interpretations were really refreshing. <br /> <br /> Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Someone described his performance as a hobo who accidentally sat on the movie and I have to say this is an appropriate description. And can anyone tell me why they formed Wickham after Legolas? Although he was in the movie for less than two minutes, I did, and without his impressive archery skills, gain the film. <br /> <br /> On a wardrobe letter I would say to me. Kill Bingley's dresses because they were wonderful. and will fit more into the modern age. (A sleeveless Regency evening dress? Please! More Versace than Austen, that's for sure) And poor Keira, all the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they finally caught the bastard who stole the one hairbrush from the movie set. Unfortunately, they didn't catch him soon to fight the actresses' steps before roles were rolled. <br /> <br /> In short, with this new Hollywood version, Adenie's eloquence, subtlety and know-how offer you the complete opposite.
