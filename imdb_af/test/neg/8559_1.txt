I spent the past 5 years in the entertainment industry and recently worked for the company that made this movie. It's a VERY sorry because I love these people, I just can't believe. Anyone can make everything so bad. Like this? !!!! It was crazy about every possible angle. From camera work to dialogue to costumes and production design, one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The actors in this movie looked as if they were shot straight from a porn shot in the San Fernando Valley and put on a set with a less talented team. <br /> <br /> I just can't touch on the fact that I have put on the best materials I've ever read and had contacts in the industry that could help me realize my dream and make every roadblock possible has? Yet people behind this spectacle of a movie have no problems collecting it, and sleeping well after being released. <br /> <br /> Living, what a journey!
