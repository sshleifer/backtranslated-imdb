Wow, what a bad movie. Not scary at least, and hardly understandable. The plot doesn't coincide at all, and the play is absolutely terrible. What is the line of a famous critic? "She runs the emotional spectrum from A to B." Yup. It's about it. Not even good for camp value! I didn't expect Oscar material, but it? And yes, her friend is a ghost? You must have the IQ of a particularly silly mollusc to not see one. <br /> <br /> This movie (and I rather use it word) is an insult to the movie. If only someone involved in it knew how to tie the narrative together! It gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there is nothing lower. On the bright side - at least it's not a full two hours.
