I think if you like snowboarding, you can get some enjoyment if you look beautiful and some beautiful tricks. But that's all the movie has to offer. the story line was not there, and any jokes that were in the movie were not funny, even on a sympathetic level. I also didn't like the characters, but the main actor (Adam Grimes) tried his best and for a comedy like this didn't have to be much, but when he was surrounded by so many other bad actors, he had no hope had to make this movie good. . but I shouldn't be too hard on them, because all I know can have a lot of skill, but with a script I could write in ten minutes, the skills they had ran and raced for fear. to appear in this movie. . my advice is not looking, i wish i never did!
