Very stupid high school / teen flicker over geeks to prove themselves better than the rich brats. Sounds familiar? This television movie by director Rod Amateau ("Uncommon Valor" and a few "Dukes of Hazaard" episodes believe it or not) say nothing, do nothing and will definitely entertain very little. <br /> <br /> Striking for his "who's who? of the television being played, including Michael J. Fox, Bob Denver (" Gilligan ") and Todd Bridges (" Various Strokes "), this lame effort falls barely over the line, also stars Anthony Edwards ("ER"). <br /> <br /> Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video
