I wondered when someone tried to turn the entire Matamoros debris into a goreporn peak. Anyroad, here are some things I learned about Mexico to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> ~ All Mexican Women Are Super Warm - Remember the little desert town in Unearthed? Yes, well, it must be the Mexican sister city. Don't even bother with the hookers, just move a few smooth movements on the hot bartender. She will be as hot as the prostitutes and probably has no children! <br /> <br /> ~ Half of Mexico is controlled by crazy Satan-worshiping Palo Mayom cultists. Â¡Ay, karamba! The other half, as everyone here in the US knows, is managed by drug dealers. Fortunately, it doesn't affect much the sex tourism trade and our ultra-low wage factories there. <br /> <br /> ~ Mexican police officers are useless. Don't go to them. Go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask for the hot chick behind the counter that happened to your lost friend. She would be much more helpful than the police. <br /> <br /> ~ If you're terribly tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cysts, don't really see the Psalms or any part of the Bible. You'll just mess the mojo.
