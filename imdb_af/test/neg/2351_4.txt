Subspecies are presented in Romania where two American colleagues Michele (Laura Mae Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride) study local folklore at local friend Mara (Irina Movila). There they live in a hotel and are curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle. It appears that a strong and angry Vampire named Radu (Anders Hove) lives there who stole the Bloodstone of his father King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm). . Radu takes the three girls fine and starts drinking the blood of Mara & Lillian. Meanwhile, Michele falls for a man named Stefan (Michael Watson) who is just Radu's brother. Michele & Stefan decide to collect and dispose of the world of evil Radu. <br /> <br /> Directed by Ted Nicolaou, this movie seems to be very high among genre fans and although it is not terrible, I will definitely not 'I call it very good and I couldn't really see anything excited to touch. Subspecies are a fairly slow movie, not so much and while trying to stay close to some classic Vampire Lore, there is all this nonsense about a Bloodstone and some small monsters that somehow come from the tips from Radu's cut fingers grow. Subspecies could have been a half-decent movie if it's not boring, I can't really remember it either good or bad. The character is good, but some are the dialogue, and there is a scene that bent me near the beginning when the girls were at the castle ruins. And one says they have to go because it gets dark, but it's still clear in the middle of the day. very bright. There is also a scene where one of the American girls finds a coffin that is the hotel's attic and doesn't really seem to be bothered by it. I'm not funny, but are a few whose house I was on a coffin in his attic. Be very, very worried if you know what I mean. I don't think I will ever see it again, there is no real threat, the plot is weak which combines classic Vampire themes with silly subplots. I was clearly unaware of that. Not the worst movie, but not the best movie either. <br /> <br /> The movie looks good with beautiful places and some local scenery, though you feel the look is budget-friendly, rather than the creators trying a authenticity. There are not many gores apart from a hood and some broken finger tips. For no apparent reason, the makers throw some average stop-moving animated monsters that really do nothing or have much meaning for the story. <br /> <br /> Filmed on the cheap by Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment production company in Bucharest in Romania, the production values ​​are good and better than many later day Band productions. The acting is not good, as many of the role players are under paraphernalia while genre regular Angus Scrimm has a small como. There is a little style here on occasion with a few plays reminiscent of the original Nosferatu (1922), especially the little Radu's shadow in the stairs with the long claw like fingernails stands out. <br /> <br /> Subspecies are a movie that seems to be very much for reasons I don't quite see. I thought it was stormy and overall dull. Followed by Bloodstone: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) and the spin0off film Vampierjournals (1997).
