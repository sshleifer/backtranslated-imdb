Remains of an ambassador unit prompted a group of cowboys to fight their Indians on the war path. It seems to be an exciting western, but this one is boring, boring and boring. It moves like molasses, the action scenes are oninspired, the acting is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even photography is not very good. Eastwood plays in an early role an ex-Confederate who doesn't like the idea of ​​fighting on the same side as Yankees. It's about the only remote situation in the whole movie, but Eastwood wasn't enough to experience an actor to pick it up, and his character is over as an evil man rather than angry or bitter. A very ordinary western. Actually, a lot less than ordinary Western. A look is if you are a naughty Eastwood fan and want to see him at the start of his career. Otherwise, don't bother.
