The movie moves pretty well, but the acting, direction and editing leave much to be desired. The characters are mostly raised from other movies and the Vinnie Jones lookalike is straight from Gone in 50 Seconds. The comedy gangster movie is a genre that must have a lot of contrast, the stupid dealers in Lock Stock and the shootings that leave everyone dead. You should never really know if you have to laugh or just sit there in shock. This movie has the right elements, but it is too easy to sit there like a person breaking and tutoring the small details that had to be stuck somewhere along the line and once the faith has been left unattended critical. Sorry, it was a brave effort and although Clint Eastwood is famous for saying it would be good for a scene, he does the job before he shoots and he is Clint Eastwood. Here a little more imagination with the camera and a little more coaching and rehearsal for delivering the lines would have made a big difference.
