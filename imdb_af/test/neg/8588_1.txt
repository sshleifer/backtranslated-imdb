Another lame effort to make a movie "gritty" and "thought provoking" - whatever the hell it means. They said Al Pacino said many words such as: "Television killed soccer." Yes, whatever. It's another movie that shows Oliver Stone's Delusions or Grandeur. If Stone tries to show us that football is going to be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stamped camera movements and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Diaz for purely aesthetic reasons. It's a shame that Diaz and Pacino have to face a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Since the time of "Scent of Woman", writers and directors Pacino used to romanticize their pathetic lines. His characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices are usually redundant and thin. He has to rediscover himself and show how he can act without shouting. He has to stop being sorry for hokey scripts with cheese lessons like "Organized soccer is mess" and act on a good story.
