I realize that a period piece is expensive to make, and that this shooting art (near framed shots to camera, moving camera, wide aperture shots, washed out) allows such movies to be made for a prize. As a style, it has advantages and disadvantages like any other, allowing more periods to be made. Like any style, it has its opponents and supporters. There are probably even those who believe that this way of shooting has an artistic foundation. <br /> <br /> If only some of the money saved was spent on writing For whatever style is used, a movie has good writing and good acting. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is usually very good. The writing less so. It is made up of a collection of bits taken from the book and many that are relevant to the plot are omitted, making it a diverse collection of scenes with little or no continuity. <br /> <br /> If you have read the book, it should not be under any circumstances. If you haven't read the book, it's easy to be content and nothing better to do, there's no reason to look at it, but be prepared to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> It could have been so much better.
