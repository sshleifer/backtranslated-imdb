The BBC and the Arts and Entertainment Network should be ashamed of themselves to bring this unfortunate production to the world. The acting, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, is at best amateur and ominously painful. The costumes are over-the-top and have some real malice. Was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Certainly, EVERY woman in Bath didn't have feathers in her head in the early 19th century. The production values ​​are poor and the pacing of the film makes it feel like it was hasty and unclear at the last minute. Quite a malicious movie I had to force myself to look to the end. This is a pity, because the producers of course spent a lot of money on costumes and shooting. Compared to Emma Thompson's sublime "Sin and Sensibility" or the extraordinary 1995 production of "Pride and Prejudice" or the subtle intensity of 1995's "Persuasion", this production by Northanger Abbey has ruled Jane Austen in her grave.
