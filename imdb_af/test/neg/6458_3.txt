The role of Buddy Ackerman is no stretch for Kevin Spacey. He played several versions of that character, other, better movies. It is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance, without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as any other character in this useless little farce. The writing leaves little time for plot or character development, like a porn movie in his hurry to get the good stuff. The difference is that here the "good things" are not people that make each other enjoyable but painful, which makes it appropriate for young adults. <br /> <br /> Of course there is nothing wrong with a porn movie if you want to see how people have sex, and I think there's nothing wrong with "Swimming with Sharks" if you want to see people physically, emotionally and undergoing psychological torture. But if you are looking for insightful satire, interesting characters or something that even tries to involve more than your basic passions, you should probably look elsewhere.
