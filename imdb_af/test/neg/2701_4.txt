So far, I don't like every Jean Rollin movie I've seen, and it has always bothered me because he's a well-known Euro-Trash monument and very popular with many regular reviewers on this beautiful website. people whose opinions I always appreciate and usually agree. Apparently, everyone always seems to find some kind of sombre and stylistic filming of brands in his work that is completely lost to me. Rollin's films are incredibly boring, they all have the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in different institutions), the dialogue is incredibly absurd, the gorgeous Gothic environment is always underutilized and the production values ​​are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. I've already surrendered to Rollin's repertoire (especially after "Iron Iron" stands) until I found out about "Night of the Hunted". This film does not have a lame lesbian vampire and stands as a bona fide horror movie with horrific murders and macabre plots. And the verdict is ?? yes and no! On the one hand, it is undoubtedly the most compelling and inventive Rollin movie I liked (and the only one I watch without going down). On the other hand, it remains a moronic movie with an unbeatable plot and emotional sex sequences to compensate for the dull. Jean Rollin is trying hard to create an atmosphere of secrecy and tension, mostly through a lack of information and vaguely set-up characters, but barely succeeds in hiding the fact that he really does not have a story. The stunningly beautiful main actress Brigitte Lahaie and the beautiful ominous musical lead are the only elements that will tie you to the screen. During a night drive back to Paris, a young man suddenly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes out of the bush. Her name is Elisabeth, but she can't remember anything about herself and who or what she ran away from. Her case of amnesia is so bad that she even constantly forgets what picked her up. The next day she was kidnapped again by an old man and taken to a sinister residential complex where several people were held in the same bizarre spiritual condition. Elisabeth knows nothing, but she has a sense of escape. Of course, I will not disclose the denial, but I can assure you it is quite stupid, illogical and far-fetched. Apparently Rollin realized this too, because the explanation is kept very short and fast. There are a large number of exaggerated and senseless sequences, the sex record is scarce and filmed without passion, the nasty makeup effects seem cheap and randomly thrown without real purpose. As said, the score is fascinating and Brigitte Lahaie's perfect body is addictive to shine.
