Man kills bear. Man becomes bear. Man / bear meets bear. Man / bear is wearing man / bear after meeting. The end. Seriously, this is the whole plot of this movie. Yes, I have simplified it to an extreme, but you get the picture. I just wish I didn't see it. <br /> <br /> The "man / bear" refers to a native American Indian who kills a cub of a cub. And while it may be, it's certainly not necessary to really sign up to the potential conflict between the two parties. Plus, there was some abuse of the two moose in the movie. But it is out of the point. <br /> <br /> Overall, many under par. Certainly, much more needed to be entertaining. Perhaps more of the secondary characters and more drama laugh between the two main legs. That's what bad movies separate from the good ones. "D"
