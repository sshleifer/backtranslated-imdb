Okay, I've seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror / suspense movies, because I recently worked on several 50 pack collections, and I have to say the guy has a limited range, but he was good at what he did. He wasn't Karloff, but the PRC was happy to have him. <br /> <br /> But the poor man was caught in a kind of the backwater ghetto of horror movies, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest .... not with the Wire not-easy screens and directions and budgets he worked on. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> The movie is good, slow, stodgy and unexciting for the most part. The "heroine" seems to be doomed to be a rent-a-center version of Judy Garland, the "hero" is leaf like white rice, and the poor guy who plays the monster doesn't even get a good one transformation scene from the agreement. His makeup effects are not scary at all - he looks like a slightly more rugged version of a farm hand, everything is. <br /> <br /> It's not a total waste. Zucco looks good on camera, he chews the landscape as he manages a terribly affected and confronted speech without flowing or losing the flow. There are some moody B & W shots here and there that don't suck completely. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie has helped a few "C" by a "Z" player who pays their rent for another month, and it never falls below a certain quality . Watch it once you like George Zucco, or just feel the need to see every wolfman-themed movie ever made.
