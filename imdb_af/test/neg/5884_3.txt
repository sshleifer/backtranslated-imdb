The title is a misnomer: the film barely shows one year of the so-called "divin marquis". It was a difficult time for him because he was threatened by the guillotine: the silent joys of Terror's rule. <br /> <br /> Historically, the background is: "The fÃªte De l'et re supreme", Robespierre's failed attempt to create a secular religion, has given a heaven opportunity to Dr. Guillotin's sinister machine at work show (full speed). <br /> <br /> As far as Sade is concerned, it is a fair mediocre relationship: he is waiting in a former nunery with other nobles, a golden loft if you compare it, says Marie-Antoinette or scientific Lavoisier's fate, and he exchanges useless conversations with a young virgin about death, love and other trivia. There is the mandatory "risky" scene, but you have to be patient because it is long before it comes on the screen. And anyway, by today's standards, can we call that risque? Cy Enfield's "De Sade", which enjoys one of the lowest ratings of the IMDb, is at least entertaining, and Keir Dullea was a more credible market than the obsolete Auteuil. And this has marked John Huston.
