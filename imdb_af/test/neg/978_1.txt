I watched "Deadly Voyage" because David Suchet was there after enjoying himself in the "Poirot" series. And Joss Ackland is always worth watching, so I went into the movie expecting it to be a worthwhile one. Oh, it wasn't to be. <br /> <br /> I won't criticize the representations, the pacing, the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the movie; others here have already given their views on these elements. The only thing I want to address is the film's message, as it introves in the intro that it is based on a true story, and in it the film's supposed importance depends. <br /> <br /> "Deadly Voyage" focuses mainly on an impoverished black African man named Kingsley who wants to move to the US because he believes he can make money there. Nothing more, nothing less - his motivation is completely selfish. (Of course some people will prevail by saying he did it for his family, but he certainly had children on the income he could make in Ghana so he really just created his own problem.) Kingsley decided to board of a Russian truck tied to New York. In the process of doing so, he is faced with difficult circumstances, racist crew members and other challenges. <br /> <br /> But that's exactly where the movie leaves me unsympathetic. Why should the audience care about Kingsley? Simple because he has a purpose? The goals of the ship's captain or the woman he left at his home with his newborn child are not such a rare commodity. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US government. It's also illegal because it steals from the Russian shipping company. Making it to the US would mean that he would take out a system he hadn't tackled. And if caught, the company will be fined $ 45,000. I doubt many of the stewards are concerned about what their chosen course of action costs someone else; They are obviously just out for their own profit. He could have won the $ 1,000 he won at the start of the film in the lottery, for legal traffic to the US, and applied for residence and work permit. Instead, he takes the illegal (and dangerous) route. <br /> <br /> So since Kingsley's journey is illegal, selfish and cannot be ethically justified, why should we care about him or his trials? Simply because he faces challenges? Why should its challenges be privileged to meet the challenge of the Russian shipping company to come to New York without stowage? Because he is black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be because Danny Glover (the film's executive producer) and others are involved, want us to root Kingsley, as if he's a hero on some noble journey. But once you accept that illegal immigration, theft and the fool's mission are not noble, you can't really care for him. <br /> <br /> Before anyone plays the race card, I assure you that I have the same feeling regardless of the ethnicity / nationality of the parties involved. Imagine whether a British person has decided to hide in a train that led to Bhutan, cross the border, and collect "unwanted" Buddhist antiquities to buy back Britain to sell. How much sympathy can the challenges he faces be generated? Very little, I want to bet. So why should we feel different about Kingley? Because he is black? Because he is poor according to US standards? The filmmakers are giving their opinion that the goals justify the means and that a $ 45,000 fine is fined by a shipping company compared to the remote possibility that an unskilled worker earns a little more in the US than what he could have if he just stayed in his own homeland. I didn't buy it for a moment.
