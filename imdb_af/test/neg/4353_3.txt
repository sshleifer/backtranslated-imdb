The Big Mes, a movie on the dark side of the Hollywood movie industry, is ironically much more like a filmed play than a movie itself. Aside from some very short expositional scenes, all the action takes place in the living room of the movie's hero, played by Jack Palance. He is a film actor who wants his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming features in the films they have printed. Her again, again wife (Ida Lupino) is also full of the studio, not to mention her husband's philandering ways. Unfortunately for both of them, the head of the studio (Rod Steiger) is a real bastard. He has blackmail material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract. But it's just a matter of time before he pushes the man too far. <br /> <br /> This movie is not, I do NOT repeat, a movie noir. On the contrary, it is an exceptional theater lounge melodrama. The plot runs at a snail's pace and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static setting and meticulously constructed blockage of the real scenes. The play is overwhelmed in the extreme, and moves sharply between out and out histrionics and softer, but no less unreliable, soliloquy, of course, meaning, but about the pretentious twaddle, especially in the hands of the sumptuous mistress Palance. Aldrich was obviously all for a stylized "something" here, but I even doubt he knew what it was and certainly the audience never did. <br /> <br /> I think the main lesson here is that movies and plays are many different mediums. What might have worked in a play did not appear to be even sophisticated or credible on film. The result? A great waste of time. There is little to enjoy here.
