I don't think I spoil someone's experience of this movie by saying that you shouldn't see it if you have something better to do, like clean under the stove. It gets dirty and you have to clean it one day. <br /> <br /> I think the movie suffers from a lack of gender and violence, although there is one car racing car that looks so dangerous. It can only be filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer. "Gargoyle's heart is in the right place, but its aspirations are conservative. At least that's not pretentious. But I had a good time playing it and playing the perennial idiot in the horror movie saying, "What's in the hole?" and die for his hubris. I also met Michael Pare. Every movie junkie must work with a B-film stacking at least once before death. And Romans are the most beautiful people I've met. Literally the most beautiful. Walking down the street in Bucarest: if 7 out of every 10 women are not quite beautiful, you walk down a street where I have not come across; and is comforted by the fact that at least 5 out of 10 are available for drinks. <br /> <br /> Part of the movie was originally shot in Casa Radio, a deserted, unfinished Classic Communist Block-Georg Nightmare building. intended to accommodate KGB propaganda operations, namely Radio Non-Free Europe. The building's five stories long and takes up a city block; Best of all, while radiating the Big Brotheresque State Resistance facade, it lies close to the city center, such as a post-apocalyptic ruin in cliff jungle and hemp plagued by dozens of gypsies and wildlife. Construction on Casa Radio was suspended when Caucescu and his wife performed on TV in 1989. There are still gaping holes falling from the sun-baked top floor (which offers surreal views of a modern quarter-mile concrete roof, decorated with prop and old motor vehicles, overlooking an invigorating old town) into the damp, flu basement. (which doubles in the movie for the Gargoyle lair.) No American rails or warning signs for Bucarest. <br /> <br /> Since the death of the Soviet Union, Casa Radio hosted several non-union filmshots, including "Highlander III". It's attractive to producers because it's a cheap place, massive scale and available space, bizarre look and free of charge insurance headache, as it's still state goods. Plus, no one complains if you don't clean up after your production. Anything left on the ground has been interpolated in the Gypsies resident's construction of their shanty town in this real urban jungle. <br /> <br /> During the shooting of "Gargoyle", an assistant director was bitten by a wild dog. The apples provided by catering are fitted into projections to keep the test dogs in the bay. I was also bitten by wild dogs in Bucarest, once in a bar (!) And once in a city park. I also survived two wreckage in two weeks, both in taxis. None of these were seen by the drivers involved in stopping the cars. <br /> <br /> GEEK NOTE: The Sci-Fi network or channel or whatever was one of the backgrounds of this movie (the smaller the budget, the more producers are set up), so it's a bit strange that no one had a problem with the original title, "Gargoyles", until it was almost time on the network, although Sci-Fi already had an unrelated series of that name. The title has changed relatively close to release somewhere, as I have a corrected copy with the previous title.
