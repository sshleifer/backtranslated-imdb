Am I the only one who thinks it's a bad movie? <br /> <br /> I admit that horror movies often miss things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects. But the way these shortcomings come together in this movie is surprisingly sad. Wretched story: The idea of ​​a raped vagina taking revenge by becoming a man, eating, sounding funny, but what the writer made of it is stupid. <br /> <br /> Bad scene: The actors move like puppets. They play and look like people who are really trying hard but failing to act. <br /> <br /> Bad FX: Especially the explosion of the Van looks inexpressibly cheap. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that a director who made some fine movies during his carrier changed over to such messy things.
