Extremely formal with cosmic-sized logical holes and a pretext for comedy. Aw, poor NYC lawyer! He just scrapes and when he gets a cut in pay, he's not going to get another job, even though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. We see him arguing in court so others get him up and congratulate him on his fiery winning delivery, but he can't stand anyone in his firm. At home, problems are ignored until people get out of the house. <br /> <br /> The only character you want to root is the final maid, who is a real person using logic and communication to survive in the world. How laughable the little girl has to bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on New Year's Eve because she feels sorry for them! (The bit is not played for laughs.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, just beat incredible and with a ** SPOILER ** finish, all-turn-180 degrees finish. How did they get the best stars for this? If I was at the studio, I would have sent this one back for a complete rewrite.
