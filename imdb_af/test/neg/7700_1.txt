There is nothing good to say about this movie. Read Revolution For the hell of it or any of its other writings. Abbie was often dismissed as the clown prince of the '60s, but he was a man of ideas who used his smartness, sense of humor and pop culture, and his flamboyant personality to pay attention to his ideas. The media has too often concentrated on the man, not the ideas, and that is also the problem with this movie. Later in his life he suffered from depression. But this movie is like a National Enquirer version of Abbie. He deserves better. If you don't know Abbie or his times, this movie won't help. <br /> <br /> This film lies. I give it a zero. <br /> <br />
