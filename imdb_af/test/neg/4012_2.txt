Altman is very proud of the fact that people in his movies talk about each other, because, he says, people do it alive. Well, people cough, burp, throw off, etc. The point is that just because people really do something, doesn't make compelling theater. This is a problem. <br /> <br /> The bigger problem is that it is not a very smart or direct or hit or relevant satire, in 1988 or 2004. Garry Trudeau still lives in the 1960s and thinks everyone but a small core of the Republican elected officials is a 60-year-old hippie liberal. I mean the man is still stretching his line - a character that is a complete anachronism, but Trudeau still employs him as if he is representative of a large line of American youth. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I'm a conservative, but I'm not saying it's bad, because it has a liberal bow. It can take a liberal branch and be funny and relevant, but it is not. It is primarily a vanity piece with a number of prominent well-known liberals (including the devastating, apostate Ron Reagan, Jr.). Sometimes it feels inscription and the rest of the time it has a snarky air of self-interest and aren't we so smart? <br /> <br /> Someone said that this show insists it follows a cult. I think his cult status is more desirable than it really is. I'm sure there are two or three people there who signed all the original episodes in 1988 and they still have, but if that is the standard, every show ever broadcast is to some extent a cult classic. If Tanner did not add the names Altman and Trudeau, it would be another forgotten HBO production from the 1980s. Instead, it is presented as a harsh, sharp political commentary by guys at the top of their game. However, the reality is so far from as possible. Pat Paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than Tanner ever was, and he's been dead for ten years.
