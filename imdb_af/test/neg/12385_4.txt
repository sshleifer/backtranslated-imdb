I like old "monster movies" for the pure camp value. This one set does not disappoint if you find that kind of thing amusing. <br /> <br /> The play is a pure 1950s stilted crap. You get used to it when you have seen enough of this ... the dialogue is very stupid and eventually forgotten. You're just there for the giant bird. <br /> <br /> The "science" in this movie is hilarious. A mundane, global bird that can manipulate anti-matter. The goal is to destroy people and eat people. " An alien who came to earth to nest. Some of the best scenes in the movie (which do not include the bird in them) include the "scientists" who explain what is going on. <br /> <br /> Much has been said about the ridiculous bird quarter. It looks like a new baby bird ... bare and ugly with folded feathers. It even looks like a hunger, malignant. But the bird scared the shit out of my three-year-old, who had big and terrible nightmares for the evening. It's a bit creepy. <br /> <br /> I was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg. (Somehow the egg is not protected by an antifreeze shield.) But I'm a bird lover, what can I say?
