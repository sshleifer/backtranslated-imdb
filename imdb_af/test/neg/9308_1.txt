Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - has no dust to start and just gets worse with age. This film proves he is completely poisonous. We can only hope it is his final movie and that his serious lack of success reduces his chances of financing for any future business. It is conceivable to think of 'Lightning Jack' and 'Les Patterson Saves the World' as the most abysmal example of Australian comedy. How tragic it is, with so many infinitely superior comic talents in Australia, Yahoo is giving such vehicles to express its brand-like school booty comedy. And to think - he had 7 years to write the script. True genius!
