Once upon a time, back in the 1940s, there lived an actress, Veronica Lake. A beautiful, talented young woman who was previously in great demand for great budget, Hollywood photos. Fast forward to the late 1960s, age, alcoholism and overall accidents hurt everyone's favorite actress. Now, a hasbeen, Miss Lake decides to follow in the footsteps of her peers (?) Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and fall back on good, reliable Horror. But meat festival? Really? She might not have been washed. To fine-tune this, Flesh Feast is a lifeless pole garbage, possibly one of the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. Lake plays a scientist, who plots with Nazis, to bring Hitler back to life, with experiments on the restoration of youth, that's right, virgins. Unless you're a big fan of Heather Hughes, run away and never look back !! <br /> <br /> I know very little about this Veronica Lake person as well as the 40's movie, but to think that such a successful career has actually become so crazy is actually pretty sad. Meat festival is almost impossible to go through, and almost I mean absolutely. Directed by Brad Grinter, director of Nudist Camp photos, and the man who made us the best B movie ever, Blood Freak, just a few years later. One has to wonder is what Blood Freak would have been if Grinter didn't work with Steve Hawkes? If so, then God will bless Steve Hawkes. You won't think that a religious, baptismal blood urge, Turkey monster, can be so much better than experiments with Maggots and Hitler, but it's really real. So you ever forget about this one and will find Blood Freak, it's just waiting to entertain you. Fast forward a few years later, Veronica Lake dies of Hepititas, broken and forgotten. The end. I hate you, Flesh Feast. 10/01
