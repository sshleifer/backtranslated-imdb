What an abomination. I am not the one who wants to claim the total veracity of a movie, but the plot and script of "Killing Zoe" is so artless that I stagger myself through the (mercifully) ninety minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Readers of these reviews will now have invented the plot: Zoe, a call girl who falls in love with the American safecracker Zed, is also an employee of the bank that Zed will help stakes Bastille Day hoist to rob. br /> <br /> The film covers the credibility of the film. Zed and Zoe's night of magic is highly prosaic, and Zoe's claims that he has experienced the orgasm of a lifetime seem as if the script's teenage fantasies are reflected more than any real on-screen chemistry. Zed's complete indifference when his friend Eric Zoe throws out of the hotel room, sets the scene for their later attachment. <br /> <br /> In action two, Eric's group of bohemians - drug addicts losing a marginal life of small crime - are preparing for their big lift with a night out in town. Here, Roger Avary's main purpose is to prove he knows something about drugs. A secondary thread is to convince us (by endless repetition) that Eric is really, VERY happy to see his old friend Zed again. Really stay. Eric's devil's power-management, exaggerated flamboyance and love for Zed are not even remotely credible - for example, look for his fake engagement to discover a dead cat in his apartment. The development of the characters that accompany the rest of the film is a memory. <br /> <br /> The lift is a disaster - understandable as the plan laughs and the criminals are full amateurs. That's where Avary continues to pay tribute to his idol Quentin Tarantino by showing that he can be more violent. In fact, however, he is more boring than boring. To build up the excitement, an extra security guard is hidden inside the safe. It was boring in video games, and it's boring now. <br /> <br /> Zoe is taken hostage in the elevator, but despite our expectation that she will play a key role, she is just fine. Or more, Avary fails to do anything with her. In the last five minutes she jumps life into the hostage, breaks the hostage situation and saves gratitude, but apparently Zed still suffers from the consequences of his crime. Why is she not worried about his involvement in the crime - or why she does not disregard him at all - it is impossible to tell. After all, she had no chance to see that he was more decent than the rest of the gang. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is silent and false throughout. Many are in French. As a native speaker I can certify that it is not even remotely true. Eric's pure-sweet discourse, swiftly alternating with a hard-man who boasts, is meant to be atmospheric and frightening alternately, but instead just grid. Meanwhile, his scaredy cat accomplices are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric is shot in a ludicrous example of exorbitant power, we can all breathe a sigh of relief: like the bank's hostages, we will soon be liberated from this unfortunate trial.
