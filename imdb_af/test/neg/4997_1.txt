Hey, I'm a fan of so-so-good movies, but there's nothing so bad about Rise Of The Undead. It's just as bad and that's it. No redeeming cheese, no unintentional humor, nothing! - boring apocalyptic zombie (the "undead": some people with almost any makeup) nonsense with special effects (if you can call the effects), stupid plot and annoying actors. They also have the nerve to pick up and announce other (better) movies (Resident Evil, Dawn Of The Dead & Night of The Comet) to make me sleep. However, it was Rise Of My Eyelids once the end credits had already rolled. My advice: save your money. It is not even worth earning a rent unless you want to get away and / or let someone sleep, then go ahead and give it a go. You have been warned;)
