Everything about this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> In the first five minutes you can tell that this movie will be terrible. However, you cannot determine how bad it will be. <br /> <br /> We start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene that is helped with gay music and no dialogue. If you move the camera, big guys who try too hard to look spiritual do not move the slightest emotion. <br /> <br /> What then looks like is one of two separate stories. The first half of the film consists of the clouds that are converted into paid, midnight battles with other ethnic groups. The clouds always win naturally, because they seem to lift weights and have "respect". It is in these scenes that we first see the degree of bad acting, editing, essay and hate for the people who fund this movie. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the main character and his partner are sent to prison. The whole jail part of the movie is not related to what I am assuming is the plot, and consists of many battles. <br /> <br /> Once out of jail (3 years for murder?) the main character and his partner reunite with the clouds. They then go to the "other side of the village" and try to lay low because everyone wants to kill them right away. <br /> <br /> The clouds are soon set up for the rape of another gangster's girl and run around the town hordes of different gangs are fighting. This point of the movie can be compared to an arcade game, as the wounds simply run around and fend off enemies who seem to get worse and worse when the movie goes on. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie ends with a massive climate battle scene in which the remaining clouds (the two main characters) enter their gang each time they fought. Apparently, the other gangs don't have a problem tackling the remaining weights (the skinheads don't care for Asians). After about a million more people are beaten by the invincible wagon brothers, the movie ends with the main characters going home. However, they do not make it home, because they are killed by thousands of movie critics who storm the set and are indignant everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie can be more like a computer game. then a movie because it will explain how two guys can take about a million bumps on the face of a million people who are twice the majority of the time. <br /> <br /> There are also tons more stupid inexplicable events in this movie, like an Asian, are fighting his own gang and taking a katana on the head just to leave the clouds away. <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, this movie isn't that bad. It's funny, it's just as bad.
