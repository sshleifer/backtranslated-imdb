(KLEIN SPOILERS) I bought the DVD of this movie yesterday. I saw it with my friends and I couldn't believe what happened. <br /> <br /> In the first 3 movies, the judges at least had a sense of humor (especially the 3rd movie), but not just The wanderers barely make a appearance, they weren't funny! They never made me laugh. I have to admit that the story started well. After an hour I remembered that the Critters movies were always very short. So I thought to myself, "Where are the $ ^% # $ the sick?!?!" They were scarce in this movie! If it didn't make me angry enough, the boy put Ethan on his bed after Charlie killed the ship and he knew the birds were still on board! In the first movie, the Brown family was scared of their minds. But here Ethan didn't even care! It was as if the ox-eaters were not even a threat! <br /> <br /> Now that I'm going to say next, the end can be destroyed, but I'm always going to say it. In the first movie, in the end, they had to face the giant butter for a final battle. In the second one there was the big ball of the butter. In the third movie, the guy with his fave burned, a spin (from Sonic the Hedgehog) and attacked the little one. But at the end of the fourth (which made me the worst), the barefooted cake brought Ethan and Ethan killed it as if it were nothing. <br /> <br /> What I really didn't do was understand what happened to Ug. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then he is angry after 50 years. It was very disappointing. Not only that, but wasn't he a sightless bounty hunter? Why was he still Johnny Steele? Plus, he had a different personality. He was much smarter and not as monotonous as in the first two. <br /> <br /> Being someone who really enjoyed the first two critters movies and loved the third, I give Critters 4 a 2/10
