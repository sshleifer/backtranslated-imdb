It's a children's TV series about a Mary-Sue who is mean and bitchy at the same time. I couldn't put myself through 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn Spears can't act to save her life! What message does this show bring to children? If you are not perfect like Zoey, you are unworthy * rollseyes *. It is absurd how Zoey's character is exactly the kind of person who will be despised in real life, but she manages to become so popular. . Then there is Chase who is actually a lovely puppy who worships the land that Zoey goes for. Then there is the fact that all the other characters have failed to stop them from moving out of Zoey. I'm sorry, but the characterization in this show is very unrealistic.
