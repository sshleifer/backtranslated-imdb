This movie is not a bit bad. It's not even bad. It's terrible. You know you're in trouble when Charo appears in a movie. She had had the week off "Love Boat". George Kennedy, he's at least a gamer - he's trying it out. Actually, he's right. And it's good to see Martha Raye. Jimmie Walker is okay. There is a little better performance than in Airport'75, but which movie doesn't play better than Airport'75? One thing I liked about this movie is that it is more in progress than many other disaster games. At least they made an attempt at subplots. What really hurts this movie is the special effects - ugh! Not too special if you ask me. This is the kind of movie that is really funny at 02:00 if you have fun with your friends and you're looking for something to laugh at.
