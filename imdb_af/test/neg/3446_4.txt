I enjoy watching Robert Forster. This was the main reason I rented this movie. I also wanted to see a story in the middle of nowhere where the characters could really work well without giving distractions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I got the movie. I couldn't be interested in the characters. I couldn't get interested in the story that was nowhere around. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour, I turned it off. I will rate the movie 4 out of 10. It falls far below the mandatory 7-rating that makes a movie worth watching.
