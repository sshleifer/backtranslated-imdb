The Dapper is about a New York radio program host called Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in the city where she grew up and loved. She has her great fianc√© David (Naveen Andrews), which she plans to marry. But one night while Erica and David run their dog, they are attacked and beaten by a group of degenerates who let David die. Erica recovers but is sad and traumatized later, and can hardly go with real life. She buys a gun on a man on the streets for protection. But one day she beckons in a shop, and a man comes in and shoots the clerk. It is then that Erica shoots and kills this man, and she becomes a vigilante. Kill someone trying to threaten or harm her or anyone else. At the same time, Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is finding this elusive unknown killer and is becoming friends with Erica. Erica is regaining her health because she kills these violent people, but is not sure if what she is doing is morally right or not. And as she and Mercer get closer, he doesn't even realize that the unknown murderous attacker is right next to him. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster gives a very good performance in The Brave One. She depicts this kind of violent, morally corrupt character brilliantly. Terrence Howard is also fantastic in this movie. Both have excellent chemistry, and strengthen the film to a certain level. The Dapper looks visually pristine, and works some brilliant camera work, but not everything works to a good effect. The screens where Erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to step out of her door to face the world. The camera has tossed back and forth to the sides in an almost dreamy way and the moment has been trapped. While every time Erica killed someone, everything had to show slo-mo and her facial expressions in detail. The slo-mo was used properly when Erica committed her first murder. But why does this effect almost every time his murder happened? The camera work creates a good atmosphere in most of the movies, but there are a few scenes here that just overlap. <br /> <br /> The Brave is much like how these murders touch emotionally Erica. Her fiance is murdered by a group of thugs, and suddenly her love of New York City is turned upside down. She realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city, and she says so on her radio program. However, I don't quite understand it. Erica acts as if she never realized that violence was occurring in the city at night, and that was quite stupid. If she lives there, she or she must be blind or unaware. Erica also appears to be a glutton for inhuman, murderous people. She shouldn't even look at them, they just came to her as if they were planning to be shot dead for their wrong doing. The Brave firstly deals with the moral and proper use of violence, and suddenly it glorifies it. The end is very negative, and totally indecent and inhuman. It also denies the purpose of Terrence Howard's character, who spends the film so much time developing evenly, and suddenly his morale takes a U-turn. The morals in the Brave One become very broken, and just break completely over the place at the end. So violence is okay? It's a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for revenge? I refuse it pretty much. You know why? Because I have a conscience, this film is certainly missing. It's not right to take another person's life, no matter how bad it is, or how much you hate it. Erica Bain strives to stop these evil perpetrators, but ultimately she is no better than the terrible people she kills. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard have a lot of power for this movie. The Bravery contains a strong message, but the message is immoral and wrong. This movie can look nice, well-acted and intelligent strong. But it gets pretty rotten at the end. I give the Brave One a 1.5 out of 4. The message is very on line and morally wrong and can't really be saved by the good acting.
