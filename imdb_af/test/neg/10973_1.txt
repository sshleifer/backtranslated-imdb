Guy Pearce looks almost like Flynn, and this deal is the only one that can claim this movie. Nowhere in Flynn's autobiography is the Klaus Reicher character rating, the homosexual encounter is speculative fiction, and the film's allegations that Flynn treated indigenous labor badly are unfounded. Director Frank Howson has not made memorable films, and I find it painful for him to blasphemously Flynn to promote his unbeatable career. <br /> <br />
