Michael Myers, the depraved, not-so-young, more psychotherapist, who appears with every appearance, is roused by his rampant brothers destroying more of his family members and anyone else coming in the way. Gaps in logic appear to be ignored in favor of healthy body number. Michael, who originally prefers quizzes and kitchen knives, learns to wield an ax and use the necessary means to prevent his victims. The result is a huge patch-dollar sales film that is virtually unhelpful by some really unpleasant rows. Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after death, seems to have been injected into this story, just as someone * can be considered dead. You will not want to cover your eyes during this one, but you will shake your head against the downward shift of John Carpenter's classic creation.
