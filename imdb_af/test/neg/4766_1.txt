I just watched it on TCM today, where the other reviewers saw it. <br /> <br /> Sorry I was the only one to find Davies a bad actress, with a really terrible attempt at an Irish (Irish-American or otherwise) accent. As she was the star, it was hard for me to get past - especially since the other judges said it was her best performance. <br /> <br /> Another particularly horrible Davies show was in Marianne. (1929), which I also looked at today. In this film, which is a 9-in-10 rating, her accent turns from that of a (correct) French woman to a strange combination of Italian and Swiss. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, in TCM's one-hour bio of Davies - "Trapped on the movie: The True Story of Marion Davies" (2001) - film historian Jeanine Basinger claims that "one of the things you About Marion Davies in her healthy work, is how good she is on accent. "Of course, this bio also contains comments by fans (make them what you want). <br /> <br /> Davies was a very attractive young woman, and through all accounts it is a great comedy in real life. <br /> <And since part of her anatomy undeniably added to the real answer to Joseph Cotten's character's search for the meaning of Kane's last word in the openingstone of the great "Citizen Kane", she has her place deserve among the great stories. as Hollywood's history. <br /> <br /> But I think Welles & Mankiewicz mostly managed it with the "Susan Alexander" facsimile of the right article. <br /> <br /> Don't save the voice. whether you agree or disagree with this post, because I really couldn't care less.
