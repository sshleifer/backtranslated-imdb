Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so cute filmed, the focus isn't even on these supposed "real half-boxes", it's more on the crew coming out of Hollywood to make the movie. No role, and if I could take back the almost 1 1/2 hours I spent on this movie, I would feel much better. <br /> <br /> Initially, it will give you the impression that it will be filmed somewhat generically, such as a real Hollywood production. But then they go into the story of the story, and it is so filmed that I am very terrible. It's supposed to be a "Blair Witch Project" really, since they use pretty much what you'd think is "real camera footage", that's not, don't be fooled. <br /> <br /> Worst movie I have ever seen. . . On the positive side, it looked like a semi-scary scene in it, and the visuals of the half-cabinets were not bad. DO NOT RENT
