Thanks to silly horror movies such as "Troll" and the indescribably horrible cult lover "Troll 2", it is virtually impossible to take movies with cobblestones, gnomes and several other types of small green hobboblins. I just recently watched the 70-year-old TV movie "Do not Be Afraid of the Dark", which is actually a very scary and seriously-colored movie about domestic baby samples, and yet I still couldn't think about it again. the laughing-penetrating potato cakes dressed in rubbish bags running amok in "Troll 2". The same thing has happened to me now. As much as I tried to go with a clear mindset in "Occupation", I unconsciously hold the so-called creepy and threatening garden festival with the bad sculpture of Nilbog! Yet, even without all the prejudices, "inhabited" is an entertaining but undeniable straight-to-video horror movie. It is a cheesy, soft and politically correct pastiche of family drama and Northern Europe mythology. The annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie are not your usual average goblins; they are "The Huldre": evil little Norwegian demons living underground and trying to chase happy families out of their homes by influencing the youngest children. It overcomes the Russell family as they enter their home in a remote village. The Cherubian blonde daughter of MILF actress Megan Gallagher starts acting strangely when she hangs in the cute playhouse in the back of the garden. She claims her friends are fairies, and although the sinister handyman has also warned of strange incidents in the past, Gina's parents simply think the girl has trouble adjusting to her new neighborhood. If she likes fairies, they arrange an appointment with the award-winning psychologist Dr. Werner while "The Huldre" slowly comes from their botanical shelter. Not very special to mention here. The pace is acceptable and the effort to build up tension is pretty cute. You understand this is a family-friendly horror movie, so no bloody murder series is shown graphically here. Heck, even the cadaver of the family's pet cat is kept outside the screen. It is the umpteenth nonsense horror movie in which Malcolm McDowell appears and he almost always shows an unreliable, greedy and self-centered figure of authority.
