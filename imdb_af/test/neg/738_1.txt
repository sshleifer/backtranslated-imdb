It is difficult for a novelist of the novel Northanger Abbey to sit and hold this BBC adapt to throw objects on the TV screen. If Jane Austen were to see herself, she would be somewhat amused and possibly poured out. Maggie Wadey's adaptation made the Northanger Abbey what it satirized, the Gothic novel (and readers of Gothic novels). <br /> <br /> The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is pretty much suggested to Austen's Catherine, an open-hearted, generous girl whose imagination simply ran away with her. But the novel's Henry Tilney is not a snuff-take, cane-wielding, juicy-line-up hero of a Gothic novel - he is a scourge, an almost handsome man with a messy room and a life (that's right, Henry Tilney is a pastor, a charm that is completely out of writing. Some of the best scenes from the novel, when Henry, totally dead, are literally-wise Katarina at thick-time, magazines, mrs. Radcliffe, etc., not depicted, is not portrayed in the adaptation, much of Henry's personality is lost when those scenes are not adjusted, and Peter Firth's appearance is not accurate Henry Tilney is supposed to being 24 or 25, dark hair and brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blonde. <br /> <br /> There are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that call for surprise and horror - who is the Marsioness, and What is she doing in the story? Why is John Thorpe less of a dunce and more of a twilight? Why is the No rthanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel, with her romantic visions, expects hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable, modern home - another element of satire! Why was General Tilney portrayed as drunk? Why did Catherine have that strange vision of Mrs. All who light her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination only goes with her in Northanger, with Henry there to soften her. And lastly, why are so many facts about the Tilney family and mrs. Tilney's death changed unnecessarily? To make the story more "terrible"? " All these peculiarities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked. <br /> <br />>
