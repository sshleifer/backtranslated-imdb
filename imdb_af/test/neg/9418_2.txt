When you see Barry Corbin in the movie of a movie, you can never be sure it will be a classic or a trash. Guess which category of SOLO falls. Apparently derived from a popular sci-fi novel, WEAPON, SOLO, Mario Van Peebles dies as a human-minded robot who decides to think for himself and is therefore aimed at elimination. He is hiding in a Mexican town, of course, to save money in places and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is ready for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles. Van Peebles manages to beat everyone with ease, of course, while Corbin looks at it all with understanding. The movie is a horrible ripoff of THE TERMINATOR and CYBORG series, and apparently has little to do with its source material. It was terribly written and performed, and the great battle at the end as straight comics. Van Peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is a scream as he pretends to be a robot in synthetic flesh. He seems to be doing the Robot Dance most of the time.
