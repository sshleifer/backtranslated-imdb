The story starts in the home of a little girl who will have a birthday party and both the mother and father looked as if they were quiet and reserved. They continue to give their daughter to her gift which is both of them and it seems to me funny the expressions on the two parents' faces as they gave their gift to this child, it was almost like, "I hope she likes ! There is a murder in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart, (Julia Kerbridge), "Reaper", 2000, becomes involved in the case due to family ties. Julia works hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney), "View From The Top", 03 is a neighboring neighbor in the same apartment as Julia and eventually goes with her and tries to help her in other ways. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely nothing to love, unless you love a movie spot in Canada and a good Katherine Mary Stewart, a Canadian resident.
