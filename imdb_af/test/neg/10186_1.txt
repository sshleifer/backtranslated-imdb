I warn your people out there, it's just a waste of your time. I'm honest when I say it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just a move on Christian propaganda! Don't throw your life, don't see it! <br /> <br /> I think they made the movie so more people would believe in Jesus or something, but it works in the opposite direction. The actors are all new, the story is just vague! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a devil's work. <br /> <br /> This movie just isn't worth seeing, so please take my advice and don't!
