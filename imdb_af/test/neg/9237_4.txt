This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first movie. And of course, our Americans have to work everything back in English, because reading subtitles is SOOOOO. Hard is it! From what I saw in the new trailers with the beautiful, now pregnant Jessica Alba (well, it makes sure every teenage boy's fantasy is everywhere!) It looks exactly the same, but probably doubles with the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror / tension / mystery I have ever seen in any language. I would recommend watching this one completely overshoot, there is no reason to look at it, because there is no reason that it is even called "The Eye 2", except for the excellence that the was the first movie to capitalize on. Do yourself a favor look "The Eye" with the volume turned up and get ready for a few possible jumps. I watched it with headphones and was pleasantly surprised at the excellence of the Pang brothers' direction. If the "Eye" reminder goes well, I hope to do it for the sake of the Pang Brothers movie careers, but at the same time, it seems as if people can't see the original because very often / almost always the remake is not as good as the original. Look at this one if you want to be some bad movie, but the original is not a comparison with this sequel.
