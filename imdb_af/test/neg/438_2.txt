I wanted to see an American Werewolf in Paris long ago, because I loved his predecessor, but this film did not impress me as much as an American Werewolf in London. Actually, to be honest, it didn't impress me at all. <br /> <br /> Tom Everett-Scott and his dude women turned Paris and in a former bungee stunt of the Eifel tower wolf-babe Julie Delpy from death. Before you have time to work out whether the constant worry and some dialogue is meant to be the comedy, a full moon has hit and the brats are chased by scary CGI weather rides along Parisian sewers. <br /> <br /> The writing is disgustingly poor, the actors are made to make this movie, they are horrible performances that match the status of the movie. From start to finish, this movie is never entertaining, enticing or even slightly visible. I had a hard time watching this whole movie without throwing up my meal, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The action scenes aren't exciting, the jokes aren't funny and the werewolves aren't scary. In short: Missing or haunting forever. <br /> <br /> I estimate an American werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10.
