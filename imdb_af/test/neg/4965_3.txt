I read about this movie online and after seeing the general positive reviews it received and the fan watching, I decided to investigate it myself. What a disappointment! It starts well enough. The opening scene was actually pretty tense, but from there it was already downhill. I can see that the filmmakers are trying to do something different with this movie, but by doing so, they have all enjoyed it. Those choices combined with the "C.S.I" editing, use of music and montage, lack of tension, fright or humor, really pull this film down. There is too much damage and a lot of "subtle" clues, so when the first turn comes up, you know how the movie will end. I gave the movie three stars because I think the cast did a good job, except that I can't recommend this movie.
