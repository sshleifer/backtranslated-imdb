** Maybe contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Okay, we can deduce this movie in one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now why do I think so? Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Guttenberg leads a special option team consisting of four people assigned to repeat a deadly virus after some arms dealers stole it from a laboratory. They do this by attacking the arm dealers in the middle of the flight and somehow getting the virus back after some battles. However, there are suspicions about Guttenberg because one of the terrorists knew his name. After debriefing, the team members are attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect that everyone is involved. After deciding, they can't trust their bosses. They decide to steal the virus again and attract the possible attackers. <br /> <br /> In theory, it's a low-budget plot. film that is only aimed at being broadcast on television. However, the plot is in danger and the movie is destroyed in several accounts. First, the plot is completely predictable and it is not nice to know how the movie will end after three minutes. Second. The acting is really bad, or the actors are aiming to act dummies. There are not many emotions, changes in facial expressions, etc. I was especially disappointed in Guttenberg that I believe can do a lot, but I totally fail in trying to be a rough action hero. In addition, although I am by no means an expert on the subject, I totally believe that I could build a better secret option team by picking up five strangers and training for a week. It seems to be a theme in the movie to make things as stupid and unprofessional as possible. It's also for good guys, bad guys and bystanders. Then I doubt the scientific and technical consultants, if any, of the film. For example, I poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and I didn't break immediately. <br /> <br /> Don't know how to really close it, but we can say that this movie has a predictable plot, bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever they do. Sorry, can't be more beautiful than that. Don't see this movie, it's not that bad, it's funny. 10/02
