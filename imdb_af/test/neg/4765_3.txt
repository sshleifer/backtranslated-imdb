Bob Clampett's 'The Hep Cat' is a clear average cartoon that is really known only for being the first color to be Looney Tune (previously Looney Tunes were all black and white while Mare Melodies was in color). The story of a dancing cat's efforts to catch a cat and a dog's efforts to catch the cat, "The Hep Cat" has the brand energy and fits most of Clampett's shorts. To be honest, Clampett doesn't have much to work with. Warren Foster's writing is shamefully thin and while Clampett passed it with 'The Hep Cat' while spamming with other slips of gold. Clampett is often told that you cannot abuse his cartoons for anyone else and it is generally true, but 'The Hep Cat' is an exception. There are flashes of Clampett genius, like the pursuit scene in which the cat stops asking the dog. "Hey, you follow me." When the dog confirms that he is, the cat simply says "Oh" and the chase goes straight back. Unfortunately, there is very little such brilliance here. Knowing who is regulating it, "The Hep Cat" is a bitter disappointment. We all have days and it was clearly one of Clampett's!
