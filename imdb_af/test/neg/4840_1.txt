The only reason I rented this movie was that Val Kilmer rarely starred in a bad movie. Of course there is a first time for everything. In many ways, this movie proves that oats are not as easy to make as we think, especially by foreign directors. The only one who came to it was probably Sergio Leone, but even his movies were missing something indeterminate from our American psyche and panache. American actors in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda helped. I can now see why they changed the original title of "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bounty". It itself tells me that producers and directors did not have a core concept about other Western than standard shooting screens and violent themes. I think we can say the same about US directors trying to make a Polish movie unfortunately in the process of failing.
