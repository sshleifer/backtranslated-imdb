I do not understand why so many of the comments in it show that it is acceptable entertainment. The obvious horror of this film-like monstrousness cannot be overstated. My friend and I just watched it, and I'm not sure we will ever have sex again. I'm not sure what was worse, the gruesome, unattractive throw, their highly photogenic genealogies, the turbulent humor, the screaming sounds that claimed songs were ... <br /> <br /> No, I know what worst of all. The girls in the green leotards, with a green facial muscle, lick Alice to dry her and then suggest in broken childlike speech that they suck milk from her breasts. It was the worst. <br /> <br /> What was also with the nurses, and why does it look so much to find each other's vagina? Why are all the male actors gay? Why does Humpty Dumpty blow a dildo in the air and pretend to be his penis? Why did my eyes see it? There are no words.
