I have one word: focus. <br /> <br /> Well. <br /> <br /> IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. okay. Let's discuss the fine focus points. I don't know about the rest of you, but in my first year of the film school they criticized us very uselessly, such as "you'll be famous avant-garde filmmakers one day" - but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing to do, called FOCUSING of the lens! it was awesome! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clearly like a bell. the person who shot the alice must learn a few things about the finer focus points. lighting also. This movie is not just out of focus, it is also illuminated like the corner of someone's basement. <br /> <br /> let me not even start pacing or plot. they could have cut about ten seconds from the beginning and end of each shot. <br /> <br /> But who cares? There is not enough trick in this movie to compensate for the total lack of respect for the best friends of the movie - FOCUS, and LIGHTING. <br /> <br /> words to the wise.
