OK, it will contain spoilers. Now I have never seen such a huge heap since the laxative / feed mixture is in the elephant casing in the zoo! It has more plot holes than mot-eaten side and for the 'realistic' plot line. Well, sexual slavery is a terrible and very real global problem and this stack of bilge uses this plague as a plot device to torture and tar, shame on everyone involved in that piece of dubious judgment. But back to the movie, if you're kidnapping people from an airport, some of the safest and camera happy places in the modern world at that time are why why plant a stool on the inside of the bus that comes to a standstill needs a twist. Just wait until you're out of the airport, pull the gun, handcuff the passengers, drive quietly to the warehouse and kill the guys, do work. On the side of the passengers, the good guys, at least three times, have the bad guys incompetent and armed, WASTE THIS! Once in a movie, it may just be acceptable not to place a bullet in the bad guys skull, but come up three times! And after he killed most of you. The man is also ready to put the gun down to stop a scar, but kill a girl for a yeast infection, which can be cleared with $ 20 dollars. I can continue with the amount of holes in it, but I won't waste my time anymore. Suffice it to say that I am rarely so insulted by such a horrible piece and as for the real problem of sexual slavery, girls go voluntarily to new jobs in remote countries and are abused, raped and often killed by the gang. master who meets them from the boat / plane and enjoys their passports and freedom. This is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by it! Don't waste your time!
