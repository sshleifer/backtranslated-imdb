Well, if you reject the fact that this movie is acting abysmal; and if you reject the fact that the story is astonished and deviates in about five different directions without ever deciding which path it really wants to go; and if you set aside the fact that I didn't find a single scene in this movie, which was interesting in the distance; Well, if you put it all aside, it's still a VERY horrible movie! <br /> <br /> I assume it should be a love story about rich old / poor girl. I've never really understood how this romance between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) ever started. The inexplicable romance is getting worse through a complete lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The script (by Michael Seitzman) is boring to the point of stupefying. How Seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle; that he would think someone would want to pay to see it is incredible. <br /> <br /> Did I mention it's a VERY, VERY horrible movie? <br /> <br /> I want it a NEWS, but the IMDb doesn't allow for NEWS votes. So I give it one while I hold my nose.
