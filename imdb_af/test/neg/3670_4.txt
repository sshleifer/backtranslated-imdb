The deciding (and direction) in Undercurrent is more unsatisfactory than inspired by this noir clunker who has failed to get off the ground from the beginning. Robert Taylor's timber style has been a roadblock for the highly-affected Kate Hepburn from the start, which is bad chemistry from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Naive and innocent Ann Hamilton (Hepburn) falls to attractive aircraft manufacturer Alan Garroway (Taylor) and rushes with him to the altar. She soon finds out there, there is a lot she doesn't know about him. As Alan is more distracted, she goes further in the dark, and Ann soon finds her a nightmare instead of the American dream. <br /> <br /> Undercurrent looks like some Hitchcock plots, but Vincent Minnelli finds out he's no master of excitement. Hepburn is not shrinking violet and she is a hard sell for a character more suited to the reticent styles of Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine. Minnelli never really succeeds in delaying Kate in a desperate manner to Taylor's limited ability as an actor. Her attempts are over as a silent Gish while Taylor's wide descent in madness gets hold of Bela Lugosi. Robert Mitchum completes the miscasting as the sensitive brother. Talk about hope <br /> <br /> Cinematographer Karl Freund offers some stylized noir interiors, but Minnelli and cast use the atmosphere softly and the tension remains lukewarm. With Minnelli far from his forts (musicals) and Hepburn's victim role that suits her like a bad suit, Undercurrent drowns everyone involved.
