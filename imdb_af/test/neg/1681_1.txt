Dull one-note characters with no development, unbeatable performances by people who sound like they just read lines, and combine ridiculous special effects to make it a real stinker. The story begins with equally common commando Russo and his fellow soldiers who attacked an all-Qaeda training base. The scene tells us that al-Qaeda has recently come to look for an ultimate weapon, and also serves to illustrate Russo's only trait, a tendency to avoid teamwork. With the help of a collection of empty slides and walking stereotypes, including a Russian spy, Russo travels to Chechnya's territory to capture a crazy scientist for the terrorists. Along the way, they meet big hordes of meat bats flying for some reason in broad daylight. From there, the movie becomes nothing more than a void of ridiculous action, including a scene in which a swarm of bats cut off a soldier's arm!
