Destructive twaddle performed in a surprisingly amateurish and improper manner - or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, tension, and more, combine with Walter Pidgeon's beef efforts to make charms a cinematic to arrange with some of Fritz Lang's other wonderful failures. (I thought the German ambassador was actually played by Lang, but apparently - they could have been twins.) If you can't predict the end of several time zones, you're not actually living. <br /> <br /> I was eagerly awaiting this DVD and was completely amazed and disappointed by such a villain (even with George Sanders and John Carradine - maybe I can wash my mind off Viaggio in Italia instead of and for look the umpteenth time). <br /> <br /> Anyone want to use a DVD once? (There can be a movie about making this horrible movie and how so many talented people can be wasted so much.)
