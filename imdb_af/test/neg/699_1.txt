I'm in a movie class and I know I don't know everything about film, but truly, it's one of the worst, stupid, delayed and messy times I've ever seen and I've seen NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. they are both equally terrible. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting even in the movie, it's not really a heartwarming story and Pat Conroy doesn't beat anything! I'm not saying fight and shit should blow up, but it will produce more than blat film. the children they loved to perform in this movie could have been the real Yammacraux Island children, they sounded stupid and could not be as far as I was concerned, it was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idEa for a movie I don't know why this movie was even made, deviating from the top five worst movies of all time.
