Early in the early 90's I was introduced to television and I loved it. <br /> <br /> What did you like about it? The fiery drawing style? The flawless artistic action involved? The absurd and deadpan communication between the characters? The whole layout of the surrounding future world? No matter what you loved ... <br /> <br /> Late 2005's Aeon Flux movie has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama, the so-called "director" of the movie, was hopelessly busy pushing the original content to a new movie. If you are not familiar with the original series, you will not understand anything during the first 60 minutes of the movie. The story is inexcusable and the meager characters do not develop during the film. <br /> <br /> An attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some poorly explanatory talks between the main characters, Kusama is not just a painful attempt to cover her mistakes as a storyteller. It is simply unworthy of the original ÆON concept. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron Can be an attractive woman, but she can't personalize the ÆON character. Although attached to strings of action scenes, her lack of talent for physical movement lapses the action sequences in the movie. The result is a large amount of witches photo cuts to cover the bare lameness of her body. <br /> <br /> Forget about the rest, it's not worth talking ... <br /> <br /> I give 1 point to Ms.Theron showing her boobs and 1 point for the beautiful architectural photography in the film. That's it.
