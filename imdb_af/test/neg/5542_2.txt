Author / director Michael Hurst's Sci-Fi Channel successor to Stan Winston's classic horror story of revenge has gone missing, has moments and decent gore, but eventually becomes short compared to the original. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure the filmmakers didn't try to make a comedy, but I caught myself. A family event started over a car accident, which is the basis for this entry into the franchise. The Hatfield and McCoy families live in a backyard town with dirt roads, pickup trucks, drink moonlight, and kick every other donkey every chance they get. Just when they thought it was safe to hate and remain happy, Jodie Hatfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) decided to fall in love. One night, the two birds of love decide to pick some quality time in the bush, while Ricky's sister looks, but it happens that some of the Hatfields accidentally kill Ricky's sister and get him and Jodie together. You know what happens next. Ricky finds his sister body and decides to visit Haggis so he can fix his revenge by the mighty Pumpkinhead. You Haw! Also, Harley (Lance Henriksen) is back to warn potential forbidden souls of using Pumpkinhead to relieve their pain. Which really puts a kink in the story because Harley is supposed to have Pumpkinhead years ahead of the story, but the environment and characters look like dirty Pilgrims who somehow traveled to bring the bakkie back to Plymouth. Then there's the sheriff (Rob Freeman) who has his own ties with the devil and looks like he's in a 70's revenge movie instead of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the gore and special effects were cool, but instead of sticking to the man-in-a-suit way of thinking, Hurst made some terrible 3D shots. use some scenes. One particularly embarrassing show shows Pumpkinhead jumping from tree branches like a weak 3D monkey. The cinematography was exceptional and elevated the quality of the movie quite a bit. The acting was also pretty decent, with the exception of some poorly executed accents. <br /> <br /> Family fraud never ends well, especially when families involved in the feud have to handle Pumpkinhead. I didn't enjoy every minute of this movie, but it was much better than most of the movies spitting the Sci-Fi channel. Perhaps this is a sign that the channel is trying to improve the quality of its movies to match the quality of its original range. I won't waste a coin on a rent, but if you get the chance to get a repeat of it on the boob tube, I'll say to check it out. It's a non-killer movie, but it rises slightly above the level of garbage it makes on DVD today.
