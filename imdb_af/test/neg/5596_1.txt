Certainly, this movie in Eastern Europe is filled with sexy, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the Nicholas Cage movie "8mm". An ambassador's daughter and her fianc√© mix it with a local woman in a threesome that eventually gets stuck. The band is used for extortion and the stakes are getting higher and higher as the couple try to work it out instead of going to authorities. <br /> <br /> The sex comes and goes - and would be the only reason to rent it, I think if you like this kind of thing - and are completely free in the middle when we go looking for the porn scene for the "other woman". I definitely wondered how it got in Blockbuster, even with a Youth Limited Poster, considering just what a hint of soft core edge is. (Oh, that's right, that's the dual standard. Real-art flasks like "The Dreamers" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" get castrated R versions, but Straight To DVD crap like this, get the UNRATED banner pride. Whatever. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible, the plot is annoyingly unlikely, but the worst offense is the idea that it is a follow-up of 8mm. I will give the movie a D for a degree and be nice, but if they try to trick me, it will be the F that honestly deserves it.
