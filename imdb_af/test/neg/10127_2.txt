You might think a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. Take, for example, the concept: the main character (s) have a great secret that they hide from their peers. It's just like Hannah Montana and it's so raven. Next, the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be sleeping halfway through many scenes. Finally, the jokes are either clich√© or boring. If they do not use, they are colorful but weird dialogue to make us laugh, they throw various props around the room. I really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material. Finally, Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment.
