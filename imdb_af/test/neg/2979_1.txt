It feels like a prolonged treatment of a comedy routine that could also tell in a ten-minute brief. Technical credits are also supported. The film really feels like a film school diploma project. <br /> <br /> The role play is a mix of seasoned stage benefits and talented newcomers, but the problems are the superficial scripts. Their lines are built exactly like a TV show. <br /> <br /> The director fails to take his lead players seriously, so we are not touched by their problems and conflicts. <br /> <br /> The film is cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling point, but in the end the movie disappears at all levels.
