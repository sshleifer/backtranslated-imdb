(spoilers) Frighteningly, I actually saw the movie this horror movie was a sequel. This is called Ator's Fighting Eagle, and I saw it when I was just 8 years old. It made such a terrible impression on me that I never forgot it. I've been a MST3K fan for a long time, so when Cavedwellers came out on tape, I bought it. I was shocked to realize that it was a follow-up to the miserable Ator movie I saw so long ago! Ator's costume has, in one way or another, become even more shocking than the last time I saw him. How can he wear that little bikini? Didn't he mind that it turned out that he had no ... errr ... package? And poor Thong ... he gets no lines and no girl, and must follow the fresh haired girly doofus Ator all the time. Did anyone else notice Miles O'Keefe walking like a woman? No wonder he is not interested in the beautiful or slightly slim Meela. The evil but fun bad man Zor is more to his taste, I'm sure. I loved Zor's cardboard coil-painted swan helmet and the way he spent all his time touching a part of Ator. The battle scenes are so badly choreographed that it is a wonder that could ever connect the swords. The dull old man spends all his time and stands to look depressed. Ator drank from a cup given to him by a man who hated him, and then it seemed astonished that they had dried him. He had to be quite clever, but he invented a hangar in the space of five minutes and flew it into a gap in space / time continuity so he traveled Bulgaria shortly in the 17th century. It was after he stabbed the giant snake poop and of course saved the post-coital Meela while she sat down and did nothing. The real hero of the movie was Thong, who saved Ator several times from his borderless stupidity, and killed the evil Zor in the bargain. Kudos to Thong, the only capable person in the whole movie.
