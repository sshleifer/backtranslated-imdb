This movie "Vampires: The Turning" is not really the 2 out of 10 I give. The movie is very predictable from start to finish when our hero kills the Vampire Slayers leader. The use of music in this movie was just as bad, it was as if you were expecting something that would happen meaningfully at any moment, though it never did. The acting was B-Rank at its best ... And the movie was just boring. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story has potential, though it could not eventually deliver. Oh, and did I call the wardrobe? The wardrobe for this movie was, of course, inexpensive not to exist, because our hero, and his girlfriend (whom he tries to save throughout the movie) carry the same outfits throughout the movie. I just want to suggest this movie if you're really bored and don't have a good wall with fresh paint to look dry. ~ Dave, the Horror Cowboy
