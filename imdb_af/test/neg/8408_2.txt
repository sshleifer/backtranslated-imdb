The first movie is a good one for me, I enjoyed it for the most part, but I thought it was really nothing special. However, compared to this mess, it looks much better. Why they had the need to make the movie was beyond me, but they had to know it couldn't match the play of the first movie when they could only get Ruth Gordon to repeat her role. The story type follows Rosemary's baby around and things, but in reality it's kind of a mess, it doesn't help the movie is a television movie and the television looks great. It also showed a comedy that many times, if they really needed to make a sequel, they had to make it an R-rated movie that had a little nudity. I'm sure it would have been pretty bad, but at least it would have been more viewable and fun, which this movie is not, despite being funny. I saw this one on Monstervision and Joe Bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and I don't have too much to say. I must say it was a successor who had never seen the light of day.
