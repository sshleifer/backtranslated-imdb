Technically speaking, this movie sucks ... lol. However, it is also hilarious. Whether it's deliberately funny or not, I don't know. Awful in every way, it's also the only movie I know that 1) a fat kid is played by a smart actor in a (very obvious) fat suit, 2) an attractive 30-something actress who play a character supposed to be in her late 60s, and 3) most compliments for plastic garden daisies ever. Don't take this movie seriously, just watch the laugh .... a great party movie.
