The director of this celluloid waste specializes in horrible exploitation films where pretension is everything; The previous year he did "dangerously close", whose good idea (about gangs having too much power in school and the school document editor against them) was immersed in a sea of ​​mess and he was going to do "Cyborg", Jean Claude Van Damme's worst movie ever (no common thing). It would be comedy about a girl - Kathy Ireland in her film debut - who is a total scramble whose inner baby is only awakened after she falls in the middle of the Earth and has a series of badly filmed, unfinished adventures mainly with a set of dwarfs who want her because she has big legs. Go figure!) Before you return home, it is not funny, gripping or entertaining at all. And anyone who sees it over me. Eating Ireland will also be sold out - not because of her voice, but because she has spent most of the movie under tons of supple clothes, with huge glasses to start. No wonder Cannon, the producers, is out of business. Surprisingly, Kathy Ireland has since made better films, or maybe it's not that great. In addition, "Barb Wire" is "Aliens."
