Reba is without a doubt one of the worst "comedy" series ever. I wonder how people write good comments on "Reba". You watch "Friends", "Married Wtih Children", "Fraizer" when you laugh at it, you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer trying to make her way into comedy and of course no chance to have. The actors / actresses next to Reba are OK, so I feel bad they are sitting in a so-called comedy show with the least funnies person in the world (Reba). In the summary, I suggest seeing this TV show how low comedy can get and appreciate those who can make you laugh
