Unlike the other Spaghetti Westerns, this one has characters that make sense, and can be identified to some extent. It still has the goofy gunplay of other Spaghettis Westerns. A spaghetti, incidentally, is another word for a Western with no plot, no characters you can care about, and goofy gunplay that doesn't make sense of the era, and relies on good music to listen to audiences. make you feel. This one is more light-hearted, like those made by Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. They were also better than the rubbish made by Eastwood and others. These sado-masochists wake up their friends when they get a chance. Everyone seems to have had a lot of fun making the movie. It was good to see a giant actor like Gilbert Roland, who was not even mentioned on the movie rental box, but it was clearly the biggest name. His character was very pleasant. At the end, there is a three-way, much better than the one that spoofs (The Good the Bad and the Ugly), simply because the characters are at least a bit nice and a little identifiable. Not a good movie, but a little fun.
