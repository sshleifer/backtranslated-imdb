Very poor writing and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his role with his empty story that did not tell us anything new. Everything is in the clich√© of the "mentor" and the "talented immature student". The characters aren't even interesting or sympathetic. Artistic, it is so empty and insignificant. The colors are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be attractive. Al Pacino tries very hard to give his character without success. Too bad because the sports games can be a very interesting subject that can be very related. But I can't get a full comment on this movie because I came out of the theater 20 minutes before the end. Everything was so predictable that it was a center of time ...
