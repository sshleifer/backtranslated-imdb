I mean really, really, VERY high and this movie has a shot at entertainment. I don't mean often high, I mean the highlight where reading the phone book will have you in stitches. Otherwise, save time from your life and do something more constructive with it, such as hitting your head on a brick and insulting your own intelligence. A complete waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny, and Master of Shams) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make (the many rappers who insist on making movies) . Not without it laughing (again chemical aid is critical) and certainly not without the politically excessive (which I am always for), but ultimately not appreciating the time out of your life.
