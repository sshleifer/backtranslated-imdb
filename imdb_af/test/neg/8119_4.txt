Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the beautifully adopted daughter of a recent deceased Japanese businessman, controls her father's business; her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), miffed that he had not left the business to run, ordered a hit on his cousin. When jug-harvest chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) accidentally enters the wrong hotel room and knocks the hit Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is wrong for the killer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls for the heir and ends up protecting her. However, she is kidnapped by Kazuo's men while Kensuke is playing an arcade game with cop Daniel (Sam Lee). <br /> <br /> Uncle Kazuo keeps Yumiko in a hypnotic trance and takes control of the business, but walks into a place where he is bothering him when his gangster poles threaten to reveal his illegal activities unless he give them full control. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Kensuke has teamed up with two martial artists, Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo). He teaches Kung Fu and tries to free Yumiko. <br /> <br /> A blend of broad slapstick humor, spoofery and fighting scenes. No Problem 2 is a disappointing movie in the light of the talent involved: 80s Kung Fu superstar Yuen Baio manages some battle scenes but nowadays becomes a bit old for acrobatics; director Kar Lok Chin delivers the kind of silly parody sktick I would expect from a Scary Movie movie; Jung Yuen persuaded to mock his character in Operation Scorpio; and Sam Lee? Well, Sam Lee is as annoying as ever! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Collin Chou, as a leg bone Ben, impressed me; He has a distinctly strong screen presence, which has not gone unnoticed by Hollywood. He has since played in two of the Matrix movies and will soon appear in D.O, led by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed by Wakana Sakai, but for a whole different reason: this beauty is easy to spot and needs to go much further in the film industry. <br /> <br /> There is some fun to exercise. which movies are being parsed, but at 104 minutes I had this movie a real task to go through. If people accompany funny faces, accompanied by silly sound effects, you make your sides burst, then no problem 2 can log in to you. Otherwise I will go well alone.
