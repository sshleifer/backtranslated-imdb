This show is great and we enjoy it thoroughly. In Alaska, I disagree with the homosexual content on tonight's performance. I feel you are pushing too hard to bring New York to Alaska. The one thing to make a New Yorker struggle in Alaska, but to turn the Alaska village into New York? It's a good show about nice women and true Alaska men and bringing the same sex couple into the mix throws the balance away. Alaska must be portrayed as a man and New York as the woman. I think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you all do. Can't have a nice show without the natural imbalance.
