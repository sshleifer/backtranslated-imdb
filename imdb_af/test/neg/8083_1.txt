I thought it would be an Ok movie after I saw the ads about it. It was funny on some parts and some very nasty. The only person I was sorry for was Horatio Sans, who had a hot wife who cheated on him with other women. But he never had a chance to have a trio, and it was good, but they had to make the movie bigger.
