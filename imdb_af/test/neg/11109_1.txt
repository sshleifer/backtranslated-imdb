It's one of the most horrible "scary" movies I've seen for a while. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to do this movie. Th Chupacabra looks like a cross between the Sleetaks of Land of the Lost and the Creation of the Black Lagoon. In addition, they had to use someone who was a little smaller, because the Chupacabra of legend is much smaller. All in all, the movie was so bad, it was funny. Why can't bullets and electricity stop the Chupacabra, but the captain's kickbox does OK? See if you are sick at home or feel down and need a good laugh.
