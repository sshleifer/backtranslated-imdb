The film Soultaker is essentially an older form of Final Destination in which several car-ridden teenagers have separated their souls from their bodies and have to deceive death by their pursuit.

If this movie is once again tackled with some good actors / actresses and some wonderful special effects it can be extremely awesome. As for the real movie, I recommend the MST3K version, the sheer version can be too boring to go through unless you love bad movies staring Martin Sheen's brother ...
