Extremely boring. I don't care how many avant-garde bones you have in your body. This baby sucks ... and won't see, because I mentioned it, except for Warhol's "Empire", it's far more entertaining! I saw other Duras movies that were much better, so I'm amazed why it is considered a "Masterpiece". As an Art historian, I had to consider radical works by Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Damien Hurst, and in this artist I can still see artistic intent, even quality and an entertaining aspect in delivering their art. As for "India Song" it is not even soft porn. Anias Nin was almost here - G-rated slideshow of sex and a voice-over that didn't relate to the slideshow not shit and not even camp ... unfortunately only a drill and a 2-hour spill. To add insult to injury was the pressure I saw blurred and scratched to hell !!! (Harvard Film Archive) If I want to see "annoyingly boring" I watch Bunuel !! Yes "India Song" - keep your head high to late modernism and be really bored! Watch a 70-year-old porn movie with all the good parts that are cut out and turn off the sound, you'll get 'India Song', but with better filmmaking and none of the annoying music or the shouting of the Fisherman's Consul!
