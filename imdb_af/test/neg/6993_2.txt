So pathetic it is not even funny. From the first scene in the movie I knew I was in a bad time. Thanks, I just saw this movie on TV. The story line was terrible, not to mention the acting. It was terrible. Many unreal and unusual things happened in this move, like. The lady put a whip under the door and whipped the man a little and he handed the keys only. I'm like, really. The creators' lousy attempt to make a futuristic city even deepened my aversion to the film. To tell the truth, the only good thing in this movie was the fight, which in itself was pretty lame. All I could ask myself when I watched this movie was "when is it going down!"
