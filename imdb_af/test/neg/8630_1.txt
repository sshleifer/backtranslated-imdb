Man, what a horrible movie. As with many horrible movies, the structure of his horror lies in writing. It is such a pathetic effort to give a psychological thriller that it gives the whole genre a bad name. Okay, here's one big problem: Sandra Bullock's character is kidnapped by Jeff Bridges in his car at a busy convenience store in broad daylight. Somehow her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland does not find a single witness to this act and then spend most of the movie completely clueless about her whereabouts. Come on! Personally, I find it completely offensive to even the darkest members of the audience. Yet we are forced to buy in this nonsense. Equally frustrated is the poor explanatory motive for Jeff Bridges's actions. His character is an eccentric academic, certainly, but far from the sociopath who would do these things. He's about ten minutes to go, give or take his beans to Sutherland for why he did his cruel acts. But the statement itself has even the most elementary sense of logic. Therefore, no intelligent hearing aid can really believe in the possibility of its evil. And if you subtract that element from the story, the whole thing falls apart. <br /> <br /> Also of great importance: -Jeff Bridges doesn't use a strange, pseudo-French accent. <br /> <br /> - The all-boring subplot that Nancy Travis entails, especially the day's savings by turning the tables on Bridges. <br /> <br /> The crazy woman somehow succeeds in remembering Jeff Bridges's number despite the fact that the Lucky Charms leprechaun is actually. <br /> <br /> -Sandra Bullock's character's name, Diane Shaver, is conveniently rearranged to form the word "disappear". Are you friggin 'joking me? -The logistic impossibility of being stunned, abducted and buried within a forty minute (specifically, Bridges) team (in a very remote location). <br /> <br /> It's a movie that made me remember the fictional, impossible stupid (but very successful) Donald Kaufman character in Adaptation. Many writers are brilliant, inspired artists. Some are just mad who convince the nitwits to run the studios to make their bravery. This particular script was so surprisingly thought that Donald Kaufman himself could sell it. Unfortunately for all of us in the real world, Todd Graff actually did.
