It is extremely rare that I see a 1955 film that I do not love. Noir, JDs, Sci-fi, Drive-Ins; I dig it the most. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done excellent work, and most of this film has good performances under their band. So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> Working in the Independent Film World, we talked about something called active movies. Actress movies are movies that are not available to anyone but other actors. Actors like "actress" movies, because they see ACTing - which is totally over-the-top melodrama. Actors like to give the opportunity to give up completely, "give everything they have" and they get a lot of satisfaction watching other actors. In many interviews with actors they say "he was a good director, he never interfered with me in any way." Actually, this is the opposite of good direction, because the whole point of having a director on the set is to keep the actors from making fools of themselves (who gave the chance, they will always do). <br /> <br /> Apparently Robert Aldrich forgot about this project. Or maybe he was sick. Or maybe he thought there was no hope to save the script in the first place, so what is it? Whatever the case, here's an example of a lesser-known movie that was best forgotten. The characters gesticulated, pontificate and generally get it all through. One thing I can say is realistic: it is in Hollywood and everyone acts like their little problems are the most important thing in the world. Don't look nice, but it's realistic. What is not realistic is that a producer who is so desperate to keep his star under contract goes out of his way to antagonize him in almost every possible way, including making him illegally engaged. But this and other plot contradictions only carry the melodrama together, which increases the opportunity for handwriting and accusation of history. <br /> <br /> I managed to get to the end of this movie, which doesn't make it worse than a "3" out of 10 in my book. But why test your own endurance when there is so much else available to rent?
