Oh wow, that character shares my first name! Nick! This movie is as bad as the first one, if not worse. Well, there is at least a real octopus in this movie. A real octopus that makes a better look in this movie. By better, I mean, "Longer" the acting is pretty dry and it's hard to go through. Just to let you know, when this ninety minute movie ends, you're not just being freed from your couch, but you get your ability to breathe. Not only that, but you realize how stupid you are and commit suicide, and realize how terrible life is after watching this movie. Really, it shows how desperate horror movies are today, more crap like this is realized and where is hell the real masters of horror recently? This movie had to be the final straw, so we can bring back filmy geniuses in horror cinema, which can actually make good modern horror movies, this movie bite.
