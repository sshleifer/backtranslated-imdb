I watched this exhibition for a while, just because of my cousins, and I hate it! First, the girls wear the same style of clothing, and they have the same first letter in their names. Then came the villains (save me), first we had a monkey with a part of his (small) brain showing, then we had a (gay) version of the devil, a pink hill, a gang green gang (which is ironic, it's their name), a spoiled princess (again, ironically, it's her name). I also found that there was no male hero in the show. (Not that I'm sexist or anything.) I'd rather watch Sailor Moon, it's much better than that. If someone else wants to see the show in the room you're in, find a way to break the television. Believe me, this will save you half an hour of torture. <br /> <br /> Rating: I just give it what it deserves, a 1 out of 10. Whatever you do, DO NOT BE IT!
