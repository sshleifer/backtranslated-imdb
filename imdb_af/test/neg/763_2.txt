For a scientifically-engineered super-dog that was supposed to be the answer to petit crime, CHOMPS was a bunch. <br /> <br /> All I ever saw was sitting or walking or running. Or run, then walk, then sit ... and then stand up and stretch, then walk, then jog to K-Tel dance hits. And sometimes it had all the answers of the daily Jumbo. But most of the time it's just a lot. <br /> <br /> All I say is: In a Celebrity Death Match, Chomps couldn't Take out Bigglesworth.
