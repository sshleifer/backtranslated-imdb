What can I say about a movie as bad as that? The people who made this movie didn't even try to make the monster, but it looks realistic. You never see more than his head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement, except when it opens the mouth to roar. And the sound they used for roaring is the best part. At many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a TIE warrior who is flying over! I couldn't believe it when I first heard it and had to rewind it a few times to make it sink. Unlike the horrible monster and the sounds it makes, there is little more to this movie, except for a few chances of attacking scenes and the crazy Scotsman attacking the kids, trying to have an intimate moment in his castle . Yet it is visible if you like this kind of garbage. I know I do.
