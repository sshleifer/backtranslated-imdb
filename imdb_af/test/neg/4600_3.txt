doesn't mean this movie is good. I was very frustrated at many levels. it is kind of the tip of the hat to bukowski. Hi, I read that guy in college - let's see what Matt Dillon is doing to him. and I love Matt Dillon. I thought he'd come closer to look a bit like a hank, but mostly just the reddish cheeks. However, I have to care about a character, and there just wasn't much to care about. I think time can be cruel for bukowski, and it bothered me a lot because the writing was solid in a kind of post-culture culture time. hard to walk through, scenes that went nowhere, and a soundtrack that made me vomit. I ask for very few, have less.
