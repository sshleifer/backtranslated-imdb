It was only after I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producer / star of this movie, Tyrone Power, died during the making. This undoubtedly explains why everyone on the screen thinks other things, a symptom of which occurs in a very early scene in which a struggle is involved that can only be described as pathetic. You know when you paint a wall until you're completely bored? Well, this is the kind of expression the fighters have on their face as they swing their swords in a highly unconvincing way. <br /> <br /> The plot centers on Soloman, the King of Israel who has a relationship with the Queen of Sheeba and his people are not happy with it. You can't really blame them because there are few things better in the world than this Israeli motif, even though the Israeli women look like Cherie Blair! Modern Israel is also very cosmopolitan, with the majority of Israelis born outside the country, but probably a few thousand years ago, where everyone speaks in European and American accents. <br /> <br /> After much talk and a dance series to be seen to be believed (And no who does not give praise) we have to defend a climax where the Israelis have surpassed themselves. massaged egyptian army who could not read a card, otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them. That's what I don't get. Although blinded by the sun, the Egyptians spend ten minutes charging the Israelis. They never realize they are loading a gaping gorge! Isn't that somewhat illogical? It's also something of a revelation error, as the horses, wagons and men who fall into the canyon are of course small figures. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God if you have an idiotic enemy who can't see a gorge in front of him or swear a sword as he paints a wall?
