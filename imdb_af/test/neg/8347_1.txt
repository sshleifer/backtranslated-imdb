The story of a volcano erupting in the city center sounds like a pretty plot for a disaster movie. However, this one was missed bigtime. The movie looks chaotic, has a storyline that is difficult to follow or believe, and the act was very bad. <br /> <br /> I agree with many comments that Lee Jones is just good at letting people around as a head in a particular field. In this one, he is on his way to the emergency office. As head of such an office, it is of course a good idea to bring your daughter to dangerous scenes. Smart thinking. Ann Heche touches walls and runs into tunnels that are probably 678 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes right. Apart from the bad acting, the factual errors are so similar to Armageddon. The only good thing about this movie is that there is no Ben Affleck to make matters worse. Avoid this movie at all costs.
