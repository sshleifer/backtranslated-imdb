I have to live this movie, but I don't. It won international awards, it's strange (I usually like such movies). It moves slowly (again something I want) and it has no sex or violence. The problem is that it is boring. We have two friends from the same town in Turkey, one of the "successful" others. the unsuccessful one comes to Istanbul to succeed in trying to get good work at sea. Both living lives are unfinished, useless and small. <br /> <br /> Well, that's not the first time this kind of movie was made. I didn't see anything new on this tired theme. There are long tasks that only someone stands watching the sea or sitting in a coffee shop or watching television. I understand that this kind of thing is there to show the emptiness of their love. While it did, I got the idea in the first 15 minutes. I don't have to be beaten for the rest of the two hours. <br /> <br /> The symbolism is also a bit heavy handed. the plate of lively minnow-type fish with one of the plates and flap around in his death throws. Symbols are the best when they are not obvious, but there is a mood in the background that is only slightly lower than the viewer's awareness. <br /> <br /> The movie is so apathetic that it's not even a score of 1, so I gave it a 2. Determining a 1 takes a talent to be bad. This movie didn't have that much energy.
