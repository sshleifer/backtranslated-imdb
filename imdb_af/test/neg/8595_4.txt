If you can watch a movie without worrying about the plot or wheat work, then Backdraft is definitely the one. <br /> <br /> But if you, like me, like movies you can believe, Backdraft has some serious flaws. It does not offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90 action movies that follow the same formulas, while not so many. <br /> <br /> After two firefighting, I think it should go somewhere else, I mean, how many big fires are there in one city? Surely firemen do other things, like getting cats out of trees? Well, I went wrong, and the repetition goes on and on again to the end. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the movie is the fire itself, well filmed, and I have to say I feel completely warm while I watch It suggests that two hours burning without a story or play would be more appropriate be for my taste.
