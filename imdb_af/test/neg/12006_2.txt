this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning so ever. I have become bad for all the actors and actresses that have ruined the career of being in this silly movie. The whole movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, as little as it did, which made it even stupid. even some of the names were unrealistic. The movie is fun to watch, so it had 2 out of 10 stars. It's probably the 3rd stupid movie ever made. I really did after realizing that it had mostly adult actors in it, but was a children's movie. The most disturbing one was Danny Trejo, a horror movie actor who was always dirty. The other actors were pretty clean as far as I'm concerned.
