The Tender Hook, or, Who Killed the Australian Film Industry? Case no. 278. This sorry excuse for a period drama takes a role and idea with potential ?? Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda, Hugo Weaving, in a jazz-era gangster drama? and change it to a sloppy pace and performed soporific. McHeath (Weaving) is a boxing promoter and gangster and functional illiterate; For no apparent reason, he was given to sing Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen songs before the match. How to postmodern. How stupid. Anyway. There is a boxer, Art (Matthew Le Nevez), who becomes McHeath's latest protégé, about his unlucky Aboriginal Stalmaat Alby (Luke Carroll). <br /> <br /> McHeath's flapper moll Iris (Byrne) makes him goo-goo eyes. Sexual tension squelches below the surface. Miranda plays Daisy, a friend of Iris (these flower girls gather) appearing in unannounced scenes. They practice dancing together and talking about joining with guys. In the 1920s. I then stopped counting anachronisms. There is a subplot with Japanese beer and a backdrop of Broome pearl fishermen. I don't know what it's all about. For some reason, which is not completely explained, Byrne puts cocaine in Art's lemonade. McHeath thinks he's drunk and drops him. Byrne plots and schemes to help him again. She is a great one for the plot and twilight. Most cause problems. McHeath's two gossips, Portly Ronnie (John Batchelor) and Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin) debate McHeath when he realizes their role in one of Iris's schemes. Ronnie sneaks out when he sees McHeath crying. Many practical incoherent scenes eventually end up in the movie. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Ogilvie spends a lot of time with kinographer Geoffrey Simpson who creates beautiful images, but completely fails to feel a sense of style, which could be compensated for the decorated, pathetic underlying text; Unfortunately, Ogilvie's sense of film grammar, the lack of structuring the scenes and outline, is incredibly incompetent. In an early stage, Daisy suddenly appears in the car with the lead actors. How she got there, and indeed who she was, apparently slipped Ogilvie's mind. There are many more examples of this mess. Where he chases away poetic fury, he only gets irritation. He gets uncomfortable actions by actors who are usually trustworthy, poorly miscarried. Weave and lean on Byrne's ability to deploy a ghostly humanity as she saddles her with an incomprehensible character. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter much if the story had more significant characters, and stronger plot formation was not stolen from a dozen old noir movies, and mocked with incomprehensible pop culture quotes. But it doesn't. It's boring.
