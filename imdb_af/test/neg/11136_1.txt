I hate movies that look like this! <br /> <br /> This 16mm disaster is full of claws, stereotypical characters, a generic, plot and terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this "Movie" we have the Aggressive Black Guy, The Black Guys Girlfriend, The Blonde Titch, The Possible Lesbian "hacker Chick", the Pedophilic teacher ... Blah, Blah, Blah .. .. And then the Pumpkin Man. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone is taking the legend too far?" This question is asked at the end of the film. Take the Tag or Scream 2 too far. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** Typically I'm not in spoilers, but I have to rant .... <br /> <br /> A dream? The whole thing was a dream !!!!! This is the most spoken way to end a movie. "I don't know how to explain it all, and we no longer have money ... Let's make the whole thing a dream." This is what the director / producer / actor / FX man had to think about. Yes, the director is the character of Mr. E He did almost everything on this garbage movie. It's such an end to the end. And what about the principal, okay, so he did the kidnapping! What did it have to do with the movie? Of course, the black people are killed, the kid is dead, the teacher who has a past sexual harassment with students is killed (he is the main suspect) .... YUCK YUCK YUCK !!! This film gave me heartburn. <br /> <br /> Pointless, senseless, and made with parents Visa and Mastercards (who say it's probably still paid off), this movie is stupid, boring and just stupid. ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the credits. The way they get the names, etc. At the beginning and at the end. It had a creepy feel. Bad movie didn't! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
