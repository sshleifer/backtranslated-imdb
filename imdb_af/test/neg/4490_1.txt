The movie begins in the spring of 2001. A soldier, John Tyree (Channing Tatum), falls in love with student Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried). Within two weeks they fall in love with each other (!). But he must go to war and she must go to college. They do but keep in touch by writing to each other. Then 9/11 happens. He wants to adapt - she wants him to stay home. What will they do? <br /> <br /> Hysterically bad romantic drama. The lead is attractive - Tatum is definitely an attractive man with beautiful green eyes and a warm body (he made a jacket out of the water after he had surfed) ... but he can't act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries ... but the dialogue here is terrible. When I saw it, I fought my friend and I hardly to laugh out loud at the beginning of the romantic dialogue. It was just awful. For the first time or so, I was bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the terrible "romance". Then, after that first hour, tragedy kicks in and I have to admit I had my tears. But the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure you cry with death, funerals and encounters, with people tearing down in tears. How can you not cry? It would have been if the acting was better. Tatum's face never changes expression - not even! He always had a bright look on his face. Seyfried was a little better but not much. To make matters worse, Tatum and Seyfried didn't have any sexual chemistry on the screen! They barely looked like they kept apart, let alone and love one another. There was a beautiful photograph of the Carolinas, but it is a boring and silly romantic "drama". A 1 completely ... and I usually like stupid romantic plays like this!
