It was one of the most dishonest, meaningless and non-peaceful of the movies I've ever seen. The representation of the others, of the Israelis, was racist, backward and unfair. For the one, the song played on the E.Sc radio has played with a very right-wing Israeli driver, "Natacha Atlas". The song's style is pretty Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation CD, and I even heard it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food and snakes) are influenced by Arab culture, and there is no reason why an Israeli Jew is offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song. The way E.S. Looks so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool luster, through a long, still shot, is meant to force the viewer to see the Jew as haggard and racist, and E.S. so noble and moderate. <br /> <br /> I traveled all over Israel, and I have never seen an IDF recruiting clerk since service is mandatory. But in the film there is not only a recruitment poster, but it shows a stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words "want to shoot?" It is an extremely inaccurate portrayal of the majority of Israelis as well as Israeli soldiers, and such an "advertisement" will not even exist on a random Israeli highway. By including this, the director intends to convince the audience that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists who have been murdered. <br /> <br /> The ninja scene was free and unnecessarily violent. A Hollywood action scene in which Israeli soldiers shooting Palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an Israeli-directed film as the ninja scene had to be. But for one reason or another, images of an unrealistic, non-comical and violent scenario are applauding the audience, as the director has so far spread the Israeli side that any deadly shot of Israeli soldiers would be killed. The director shows absolutely no attempt to build bridges, to portray "others" or to work for peace; violence is made to be the only solution. It is promoted by scenes of explosive tanks, falling towers, and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends is serving in the Israeli army, and the targets in firearms are never Arab women dressed in black or any other quasi-citizen on canvas. Soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching Palestine unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; The method, according to my friend, is to shout a warning, in the air or to burn the area, and if everything else fails, shoot into the bone and then investigate and hospitalize. It is not the correct procedure to direct a woman into the head as shown in the head. <br /> <br /> Apart from these inaccuracies, the steering style was also poor. Repetition has become repetitive and no longer fascinating. Symbols, such as the balloon drawn with Arafat, are forced out of any plot structure or effective integration into the environment; The balloon is Palestine that pierces and regains Jerusalem, and for no reason does E.S. created. The ambulance is being inspected for Israeli soldier permits, followed by subsequent Israeli ambulances flying over the checkpoint. This is an exaggerated demand for an Israeli double standard by the director. The attempt by the director to show life in Nazareth as critical and useless is done with leftovers; show the routines of random people over and over again, even with a slight change every time, and emphasize that not one member of the roll-cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue, shouting the appearance of such scenes, the sadness of life, almost without much room for personal interpretation. Unlike part of the film, the daily life in Nazareth, with the second part, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director blames this threat on Israel, but never gives any direct evidence as to why the blame can be correct. argued. <br /> <br /> I spent hours trying to figure out why music suddenly ended and started suddenly, and why many modern fashion shows and metal action tracks were included in the score. I still can't get an answer. I felt that the music was out of place in this movie; The contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually irritating and non-influential or thought-provoking. I can understand whether the director of the music is meant to give some scenic aspects to certain scenes, but I found that there is nothing comical that is found in Israeli soldiers. They are shooting at targets or fighting a ninja or a woman has to walk through a checkpoint, even if it is challenging. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes, and irritated by the lack of counting during quiet scenes. As far as the director's intent is concerned, it just had a mental dissatisfaction in the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has no legal political message because it offers inaccurate and extreme representation of the other and fails to address any problems. It is a propaganda film, because the director plans several symbols, styles and scenes to establish sympathy for the Palestinian side, while the Israeli side is shown cruelly and inhumanly without exception. The lively atmosphere of an action-packed Hollywood scene or intense music is displayed in every act of violence by Palestinians against Israelis, so that almost inevitably positive and excited feelings evoking the music and cinematography from the audience are directed at one end. There is no thought, reflection or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience; Emotions are simply pulled on one side, and held there, in a "good vs bad" clich√© scenario. I believe this film did not lack the depth, quality and power of other Palestinian films, such as "Paradise Now" and "Wedding in the Galilee."
