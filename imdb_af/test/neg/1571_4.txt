The movie was disappointing. I saw it on Broadway with Bernadette Peters and she was excellent. Perhaps as she grabs herself at the end of her music career, her condition of despair gives her the role she flaunts, reinvests and triumphs as her own. Bette's song is always belted, always flat and missing to show her ability as an actress. To be entertaining, this show died for a stronger lead and a stronger role, so the other in Bette's absence would be memorable. Another criticism: his smile directly in the camera every time she starts singing! I know this is music theater, but please leave a little grace social. Middler cannot act like Liza or Streisand may be in a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.
