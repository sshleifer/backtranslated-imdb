I really love horror movies and try to give everyone what I see as much credit (or sometimes more) as possible, but it really pushes the ticket ... most of the role players were alike, but hardly any of them could act not at all - but think again about the writing / dialogue of this mess ... some good makeup, but absolutely ridiculous special fx. All in all I give it 3 out of 10 - and I have second thoughts about it !!
