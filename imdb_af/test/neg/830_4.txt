Even before this movie, it is clear to see that Ali G has become the exact character he has given to parody. Anyway, I'm not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's character, but was curious to see a man with so little talent convinced universal studios about a 1-and-a-half-hour movie from a To fund a 3 minute joke. <br /> <br /> A paper thin plot is just a sprout of penis and dagga jokes, and I have to admit I was hurt when I saw such respected thespians, as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon were so low for work. To say that I have to admit (even if I'm shy) that I've had a tits more than once, and how bad this movie was, it was never boring and I never even considered it do not link (mainly due to the beautiful Rhona Mitra). Say that, just watch this movie if you are a teenager between the ages of 14 and 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious.
