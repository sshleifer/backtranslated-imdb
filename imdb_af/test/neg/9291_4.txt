Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without a passport. She's in a lot of trouble, I won't know exactly, and even American extraterritoriality won't help her. <br /> <br /> I mention it because one of the grievances that the Chinese are including the bandits that are attacking The American mission in this story that was deep in the Chinese interior was the specific institution by which US citizens who committed crimes by US courts through our consulates. However, we were far from the only country that did so. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story with her on a train opens to Shanghai to use a Hokey Russian accent. The accent intrigue Warner Baxter, which is nicely plastered. <br /> <br /> However, bandits interrupt the journey and the two of them seek refuge in the American consulate hosted by Charles Winninger. He's the best in the movie and I just wish a better story was given because I liked his character. He is a widower and a proud member of the consular service, appointed by William McKinley in 1900. He requested a transfer ten years later, which is the last thing he heard about. As Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Hale made it appropriate, he is the real forgotten man. <br /> <br /> Baxter knocks everything into a role that someone like Clark Gable would have had in his sleep at MGM. The heroic would have been more natural to Gable than to Baxter, as the mission was defended and defended against the bandits. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye had one number to sing. Why Alice's song was cut out, God and Zanuck don't know. One thing I still try to find out is when the mission residents take a final refuge in the basement with a fall door, just who is left over to pull the carpet over the basement door? <br /> <br /> Barricade had the potential to be much better than it was. But untidy editing and lost faith in the project released 20th Century Fox from an unfinished project. Watching Barricade is like eating a bad cooked meal.
