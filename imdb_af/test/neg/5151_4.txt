No, it's just a cheap 1940 series with the Cap's good name. If you are a fan of the comic book, you will be very disappointed. They changed the character radically. No shield, no Bucky, no fight against the Nazis, no wings on the side of his mask and most importantly: Captain America is now a District Attorney and no longer a GI. <br /> <br /> Dick Purcell as Captain America? Do not look too closely when he changes in his costume. It's pretty obvious he wasn't in the best physical shape when he made this series (can you be foolish?). It is also very clear that a stuntman performs most of the action here. Almost every chapter has a compulsory fist fight that is shot and executed in exactly the same way. The villain is rather slim and although he uses an alias (The Scarab), he does not carry any kind of disguise. The story is repetitive and very simple. The effects are lazy and the action is average. On the positive side, our sexy Lorna Gray as the D.A. his assistant and good captain are driving an early chapter on a cool motorcycle. Overall OK but nothing special.
