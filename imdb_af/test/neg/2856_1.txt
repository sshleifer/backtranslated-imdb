.... You get this silly excuse for a Child's Play rip-off! Man, what do they think? First, they are messing with a Rumpelstiltskin horror movie, then they make such a crap. Variety Languages â€‹â€‹Hateers! Well, to be honest, I saw it as a child, and it got me a little, just because I was under age assuming Pinocchio wouldn't do it, wah wah wah. But I grew up and think of it as Child's Play rip, a fairy tale bash nonsense, and a lame Tales From The Crypt episode, or try to be one, with a lame end that's stupid and that have many plot holes, and I still can't understand how it came to life. Was it the work of an evil Geppetto? Then, what does he become after some evil acts, a real boy who has become America's Most Popular? Personally, I think the concept of an evil Geppetto sounds better, he builds an army of murderers and starts a crime wave, funny. But it is terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible! Awful! Stink like a shoe, and terrible! It sucked it! If you want killer puppies, instead of attaching the killer doll, specifically Child's Play, do not attach any strings. Or if you want a fairy tale character on his head, watch Leprechaun, or if you want Pinocchio, watch the animated Disnet version or live version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau instead. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
