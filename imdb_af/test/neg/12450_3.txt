Slow-moving ponderous movie with horrible drama on the whole - but lovely places and clothes to admire, and of course Timothy Dalton, who does a compelling job, as always. I wanted to laugh out loud at the voice recording - so stupid! But Dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very attractive and masculine. This movie is worth seeing just to see him .... and he seems to have walked in a bad romance romance novel, poor man. Your time will be better spent on Mr. Dalton watched in 1970's "Wuthering Heights" or the early 1980s version of Jane Eyre. Poor Sela Ward, so nice, but so wood. Certainly, she's better in other movies.
