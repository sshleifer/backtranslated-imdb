Yes, stupid is the word for this actress. I know many mentioned her beauty, but this viewer found her empty head and boring to look with her bleached hair, lip gloss and not so perfect body. See how she walks away in those jeans, with a pretty big butt. Her buttocks spread over her shoulders. What does that tell you? As for the leading man, played by beautiful Mark Humphrey, he was perfectly thrown. A charmer. However, he and Lancaster do not match. She was off guard against this pretty guy. Acting well by Susan Glover as the sister. Angela Galuppo played a small role and was right. But film director Philippe Gagnon has wasted too much footage on Lancaster. After a while you got tired of looking at her and looking at her dull acting ability. And what a woman of a woman she was. Snooping on her husband, who is stupid and just spoiling a spoil. Was happy to see her hit with the arrow gun. I thought it might be the end of her. But unfortunately, the script tells us differently. After torturing myself and seeing this loser again, I still got the same criticism. Lancaster is boring to watch. This time around her hair, people. Her hair constantly in her face, constantly throwing it back, became annoying. I question the author, Alexandra Komisaruk's reason why a good looks rich man like Philippe even bothering like a bimbo like Allison. When there were so many handsome intelligent women, with the class to choose. He picks up nothing. Is this the Rochester / Jane Eyre thing? Oh, that's all a matter of taste, I think. This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup of tea, people.
