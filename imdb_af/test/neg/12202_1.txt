That was what I felt screaming and bumping out of the theater, but I was bothering myself. Yes, the acting was great, no it wasn't the typical Hollywood movie, but the dialogue just didn't end (or become interesting)! And despite all the gabbing, you never really know or care about any of the characters. Definitely the most boring movie I've seen since the sphere, but I expected you to be boring. I had to sit there, but please, save yourself
