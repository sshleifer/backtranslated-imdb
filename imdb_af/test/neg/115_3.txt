I saw this movie again in the middle / late 80s when I was a child. We couldn't even get it all out. The dialogue, the acting, everything about it, was just over. <br /> <br /> Here are some examples ... Suggest this spoken dramatic dramatic way: Oreegon? You go to Oreegon Why would anyone go to Oreegon? "<br /> <br />" Survivalists? No one ever told us about any survivalists! "<br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, my sister and I rented It is again for her 16th birthday party, so we can move friends around and laugh at how terrible it was. don't finish!
