Well now, this movie is a piece of work. It's full of stupid jesus refrences and dialougue that will make most human beings ask if they don't have to film at all. Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine subscribe, but take it from me, suck this movie. The story is incomprehensible and lacking in intelligence. The sets, motorcycles and costumes come out as a cross between two and five and a slavery. I'm sure there's porn with better dialougue.
