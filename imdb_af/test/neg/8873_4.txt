The actors are so dull that it is almost impossible to tell them apart (Pauline Kael said of this movie, "The actors have names, but they are really anonymous"), and the special effects are really bad. They simulate weightlessness with people hanging on cables and the trick that Fred Astaire on the ceiling in "Royal Wedding" dancing (but none of these guys move well enough to make it seem convincing). <br /> <br /> The lowest point of the movie is when one of the characters, an air force pilot, tries to convince other "giants of industry" to join him in a moon-rocket consortium, and he shows them a Woody Woodpecker cartoon explaining how a rocket works on a 2nd-level plane! (And to think that Robert Heinlein worked on the screenplay ...) <br /> <br /> The only plus is that the production design manages to communicate some kind of "Amazing Stories" sensitivity, and even This is much better done. in the producer's (George Pal) movie "When Worlds Collide", which has similarly bad acting, but is much more entertaining. However, Pal's best sci-fi movie should be "The Time Machine".
