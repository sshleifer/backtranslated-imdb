I bought this Chuck Norris DVD and knew it was one of its earliest movies, and it shows. We all know he will never win an Oscar for his play, but that's not what we see him for. Although there have been some earthquakes in California since this movie, there was never a desert or hills between Hwy.99 and I 5. Billy supposedly switched from 99 to 5 along 120, a distance of less than 15 miles. I wish the authors, producers and directors of these movies would at least look at a map. As a truck driver who spends a lot of time in California, I could tell from the beginning that the geography was wrong. However, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. So grab your Doritos and an adult drink and enjoy a journey back in time.
