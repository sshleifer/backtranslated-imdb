The obvious ESPN drools when Knight is in the news, but did they make a freakin movie about him? It was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie I've ever seen. It had everything: horrible acting, terrible dialogue, ridiculous decisions, cheap sets, etc. It looked like it was shot at a $ 10 budget. Cummon, how about the game scenes? Were they in a middle school gym? And the lighting, well, just let me say it's ridiculous. And Brian Denehy as Bob Knight? Give me a chance. Denehey looked like ... The one in a red jersey, nothing more. ESPN has lost much credibility with this flop attempt. They poured millions of dollars into advertising, then the prime minister was a big dissapointment. Bob Knight is not a subject that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. ESPN blew it. Even Knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else.
