Let me start with a terrible story and a terrible control system. good animation but not too good graphics. That is why I give this game 4 out of 10. THIS PLAY needs an improvement if you ask me !!! I will reconsider and make the control system better so that jaws are not so difficult to control. If I had improved it, I would look better than the movie. It will make anyone crazy if you are so easily killed. I played it and was murdered by a diver when he had one of those two hit movies. The dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will beg to go to the bottom of hell. this game sucks a little fat ass. sorry about all the cussing i think i'm done now. It's just that this game is so bad that it has to be taken out of the store's shelf. I dare to play the garbage and you will probably get so crazy by dying so easily, don't play it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
