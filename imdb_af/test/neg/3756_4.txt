Of the four main players here - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin - the only one I've never heard before (at the time) was the one that annoyed me and ruined the movie. Well, she had to do a decent job of acting to let me throw her and the VHS into the rubbish bin. I refer to Kelly in the role of teen brat, "Tia Russell." Ironically, she played a beautiful and extremely enjoyable role six years later in the person of "Rowena Morgan" in "Mr. Holland's Opus." <br /> <br /> Candy, as usual, is nice to watch as Buck Russell, "or the title character," Uncle Buck. "Few players were better off playing a sweet, incessant slap than Candy. I enjoyed his character here, but I can't see that perishable girl once. Also, in the first few minutes of the movie, the boy "Miles" (Cauklin) the word "G-damn." How bad is it, with a six-year-old child who tells the name of the Lord in vain on film? These Hollywood people are so sickos. their child actors are upset spiritually, Caulkin is a matter in the point.
