I thought I saw this movie because the plot summary sounds familiar. But when I watched it one afternoon, I didn't recognize anything - if I had seen it before, I had to block the horror from it. <Br /> <br /> This movie is terrible and it shows its age. In fact, it looks older than it is: more like a mid-80s moronic comedy. While being a fan of toilet humor and seeing the funny side of many things, it is 'comedy' at its most childish and homophobic. The plot is as thin as a Supermodel, which wouldn't bother me if the movie was just funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one entertaining line in the whole movie that the character Louis said: "Looks like someone threw away a perfect good white boy!" In fact, Louis is the only peculiar character (and it doesn't say much). James and Carl are the kind of annoying, immature men that a sensible woman would run a mile, their practical jokes about as humorous as the war in Iraq; The character of Susan Wilkins is colorless (looks like Julia Roberts, but lacks her charisma) and there is zero chemistry between her and Carl - although it may be unfair to blame the actress because I don't know what she could have done with that a poorly written part; and the villain is not funny or frightening or unforgettable. <br /> <br /> There is good rubbish and bad trash. This is garbage that should not be recycled.
