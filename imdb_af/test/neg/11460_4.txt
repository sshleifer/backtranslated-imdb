Unfortunately, this movie is typical of watering a good movie by many successors. In the 1940s, Universal made several serial sample films, which were pale imitations of the original. The intelligent Egyptian writer Imhotep was replaced by Frankenstein, who was dragged into a mummy wrapper, showing no signs of intelligent life. This movie is fun in places, but if you've seen The Mummy (1932), you'll be disappointed.
