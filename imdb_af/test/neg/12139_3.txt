Let me be clear. I hate these kind of movies. I don't like something where the protagonists are all English bourgeoisie. I find this kind of literature and film terribly pretentious. You will never read a Jane Austen book willingly. It said, the only reason I read W. Somerset Maugham's book and watched the movie was for a class. <br /> <br /> Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a beautiful English woman living in a borrowed villa in Florence. before World War II. One night after eating with some of her rich royal relatives, she willingly picked up an Austrian refugee, had sex with him and locks, and then killed himself. As the film goes further and further, you really don't want Maria. <br /> <br /> What a piece of crap this movie was. First, there were many subplots and characters invented in the movie that wasn't even in the book. I doubt many at the end of Mr. Maugham would have appreciated them. The characters, though affluent, were among the superficial and self-centered people I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give it less than three stars was because the play is the only thing redeemable. The talented Kristin Scott Thomas is perfect for Maria's role. In fact, I couldn't fill someone else's shoes. Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft also had roles, which were as good as the head. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain of watching this movie.
