When I see the poster at the theater, I thought it was a "new line" of a horror story without a well-known role worth trying a try. But after I went in, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There were many non-sense and logical defects. For me, it's a movie that's not worth playing theaters. It's not even worth seeing.
