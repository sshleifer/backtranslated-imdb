Just saw it at the Madison Horror Film Festival and was disappointed. A few shocking, funny moments (like the hollow Carla, a urinating harp in the Dreamland) and two interesting interesting sites (similar to the New Nightmare with faith that brings a mythical character to life and also lost highway with a man who lives a fantasy in his life, but had long streams of no movement and incoherent plot development. Just because you use the framework of dreams or a spiritual fluid state doesn't make it Lynchian. You need the compelling visual art and the spectacular performances. <br /> <br /> Positive things: Dr Maitland had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute. Carla's father, Chalmers, and Ingrid Pitt seemed to have had fun. And at least Tom Savini seemed to have memorized his lines and we couldn't see if he was just reading card cards. <br /> <br /> I get the hammer references, but it seems the director realizes that the script was a snoozer and just added a few shocks to try to make a little laugh out of any footage he put together could sit down. But they do not work, because they are too few and far between and create a contradictory tone. Condensate it up to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you can have a surreal bare short, but over the length of the function, skip it. It's not that bad, it's good. It's just as bad, it's boring.
