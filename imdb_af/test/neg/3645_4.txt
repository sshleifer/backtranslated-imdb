I look forward to watching this movie, and it contains many interesting perspectives from Iraqis across the country, not just in key areas. <br /> <br /> But as the film goes on and as it seems increasingly more one-sided, I began to wonder who chose the movie. To get as many hundreds of hours down to just 80 minutes, of course, had to be made decisions. <br /> <br /> I would really have had a movie showing how every day Iraqis felt on all sides of the issues, but with the newspaper headlines as opposed to what people said, and with everyone in the movie with the same opinion at the end, I thought it was obvious that editing was done with a preconceived bias. <br /> <br /> It could have been such a good movie.
