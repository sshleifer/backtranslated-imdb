Man bites this thing! I'm sorry, I've ever sat down and watched it! Friedkin was insane for making a movie trying to sympathize with the viewers for this insane. If that were me, I would hate the audience that low life instead of getting all the foggy eyes over him! He killed people! Very grizzly, I can add too! And Friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because he's "not right"! I say Friedkin can forget it! I hate the man who is partly based on this movie and hope they have made sense and his pity gives the juice! Don't waste your time! It's sick and perverse!
