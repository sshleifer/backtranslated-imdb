Telly Savalas puts it up as the Mexican revolutionary (although he agrees with Chuck Connors as a military martinet) in this jokey, but rather boring about the life and times of the well-known historical figure. A previous attempt, VILLA RIDES! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and co-star Robert Mitchcum, treated these events more soberly and on a larger scale. As such, PANCHO VILLA is an all too typical European company and an incomprehensible one in spite of its credibility; The end result is more often stupid, rather than amusing. Although it takes a few moments, especially the action pieces and a play that involves a noise in a church, it offers some fun. Oh, and Savalas even gets the end of the title!
