Dear Mr Ram Gopal Varma, I do not know in what capacity I am writing this letter to you. I'm a never-told-he-finished Amitabh Bachchan fan, who was sitting in Jaadugar by his cock-chasing act. I also demand an important indication in The Godfather Fan Club, after watching the Coppola classic, more than you delivered from your Factory. And of course I was a big fan of yours, from then on, you had Nagarjuna the cycle chain around his knuckles in Shiva. <br /> <br /> When you announced and called Sarkar, you had Godfather, everyone who wanted to know was the date on which the first look would be, the Sunday would be the promotions on the air, the Friday the movie is released. It was pure wish fulfillment at work, knowing that, and not someone hanging between the mustard fields of Amritsar and Amsterdam's tulip gardens, you had the task of recreating the Puzo pages on the big screen of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> Your site could no longer be yours ?? working for the first time with the legend, throwing Abhishek as his screen-son, giving Kay Kay a role he has earned for years. He withheld forgotten faces such as Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar and included non-actors such as Katrina and Tanishaa to join. the list ?? Before July 1, you ever made Sarkar the most anticipated movie for any Godfather freak worshiping Bachchan. <br /> <br /> The opening points have expressed the hope that you have gorgeous sepia-tinted promotions on the telly. But now you call Sarkar your tribute to Godfather instead of the word "inspired" you've been using for a long time. Probably you don't want the two creations to be compared, but if the medium is the same, a Canopy will be compared to Reservoir Dogs and a Reservoir Dogs to a city on fire. <br /> <br /> Also when your first and last rows ?? the heart of any screenplay treatment ?? is about settling and transferring power, you can't keep the Nagares and the Corleones apart, even if you replace the American mafia with the political power play of Maharashtrian. <br /> <br /> But you're wrong, Mr. Hot ?? You wanted to show Amitabh in his 70's avatar, as rolled on the pins of Salim-Javed. You wanted him to look bigger than life. You wanted him to be his own trademark (o). How can you steal his voice to use silence? How could you put him in his chair in the hunt for interesting camera angles? How could you have stranded him without his voice and silence, the two things she made B so big? Coppola's Godfather cameraman Gordon Willis masked Brando's eyes throughout the movie because it didn't have the power to fit that spectacular voice or snap of the fingers. But you have tried to repeat the Malik act of your own company. But Bachchan is not an Ajay Devgan ?? his forts do not lie in the stagnant stare and the stifling silence. You made the man look like a dedicated patient, who is occasionally reminded to look at the predictable one-liners to the cue cards. For this, Agneepath is there, a certain Saturday. <br /> <br /> What Bachchan fan is going to watch Kay Kay Menon storing the thunder from under his nose in the scene where Sarkar Vishnu asks to leave his house? Which Amitabh aficionado is going to watch, focus on achar and carom, in a movie talking about power with a capital P in the promotions? We can't handle so much in the name of restraint and understatement! You don't even let the camera rest for five seconds when he finds out that his son wanted to kill him. Give me the old-school-only-on-Bachchan style, any Saturday. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kudos will make you an actor from Abhishek, first in Naach and now in Sarkar. You also allow him to show Mallika Shera that he can run as well as his father. Even in the short prison order, you really make the Bachchans out of the text, an opportunity Shaad missed in Bunty Aur Babli. Wishing the movie might be more a father-son story, rather than a chaotic caricature conflict in the name of characters, which appears like the advertising windows on the internet. <br /> <br /> You also let the women go more. In the writing as Puzo and Coppola you have already earned Brownie points to cut them so effectively. Pathak is a welcome return as the mother in the middle, Tanishaa loves the sweet-hearted girl, Katrina, a revelation as Abhishek's confused lover and Rukhsar's silence talking volumes. <br /> <br /> But subplots are not a classic repetition. When your free-running camera tries to make every frame irritate and irritate your hard background score, we still remember being in a factory. Well, maybe not a Nino Rota score, but Sarkar definitely deserves better than Govinda's, Govinda's and uncalled-for-flute mixes. <br /> <br /> Mr. Varma, some of your Factory directors tell me that you are involved in each project, from overseeing the shooting schedules to overseeing the editing sessions. Perhaps, in the midst of all the different storyboards, the Bhiku Matre shout is subdued by the Subhash Nagare silence. Perhaps you should put the shutters down in the factory and work on a single homemade product. Otherwise, your products will remain, use and throw products, not estimate. And movie buffs like me, for whom there are no hits and flops, just good movies, prefer a movie without Factory finishes, any Saturday.
