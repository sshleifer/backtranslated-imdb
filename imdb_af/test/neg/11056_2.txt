Bottom-of-the-bar stinker is so bad it is out of the ordinary. The "plot" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film he is called a "military adviser", but it is not quite clear whether he is in the US military or not) to the army of Help a Latin American fight guerrillas get excited to join the guerrillas when the government turns on, torture and torture him. Shannon Tweed is a sports equipment salesman that he picks up in a bar caught in all the intrigue. This description makes the movie sound better than it is, because it is really a stinker of almost biblical relationships. How bad is that? Well, Shannon Tweed turns into the movie's most professional acting work. If it's not an indication of how a twelfth grade junk is this turkey, nothing is irreconcilable to a music party that looks like it comes from a 1940s "Z" grade horrorflick (and can be very good ) to the same footage (ie armored personnel who follow the same jungle trail) repeatedly to some of the most inconspicuous plays in recent memory, this laughter-minute mud party should be seen as disbelieved. Tweed looks bored, brown looks hanged, and by now this thing is done - if you can keep that long; I can't - you'll just know how they feel. <br /> <br /> Although there are many explosions and gunfights, it cannot be regarded as an "action" picture by any imagination. . It's boring (there's a scene in the back of a truck where everybody stays three or four minutes apart), repeating (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" being killed over and over), illogical (when a group of rebels is caught in an open field by a state helicopter gunship, instead of breaking the cover they are just standing there to watch), unobtrusive (soldiers and rebels who "die" when no guns shoot , a rifle battle in a house where fighters who stand against walls are machine gunners, but miraculously escapes the walls undamaged) predictable (when the "governor" says to offer a reward for Brown's catch because "someone" him you know exactly who that person will be, and it seems exactly what you thought it was and just really stupid (pretty much everything else in the picture). Improper, brainless and stupid, out of faith. Don't waste your time.
