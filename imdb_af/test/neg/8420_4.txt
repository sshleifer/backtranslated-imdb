Dry disrespectful, but unfortunately it is not a satire of detective videos, with Michael Caine, with a rocky face, who plays a British writer of trashy crime stories following the Mediterranean journey to help memorize a popular wrestler to write. He soon realized that he was being followed and his life was in danger. Caine tells the proceedings with sizable and bad sarcasm, but his real performance is energy saving. (Caine's sharp outbursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere, and he doesn't link to anyone on the screen). Other role players (especially Mickey Rooney, a silver hair Lionel Stander, and Lizabeth Scott) are doing very well in colorful outrolls, though Al Lettieri has an abusive role as a seemingly cross-embellished. (Lettieri is insulted without being able to defend himself, a petty position). Author-director Mike Hodges has a good idea (satirizing the 1940s detective films without harming the hard-boiled talk and environment), but he doesn't have a very keen sense of humor. When a Bogart lookalike - a question about a falcon - is the best joke, it is indeed anemic. ** of ****
