Not as bad as some people say ... This is an unofficial Bond movie and a remake of Thunderball, written by Kevin McClory (co-producer in Thunderball). Well, the role play is very interesting. Maria Brandauer is a good Bond villain, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are just like the "original" Bond girls, plus Rowan Atkinson and a really great Edward Fox, who really look refreshing in the "M" role. In fact, the whole movie is refreshing and gives new impetus. Sean Connery does it again with confidence and charm, except that he looks a little too old. But well, he is the original Bond and it was great to see him again in this role. The sites are also typical - Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that really fails is the music score, the song "Never say never again" is OKK, but the theme song is just missing. All in all, a beautiful try to make a difference to the comic and stupid Roger Moore movies like "Moonraker". Just if there was another story, "Thunderball" was an excellent movie and didn't really need a remake
