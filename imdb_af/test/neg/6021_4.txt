"Clubbed" is another "will-do"? Entry into the Brit Fisticuffs genre and is sure to keep punters who don't expect to entertain too much for ninety minutes after a few beers. But for anyone looking for intelligent, quality entertainment, it's really best avoided. <br /> <br /> There are so many misnomer in the scary script that even an actor of Colin Salmon's caliber remains. The action was set in the eighties, but it is never clear why, especially if they could not take the convincing feeling for that decade - it took more than a few 80 soul records on the soundtrack, the occasional sucker and a handful of 30-year-old cars. Then we see central characters studying texts like Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" and talking about how violence should be a last resort, while the same characters are just too willing to start rolling out all the testosterone-fired, unthinking desolation of a bunch of chavs fighting over a bag of chips. <br /> <br /> Character development does not exist in "Clubbed". Also not irony, subtlety or pathos. This is a film featuring good memories of Guy Richie's early gangster movies, which, despite their mistakes, certainly had far more white, better editing, snapper dialogue and more emotional punch than this slack saga. They're a decade now, anyway - isn't it time we continued to try to follow them?
