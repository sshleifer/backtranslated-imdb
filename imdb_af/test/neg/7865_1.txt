* The ELITE sniper team, who added 24h or so earlier, decided to take a cover behind a huge rock in one of the first scenes instead of intervening and making themselves invisible. * If the hero "runs" to save his wife, he actually jumps. * When inside a building and with the aim of a target only 20-30 meters away the hero uses his scope. In addition to the fact that most non-elite soldiers have hit the lap of the hip and still, there is also the fact that the range may not be as close as possible. * There is a satellite that can actually look horizontal in buildings. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest heap of shit I've ever put in my DVD player.
