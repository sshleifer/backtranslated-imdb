The Bone Collector is in New York City and started as one of the world's leading criminologist and crime scene experts. Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident that leaves him a restrained quadriplegic. Jump forward four years and Alan (Gary Swanson) and his wife, Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped. Shortly after police officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), New York's policeman, was brought to a crime scene, he found Alan's buried and mutilated body. Amelia looks at some unusual crime scene evidence and makes a note of it that impresses Rhyme when asked to work on the case. He soon realized the evidence was cryptic clues to Lindsay's whereabouts. After breaking the clues, the police came to leave her to save her, but it was only the beginning as a sadistic serial killer was still killing and leaving forensic clues for Rhyme and police ... <br /> <br / > Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night and I have to say this is one of the worst big budget posts The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Se7en (1995) serial killers I saw make it on Friday 13th (1980) looks sophisticated and realistic! Jeremy Iacone's writing is based on the book by Jeffery Deaver and is so poor on so many levels that I almost know where to start. For a start, it takes itself deadly serious and it makes all the other mistakes twice as bad. The character is really awful and I didn't believe any of them were real people. First, we have Lincoln Rhyme that is paralyzed from the neck and there is not much that can do with him. He can literally do nothing, but lie in bed for the whole movie. He is apparently impressed with Amelia because she stopped a train and thought a new footprint near a murdered person might be of interest. I'm not funny here, but wouldn't a policeman realize that a footprint near a murder victim might be important. ? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there is Capatin Cheney who is not only unlikely and screams for everyone for no apparent reason, but is so incompetent that he has failed to commit several murders committed in a short time, where every victim has parts of meat and skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this man become a police captain? Then there is the murderer whose motives are less than likely, are you trying to tell me they have planned a complicated plan to kill at least seven people because they were six years in prison for something they actually did? If they wanted revenge on Rhyme, why did they kill all the other people who had nothing and maybe I could just buy someone who wanted to take revenge against the man who drove them away but didn't kill other people who were not related to themselves did not, the intended target Rhyme anything else. Even after you have developed a complicated plan to kill and get rid of these people, they suddenly become the most stupid people in history, as if they were holding a big knife and could walk and use their arms, were they actually defeated and almost killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement under his neck in his body! How did it happen? I must also mention Amelia who is a terrible character. She actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photos and shoots for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Except for the worst written character, the story and plot are ever. is not much better We never find out why the killer uses the Bone Collector book as inspiration. We never find out why the killer took meat from his victims. It has never been explained why a newcomer such as Amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes within the real forensic teams. There is no reason why the killer chooses his victims. Also, the murderers clues are a bit obscure, isn't it? I mean a bloody animal leg and shaved rock scar? Logically how does one go from a bone and rat to the exact location of the next victim and have to choose the whole of New York? There is a little nonsense about a bird sitting on Rhymes window list that is just random. Nearly two hours the Bone Collector is very slow. There is so much wrong with The Bone Collector and it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's horrible at all levels and has no credibility. Apparently, Angelina Jolie said she had shot nudges for this movie, but they were cut because they felt too distracting. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 48,000,000 The Bone Collector is well-crafted with good production. values ​​and that Hollywood shines about it. I also have to add that I think Angelina Jolie is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I think she's absolutely horrible in this. Denzel Washington just kind of lies there is really, Queen Latifah is terrible and even Michael Rooker can't do much, because he's stuck with a clichéd and a dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The Bone Collector must be one of the worst Hollywood movies I've seen for a while, I saw Telly for free last night and I still feel cheated and ripped off. There are just so many things to make, it's stupid, embarrassingly horrible or should it be terribly embarrassing? Work either to be honest ...
