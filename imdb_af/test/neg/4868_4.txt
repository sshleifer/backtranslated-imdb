My Tasks: Routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. <br /> <br /> A rare political excitement that made a very poor response to the box, I just caught the SHADOW CONSPIRACY on TV, and while I was glad I satisfied my curiosity about this rare to see movie, i didn't exactly feel this movie was all special. Considering the checkout response, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not all as bad as critics and the public responded, but it is not yet very good to start with and everything, from writing to direction, is pretty predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself having a deadly conspiracy among the White House staff with murderers and hunters (many of them). After a professor is killed, Sheen helps ex-flame reporter Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) help uncover the traitor and unlock the title. <br /> <br /> But this writing, written by Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs, is pedestrians as they come, not much different from other White House conspirators like in ABSOLUTE FORCE AND ABOVE IN 1600. A number of significant talents ( Donald Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang try their best on a routine script, but rarely save it from the predictability of writing. Not to mention a ridiculous scene that includes a toy helicopter, which in this "serious" political excitement is far too stupid and outrageous. The shadow awareness has its moments I am sure of, some of which are much appreciated. (Director George Pan Cosmatos serves some decent pursuit scenes), but not one that elevates this routine excitement, of which there is not much profit or surprise. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
