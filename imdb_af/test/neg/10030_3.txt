The prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June 1984, you might have caught it on the movie channel in the summer of 85, but little else is remembered. The plot is again your basic killer in the forest. But ironically, it was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week on a few row ins (yes Jim, driving in Namans in June of 84). But it has a dated look to it. Maybe they later released it to pay in cash on all the other terrorist films over which the market was flooded in 1984. On the story it has a kind of back story, a forest fire in the 1940s burned many cigars to boredom. But one of their children survived (our monster) so fast forward to this day, which would be 1978, we have an older middle-aged couple just to be sent through the monster. The tagline for this photo claims it's not human, and she got an AX, but an ax was only used in these first two murders. Now we have a lot of teenagers who look like they are in their middle 20's camp. We all know they are the Prey, and the monster knocks them one by one. For an 80 minute movie it looks longer. We also have lots of wildlife photos to fill in the gaps for the 80 minutes. Overall to get into an 80-year-old horror movie, it looks more like 70's than ever. Hey the Prey has the potential to be a good horror killer in the forest movie, but falls a little short. However, it did have a scary monster in the end and we have to wait until the last 2 minutes to see him. His note, the monster started dying in the Addams family flies in the 1990s.
