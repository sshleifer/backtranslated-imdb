Okay, so I saw this movie at this year's Sundance, and I was very unobstructed. It took a good fifteen minute footage before there was an edit or dialogue that made any sense and it took another 30 minutes before the ham-fisted script was on its way to a working plot that was not " a close-up of Ryan Gosling's smile or confronted with moralization. However, after the first 45 minutes, the script blew in a watch, although it wasn't quite entertaining or thoughtful. The highlights include both Gosling's and Morse's acting, Gosling is an emerging star and Morse is a highly established character player with a good sense of diverse emotions. After the show I hit a few of my friends a little bit about the movie when David Morse walked right behind me. He looks like the best man in the world, but he's a solid 6'2 "and probably heavier than 50 pounds. I removed my foot from my mouth and quickly changed the subject.
