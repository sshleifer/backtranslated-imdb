Ghosts, don't be deceived, it's a stinker ... poorly filmed, poorly behaved and nothing ... nothing here for the film painting is still looking for a solid B movie from the 40's and 50's gold mines. classic. I gave it a try, based on the relatively high rating on IMDb. There is no accounting for taste, but I found nothing in this movie to recommend to other IMDb members. It is a classic example of a movie watch and feels like you've been out for a few minutes taking it to get the gratitude down. Having Alan Ladd on the DVD / tape is almost deceitful, he's less than two minutes on the camera and has almost no dialogue! It is not this weapon for people ... it is a classic in the loop of the studios that do not exchange any food. We are all looking for the greatest ... save your time at Gangs, Inc. / Paper Bullets ... this is mean!
