I was initially interested in this movie after reading a summary and seeing some striking screenshots, and the promise was there for a gripping horror movie of the Dario Argento style. Of course, I have to say that Argento's films were sometimes rather incoherent, and some felt like a handful of visually-impressive pieces that were loosely tied together with a vague junction. As Argento is credited as a writer, I have to say, I'm not really surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria, when examined, shows the same tendency towards rope along sometimes unrelated scenes purely for aesthetic impact. However, Suspiria also benefited from a distinctive main character and distinct antagonist, as well as scenes that ultimately contributed to the ultimate resolution. <br /> <br /> The Church, on the other hand, has nothing of these things. It has no main character, no protagonist at all; In addition, it has no real plot to speak of, and no crescendo, no climax, no denial and no decision. It's a totally hollow, incoherent work that looks as if Argento has sat down and thought hey, it would make an interesting scene visually. Let's do it! ' The movie is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Initially, it may be interesting, and Soavi's direction is excellent, I have to say. Soavi cannot be accused of the material, as it is made as urgent as possible. Such a good direction calls attention to the terrible shortcomings of writing, and there is absolutely no point in it. The attempt to make a central unifying plot is nothing more than plagiarism of Carpenter's film, Prince of Darkness. Events just happen because the writing they want, and reactions to the events are totally indescribable. The story has been irreparably damaged to a point, simply because there is no ability to suspend unbelief; it's too ridiculous. In addition, there are many factual errors that are so sharp that cause embarrassment. <br /> <br /> If it was more openly artistic and changed in another job, it might be cool or tense. If it fell into a real coherent story, it might have been poignant. But it wasn't one of these. The best it did was confusing and at times disturbing. Plots are introduced, but never followed. Characters are forgotten and changed randomly. No logic is ever applied to any situation. It might have been scary or interesting, but to elicit that kind of feeling, take more trouble from a screenwriter ... much more. <br /> <br /> All in all, the Church is not worth watching for anyone. but altogether enthusiasts of Italian horror who are more style than fabric. This is Argento's style at its worst, and this is a strong justification for the usual criticism.
