Wow. I felt I had to burn down after watching this one, but maybe there were other reasons I would imagine. I felt and abused after waking up, I meant to watch this movie. Hairy coffins, thick mustaches and good, hairy all describe this porn / horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can't call it "porn" in the 70's and 80's without the hair. <br /> <br /> As a horrible movie, it bites. But as a piece of exploitation / pornography from Italy's rich film history, it's definitely a place in my library. The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles. I wish it had the very poorly baptized English, I think it would have added to the sleepiness factor that already existed. The only white man in the movie is "Mark Shannon" - he is wearing the mustache, hairy cut piece of machismo, who really tries a show every time he "bumps to bat". It was at the end of an era where porn producers were making something artistic. Nothing like making the camera from a tropical background to a hairy man who has a doggie-style sex with a woman. I can't help but laugh. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies I pray that my future wife and children will never find.
