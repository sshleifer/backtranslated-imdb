This movie is like porn with all the good parts removed. It is like all the pornstars who have not fulfilled their obligations to fulfill this horrible, thin, useless piece of gargoyle abstinence. <br /> <br /> It's a useful movie if you're in the mood to torture a loved one (or no longer loved one). It is important that if you choose to use this movie as a torture method, put it in earplugs and put blindfolds to defend yourself. <br /> <br /> If I had a choice between this movie and the 700 club ... I would choose Girls Gone Wild. <br /> <br /> Overall, better if you drank. But just because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.
