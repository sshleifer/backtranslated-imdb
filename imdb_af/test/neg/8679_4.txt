This movie with fine production values ​​contains secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very well-run, dull light, depressing century of the century over a friendship between a deadly sick man and a melancholy, guilty junkie. Talkie dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying is thin. Recommended if you like independent, smart intellectual, slow-speed Merchant Ivory type features. <br /> <br /> I suspect the main characters were in love, but their connection was so testified, it didn't really have the emotional impact of 'Brokeback Mountain'. It contains some good writing with a scene that discusses how to disappear in life, but it is really a dark and depressing movie.
