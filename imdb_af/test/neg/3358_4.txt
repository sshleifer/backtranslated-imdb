Below the average blaxpoitation action / melodrama in which the beautiful me. Grier plays a private eye coming to the aid of her father (Rudy Challenger) and his partner (Austin Stoker of the original "Attack on Precinct 13"), whose loan business is under threat. <br /> <br /> I'll be honest - I agree with some other user comments for this movie. "Sheba, Baby" has a less satisfactory writing, direction that is not particularly distinguished, action scenes that are best entertained properly, and one of me. Grier's more indescribable supporting roles (although there is an important supporting role for D'Urville, Martin, also known as blaxpoitation). I get the feeling that this routine movie might soon be put together to offer cash at her then great popularity. <br /> <br /> It was definitely again to see Stoker, although Mrs. Grier is not that good. a role - or dialogue - as she did in other films, although she is doing what she does best, and it plays a sassy, ​​sexy sister on a mission of revenge. <br /> <br /> Non-stop soul / funk soundtrack is at least enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Mostly recommended for those who want to see everything in the Pam Grier movie repertoire. <br /> <br /> 4/10
