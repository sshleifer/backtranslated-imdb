A little light horror movie; If it's not for some sex scenes, it can easily be a TV movie. Plotgate is abundant (one example: why would there be a secret portion of the 18th century that burns from the top floor of a house burned to the ground and a new building that took place 200 years later?) , characters do things that someone with an IQ that is greater than their shoe size would not. <br /> <br /> It has some fun moments, but overall it's a sub-movie that managed to get Roy Scheider because his accounts were followed. If you are looking for a very formal, predictable movie that might give a few laughs, it might be worth watching. If not, then this one is not for you.
