With the horrible play, the terrible dialogue, the multitude of bad humor, the crazy plot and the horrible movie. It must be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I'm the king of finding bad movies. For the effects, they just threw false blood on people and things, didn't spend time creating wounds and earning special effects. Most people who make low budget horror flicks do at least something like cloth or something to make a wound. The dialogue was far from even decent and the acting was without direction or effort. They just threw a few actors on a set and said, have it. I swear I saw better movies of my movie in class at school. How did it ever get a DVD edition?
