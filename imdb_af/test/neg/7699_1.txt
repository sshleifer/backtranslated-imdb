This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. It didn't explain a single clich√© that one could think of Hollywood-so-called Thriller. The protagonist is a loving father and a private investigator who is doing a special job: to determine if a suspected snuff movie is really. <br /> <br /> Surely he gets involved in deeper and deeper, greasy pornshops (managed by mexicans) and sex theaters are his field of investigation if he is looking for the murderers of the woman in the snuff movie. He is assisted by a "smart" (he reads a book) sex shop employee. He is doing a murderous bondage film producer and his personal perverts responsible for the movie ... ... and what do you expect? They are portrayed as the simple evil, not necessary for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the bad, and he is the purifier. Boom. Killer of the killers. End of the movie. Is it so bad? Yes, I'm so scared. <br /> <br /> Ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert that did the murder) even shows its ridiculous character: In the last scene, our hero forces "machine" to hide his mask (you're using of course one) and admit that "machine" looks like the normal 08/15 man from the street. Then "machine" says: "Blablabla I'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, I have a nice childhood, I just like to do what I do!" <br /> <br /> I just love to kill people. Yes, sure, "everyone loves people to kill people" (Bender). It's not just the total lack of character that made this movie so boring. It's also ugly that I have to kill these people. It makes you sick. In one scene our hero tied one of the killers and tried to shoot him ... but he couldn't. So what does he do? He called the mother of the murdered woman, said her child was dead and asked her if she loved her child so much that she wanted to see the killers dead. The mother is crying, she wants to love her child, he goes back to the tied murderer and hits him. <br /> <br /> To get to the point: This movie blows the dirty air of lynchmob supporters (surely the police don't play a role in it), moralizing in a ridiculous form against pornography, it doesn't take characters seriously Don't waste your time with a stupid plot. Probably, the only good thing about this movie is that it doesn't try pseudo-psycho-analysis ... even that will be too much plot. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with it. /> <br />
