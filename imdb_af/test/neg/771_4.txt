Someone else calls this movie a "fable-horror" movie, and I think it's pretty good. This is at least the concept. A group of teenagers, each with their own fish, get a look at a twisted sideshow barker. He decides to teach the teens a lesson by making them part of the freak show. A cool idea, but could be done better. Of course, the fate of some of the teenagers was also scrapped in your face, while other characters could be dropped. The end was also a serious deviation. No solution or big turn or anything. <br /> <br /> But as a low budget horror movie, it's pretty fun to watch. If you're in a cheesy ghost party, you should have a laugh to watch this one. However, I think one of his faults is ... taking it too seriously. It's a silly movie, and if it was a little more self-conscious, I think it would have been better. But at least there are plenty of neat carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to make you look.
