One of Bolls better efforts. Just show that if you do something long enough, you just have to improve. It's still not good, but it is at least daring which is an improvement on the blood. The biggest difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry is that Farcry's story was not the point of the game, while Bloodrayne had a strong story and so Boll had a better chance of solving it. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is actually pretty good. Sometimes a touch is exaggerated but in a good way and just worth a watch. <br /> <br /> It was handy, it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good, but you can't say they take it seriously due to comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood that gives it to the film actually helps. <br /> <br /> While thinking a little closer to the story of the game, it made for a slightly better movie, the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game, scarcely Oscar was just a FPS carnage vehicle. Would like to have it in the jungle as it was a nice integral part of the game, but Canada doesn't have much of the jungle and at least it's in a kind of rain forest. <br /> <br /> Why Boll feels the need to change professionally written and targeted game racks that I don't know, but he does. And until he starts to make the source material speak through his adaptations, it will always be missing. Watch the movie for a laugh, it's good for it and maybe to watch a party as a drinking party.
