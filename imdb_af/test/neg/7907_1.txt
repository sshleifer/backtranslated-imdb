Frankly, I didn't think there was anything humorous about this movie. It was really lame and poorly done without any plot. Surprisingly, it got me at the Malcolm X terminal, and it was about it. Serious Soul Plane even made the worst movies like Gigli look like an Emmy winner. This movie is really not worth seeing, unless of course you were blind like Johnny Witherspoon who played the blind man in the movie (another sad character). I hung the majority of the stereotypical jokes and ruined Tom Arnold and D. Hughley by throwing them into this movie. This movie can be summarized in only one sentence. Nashawn wins $ 100 million and creates his own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, I called sex? If I could, I would rate this movie in the negative numbers, but the beginning was amusing that brought this movie to 1/10. Do the "t bag" pfft!
