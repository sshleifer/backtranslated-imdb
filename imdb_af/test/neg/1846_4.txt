Whoever wrote the script for this movie never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I have never seen so many bugs in a biopsy, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I can write a whole list of factual errors, but it will continue for pages. In my whole, I believe Lucille Ball is one of the careless people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be annoyed by how many mistakes were made in this movie. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie looked very sloppy to me.
