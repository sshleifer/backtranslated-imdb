This movie is widely reputed as a copy of the Will Smith feature Hitch. This movie was boring. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as dull as unbearable. Govinda looks completely over his head. He doesn't do his best roles like this. It is also unconvincing as its performance in Deewana Mastana. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is "best" on his eye. And it's in the few scenes he remembers wearing. It can only have been through nepotism that this eye paints scenes can be saved from the trash of any movie's cutting floor. <br /> <br /> Another Bollywood case ashamed of its scandalous cloning. Another case of Bollywood heard majority embarrass themselves by making it a hit.
