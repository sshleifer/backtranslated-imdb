The problem with this kind of lyrical movie is that you also make a masterpiece or a lemon: there is a small middle ground. To put it softly, it's not a "Berlin city symphony" or "Man with a movie camera." Unfortunately, it's not much to look at. <br /> <br /> The problem with this one is that it is slippery and half-baked, as if Michael Moore had boarded. It doesn't really have to say anything, or rather to show us pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propagate a thesis. It's just a patchwork looking for a point. (Though unaware, the movie tells us more about the idea of ​​Uncle Sam than it envisages. There is something deeply paradoxical about an anti-technology, anti-civilization, anti-media film so deep in technology. Do as I say, and not like me. "You just love the Yanks.) Tonally there is something sour and misanthropic about this episode. Both previous episodes had moments of lyric and excitement; this time they are Shows consistent gloss, it simply doesn't work over this time, as Gustav Mahler will tell you. <br /> <br /> Stylish, Naqoyqatsi is a mess, the wizzy digital stuff is particularly misleading, giving it the whole thing very difficult, over-processed look, and it also undermines the "realistic" nature of the analog "found material." (I mean, I'm sorry for the guys. Part of the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a tribute to the use of optical film was, but now, optical film is a historical artifact, must ll take the digital domain on board but i dont think they bring it down. The digital stuff often looks like video links from CNN or BBC World.) And with the "found footage", digital manipulation is often ugly and usually just silly and the false color and solarization kept me in mind ... <br /> <br /> ... ahem ... <br /> <br /> James Bond title series. <br /> <br /> Ahem. Strangely as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the movie was simply stolen by Yo Yo Ma's performance; It's about as unobtrusive as a Lawrence Olivier voice over. The images must jolly be compelling to bump into all the charisma. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass himself is on strange form; He never expected him to beat the Verdi Requiem! (Let me laugh, which of course is not the desired answer to any part of this movie). There is even one piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe they changed his pills. <br /> <br /> From our idle questions department: is Geoffrey Reggio actually a Hopi Indian? Or did he just do a sweat lodge in Hollywood Hills? Oh, and are the different pieces of footage from previous episodes a comment on how these movies are also part of the global media?
