The depiction of this film seems to be that the passing of World War II generation in America, with its apple pie and hypocrisy, was a terrible tragedy. These horrible hippies apparently ruined everything. <br /> <br /> What the movie holds together is the excellent performances - especially Lemmon, which is truly remarkable. Otherwise, we have a boring slide drama (just over 24 hours of Jack's life) with pretensions. <br /> <br /> I got it going.
