But it is not. The plot is not that bad, the actors are not all terrible, so it must be decent. Instead, despite a good starting point, the plot just goes on and there is a lot of "I can't believe he / she is so stupid" moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going to keep. It frustrated me when I sometimes looked at the main character's decision. It also took too long to get the good part of the movie. Expectation is great, but you can't build up more than half of the movie. A shame also because it had proper exposure on release and hit right before the big Halloween season. However, I have a feeling that it will get at least one successor, if not more so maybe they will build on the strong general plot to eventually release something decent.
