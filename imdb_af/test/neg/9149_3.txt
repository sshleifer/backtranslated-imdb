Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's gorgeous smile and sultry looks at the movie, but unfortunately it's the only two values ​​to watch this movie. When in theory we have to look for the narrative. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin on the ground, and hard to believe. Just as beautiful as Jessica Alba, she doesn't add the spark she injected into the credible Dark Angel series. Since Dark Angel, it seems that Alba has been reduced to naked biscuit (but what eye candy!), And is the only reason to put her in movies. <br /> <br /> The concept of the sleep dictionary is foolish and unquestionable, with little character development (or character for that matter) to make us the 109 minute long time with this world. Despite the movie's short running time, it still manages to run too long and too hard. <br /> <br /> It seems a pity that such talents as Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer, Bob Hoskins are wasted on a thin story that hardly increases a wrist. This film misses a trick, an exotic setting, a more than capable role, with beautiful cinematography, and a chance to use the themes and dualistic concepts of 'civilization'. But there is little telling to talk about, no drama, no sense, we look at a story of love, more a story of lust and wife, happy to please men without a doubt. Let us be honest, if Jessica Alba allows you to sleep with her freely, do you seriously think that you can concentrate on learning a tribal language? Therein lies the great problem, both in the suspension of unbelief, and also in which the female characters are limited and reduced. Take, for example, the fact that Jessica alba's character undergoes the spiritual and physical oppression of pregnancy and is born to her forbidden love, but all we see is a beautiful and crooked one for her, then beautiful and crooked, with a baby, the next. <br /> <br /> It is a pity to see a movie with a promise that offers nothing to the potential. I could write about the mistakes of the movies endlessly, but it hurts me to do so. The movie looks good, the point of departure could be made in a beautiful movie, but unfortunately it was not.
