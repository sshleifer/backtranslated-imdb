Computer. Could there be something more boring? Tap on a few keys in front of a computer all day every day every day, tap tap. It's a lot of the problem with this movie, the heroine is sitting in front of a computer VDU typing the keys and no matter how much agitation she gives, or how much stress the composer attacks or how many extreme close-ups the director doesn't use much excitement at the fact that there are few things less exciting than looking at someone on a computer <br /> <br /> There are a few other problems too many of their factual errors about how computers work. Is it possible to turn on a computer that is both off and not connected to the Internet? I think that when the NET was created 10 years ago, very few people would understand how computers worked, the authors would be able to have BS at length, but since we now live in a global town where almost every Western world households own computer the audience is definitely very clear on the factual errors of this movie. And of course, there are too many cases where someone at critical times acts stupid or foolish to make the plot progress, making the NET a very mediocre movie.
