My bad movie guru (and the president of the Exposed Film Society) played this one on us last week. There was no denial of the demented glare in his eye, as he pulled it out of his brown paper bag and announced what he had chosen for us: "The Dangerous Game". It was filmed on a budget of about $ 2.95. <br /> <br /> Of course, $ 2.95 went much more back in 1962, but still ... <br /> Anyway, there's certainly plenty to keep from this movie . It's plentiful with serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the "repetitive musket" that fired twice in two minutes without the benefit of a recharge). The hero is a wuss who stands while his wounded friend fights and is killed. <br /> <br /> More? OK-The plot is a shambles with no continuity to speak of. The movie wastes five minutes with a 'special guest star' that serves as the physical embodiment of the villain's madness and paranoia, but never shows him again. The hero is unknowingly choked by the court but does not mention it when he wakes up and first meets his host. The mute servant girl is trapped, sitting on the rack ... and then the movie (and the hero who put her in this trouble) is just "forgetting" about her. <br /> <br /> More? Well, the sets are cheap, and the special effects are cheaper (the makeup is an exception to this). Much of the plot is borne by the narrator's drone, monotonic voice ear, which has less dramatic impact than the Denny's menu. Most of the dialogue is simply ridiculous and stilted, as if translated from Japanese. ("I demand that our conversations be enjoyable!") And the color values ​​became popular with shot after shot, as if cheap movie stock and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day. (Note - this last may have been a bad print, rather than a camera crew). <br /> <br /> But there were some nice moments here and there. The makeup effects were incredibly good as opposed to the rest of the movie, the actors were interesting, especially the dumb servant and the Countess. And in spite of everything, there was a definite, scary atmosphere that could be found very unpleasant and disturbing. <br /> <br /> So, what was the deal with this movie? I thought a little about it and realized that director / writer, Pat Boyette, was basically trying to make a story of the old "horror" horror cartoons on film. It would account for the stationary dialogue, the sketchy character development (in a comic, physiognomy = character, even more than in film), the intriguing logic of the story ("EG" horror stories have cleared out a nasty "shock" "ending up and not big on psychological realism", the over-confidence in the narrative voice (appearing in subtitles over the panels), and the interesting makeup effects that the Greek photos that the old EC artists did so well looked like. <br /> In fact, I would be willing to bet that when Boyette saw his leading man during the decisive, he immediately saw that the man was so close to being the equivalent of the lazy, soccer figures and in to keep the faces drawn by artists such as Johnny Craig and Jack Davis as a real person and still exist in the real world. He used costumes and lighting to accentuate the cartoon aspect of the visuals and change everyone into live EC cartoon characters. (See: the empty lady's white beauty, the Count's strong bony characteristics, strange bronze skin and sharp chin, the platinum 'do on the long, chunky black henchman, etc.) 's explanation failures. Boyette knew how to frame things, but he didn't know how to do with three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette knew how to tell a creepy story within the boundaries of a comic book, but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him. Of course he wouldn't be the first person with this problem - look at what Joel Schumacher did for Batman. But he didn't have a big budget to hide. <br /> <br /> In any case, I think that Boyette wrecked away from this train and probably spent less time on "Dungeon of Harrow" than the people posting on this movie's message boards. He did what he wanted to do within certain vague limits, and you have to respect him ... even if you don't care for "Harrow".
