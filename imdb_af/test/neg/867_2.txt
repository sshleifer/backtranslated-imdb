Mom starts at night in the middle of nowhere, looking at what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A truck pulls up and a dreadful father cuts out his gruesome daughter, Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian), and leaves her there, but she's not alone, because the shadow figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) looks at her. a short distance away. Virginia tries to talk, but if she squeezes a cigarette under her leopard print, the high-heeled shoes, Nestor, are grabbing her throat and dragging her into the darkness. Nestor then rips her up, turns into a monster and starts eating her inside. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer who has Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) and the LAPD, or it is the message that a local TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) tells his viewers. Clay lives happily with his pregnant girl Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) and therefore his mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a spare room that she decides to rent out to the "blind" dark sunglasses Nestor wears. Unfortunately for Emily she accidentally knocks Nestor's sunglasses from which he revealed he has strange colored eyes. Nestor then becomes a monster and confesses to Emily to change her into a carnivorous monster, just like him. Nestor takes Emily out to train her, finds a suitable homeless bum (Rory VanSaint), kills him and eats his gut, but Emily's son Clay has seen the whole thing and he has to choose between what is right and his love for his Mother who just happens to be a large-scale monster! And you did it. <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a nice, horrible movie. If you look at the other comments on the IMDb and the genre list it gave, it looks like Mum looks like a comedy horror. Well, I can tell you now that I have not seen any comic elements in Mom, because there is none unless they are very subtle. The only thing I can assume is that people see comedy in the real situation that mom is offering, it's an old lady who becomes a carnivorous monster and the predictable problems and emotional anxiety it causes her son to find out. There are no jokes (except the name of a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens)), slapstick humor or anything that is at stake even in the film itself, and as far as I can see, it is completely played in the 90's minutes. So, if there is no comedy in Mum, does that mean that there is a lot of horror? Wrong, Mum sucks and is painfully slow to watch, especially after the first thirty minutes of Nestor turning a few times in a monster, biting Emily and showing how to hunt for food and clay. So far, Mamma has moved at a fairly decent pace, I had some special makeup effects and interested me. Unfortunately, Mum runs another hour, which is actually the emotional shit Emily's son suffered, the eventual collapse of his marriage and torn between love for his mother and the fact that she is a carnivorous monster. This part of the movie is incredibly slow, boring and so boring as dish water, even the nerve to go to a click-roll reversal scenario where Clay tells his mom to go to her room and stays there behind her shut up and tell her and sit over her window so she can't escape her room. Mom's script ignores the origins of the monsters and asks us to assume that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should make no matter how stupid an explanation would have been. I think a background for the monster would have helped. Technically Mum is vague and cheap, although I can't say it's bad, it's very average stuff with nothing at all that impresses or something that I can enjoy time with. The special makeup effect on the sample is OK, but they are used in very fast flashes, shiny and you will miss them. Don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like I was, the monster is only three times in the maximum and everyone is within the first 30 minutes. There is not much gore, a cut arm, a little intestine that eats, a burned body and a drill in someone's arm is all we get. The acting is OK, but please Mr. Brion James, how about the deadly accent! At least James had the good mind to know he was in the shit and was sensibly chosen to kill early in the proceedings. Everyone is nobodies expecting the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night (1985). recognizes him from Die Hard 2 (1990), did he make Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall, there is nothing I can really recommend to me as a horror movie and it certainly is not a comedy that I am. Very poor, very disappointing, and yet I am captivated by fine video boxing artwork with many stills of cool looking monsters. Definitely one to avoid.
