This film is trying to haunt the studio era in Hollywood and the 1950s. Guy Stone is meant to be a Rock Hudson type, but both author and actor Matt Letscher make a smarmy, cruel, baritone-spoken version of George Hamilton instead, which causes an unpleasant character. <br /> <br /> Guy Stone is such a reprehensible person that the audience is having trouble wasting human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was so ridiculous, Stone is a hateful person who consciously uses and throws the dear, attractive young men who share his bed every few hours. <br /> <br /> Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone's Celibate Lesbian driver. Cartwright is very good, but the director doesn't quite know what to do with her. The mistake lies in the dialogue, which is a bit clumsy, and the movie suffers. <br /> <br /> Carrie Preston's Sally owes more to Ellen Greene in "The Little Shop of Horrors". As written, Preston's Sally is good for a laugh, but little else. Newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this movie. He can't act and seems to have been cast for his warm body and good body. <br /> <br /> Like many recent films, Straight-Jacket is a "drama" - a comedy film that badly turns a drama over two-thirds of the way through the movie. And like almost all the dramas, Straight-Jacket fails. <br /> <br /> Despite the expensive services of Skywalker Sound, the sound quality of the movie leaves much to be desired. The excessive use of the musical soundtrack also creates a distracting number of directions. <br /> <br /> The movie really failed to satirize anything in the 1950s. Unlike 'Singin' in the Rain, which perfectly captures Hollywood's ambivalence about the advent of sound as well as the studio movie mentality on formula films, 'Straight-Jacket' cannot portray Hollywood at all in the 1950s. The key characters' dialogue, sets and behavior are non-written rather than death-on-stereotypes of the 1950s Hollywood. The same can be said for the eclipse of the general mores, social trends and fads of the 1950s as a whole. Compare the transformation of Guy's house with the dead-on-satire of the 1950's house in the "Horror Store". There is no comparison; "Small shop" hits the nail on the head, while "Straight-Jacket" doesn't even know there is a nail. <br /> <br /> Motivations also seem random. Rick Foster is a principally liberal, but he almost immediately falls for a materialistic schmuck like Guy Stone. Rick is very good with Guy's closed status for many months. But when it comes time to go to Italy, he is confronted for reasons that are completely unclear. And even though Sally seems to fall in love with Freddie during the party, this plot point just disappears a few minutes later without comment. Rick came out like a gay man from the 1990s, not a gay writer of the 1950s. Indeed, modern morality fills this movie - which it may not be, if it were truly a satirical look at homophobia in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Plot holes in this ragtag film are also abundant. Saul repeatedly says he will switch Freddie Stevens to the old, but never do, so Freddie can come out of Guy. Jerry and Saul's plot to 'make' Guy, never makes sense, and Sally's sudden decision also doesn't blame. And while Guy admits he's a homosexual, it doesn't matter and he ends up in anyway a famous star and playwright. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the production values ​​cannot save this film. The cinematography by Michael Pinkey is pedestrian. Sometimes the movie looks like a filmed play rather than a movie (especially the screens in Saul's office). Everything is limited to medium shots, and the movie is incredibly static. The editing by Chris Conlee also doesn't do the movie. Long scenes that would benefit from the insertion of close-ups or shifts in the point of view remain uncertain. Whether it's due to lack of coverage or bad editing is not clear, but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy. <br /> <br /> The movie relies on Guy's CGI effects created by visual effect designer Thomas Dickens. But the CGI looks clumsy and hokey, and it's very remarkably amateurish. <br /> <br /> My overall impression of this movie is that the jokes are cheap and easy, disturbing the plot, the variations volatile and far from the mark, the satire non-existent, the show bread and the point off. , and the comic timing. It's almost an amateur movie. It's like someone has taken a high school production and threw $ 10m into it.
