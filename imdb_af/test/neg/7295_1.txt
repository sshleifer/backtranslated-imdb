If you saw Atlantis 1, you know that what the movie really made was brilliant animation and good writing. This movie was so smooth and animated. The story is also dull. I was so disappointed in this half-baked roof that I couldn't do it the first hour, and MAN I tried! The one thing this film had was that it expanded the "mole" character, making it both more sympathetic and three-dimensional. Take it from me, judge this junk from the cover on the video box. The lid is poorly drawn Disney schlock, clearly grabbing for an easy goat of an unsuspecting parent. If it were a stand-alone movie, it wouldn't be that bad, but on the scenes of a brilliant piece like Atlantis, it runs completely inexcusably.
