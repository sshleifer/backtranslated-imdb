What had to be a dramatic story of life on the river. Murray seems to be a stupid, sweet romance about an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with Aussie accent) who falls for the larchin first (John Waters) of a mushroom farmer. <br /> <br /> The first half of this four and a half hour mini-series shows a promise, but it quickly falls flat as predictable and thin. There were some real pain and spark in the plot to give the movie a little life. Gus Mercurio's early exit didn't help, as his character was the only interesting one for me. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the longer TV version is more in depth, because this video translation has certainly not missed it. <br /> <br /> Sunday June 27, 1993 - Video
