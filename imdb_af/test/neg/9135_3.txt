The first two movies of this series have featured their footage of the natural world and ordinary people sitting in the middle of society. This movie does not have any natural footage, which I understand is part of the point, but it really does make the whole video component of the movie look like random images tied up - those flying around, computer models of human skeletons , et cetera. Sometimes the stock image material is well used (the nationalism / finance segment at around 35:00), but usually the video lacks meaningful content and requires you to accept the context of the stock photographers rather than the context of the director. It is no better than the video displayed on a karaoke machine. Three stars added for the Philip Glass soundtrack.
