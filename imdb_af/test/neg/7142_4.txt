Hey! The grudge 2! What's up, man? I have a friend I want you to meet. The grudge 2 meets Johnny's worst of 2006 list. Johnny's Worst of 2006 list meets The Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? I was under the impression that it was a successor to The Grudge, rather than a remake. If so, why does it do nothing but the original repetition? This floater doesn't even feel like a movie. It's just a 90-minute soundtrack to the strange chat clerk who makes that annoying curly sound. <br /> <br /> An audio I recommend to you doesn't get me going. It was kind of creepy the first time I heard it, but I heard about 12,367 times since 2004, so it's running pretty well. And it's made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought it would be funny to simulate the sound when there was a quiet spot in the movie. Sigh. <br /> <br /> People, YOU ARE NOT FUNNIE YOU SHOULD NEVER SET UP! I promise you, every time a character walks through an empty room slowly (that's about 97% of the movie), someone in the audience will start it, "Uhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhkkkkkk." Yes, I know this is a terrible way to repeat the sound with letters, but you get the core. So then some parents in the audience will giggle, and not be over, deliver their own version. I was very close to just walking through the audience and bumping random people. <br /> <br /> I told you not to start me. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely nothing about The Grudge 2 I can't recommend. There is no single original scare or idea in the whole movie. There is not one memorable acting performance. Are you a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan? Cub, enjoy her two-minute screen time and one line of dialogue. Are you an Amber Tamblyn fan? I hope you can handle the fact that she has nothing more to do than walk around to see if she is suffering from a pinched nerve. Can you believe the story (if you can call it) is even worse than the resentment? <br /> <br /> At least the original was pretty scanty and boasted some effective bounces. I didn't jump once during this clumsy (yes, I made up the word, handled it). That's right. Not a single time. The "scares" are so manufactured and they are so blatantly engraved that there is absolutely no shock value once the "gotcha" has arrived. Watching this movie is like playing a good chess game - you're always four or five scenes in front of it. <br /> <br /> There are also some strange scenes thrown by it, which makes no sense at all. One that immediately comes to heart is a scene where a girl drinks a liter of milk and then begins to revive it again in the jar. Huh? I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot of it in the movie. Laugh. Sighing. Head shaking. Sleeping (I did twice). <br /> <br /> The movie even makes a 1/5-hearted attempt to turn a plot. Wow. It's so bad that I don't think we should even make it worthy of it by calling it a breeze. Did they really think someone would be surprised at the revelation of who's hiding under the hoodie? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John came out of the closet. <br /> <br /> And of course, the end of the whole non-closing is going to "look, we can have another sequel". Once the credits rolled, the audience boasted. My sentiments exactly. If the audience paid money for this killer, it would probably have been the most, and I would have liked the charge. <br /> <br /> We learned from The Grudge that there is a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful anger of anger, a curse is left behind. Like a Ben Affleck movie, it is a "spot" that is always a part of the place where death occurred. Well, in The Grudge 2, we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend, the successor will be poured out, and more often than not, it will leave a spot on a theater where the film shows . <br /> <br /> THE HISTORY <br /> <br /> If you are a total wimp and have never seen the grudge, it may offer some cheap scares. But I strongly recommend saving your money, otherwise there is a good chance you will be the one who runs out of the theater with a grudge.
