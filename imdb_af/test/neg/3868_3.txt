The seven collaborations between director Joseph "von" Sternberg and star Marlene Dietrich were so different in look and tone, and so different from anything else that took place at that time, they almost seem like a subgenre of their own. Like any genre, they have their own masterpieces, as well as their absolute turkeys. Time to send Blonde Venus back to the farm. <br /> <br /> After the boring seductive hits The Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, in which Miss. Dietrich established her screen shot as a cabaret singer prostitute, someone at Paramount decided it was time for Marlene to play a mother. There is nothing wrong with it in itself; As an actress, she was on the point. It's just that nothing else about the format has changed. It's like the blue angel plus a child. Sufficefully, the story of a woman dragging her child on her crazy escapes is a good condition for a tragic drama, but it's not the way it is played. Dietrich's journey is played as a kind of adventure, using her mind and accomplices to stay ahead of the law. This is not a terrible example of pre-code libertarianism? This is just bizarre unpleasant. <br /> <br /> While we may be able to accept Marlene, a mum's mum, there's absolutely no way to buy Sternberg as a director of warmth and poignancy. Despite being one of the handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit, Sternberg simply fails to get the story bow. The film's emotional payout is supposed to be the ultimate reunification of the family, but even in the beginning it's not worth something to come back to. Sternberg's interiors are usually dressed and shot to look like brothel or insane asylum. The house of Faradays is actually quite a creepy environment, and it's a wonder. Johnny did not water the bed and asked to sleep with the light. <br /> <br /> But if anyone who knows them knows, the point of a Dietrich / Sternberg photo is to make Dietrich fabulous, and at least Blonde Venus is a success in this regard. Marlene is launched from a bush pool in a shiny, glittering proximity, and even when she is reduced to sheets, the camera still loves her. The same cannot be said for the rest of the role Sternberg tended to regard as mobile landscapes. Normal-tempered Herbert Marshall is reduced to a cheerful grouch in the shadows. Even the pure and vibrant Cary Grant just becomes a boring background blob, and doesn't look as interesting enough for Dietrich to walk away. <br /> <br /> The only outstanding moments in Blonde Venus are Marlene's song and dance routines, especially the well-known Hot Voodoo number where she parodies her own surrealistic persona by developing a gorilla outfit. But even they feel that they have been cut from another movie. Sternberg's fans can take it as another masterpiece, as they usually do, but it is a great disappointment to the average punk. Audiences of the time did not attack it, as they had earlier hits, and it repeated the beginning of the end for Marlene's boom. A year later there would be a new queen at Paramount? Mae West.
