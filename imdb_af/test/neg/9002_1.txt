It's not that bad, it's good. It is so bad, it violates the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment by the Geneva Convention. Only by reading the Synopsis, you can even find out the "plot" of this Straight to Video disaster. It's a hodge-podge of grainy stock footage split along with some of the all-time worst you'll ever have to see the crash. Comparing this incompetent, fearless, humorous mess to "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" is like saying "Gigli" is like "Citizen Kane". The talented governor is bought in cheap, J.C. Penney "Goin to Church" clothes, and there is not the slightest attempt to make her hairstyles or make-up. If you really want to see how this kind of "tribute" works, look at "The Lost Skeleton or Cadavra". It's smart, well-written and best of all, performed by real actors who aren't so angry to watch. For that reason, the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson, whose Sci-Fi card "The Attack of the 70 Foot Courtesy Lady" leaves this film, is looking for it. The people in Terror In the Tropics look and sound like they were pulled off the street and given their scripts to read during the one and only take. It's an insult to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney, and anyone else involved in the movies they cannibalized to make this feast! Money is not the problem - Many can be reached with very little cost. A good script, decent actors and top-Z grade costumes and production design should have been before the so-called director created this stinky stack of film waste. Let us hope that the "promise" of a successor has not come true - it was by far the most frightening thing in the whole movie!
