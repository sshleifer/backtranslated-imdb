It looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, right? And a $ 42 million elevator sounds like a kick-ass crime movie. <br /> <br /> Big Disappointment - I think the stars have got all the money, because the production values ​​are in common. <br /> <br /> But more than that, the pseudo reservoir dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong. It's made for TV stuff. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's very disappointing - it points to what it is - but loses it massively because it's unstable, not very interesting.
