Bubbling just below the surface of Showtime is a good idea. Actually, it's more than two or three ideas that are constantly fighting for screens. This movie doesn't just have its cake and doesn't eat it either; It has the whole bakery. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) interrupted a drug chest by the media and a Brazilian, the shooter-shooting actor Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner shoots, he shoots the camera out of the hands of a harsh newcomer, and the tiff lands him in a new reality show program, produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many mistakes and peculiarities in the film, the injured partner is never heard from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> De Niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how TV police don't act like real police. Funny thing is, as the film progresses, his character and Murphy begin to grow more and more like the clique they clash with each other. In a smarter movie, De Niro's diatribe played as ironic comments; here it just shows how to pamper the movie. While a spoof of a reality-based policy show may be funny, team writers and director Tom Dey (who made the far superior Shanghai afternoon a few years ago, see the movie instead) be indifferent, and instead hitting the TV industry, they really let them out. (The hardest thing they seem to say about network exports is that they like to play table tennis). Russo's character has a shining terrific delight in her eye, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress's enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> With little on the screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and it is dangerous in a movie with these many plot holes. For example; If Showtime (the name given to the police show) is such a popular smash, does anyone seem to recognize the De Niro and Murphy when they are at work? For the case, if they are investigating smugglers and ubiquitous man Vargas on television, why did the heck not mention him to be on his route? Then again, if I gave this villain's action, I should not be surprised; is it the same joker who is very angry with an employee to use his new supergun without approval, endanger an agreement and then send him? Using about ten of the superguns to direct his entire home, of course! It's like sticking out a fire with a bigger fire. <br /> <br /> Sometimes Showtime is laughed at, but there's simply not enough for the movie's almost two hours of running. Worse still, the really smart gags suggest that this movie could really be something if they just submitted a few drafts concepts. Murphy cups and talk as fast as he can with minimal results, and De Niro looks flat bored by most of these. After a completely unnecessary fist fight between policemen and gang members (which remarkably leads to no injuries and no arrests), Russo's character calls 'It's fantastic television!' Maybe it's great television, but it's far from a good movie.
