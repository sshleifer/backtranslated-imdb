This movie is something terrible. I laughed all the time. I had to be forced into some scenes because my mother thought it was not a good thing to laugh when people die, but in this movie even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into a tornado. <br /> <br /> Blasts of cars thrown by wind forces on buildings look like those of the old school team game, called R-Type. Dialogue is very bad and I am interested in how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie. It's just wonderful how such a bad movie can make it into the TV. <br /> <br /> Just the right reason to watch this movie is having fun with nonsense and absurdity.
