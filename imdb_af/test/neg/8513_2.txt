In my opinion, this movie is not good. I hardly get a good thing to say about it, but I'd still like to explain, before I get to the conclusion, it's just another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I decided to see it because Costas Mandylor starred about it, and that was the main reason I watched it to the end. I like action movies, and I understand that such movies are built on the action rather than the story. I know they don't go into detail when it comes to the credibility of the story and the events, but even that doesn't explain why some scenes, just because they have reality awareness, look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the movie looks very promising: a tough, good looking specialist and its not so difficult but clever and funny partner should do a job that looks a little different than they expected . The story takes place on a ship. A disaster happens, the ship is reversed, and only a few are left alive. During their struggle to survive, they must escape a shark, a professional killer and the rising water. <br /> <br /> The movie is also very violent. The main weapon (alongside the disaster that has already drawn most passengers) is the gun that is used in many cases. I personally missed a good man to fight a man (or woman to wife if you prefer). Family Fun? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this movie was shot in a hurry, without a real vision trying to say it. Made from the usual action movie tricks, with a little something called love, and without a real meaning, it only leads to a bad movie.
