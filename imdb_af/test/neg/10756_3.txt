"Opposing Force [1986]" was not as good as "Dr Strangelove" and it was not as good as "The Bridge on the River Kwai". Heck, it wasn't even as good as 'GI Jane', which is very sad. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around a basic ethical problem: In a simulated prisoner-of-war situation, how far can you go before you break the law? What is the law in such a situation? How can you simulate someone's torture without actually torturing someone? Can you intentionally administer pain? How about breaking bones? Mock executions? Sexual abuse? Severe blood loss? Real guns with bullets? Death? Somewhere between this is a very fuzzy line that is "acceptable" to "horrific". <br /> <br /> Now what can you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality are disappearing? What can you do? This movie seeks to portray this dilemma. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in "resistance training". I have a brother who has gone through the USAF's POW training program. According to him, it was technically close to the point. <br /> <br /> The movie has a pretty good point of departure, but it doesn't have a very good story. I wondered if it could be based on a real event, but it became clear that it was not when the explosions started. They have changed three-quarters into the filmmakers because it takes a really extreme turn and turns into a somewhat senseless shooting-em-up with many distracting explosions. <br /> <br /> I found it to be a reasonably unsatisfactory end; Again, kind of useless. I'm still wondering what the point of the whole thing was - I started to suspect there was simply no one. It could have been much better with just a little more story to go with the fireworks.
