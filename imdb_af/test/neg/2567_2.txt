Dr. Steven Segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak. This movie strikes me as foolishly serious in the case of an unintended camp classic (the best kind). Memorable lines include: "Knowledge is like a deer. Chase it, and it will run away from you" and "Drink it. It will make you feel better." It's so badly bad - they couldn't have made it worse if they tried. <br /> <br /> Segal is trying to convince you that he is 1. sensitive - by saving a stricken pony; 2. A good father - through a saccharine cooking scene for his daughter; 3. a man of science - by looking at a false spectrum; 4. in accordance with nature - using homeopathic remedies; 5. Politically correct and multicultural - having Indian friends; 6. An iconoclast - opening a rural practice to a previous life in a national research laboratory; and 7. an action hero - by being really fat, yet it can still fight. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It is good to see as a late-night Saturday movie, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!).
