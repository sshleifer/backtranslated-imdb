Lon Chaney Jr returns to wood as the mummy Kharis is looking for his mate, Annanka whose soul now lives in the beautiful host of descendant Amina (Ramsay Ames). Andoheb, High Priest of Arkan (George Zucco) leaves Yousef Bey (John Carradine) in charge of Kharis to continue their bad ways. Tom (Robert Lowery) must find a way to save his beloved Amina from some future mummy terror. <br /> <br /> Routine, predictable entry in the Kharis series proves that almost every movie follows a specific format / formula. The city is threatened by a villainous, armed cork-masked corpse, apparently qualified with superhuman strength to choke off life from incompetent men who, with relative ease, are limited by a mere Kharis disease. Frank Reicher, who saw Kharis in action .. and knows a lot about Egyptian history. In the previous film (The Mummy's Tomb), proving that someone who has survived a previous mummy encounter will surely die when he returns to the next movie. Well-produced, but lacking originality that will exclude some of the other films in the series. Unfortunately, Carradine sleeps through his role as evil Yousef Bey. Terrifying scan carried Kharis, who is known to wear a crippled right arm, with an unconscious Amina with both arms for long distances without bad effects. One aspect, the shocking climax where Tom's attempt at heroism does not go according to plan, as Kharis keeps his girl in the accident, slightly raises the covert movie.
