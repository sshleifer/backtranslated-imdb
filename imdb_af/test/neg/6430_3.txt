First of all, this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it, because I did not understand this terrible story. Furthermore, the unknown cast, led by an actress, called Laura Mennell, is just awful. The expressions and screams of the character, Sara Tobias, are laughing and ridiculous, confusing grimace with acting. Last but not least, there are many favorable reviews on this movie in IMDb as follows: <br /> <br /> - Top Notch - Can't wait to see more of the directorships ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on September 24, 2004; <br /> <br /> - Incredibly shot, incredibly intense ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on August 12, 2004; <br /> <br /> - Not your typical blood and gore, actually better. 7/10 ?? the author has only 1 review in IMDb on February 13, 2005; <br /> <br /> - As intense as Asian horror !! - The author has only one review in IMDb on November 14, 2004. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are they the parents, family, friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11 A Nova Profecia" ("11.11 ?? The New Prophecy")
