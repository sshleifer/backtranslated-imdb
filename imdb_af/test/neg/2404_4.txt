Very curious that Nichols and Hanks will work for it, of course they believe it. Strange because it has to carry the title "Charlie Wilson's War the Lie". How can the timeframe leave the right history, while the CIA, while traveling from the Russians to Afghanistan, gave support to the Taliban, and today's World of Terrorism. In 1990, Bin Laden went home to Saudi Arabia as a hero of jihad, who, along with his Arab legion, forced the mighty Soviet Union superpower into Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> To prevent any connection with Osama Bin Laden being said again, Hollywood does not care about the historical truth. Charlie Wilson, a patriot, barely resembles a congressman who is amok.
