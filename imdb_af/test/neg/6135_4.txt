Army-private Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapezoidal aircraft, is set to fire brave stunts without a net and alienate his high-end cohorts; Meanwhile, there is an extensive camp show for Army soldiers and staff, and the entire M-G-M studio has come to join the fun. Mickey Rooney plays M.C. (indifferent), in which he acts as Kay Kyser and his orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter and the M-G-M Dancing Girls (which seem to be dressed as vegetables). Red Skelton does a nice little deal with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but the other comic pieces suffer from an apparent vacuum between the artists and the alleged live audience (they are terribly quiet until the editor cuts them for exaggerated shots) . Judy Garland sings an inappropriate song about a jumping camp in Carnegie Hall (unlikely to be accompanied by classic pianist Jos√© Iturbi, who calls Judy 'hep'). The production is shiny, but the manic energy feels fake, manufactured. ** of ****
