I can't believe I actually set up a season ticket on my TiVo, apparently they had a good preview or something. But I can't imagine it. After about 5 minutes I thought of myself. Why do I look at it. It's certainly not the reality, and some of the worst acting I've ever seen on television. I'm a total addict of reality TV and there's nothing really about it. THE ACTIVE. (If you can call it) is terrible. The only ones who are almost 5% are the girls who are meant to show viewers. Although they have to be much more fun to save this train wreck. If they had more lines, they would probably change my mind because they probably didn't have any talent either. This, of course, is a very low budget production with 'actors' that seem to be very cheap. There is no way to get a job in anything else. Someone should lead these people to a job in food service. Maybe they can do it. Ag and incidentally, Parco P.I. don't take up more space on my TiVo or TiVo's season ticket. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen.
