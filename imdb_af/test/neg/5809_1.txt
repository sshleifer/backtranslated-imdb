This movie is on a par with the "Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael" for the biggest pieces of garbage ever hit the silver screen. If these guys were not Adam Sandler's gay friends, this script would have landed where it should be: as a great movie excerpt's toilet paper. I hate this movie, it causes me to hurt people. I will admit that I have high standards, but honestly I would rather see Step Up 2. The ultra sad part was when I recorded on IMDb and read that you gave bits of trash actually this movie a 6.9 rating. This is proof of all the delays in our society that are looking at horrible movies that are just half an hour long, dick, fart and weed jokes with little or no originality. Having seen this review, I would like to suggest 'Tyler Perry's House of Pain' to all of you who enjoyed this movie; You will see high quality humor there at about the same level of this horrible horror.
