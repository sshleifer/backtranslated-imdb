As a massive fan of the three TV series, I was very interested to learn that LoG is moving on the big screen. However, in my more honest moments, I had doubts about the likely success of the concept, and whether the authors can sustain the high level of humor, comedy and horror that enters the original series. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my fears were not unfounded, and the movie was a great disappointment. I struggle to understand the other comments on this site. It is clear that people are entitled to their opinions, but the guys I watched agree with me, and they are just as big fans as me. <br /> <br /> The play had no conviction, but they are so good that even when they are not at their best, they are still very vigilant. The biggest problem was the plot - and the writing. There were a few laughs, but not enough, a few moments of disgust, but not enough. The worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after leaving the theater. So rarely did I feel so completely uninspired by a movie and so unmotivated to discuss it with others. <br /> <br /> I write this comment as a warning to other league fans - get a wide variety of opinions on this movie before going to see it. If you like League, you can convince yourself that they have not broken their move into the theater. If you can't convince it, then in your mind you will evaporate the otherwise spotless genius depicting the TV series. <br /> <br /> Go to the theater? More like log. (or small brown fish).
