The worst movie I've seen in years (and I've seen a lot of movies). Act is horrible, there is no plot whatsoever, there is no point whatsoever, I robbed after renting this movie. they advised me to think it out! a shame for horrible movies! Stay away from this terrible piece of c ** p. save your money!
