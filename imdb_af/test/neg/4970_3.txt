I saw the trailers of this movie and found the cinematography and what was interesting. I saw the IMDb rating and 6.8 confirmed it was an above average movie. So it went. <br /> <br /> The story is about Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) ?? a beautiful high school girl who is a subject of male sexual desire. Mandy's friend Emmet's (Michael Welch) provocation to another fellow student to show his love for Mandy leaves the fellow student drunk and jumps dead. Nine months past and Mandy invited for a summer week to a secluded farm by her teenage friends ?? three girls and three boys go there! There is a security guard Garth (Anson Mount) working at the farm. During the first night themselves do the murders take place? one by one, the members of the group are murdered. Who's behind the killings? I won't tell you here to spoil sports? Did I keep the movie? NO. After usually interesting opening ?? the movie takes a downward turn with each unfolding of the event. By half-time when the killer is revealed, one loses interest in the remaining proceedings. There is a last turn in the story to shock the viewers, but it has rather shaken me in disbelief and laughter! All this tension? Huh ??! Amber Heard acts and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl? Who is aware of her beauty and men's desire for her. The remaining throw is usually ?? nothing to say. There are so many movies made from teens boys and girls to a secluded place and slowly someone killing them one by one? that it doesn't interest me anymore. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Levine is trying to make the movie interesting by making use of contemporary teens conversations loaded with sexual overtones, but doesn't let the movie rise above the everyday scene. . <br /> <br /> The only and most enjoyable saving grace of the movie is his films by Darren Genet ?? that captures pictures of beautiful photos! (Stars 3 out of 10)
