I wrote it as a two-part review. Part two spoiled. <br /> <br /> Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, it's not one about sex with car accidents. This is the one on racism in L.A. You know, the one where everyone is racist, and race is at all times the subject of everyone's mind. White. <br /> <br /> It's like the movie is a form of tower syndrome where race is the constant theme. White. Racist. Racism. Race relationships. Relay race. <br /> <br /> Paul Haggis made a movie that took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to indicate the breakage of people who are tangentially connected and put it in a 1'53 "spiritual vomit racism in America RACE In the 24-hour period, we have 7 parallel stories about race and the first hour, people say ridiculous things and do absurd things in an attempt to really be racism in America . <br /> <br /> For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate offers the comic relief, badly, the first half of their story is straightened up from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction RACISM Their section is Quentin Tarantino section where, Instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism CONSTANTLY <br /> <br /> The other good thing about this is the Mexican story when the Mexican man talking to his daughter, giving her his invisible impenetrable cloak m to protect her bullets. Good writing, but that's just because the writers had daughters and knew what they would say in his place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the stories are extremely ridiculous. The Hindi does not act in any sense of realism. The scene where he tries to fix the lock and the Mexican tells him he needs a new door is shortened and stupid. Why would such a person act like this? Is it realistic? Nooo. This reminds me of the Doom Generation convenience store clerk. "Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents Girly." If I ever watch the second half of the movie, I hope his head is shot down and his bodily head begins to be cleared. <br /> <br /> I didn't mention race in more than one paragraph. RAS. Racism. RACE FOR THE SON. Better. Then there is the black man who wants to be white, Matt Dillon, who has a slide on his shoulder against blacks, Ryan Phillippe, who looks nice and does nothing, and several other bad actors who play badly with a bad dialogue. When Matt Dillon molestes the black producer's wife, can I help if I crack? When Philippe guesses the second time to write his partner for racism, can I help to crack? The movie is as funny as it is racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you. <br /> <br /> Now, you think this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, in addition to a nod to Matt Dillon who actually tried a decent job. Who is paying for it, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Do not see it unless you feel that you are preaching about racism in society by a bad and unrealistic writing by 2 white men in fifty who do not reveal reality or interaction with the right society shape or shape in any way. <br /> <br /> Part 2: <br /> <br /> The second half of Crash takes any and all story lines in the first half ... and spits They are back in some kind of redeeming, finally, the world is a great coincidence somehow. And this is actually one of the worst ways to do this. <br /> <br /> Take 1999's Magnolia. People were not easily tied up easily over and over again. They were only connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who did something you knew someone else was involved with. Crash takes this wrap into a serious extreme. <br /> <br /> The stories are set up to meet everyone again. Is there only 5 on the LAPD power? Do these people not work strange shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then the first day the next day? And why should Tate be the murdered hitchhiker? Had it no longer had emotional tension as well as realism if there was someone we didn't follow all day? Like Phillippe, pick up a random hitchhiker and then fall out. Everyone will be freaking out. <br /> <br /> Eventually, in the second half, the touch of invisible mantle scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It rejected me and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter, but they created a beautiful, pleasant scene and that caused the people to tear. It really rejected me. With the authors, not the scene. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and totally untouched. The coincidences are far too much and they need an extreme suspension of unbelief. Unlike lightweight Magnolia, it had compounds on compounds that were just over the top. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock dropped the stairs. But she didn't die. She must have. I cheered when she fell. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is that it draws a Magnolia. Not only in structure, but it has a montage over the song In the deep where you see everyone being depressed. Magnolia took it and had postmodern commentary by singing all the characters who sang to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash came out in 2005. It's hard to comment on a movie that won't be made for another 6 years, but it did. Somehow. <br /> <br /> Full waste of my time. <br /> <br /> First half: D-; Second half: lowest grade ever; Overall: F ---
