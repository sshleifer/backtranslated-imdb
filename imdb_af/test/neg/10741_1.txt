I'm not even with Dante who portrays the Democratic supportive zombies as creatures with an average IQ of 23. I believe their behavior should reflect a lower IQ than that, something in the order of a Pelosi IQ ... A single digit figure, please. <br /> <br /> The MOH series is pretty uneven, and that's the worst episode. Dante, another thoughtless Hollywood liberal (or an apolitical nerd who sucks to the left-wing establishment to rediscover his compassionate career?), Must finally realize that his direct labor has been trapped in a low gear for almost two decades. So come with this curly-invasive, unreliable, left-wing "satire" of the Bush administration, Republicans and capitalism. Perhaps he felt he was not yet openly politicized. He would not be exactly the first non-talent to use asinine political propaganda to advance his career when everything else fails. The creator of villages such as "Piranha", "The Howling" and "Matinee", Dante, was so useful a contributor to the horror genre as Adolf Hitler was world peace. <br /> <br /> TH uses lowest-common denominator humor, cheap and predictable gags that won't even understand the blues of all members of the Bluebond Union. Or have you ever seen a smart, subtle, intelligent liberal satire? Populist dung has the basis of all messages, so the language and manner in which this message is communicated should be as simple and basic as Sean Penn's name. And the better people to send this message to the popcorn sheep than some cocaine sniffing Tinseltown losers who all fell so low that they were forced to write for TV ... <br /> <br /> I don't want political propaganda, either left or right, in any type of film. But this puts in horror - of all genres - is proof of the endless stupidity that ranks so high in Hollywood's anti-intelligentsia. So deadly was Dante that he didn't even notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote for democrat ... (That's what you get for finishing a film school: not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any imagination.)
