This is one of the worst movies I've seen and definitely made the worst movie Nagesh Kuknoor. I can't believe anyone who created a movie like Teen Deewarein created. <br /> <br /> Plot of the movie itself is really flawed that Zeenat Meera must seek and get her grace to help her husband avoid death sentence in Soudi Arabia. Ordinary logic says if Zeenat cannot easily find Meera, the Soudi government will not be able to print Zeenat safely for Meera's signature or thumb print and produce it before the Soudis. Another worst thing is that Shankar has given the wrong address in his passport, so Indian officials can't get to the address, but after some time, Meera Shankar's suitcase gets through the Soudi government. Wow! Don't make Soudis good in India more than Indians? <br /> <br /> Nagya does a little more than cameo in the movie with the role of Chopra, who sees Meera and looks for Meera's father-in-law, Girish Karnaad (this man is just wasted) helping her ash to get a hold. <br /> <br /> Nagya can't speak Hindi and he was assisted by other guys to translate the English dialogues he wrote into Hindi. This time, it seems that his aide was in serious drunkenness, while writing dialogues like "Imaan ki Chalaang" (leap of honesty). Within minutes, after our worst nightmares, Meera not only takes this honest jump, she taps her feet to do "Imma ka Naach". (Dance of Honesty). <br /> <br /> One of the only light-skinned movies is its cinematography and very beautiful colors. But since Bollywood has learned the thing called Post-production, almost all movies have vibrant colors and beautifully mixed backgrounds, not a big problem. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that making a cheese film is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas, Nagyas and everyone is ready to be touched.
