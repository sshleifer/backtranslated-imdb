As other people have mentioned, there may be some other reason to watch this film other than seeing the former Wayne's World star. Mike Myers plays a serious role? The story line is interesting but lacking in development and sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there were any good paintings from Ireland, it would be another reason to see it. Instead, it focuses on a small, normal village surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the Emerald Isle, often shown in Irish films. If there was a cultural "spice" to admire the "Irish personality", it would be worth seeing, but it could almost have shot in England. Too bad for Myers, but this one fails to satisfy or satisfy the heart of anyone who ever wanted to visit the country of Guiness.
