One night, Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist who visits England, picks up a hitch hiker. Two years later, after discovering the man's address book in his car, he returned the book to the man's cute home, just to find out that the man was being murdered. No one in or out of the family seems to make sure the hitch hiker could not commit the murder (of his own stepmother) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime. <br /> <br /> Sutherland is the man's alibi, but he arrived too late. From a guilty feeling, he discovers the right murderer. <br /> <br /> Agatha Christie's mysteries usually involve a number of diverse people, all with some motive for the crime, all suspected, and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict timeline. There is often not always a sidekick with whom the investigator can overcome things. <br /> <br /> Due to the shortcoming of the situation, the necessary care must be taken to explain or observe each element of the mystery to the reader. Redundancy is perfect. We need to keep the characters and timelines straight. Christie's movies are of a scarce nature in which the use of familiar faces in subordinate characters is actually useful. (Jacqueline de Bellefort? Oh yes, this is Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is a Golan Globus production, with everything in the direction of production values, a well-prepared script and skill behind the camera. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes in which Sutherland discovers that an innocent man is hanging is good. Then everything in the viewer is beaten in irreconcilable pieces, often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voice calls that tell us nothing. The writing has a slapdash quality, as if being thrown overnight by two hacks. Few of the faces are known and it doesn't help at all. Everyone is commenting on everyone else and the names become a hopeless obstacle. The musical score consists of four instruments that do annoying atonal jazz riffs. Some celebrities are thrown in to wake the dozens in the audience. If Dame Agatha was alive, she was among the viewers who had to be awakened. <br /> <br /> Dullsville.
