From the title, the tag line, the plot summary on the DVD, etc., I expected something slightly epic, with the historical fiction and the romance that agree to excite you; this is what they did for example in Last of the Mohicans, and I think they did a beautiful job. Maybe I had standards too high for this movie and didn't give it a fair chance. But the scenery was hardly OK (how could they not get any more beautiful if they had such landscapes to work with?), The two lovers had no chemistry at all and the plot was just as predictable that it felt like it was set up is. in 5 minutes by a 12-year-old - and not a very imaginative. Nouvelle-France is a love story that takes place in an advanced historical era. But the history of Nouvelle France is hardly a synot, and the love story is banal and fails to provide the viewer with the fate of love. Surprisingly, the only good parts of the movie came from something completely unexpected and unreliable: the relationship between Marie-Loup, the heroine and her children (one natural, one adopted). If they only concentrated on her family and forgot about the love story, it would have been a much better movie. Marie-Loup's parents had to be given more screen time and character development. Britain's politics had been more than a three-minute scene with hardly any links to the rest. The decay also had to be developed or removed. From the script altogether (why do actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs hire them so badly?) Bad work in general.
