This may include *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br />. Where do you start with this particular empty desert? Well, it would be nice if they actually had a plot. Acting talent, decent dialogue, tension, humor, hey, even free sex, would have helped this movie. Unfortunately, there were only many gores (not even well done), automatic weapons shot and missing. <br /> <br /> There was no reason to adhere to the basic premise, a Native American curse protects the bodies of the tribe he killed, with his search by a Federal Special Ops team in have attracted civilians (?). Most of the time relates to one of the basic rules of conduct in a Horror movie that separates from the group, so you can be chosen one by one. You'd think this team would know better, especially since they're actually the third team that was sent to investigate, the other two teams disappear without a track. When they finally realize they are being counted down, they make one of several stands and fire their weapons just to hit the trees a lot. Tree shot scene repeats endlessly in this movie to save money. <br /> <br /> If they don't shoot trees, they follow this spirit that leaves no trace (who knows how to follow it), and injects a lot of macho BS. By the way, did I mention that most of this team are women? Interesting listening to them talking tough. Not very entertaining, but interesting. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can find better movies in the bargain at Kmart.
