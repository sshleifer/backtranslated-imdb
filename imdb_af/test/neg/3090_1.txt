what a waste of time! I expected better from cameron diaz! I think it wasn't really her fault to be in a terrible movie. the film does not capture the beauty of Europe ..... and was not successful in leading the audience into tension or wonder. poor attempt at storytelling and narration - dialogue is boring and could not convey what I sometimes think simplicity is beauty. no love, energy, electricity on the screen. too bad !!!!!!!! 1
