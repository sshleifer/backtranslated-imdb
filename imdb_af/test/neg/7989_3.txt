"The wizard of Menlo Park" was very responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007: even if he did not find it without competitors or assistants, he had the electric light, the phonograph, the movie camera, the electric car battery, the electric power grid (possibly his most important but least recalled invention), the prefabricated house, and the innovations on the telephone and telegraph, as well as the tapping machine and an early voting machine. The total number of patents is over 1,000 - much more than any other American inventor. <br /> <br /> But Edison was a relentless business contender. He often had great legal battles over the precedence of his inventions about competitors. The best example is the phone, where he was one of seven or eight opponents with claims against Alexander Graham Bell. In fact, Edison's invention here was not the central idea that Bell and Gray came apart independently in 1876, but an improvement in the sound quality of the telephone receiver and transmitter Bell did not develop. Yet it was part of the big decision of the Supreme Court of 1888, which was the longest US High Court decision (a single volume of their reports!) Written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite. to complete it. <br /> <br /> In 1886, Edison found an eternal relentless rival in the field of electric power grids for big cities. It was George Westinghouse, inventor of the railway air. Westinghouse's firm got the help of a new inventor, and former Edison assistant, Nicola Tesla. Tesla developed "alternating current", which was a competitive system for Edison's "direct current". Edison's system was basically a straight-line electricity system. Tesla's system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another. Actually, it was a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to break this rival through a publicity campaign. <br /> <br /> It started with electric power lines. Edison used to set his lines underground so they would not be threatened by weather conditions. But Westinghouse was forced to extend its lines into the open telephone lines. When there were several casual deaths at the Westinghouse lines, there were Westinghouse lines (especially one incident where the repairman was burned alive to hundreds of shocked viewers in Manhattan's business district). Edison started insisting that AC power was much more dangerous than DC <br /> <br /> One consequence was that Edison helped some subsidiary inventors to get Westinghouse AC generators and dynamos for an electric chair. Edison himself always refused to find the electric chair, but he helped several smaller figures along the way. Read the full story by Mark Essig's EDISON & THE ELECTRIC CHAIR (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison was experimenting with cats and dogs (experiments he was happy to show the public). In the long run, despite supporting the invention of a new method of execution, Edison did not disrupt the public support of Alternating Current. But he never stopped trying. <br /> <br /> In 1903, he had the opportunity to launch his campaign against Westinghouse and A.C. to combine with his invention of the film camera. He helped to drop a well-known public elephant ("Topsy") who killed some men. He did this by electrocuting the poor animal with A.C. But the whole murder is on film - and one can see it today. It's an avid search movie - whatever did poor "Topsy" was a poor animal - not a Machiavellian killer. The moment we see the explosions of electricity rubbish that show the death of the elephant, we are aware that it will soon be over, but the sudden collapse of Topsy is still an unpleasant performance. The film has a bad smell in the mouth of modern film audiences. Still, sad to say, it probably made a profit for Edison - his description of the movie in his movie catalog shows real pride in his performance here. In 1903 it might be exciting entertainment for many Americans who saw it. One is glad that more people are experiencing this today terribly. Sometimes one can have humanity's feelings, have improved a little.
