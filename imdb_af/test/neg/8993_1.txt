Naach would have won a rally for the Worst Film in 2004 (can also be overall) if it was worldwide. When it goes bad (aka shows attitude / nice / over (not) acting) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While the catwoman had a story, presumably hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that makes me wonder why IMDb makes it possible to rate a movie as 0/10. Again, I think the movie doesn't even have a 0. It should be something negative or minus infinite. <br /> <br /> OK, how about the plot? It's a funda-giving, arrogant, full of attitude choreographer meets a useless, less skillful, loafer that strives for an actor story. The story is so short that IMDb, as just another sentence, can ban me from writing a spoiler. About the storytelling? It's like a lot (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. Don't try this movie if you bought a new DVD player. You will eventually believe that DVD is also bad or that DVD player is beaten. It is not his fault at all. <br /> <br /> At the end of it all, you finally give credit to the director. He at least realized that both Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) could not convincingly talk, so there were not too many dialogues in this movie. So, at least you can sleep your way through the movie, with some annoying sounds from the Antra-Malli song series. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're new to Bollywood Cinema. Once you have patented this movie, you will be able to watch and enjoy any Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> There can be no worse 3 hour torture than this!
