I know everyone said this movie was completely crap and I agree with them. I spent a few years after seeing it and telling it to other people. I recommended that they not see it. But when it was on television, we saw the ad. I went to the family and said, "I know it's sad, but I think it's to see it". My sister went to me and said, "Yes, I too." And you know what? It was funny. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie at all. It is absolutely a waste of time. But this is a good waste of time. You can still think it's slim and fair, but I thought it was a very funny slapstick comedy. I didn't look like a few pieces, like when the fish was hit by the car, but I thought well. I liked sitting there and taking out all the well-known Australian faces: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald, etc. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to waste your time, watch this movie. Otherwise, see a drama or something.
