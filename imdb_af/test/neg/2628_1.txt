Milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 shooter Mikey, if you actually check it, both movies have the same lines! But if you want to see an incredibly funny movie, with absolutely no plot whatsoever ...... well then the movie is for you. The play is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. The story behind this cruelty is simple. Milo Jeeder is a child with serious family problems. His father is an abortion doctor who holds unborn fetus in a pot (NICE!) And was desperate for a child of his own. He made a way to bring one of these shed children to life and he called him ............. MILO !!!!! <br /> <br /> Apart from all the bad, terrible directing, annoying sound of Milo's voice and the overbearing sound of the bell on his bike, if you take away all the bad, it's still a bad but funny attempt at a movie. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a bankroll 1 out of 10
