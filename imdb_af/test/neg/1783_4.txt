I thought it would be a fun comedy without sex or nudity in it. Well, there is no sexual content, but as if it were a "fun comedy", I remember only three times during "The Green Butchers". The hilarity is centered around cannibalism and mental disability, which is just sick humor, in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I had to walk out of this movie and I kick myself because I didn't. In fact, I shouldn't have seen this movie in the first place. The only good thing that came from this movie was the fact that Bjarne and his brother eventually changed and put their ugly past behind them. I advise any well-meaning individual to stay away from this eradicating movie.
