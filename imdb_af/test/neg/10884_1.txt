I saw a lot of movies. In fact, I love B horror movies, they are one of my favorite genres. But this "garbage" (I refuse to admit it received the honor of the movie) was the worst piece of shit I ever had the torture to watch. I actually subscribed to IMDb for the fact that I had a way to at least agree how terrible this "rubbish" was. I watched "Films" (at least they deserve the honor) in cellars by high school students who were better written and directed. I have nothing but sorry for the poor actors in this "Garbage" because they just tried to earn a pay check. They will now have this spot on their records like a virgin raped and given Herpes! If writer / director John Shiban has any dignity at all, after undoubtedly becoming numerous people, he should never allow himself near a camera again and try to use his so-called "Gifts" to fit something to make him .... Like the floor of a Peep Show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
