It's a silly movie with lots of singing and dancing. Acting is average, but writing leaves something to be desired. There are memorable performances by Buddy Epsen, with a short but outstanding performance by Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. A totally incredible portrayal of college life that ends with an excellent ice skating exhibition by Alice in Wonderland. Many parts are worth watching, but don't be afraid to move forward through parts of the movie
