Greedy land baron in the small western town of Prairie City wants all the farmers to be off their land, with intimidation tactics and arson to evacuate them. It seems as if the town is swimming on top of oil, and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he is cut off by the baron's hired gun. The farmer's seafaring son is coming soon, and only realize what he opposes and tries to fight the rest of the residents to fight. Another lawlessness-in-the-West story, with everyone under the thumb of the villain (who obviously holds all the cards). Derived and uncomfortable to watch, with a long wait before our Stoic hero finally gets his dander. Sterling Hayden's half-hearted Swedish accent is a big problem, though he does cut a solid, sympathetic screen presence and almost guarantees the picture. Director Joseph H. Lewis studies most of the scenes, such as a TV West, and Gerald Fried's bug-heavy score is no help, although rich black and white cinematography by Ray Rennahan is excellent. An independent production released by United Artists has started a bizarre one (starting with shots from the final, followed by shots from the movie's mid-section), but it does have a certain needle force that gets the viewer on Hayden's side. . ** of ****
