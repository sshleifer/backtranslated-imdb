I was also a woman of an abusive man, even though the attacks were psychological, not physical. He gave a very respectful, responsible and generous personality to everyone we saw together, which, unlike myself, resulted in others being so dull and unstable. Initially, I was so incredibly flattered that anyone like Gus (who worked in a bank and was very confident) would even give the time of the day, and I totally overwhelmed him for the IDEA, rather than the person he was . If I got my head straight and first got to know him better, I couldn't have married him. However, this is my fault. It was not my fault to be abused. I did not deserve it, nor did I see it until I was thinking, criticism and isolation. He acted as if I had no business that differed from his own opinion - actually he went further. If I did not agree, he assumed that I had misunderstood and increasingly simplified his wording. By the time I finally lost my self-respect, I couldn't recognize the problem I was having, and I had to be brought to reality. by outside influence. My dad said Gus called me a bitch. Well, it was another half year before the rage that started at that moment finally exploded and I packed things in while he was at work, and I left. .. and it was a few months before I could understand the fact that I was abused and that it was not my fault, he did the things he did. ..... so please, anyone who accepts it is the victim's fault, think !!! If a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner, if you have an accident on your back in an anxious situation, are you blaming the puppy? By the time the abuse in a relationship reaches a clear violent level, the target of abuse is so wounded and impersonal (as in Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to judge the circumstances accurately, because then the victim believes all the terrible things traced by the abuse. Have a heart, people. The labeling of victims as stupid morons is like kicking someone who is already terribly beaten. -------> and this helps how ???
