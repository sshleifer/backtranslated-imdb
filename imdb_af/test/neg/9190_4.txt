This film basically tries to portray the heroism of firefighters through the entire movie turning an American father, with a good heart that others place for themselves. Now I know they are trying to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American dad who is a firefighter, but as if there is nothing interesting about him so ever, so when the movie comes to the climax , there is little or no emotion. This movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting, but it just as boring as any other work, except that you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station, but anyone could have played his part and he is a dull character than the rest of the movie. What a good movie could have been is that the firefighter puts himself as heroes because they are firefighters and change the whole scenario into an uninteresting melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
