OK, this movie was not good at all. Video games are not what I would boast if I was 15. Cool to play games, but to write a comment on video games, this movie can be, it's strange. Just playing a video game, don't worry about how to get caught up. I use my phone, I hope I do not lose my girlfriend in it. Fat is the worst ever? OK, Grease has a very thorough story with a musical. Even if you don't like musical, someone will say Fat is good. My brother has been playing video games all the time and he watched and ran for 30 minutes because it was so terrible. I fall asleep.
