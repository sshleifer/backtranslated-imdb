<br /> <br /> I was one of the Hollywood action block busters of the 80's. They had icons like Arnie and Sly, but I think the action movie in the 90s dropped to new depths. The worst of this, I believe, was Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The plot is confronted with scandal and draws out the worst cliches as it attempts to be excited. The melodrama is so shrinking saccharine and awful that you can't really wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Unfortunately, Liv Tyler, who has performed admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, decided to jump on the commercial train. This movie symbolizes the new Hollywood aesthetic of great special effects and precious, little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. This is the norm of these days and I wonder if there is a role in Hollywood for writers. They seem to only employ hacks and committees to write the comfortable scripts. The rest leave them to technology. There is not a single great, warm human emotion in Armageddon. It just feels empty and soft. I can only think of one good aspect of this movie and it involves Liv Tyler's father who doesn't even appear in the movie. Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith presents a theme song for the movie - a ballad that really stumbles on, and at least a bit in the heartbeat when the end credits come up. <br /> <br /> I cry for Western civilization as people like this predictable, cumbersome film. It stands for abomination, lethargy, and a decline in human intellect. I'd even prefer to watch the eighth Friday on the 13th.
