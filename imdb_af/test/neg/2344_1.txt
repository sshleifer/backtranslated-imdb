I watched Telly the other night, and little did I know what a cringe fest would be ... I knew it would be stupid, but not so bad! This film illustrates everything that is terrible in the Australian comedy. Apart from the most boring, uninspired scenarios and characters I have ever experienced (apart from those dubious French-made American tax breakthroughs!), Most of the situations were boring, incredible, stereotypical and so funny, just ... horrible! <br /> <br /> One such scenario that really irritated me was the nerds on the bus scene. From a screenwriting perspective, the authors use the most uninteresting - not to mention - amazing scenario to get these three stranded without their luggage ... They're on the vacation of their lives and they're going to risk it all (including a $ 300 deposit, luggage and room) to exercise their rights to dance on a bus? I mean, they're about half an hour away from their destination! At least they could have kicked the bus driver, but they didn't go out willingly. "They can't take it anymore!" And ruining their vacation ... Anyway, I can't believe the authors don't attend. terrible scenario. I think a 10-year-old can be more clever, funny and credible with 5 set-ups. <br /> <br /> I can continue with many others - the truly imaginative stereotypical psychopath, the whole relationship with the evil friend and brand virgin, the 'Wow Man! There is a good girl who breathes things on the train - Everything was just tired! I can't think of one detached feature of this movie, except that the third-wheeler might be cute. Spoiled his career by appearing in this trash already!
