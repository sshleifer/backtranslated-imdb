It's really bad, the characters were vague, the story was boring, and there was no sex scene. In addition, it does not have drama, the conflict is minimal, causing it to be extremely slow. Nothing happens in this movie, you will expect a sex scene, but they just have a kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife, and a stranger pulling them off the highway. The couple invite the stranger to stay with them because he is homeless. At this stage, would you expect the stranger to have sex with the woman? No, they just kiss and that's it. Also, this movie contains no action, no comedy, no drama, and not even tension. Imagine that the studio might not even have read this script !!
