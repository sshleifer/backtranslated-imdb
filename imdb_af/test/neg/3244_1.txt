I am ashamed to publicly admit that I even kept the cover of this movie once! This is an absolute reason why one should examine the film before he sees it! The 'makers' of this movie called us all the foolish and gullible losers with too much time on our hands. <br /> <br /> Based on the mythical Indian form-shifting cobra and rebirth, the story takes us a painful ride. College goes 40+ actors (now really?) Is the target of their former friend Manisha Koirala (who was a cobra in her early life, but is now a ghost!) And her pathetic, eternal, powerful boyfriend Kohli (what unfortunately not yet seen). Now you need to know more? <br /> <br /> I agree to study for the upcoming test in school rather than this movie! Give it a pass if you are healthy. If not ... then you will probably enjoy it.
