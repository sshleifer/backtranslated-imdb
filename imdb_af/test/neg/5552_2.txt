I love camp movies, believe me and Gordon Lewis's usual techniques don't bother me, but it's just one of his most beautiful movies, even more so than BLOOD FEAST, I'm not joking. THE GORGEOUS GIRLS are about a crazy person who is going to kill a lot - go (re) girls from a nightclub. A detective and a reporter are trying to find the big secret. Perhaps the performances here are slightly better than the regular average acting H.G Lewis movies, but that doesn't say much. The camera work is even terrible. <br /> <br /> But at least it's kind of viewable with the go, girls are acting ... you're going to spend a good time with it, and the murders are just absurd in a very, very bad way: A girl is killed with a wooden hammer punch in her buttocks (!) and just don't talk about what it does with the nipples. You're going to laugh like somebody after that. But the better of all this mess is a scene I just love for his camp: the go-go girl before being attacked by many feminists who dance in a very American way. Although it is important to note that this is one of the first films to receive an X rating due to the violence. ONLY if you want to laugh and have a good time (but with many, A LOT of beer).
