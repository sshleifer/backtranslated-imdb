There is really only one reason to watch this scarcely adequate and completely predictable movie about an excited chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphan Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister dies in a car wreck is. And the reason is to see Aaron Eckhart (Nick) who, with his slideshow and attractive low stance, looks good to beat and eat between two slices of organic Pannini with an olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dip and some finely chopped sun dried. tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean. The thought that he could take off his shirt was the only thing that kept me awake to the end. He dropped his apron several times, but to my disappointment I never went further. <br /> <br /> I can't be too critical, because I watched it on pay per impression at home, so it didn't cost it. At least I got the price of two movie tickets, and I was educated to be grateful for little mercy. But really, it's Rom Com at its most formal. Zeta Jones gives a very flat, monotonous performance, she looks completely without passion (possibly due to the time she spent in the cold store at the restaurant). Thirty in there couldn't have been fun and her face barely changed over the whole movie. Abigail Breslin was pretty good as a cousin, she is such an attractive girl that it is impossible to criticize her, and anyway I love her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson is always good value and I can't really blame her as the restaurant owner because she was very unused and saw a good actor and how little she had to do here. But the whole thing is just as clich√©d, much of the dialogue banal, and the outcome so obvious. This is the movie-like equivalent of paint by numbers, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart generated little heat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nick likes Italian food (which undoubtedly indicates his burning inner passion) and cooks for the sound of Puccini. She appeared in Kate's kitchen at 22 Bleecker (the restaurant's name) predictably her feathers, but his relentless ability to connect with her cousin by making pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the lounge brought Kate to and fro Some obstacles along the way, she ends up giving him her valued possession. No, not her honor. But her recipe for saffron sauce. <br /> <br /> I'm very unfair here, aren't I? I mean Rom Com is Rom Com and we all know what we allow ourselves when we sign up. But should it always be so boring?
