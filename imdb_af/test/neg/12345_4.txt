For the first forty minutes or so, Luna is a great pleasure to watch. The characters and their situation are interesting and the photography and places are beautiful to look at. Then Jill Clayburgh discovered her son. Matthew Barry uses heroin and the movie begins to unravel and then becomes really ridiculous in his illness. <br /> <br /> Clayburgh asked him why and when he started using the drug, and she or the audience always got a straight answer, which would be a bit helpful. He doesn't care about anything, but it's not right, because we clearly see in the incredible early scenes that he has a lot of interest in his mother's singing, baseball, sex and apparently enough to force marijuana. This movie is for people who think junior gets into hard drugs, because mom and dad were workaholics who missed his piano review. I think such a dangerous and emotional volatile drug such as heroin was chosen as a kind of intellectual catalyst for the later scenes of incest. There is a lot of discussion about the mother's love for the boy, but it's really about Bernardo Bertolucci who is pretentious. Luna would have been good as a beautiful little family drama. <br /> <br /> How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more worried about the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this movie than for something that went through his character. ** from ****
