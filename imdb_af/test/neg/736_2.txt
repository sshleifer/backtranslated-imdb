I saw some horrible book-to-movie adjustments in my day, but this one holds them all! The bizarre, unattractive cast detracts from the story, which in itself is untrue to the book. Mr. Tilney is nothing so attractive; As for Catherine Morland, a geary look makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella reads nothing like the Aphrodite in the original text, and James Morland appears in the movie too much to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story. Also, as others have said, this novel was aimed at suggesting the Gothic craze in Austen's time, but it seems that this "soft horror" film is designed and intended to be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen turns into her grave every time one of her fans is disappointed by this horrible interpretation of what a joke was.
