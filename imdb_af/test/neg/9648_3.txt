This self-important, confusing B + W "movie" looks like a baby on a very bad journey. You are dealing with something reminiscent of a piece of decaying lettuce that accidentally fell from the back of a garbage truck: no one likes to touch it, as it will probably drain on its own against storm be. There is no place for plot when you have "visceral image" and "subtle" allegory. For me it seems as if the director is trying to make the next great art film as he begs for intellectual awards. Neither did I bring my beret. Seeing this, I almost feel insulted, as the "movie" is such an effective work to distance you from.
