I'm not from America, I usually see this show on AXN channel, I don't know why this respected channel is such a sucker in the first time slot. The creation of Hollywood's money bank Jerry Bruckheimer, this time he spends a large amount of cash in the small screen. In each episode, a lot of people with two team members travel from country to country for a large amount of money; where the camera teams shoot their journeys. I don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show. It has nothing to look at, in all the episodes we see people running like beggars, sometimes shouting, crying, squeaking, jerking camera work. It is harmful to both eyes and ears. The most disgusting part of the race is that the viewers eventually know that each of the team members cannot enjoy their race / travel experience. Although, to pick up the ratings, the producers included Gays' ideas in one show, sucking the American reality show. <br /> <br /> It's nothing to look at, better switch to other channels. <Br /> <br /> The Amazing Race = The Disgusting Show.
