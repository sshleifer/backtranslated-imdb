"In the heavy summer of 1958, the Deuces, a gang of Brooklyn thugs, find their turf threatened when the leader of a rival, the Vipers, is released from prison. Leon (Stephen Dorff), the Deuces leader , trying to guide his boys through bloody brawls to keep the Vipers out, but if his brother (Brad Renfro) falls into a sultry and dangerous relationship with Annie (Fairuza Balk), the sister of a Viper and his own girlfriend brutally attacked, Leon and his gang plunged into an all-out war to save his brother, his girlfriend - and his neighborhood! "according to the DVD hat description. It's definitely no "basketball diaries". Think of it as 'West Side Story' which is hit over the head with baseball bats and steel pipes. Stokbal left Brooklyn with the Dodgers. "Deuces Wild" has some cool Hollywood sets, 1950s cars and soundtrack songs; and many of them are beautifully photographed by John A. Alonzo. The story and direction never goes beyond these strengths, allowing the film to sprout and descend during its opening hours. The movie looks good when you read the credits, but translates into an aging, fleeting mess of fake pumpadours, blood and Brylcreem ?? and a horror wedge. A feeling of sadness and regret is the production. <br /> <br /> *** Deuces Wild (5/3/02) Scott Kalvert ~ Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Frankie Muniz
