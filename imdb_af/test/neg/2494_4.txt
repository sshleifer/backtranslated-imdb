It is easier to watch this movie if you consider it a scenario created by fleet lieutenant Reginald Barclay during his holodeck addiction. (Barclay is a recurring Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.) <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz is mistaken for Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a flat, two-dimensional figure from a soap opera. Paul Newman is also overlooked as General Leslie Groves, but this movie's problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles. <br /> <br /> The factual mistakes and great freedoms taken (with the chronology of events) to Prescribe Writer Bruce Robinson's political agenda make this movie embarrassing to look at. That's probably why this movie has found a home on the so-called History Channel. <br /> <br /> "Fat Man and Little Boy" combines bad science, bad history, bad scriptwriter and mediocre work to make a movie not to be seen by impressive high school or college students, nothing of the Manhattan project does not know. .
