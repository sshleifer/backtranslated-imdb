This series takes a classic story and rubbish it. Robin is spoken in some way by a moose man in the woods and devoted to all sorts of druidism and absolute satanic episodes. The story goes over him and avoids the evil sheriff than helping the poor. It is hardly visible. And for the sake of all the ridicule, they kill Robin at the end of Series 2 and replace with another actor. Some may like this show as a fantasy show, but it is NOT a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin to fight King Richard's name against Prince John and the sheriff and if you want the poor and oppressed, watch the classic series or the latest from the BBC.
