*** BIG SPOILERS! *** "Flesh Feast" of 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great Veronica Lake career. It has the wide reputation to be a terribly stinker, and rightly I have to say. As a big fan of low budget Horror / Exploitation, especially from the 70's, I chose to watch it, mainly because of the cool campsite on this site, but after watching it, I had to admit that the picture was actually has nothing to do with the movie. The photo here on this site is the cover of a DVD collection entitled "Flesh Feast" containing four films, including Sergio Martino's "Mountain Of The Cannibal God" and Dal Tenney's "I Eat Your Skin". What this collection does not include, however, is this boring turkey. "Flesh Feast" is not only camp and ridiculous, but mostly pretty boring, which is even more pathetic, as the movie is only 70 minutes long. Also, don't be fooled by the title, the movie is not gory at all. Yet it is vigilant, even though it is only for its trashiness and especially the extremely stupid, but somewhat entertaining end. The film follows a ridiculous plot about dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake), an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild the youth using carnivorous virgins (don't ask how). A bunch of criminals (or terrorists, or whatever), paid by a radical political group, gives the doctor to restore the youth of a 'mysterious' commander. After an endless hour of indifferent drive, it seems that the mysterious commander himself is Hitler himself. It was quite obvious, but I still had to walk out, because the film's final was so incredibly stupid and ceaselessly hilarious ... This is a movie that is far from being the last movie of a great actress and former beauty queen like Veronika Lake. Except for the lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for a zero-budget production like this. However, bad performances are something I can easily forgive in such films. However, what I cannot forgive is extreme boredom. The last five minutes have been watching for hardcore fans of camping, but I still recommend skipping them.
