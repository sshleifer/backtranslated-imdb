In a future where a complex travel agency uses time travel technology to return rich customers back in time for explorations to dinosaur age, the future becomes inexplicably changed when one of their clients breaks the cardinal rule of not hiding the road. In an effort to repair the damage, Edward Burns teams with the inventors of technology (Catherine McCormack). <br /> <br /> The premise is pretty good and engaging. It may have some flaws on it, but it can still make an interesting movie. Unfortunately, a sound of thunder fails to hook the audience really. It suffers from a number of problems and it takes itself too seriously, so it's really hard to have fun while watching the movie. Personally, I thought the script was the biggest problem of the movie. It was more plot holes than expected and the movie was so lazy to explain things. I was hoping for a more in-depth investigation into the "butterfly effect", but the movie was more awesome than anything else. It's been good with me since 90 minutes of uncaring fun, is still a great way to spend an evening. However, all the fun this movie is offering was unintentional and lame. There were some scenes that entertained me, but I was pretty bored. <br /> <br /> The acting is not much better, because most of them look more interested in a salary than anything else. The only person who had a good performance was Ben Kingsley. He liked the first half of the film and he also had the most fun. Edwards Burns was pretty pale and pale. I don't think he has what it takes to be a leading man. However, he can make a decent supportive actor. Catherine McCormack was just very annoying and not very credible. I didn't really see her in anything else, but she could have potential. The rest of the actors also give bad performances, although most of them are relatively unknown so they don't have to work out too much. <br /> <br /> Look at the message boards, and most people complain about the special effects. There is no way to sugar them and they are terrible. All the dinosaurs really look bad. The Gibbon lizards (share monkey, share dino), while a creative idea, become obsolete after a while and they will probably encourage less than fear. The green screen work just looks awful and unprofessional. I really wondered what director Peter Hyams was trying to achieve here. He fails to deliver the tension, action and excitement and makes this movie a long one. The movie is mostly scarce and it is far from the worst movie of 2005. Hopefully they will record this film again in the future. There is potential in this project, but it is now the best we have. In the end, unless curiosity gets you the best, there's no reason to see a sound of thunder. Rating 4/10
