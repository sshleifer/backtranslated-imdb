I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money to think it would be at least generously entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed was when Robin Williams crashed into the car at the bottom of the hill, and the end he seemed to be killed. Glenn Close was unpleasant, and she apparently didn't get old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp would have taken her children away from the Department of Children and Families. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and his glazed donut look of benevolent goodness are just too sweet and thrilled for me. He has two roles he can play: Funny person or sad, tragic, kind-hearted victim. See the Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam, and all its so-called "dramatic" roles. It's always the same thing. Put them all together in one long mini-series. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Remember Fatal Attraction? Do you want to have a relationship with her, even on your worst day and if you were alone? Did you feel any sparks between her and Michael Douglas? Have you ever seen Glenn Close? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. It was back in the day he played serial killers and bad guys, so he saw him as a transsexual, at least funny. Garp is made for all those who love to watch movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claim it is beautiful and deep.
