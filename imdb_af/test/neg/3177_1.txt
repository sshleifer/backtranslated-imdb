The action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to tie the episodes together and move the story forward. The plot runs alongside. With few exceptions (eg Graham Greene), the play was uninspired and is at its best pedestrians. The actors had something different on their minds, except the scene they were in. It is boring to observe a man who drives a car through the semi-desert country from the movie's environment, whether driving or driving. Such scenes are typical of the level of tension in the video. So there was nothing about this video to engage or draw the observer, to take care of the characters and the outcome. I'm double disappointed because I rented this movie, based on the reputation of the executive producer (Redford) and the author of the novel on which it is based (Hillerman). I note that the jewel box reports that funding is provided by PBS and the Public Broadcasting Corporation as well as Carlton International. I hope this video was so disappointing for them and my wife that they will no longer fund disasters from the same source.
