Can I just start saying I'm a fan of bad movies. And it's a very bad movie. It puts forward 100 passengers, 3,000 snakes, but I think it's more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> The snakes do nothing special, the whole movie is just blunders with little events. Although there is sometimes a big shot of pulsating arms and green goo-puke (bad movies have to go green, isn't it?). <br /> <br /> But then the end comes together and you'll literally hit straight from your seat in hysteria. For this, this movie is a boost to a 2 * rating. <br /> <br /> There are some movies about the world you want to show friends, just so you can see reaction when a certain event happens in them. <br /> <br /> For example, The arrival of "Big Man" in R Kelly's "trapped in the closet" "The LINE" in "Shark Attack 3" (you will know it when you hear it) The arrival of the mum shark in 'Shark Attack 3' Almost every scene of 'troll 2' The end of 'Dracula 3000' (just for the complete unbelief and confusion) and the end of this movie prides itself in this category. It is worth putting just that. So get drunk, stoned, whatever your poison, and watch this movie with a few friends. <br /> <br /> Very simple, if you like bad movies, get it, but don't be confused with 'Snakes on a plane' ... there's no relationship. <br /> <br /> And don't pay more than a fiver for it.
