This movie was poorly drafted, poorly written and poorly performed. All the characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The movie was fundamentalist Christian propaganda. The Christian characters are more holy than you and they are without compassion for the skeptical or unpredictable characters. The movie was a real "gotcha" for both the skeptical character and myself as a viewer, which put us in a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the theater management and was acquitted for another movie. I remember another film about a similar topic, "The Rapture," with Mimi Rogers, who was much better and professionally done. I think I'll see "The Rapture" again. If you attend and do not like "Unidentified," don't say I didn't warn you.
