I have never seen the other two "Ninja" movies and for all I know, there are some, but for some reason I watched this one. This one starts pretty fast as this one Ninja goes on a super-deadly spree. He is almost unstoppable, as it takes a lot of dots to pick him up. He's not out for the score, as he eventually owns a woman and then continues his deadly ways by using her as his instrument. Another ninja goes into the dress and apparently the only way to kill a ninja is with another ninja so he is a volunteer. This leads to a great battle at the end when the dead ninja goes back into his body and they are out in a whole war. Sounds better than it actually seems, but at least it wasn't boring.
