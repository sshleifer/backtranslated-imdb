I saw the movie in the original Italian. It should be said that the acting and interpretation is most polluted by the TV-generated tendency to speak into a very muted voice, not to move lips, tensions, as in "The Real Life" - productions and "Let's-raise - our audience-with-a-pair-tears" screen-dramatic writing. The late Massimo Girotti towers on the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The movie has some good tips, but (as in another commentary for mines) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plots of less and less relevance. Another trend has shifted from TV productions, known to Italians. A few drops in style can be saved to the public, such as the patisserie dress (charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual wage sweets, watch Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.) Hammam and the Fairies are definitely more truth, Ozpetek learned Italy's melody in the early 2000's and is about to go ... I'll give him a last chance though ...
