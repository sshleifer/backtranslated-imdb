I thought it was a spoof when I saw it at the rental shop, but I realized it was just crap, I can't even believe I didn't shut it down, as we all know the snakes were not rattlers, were their pythons and Gardner's, the acting was paralyzed and converted, I still can't believe the finite lole, if you are going to look, just look for the end, it was seriously priceless way better than 6th sentence, or the makers of the movie actually I thought this title would fly. The only time it's really going to fly is when I throw it in the garbage. Just look for a laugh. It was hilarious in the dumbest way. Don't just buy it.
