Based on the excellent Watchers novel by Dean Koontz, this extremely horrible movie is unlikely to be seen by anyone. Not since the "Running Man", I have seen a book that has been unknown so far. The difference, however, is that the "Running Man" movie was still fun as an entertaining action movie that posted a million catches. This movie ?? No, nothing entertaining amusing. In fact, if you love the book, as you do, you will even hate this bastardization. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** Right, I'm basically going to tell you the story here, almost entirely. Why? Because you, dear reader, don't even have to suffer this horror. It's good for me, because I enjoy watching. Because I like to complain about things. Now on the nasty side: This film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant monkey creature who has escaped from a destroyed government genetics laboratory with a super-smart golden retriever who "hero" call "Furface." Sigh ?? Trust me, in the novel, shook this story. I'll get it later. Anyway, the hero is no one else, the dreamy son-child Corey Haim. Oh, I'm not joking. Our hero runs around, creaking voice and everyone, trying to convince his mother to save this dog from the "evil government" born to him and make him genetically ultra-smart. The monkey creature, referred to afterwards as an "Oxcom" (God helps us), is also a genetic boot of a creature built to be the ultimate warrior on the battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers, always playing a badass) is also in this movie, and no, I couldn't figure out how someone convinced him it would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the NSO hunting the dog and the creature. Oh yes, here are some spoilerama: He is also a creation of government and the same lab, and look, look, most of the movies are a peak and kill people? And all the murder is supposed to be by the monkey soldier. Instead of a rockin 'kick-ass, creepy horror movie, we have a rectal bleeding of a teenage farmer's horror flick. The dog's intelligence is all too easily found, and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside. Break !! <br /> <br /> Change from Book to Film: <br /> <br /> - Change character (Travis) from man to boy change. <br /> <br /> - Man's love interest in book (Nora), is his mother now? And all her depth and character growth is completely gone. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson, black man, is now white Mr. Ironside. This is important as the character's power is built on his legacy in the book. <br /> <br /> - The relationship between two figures of authority is completely ignored, Lem kills the man who was originally his best friend. <br /> - One principle character in the book is now completely absent, the "immortal" that the heroes have chased - perhaps it is supposed to be Ironside, but why is he then someone else? <br /> <br /> - Never get deserving Einstein's name in the movie. <br /> <br /> - No part of the book took place in a High School, at least nothing that had a strong impact on the plot. <br /> <br /> - Take over a matter of days, rather months like the book? Unrealistic pacing. <br /> <br /> - Corey Haim's girlfriend in the movie does not appear in more than two chapters in the book - and they never met in the book. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson's character is no longer cool; Instead, he is a total asshole that bulges his people. <br /> <br /> - Hero Travis was part of Delta Force (military segment specializing in hunting terrorists), instead, his dad, who was never in the movie, was part of the group. <br /> <br /> - Several intelligence in the sample is now completely absent. <br /> <br /> - Parts that Soviet and Mob are exhausted from the story. <br /> <br /> - These are just the most unpleasant changes, and the one I could remember by hand (and a day later). <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - After 90 minutes of pain and mental anxiety, the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Didn't do that, didn't help: <br /> <br /> - Michael Ironside? I usually like him. <br /> <br /> - The dog is quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> - Wacky "total 80's" title screen. <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - Okay, writing for one is extremely terrible. <br /> <br /> - The direction is so half-assed that anyone watching the movie will feel better than anyone involved in it. <br /> <br /> - The play is sloppy and weak, especially from Corey Haim. <br /> <br /> - Loose, weak, diluted story. <br /> - The monster just looks pathetic, that is, when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing. His head is vastly overgrown, the yellow eyes so much of the thing in the book are not seen for more than two seconds. Instead of a lean, powerful, fast, intelligent killing machine, we have a few foxes in a puke-ugly mug that is forced on us. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> - Even the violence and the fool are poorly done, as it is supposed to be a HORROR movie !! Usually violence is at least well done! <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The idea that Dean Koontz is playing his brilliant novel to become this dirty f * cking piece of sh * I am dangerously close to vomiting myself and someone close to me. There are movies worse than this (headache inducing as the idea may seem), but so far only 'Alien vs. Predator', at least for me, is a greater tribulation and more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: See how the end credits start. <br/> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, it's just terrible) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 1/10 Special effects / Makeup up: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Gore: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br / > <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I would recommend that no one ever watch this movie, except for some extreme die-hard horror fans ?? and just if you didn't read the novel. Instead, I would recommend that anyone interested in it should avoid it completely and buy / check / borrow the book. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
