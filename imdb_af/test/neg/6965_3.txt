There is a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating. Since it was made in 1953, it is a very brave film about transvestites. The problem is tackled fairly seriously and sympathetically (and offers the viewer much information on the subject) and tries very hard not to stereotype. The film makes it clear that transvestites are not homosexual, and that, in addition to wearing women's clothing, they live a relatively normal life. It's about the pain of not being accepted into society - the plot revolves around a police officer (Lyle Talbot) trying to understand the problem because he recently had suicide. So, you have to give everyone involved in this movie credit for such a controversial (in the context of 1953). <br /> <br /> Having said all this, I'm sorry to say that this movie is absolutely horrible. In the effort to portray Glen / Glenda's (Edward D. Wood )'s pain, the movie falls foolishly (and sometimes surprisingly - again giving the era - sensual) fantasies that make the story very difficult to follow. The acting is at its best. None of the dialogue is about as real; the actors look and sound like people who write speeches written by others. And worst of all - there was no point in having Bela Lugosi in this movie. It was one of the increasingly embarrassing roles that this poor man learned in the last stages of his career. "Pull the strings, pull the strings," the Lugosi's character (called the Spirit in the credits, but actually more than a crazy scientist) still cries. And nothing he did was really related to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> For artistic merit, the film doesn't earn much more than 1/10. But for the courage involved to just express it, I give it a 3/10.
