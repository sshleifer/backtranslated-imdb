Hi! I am Sheena, an Afrikaner (but white!) Jungle Tribal who transforms the incredible ability to turn into the cheapest, most indifferent monster in the world (think 60's Star Trek strangers) by rolling into seductive mud! When I first found myself in this horrible position, I took the only logical action: I made myself a torn jungle bikini to do my bad deeds. I enjoy romance novels and tear the occasional unforeseen African warrior. And I would be referred if I didn't sidekick me (white of course). Cutter, an American former military man who fled to America after the divorce, fled. Can you say "one day alimony"? Anyway, he occasionally gives distractions from my difficult life. I mean, how much idiot blonde do you know is also an endangered species of flesh-rotating monster? In spite of my hardship (acting so hard!), I did not give up, and after much soul research I finally discovered my role in life: terrorizing psychic senators who are so sorry to not have cable or satellite.
