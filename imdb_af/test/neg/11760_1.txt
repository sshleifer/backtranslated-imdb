You can't really blame the movie maker for the glorification of Che, because the industry is all about money. Most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" are an absolute test produced by the Communist Cuban government after Che's death. Che was a day one killer. Here's a list of the great things Che did for Cuba. 1) Thousands of innocent Cuban men, women and children done to satisfy his desire for strength. <br /> <br /> 2) Destroy Cuba's economy and good reputation with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso was equal to the US dollar. Now it's basically worthless. <br /> <br /> 3) Continuously failed at all things related to diplomacy, economy and the army. He never did it in his first year in the Medical School, and he was just in one real fight in which he surrendered with a full-fledged rifle. <br /> <br /> 4) He took over the largest estate in Cuba to set up for himself. It has a yacht, a 60-home-American TV, a pool and ocean views. So much to avoid the materialistic lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Today, Cuba is a completely needy country, and you have no one except Che and the Castro brothers to thank it. If you go to Cuba today, you will not be allowed to leave the tourist areas. would find obstacles, beggars and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> If you think any of what I'm saying is untrue, you're going to study. Compare Cuban exports from 1950/60 to those of today, talk to people who survived or who had parents in the so-called Cuban "revolution" of the 1960s; read all the reports of murdered innocents; read the reports of people who served under Che and Castro and fled because of an evil, disgusting person. <br /> <br /> Please, please remember to read or view ALL objectively. Stop taking everything at face value and think about it.
