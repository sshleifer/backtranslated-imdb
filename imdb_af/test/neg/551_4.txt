In 1984, the Karate Kid had a little charm, even if it was no more than a poor man's Rocky. Unfortunately, producer Jerry Weintraub did not realize that it was best to leave the story at the point where it ended, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to make the film in a trilogy. change. Part III was the final layer in the franchise, but someone had to think the series still has a potential. What other explanation would be possible for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. Next? Yep, Macchio is gone (at least he was smart enough to end up eventually), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!). He plays an unhappy teenager (who is still?) Named Julie Pierce. Now the girl has family problems. She also gets into trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out, one of his students is actually a good guy, and Julie falls for him. It gets her in greater trouble than before, of course. Fortunately for her, she currently lives with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of her grandfather who knows how to get back to the bad guys. <br /> <br /> All the factors up to seven clich√©s, and it's just a generic plot summary - think what the detailed scenes should be! From start to finish, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. Swank, grateful, like Boys Do not Cry and Million Dollar Baby to deliver this disaster, but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first movie, and was quite nice in the pursuers, but has nothing for him to speak here - even the revival of the "wax on, wax off" doll is stillborn. As for Ironside, he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III, but it's hardly a stretch. <br /> <br /> So, is this picture really so terrible? Not quite. There are a series of strange beauties, but if the best role in the whole movie involves a group of Asian monks dancing while they are listening to pop music for the first time in their lives, it does not qualify as a recommendation to see the rest.
