I saw Bogard when it was released in the 70's. It was one of the photos that received an X rating for violence. We sniffed in our local gravel house and saw it anyway. Pretty good picture. Many blood fights out of the street, although the cheap sound effects for the bumps took away something. And lots of sex. I remember one of the early scenes when Bogard met this pretty brunette in an apartment she showed him. Without saying a word, he picked her up, put her in the windowsill and nails her. From what I remember, the picture swung down from that point. When I found out, Bogart was also called Black Fist and was available on VHS. I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist edited Bogard for television. So many of the scenes I remember were missing, I wondered if it was the same picture.
