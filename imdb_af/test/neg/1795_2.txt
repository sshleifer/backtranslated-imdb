Heart of Darkness, a short novel written by Joseph Conrad about greed, corruption, and traveling through Africa, was at least a boring reading. The narrator follows Marlow, a sailor who travels to the deep Africa to save Kurtz, anything from a wonderful ivory trader who supposedly got mad. This conclusion arose when the Ivory did not come into the main harbor anymore. The basis of the story is to write Conrad's beauty from the environment, making the scene wonderful, but possibly a bit too comprehensive. The story looked more like a watercolor painting, as attributed to the slow creeping soft action story that Conrad might want to work out. <br /> <br /> It sometimes happens that after reading a book, the attribute watched movie may help match some thoughts with those in the book, or vice versa. Not so with Heart of Darkness, even with the supporting role of masterpiece actor John Malkovich, the film just confused me, there were no real main characters in the movie, no one stood out to the other, not of the extensive symbolism was explained. It was rather dull and sad to say the least. <br /> <br /> In everything respecting the author, The heart of darkness is a truly short novel masterpiece, it touches on some very serious subjects, the lies of Marlow, and Kurtz's greed. It is not a book that is taken lightly and will put you in a rather gloomy mood. A book like this I feel can be difficult for many people. However, I would recommend this book to those who want a sad pseudo-action story without a happy textbook.
