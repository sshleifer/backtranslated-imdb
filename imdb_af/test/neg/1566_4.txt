GEORGE AND MILDRED was a spin of the mid-1970s sit-com MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE. Although I haven't seen the series since the last broadcast, I remember it's pretty amusing with most of the comedy that comes from the equal couple going to live next to the sneaky Fourmile family, a kind of LOVE THIS CITIZENS, without the cynical racist gags. <br /> <br /> Having seen this "big screen version of the show", I ask myself what a big screen version of? Certainly not from a popular mid-70's, come with the same name. For some reason, the film is left by the film by George and Mildred, where they are left behind and trapped in a plot that includes serious gangs who want George to pick up accidentally and lead to " Some situations and lines like: <br /> <br /> "He gave it to you" <br /> <br /> "No, this is the first time a man has resisted my charm. <br /> <br /> "I mean the envelope" <br /> <br /> You get the impression that author writer Dick Sharples (who never wrote an episode for the original sit-com has ever had) seen an episode of the source material and confused the show with the CARRY ON series of movies, in many ways it looks like the same mistakes of the latter LOST IN SPACE movie because it has absolutely nothing in common with the series it created
