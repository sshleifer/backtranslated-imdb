"Based on a joke ever told by Jim Wynorski ..." that's what I read at the end of the final credits. Well, Mr Wynorski should have a terrible sense of humor! This movie is terrible, really. I loved the first two chapters of The Slumber Party Massacre series; the third movie was rather useless, but totally viewable, compared to this piece of crap! There is not even a Driller Killer and the plot, the acting, the characters, the places, the events ... everything is boring, absurd and laughing. The only good reason to watch this turkey is the girls: if this movie was a porn, I think it would work much better! The movie also doesn't sound: the first scene (the one in the tent) can be more bloody and the scene with the headless guy knocking on the door takes one second! Some moments of slight excitement cannot save a non-existent plot. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only true actor here: I found him the only portable character in this movie! Oh, ... there's a nonsense with Brinke Stevens, who Linda performed in the first Slumber Party massacre: the police are bothering her to get to know more about the murderer; But what we get is just some footage of the first movie! Not a dialogue, not a monologue or any of these still traumatized adults, who are forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says) and give us no clues about the murderer! <Br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
