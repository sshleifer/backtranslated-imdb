I think it's an all-out horrible movie will be unfair, but it's pretty bad. The sub-Disney storyline entails that dogs play soccer and fall in love (okay, how cute!) The acting is not bad, but can certainly be better, especially that of young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who plays throughout the movie look. ashamed, as he doesn't even want to be there. Anyway, kids will love it, but parents beware!
