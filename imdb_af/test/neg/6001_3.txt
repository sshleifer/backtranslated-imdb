I usually like Jackie Chan movies, but this one was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 combat scenes that all meet more or less normal standards. The bad thing about this movie is it focuses heavily on cars racing / racing. The car hunt is not that bad (although not as exciting as fighting), but the car racing at the end is extremely boring. Actually, all this is a Jackie Chan movie making a Jackie Chan movie and everything except Jackie Chan. Even the traditional outings at the end don't have their usual humor. <br /> <br /> I suspect this has made things worse by getting one of those terrible versions. I usually try to see the caption version ... I wish I could understand Chinese. <br /> <br /> I just saw one Jackie movie, worse that this one and one of his early performances was in Hollywood movies that didn't turn out so well. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless really curious or a fan of motorsport.
