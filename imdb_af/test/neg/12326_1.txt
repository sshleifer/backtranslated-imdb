The only good thing about this infallible drink is that I don't have to pay it. I saw it for free at college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that's free, it's hopeless. Steel-working and poor jokes can't be masked by an excellent but confusing set design (it's going to market its way to Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers did in this movie, but I've never seen anything more depressed. It was nothing more than a blatant attempt to capitalize on the Grinch's previous success (which his opponents have, but I really enjoyed it). It is difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects have been transferred to fund it. <br /> <br /> Do you want a funny Seuss adjustment? Go with the Grinch.
