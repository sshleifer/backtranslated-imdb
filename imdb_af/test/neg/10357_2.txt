Some say this show was good in the early years! I disagree with everyone. The show is just silly and pathetic. My mother hates it, I hate it, my dad hates it, I don't know about my sister, but oh well. Here are some reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1. THE FEATURES: Babies used as adult style characters are stupid. The babies are just exaggerated and annoying. The adults and adults are stupid and unattractive. The worst character is that Angelica Pickles (she really works it for you on drums when you had a long, hard and unfortunate day at the office) and also Kimi Finster who later appeared; she is too optimistic and a pain in the buttocks. She can't decide where she is French or Japanese: it doesn't matter; you are an American citizen and that is it! Oh, what I'm talking about, all the characters from this show suck! <br /> <br /> 2. THE STORIES: The stories are original and stupid. It makes it like the babies go down on a big adventure, yes to the backyard barn. In one episode, leader Tommy Pickles climbed the leader into a television room and literally destroyed it. Don't give children any idea to clean up normal T.V station control rooms (they pay a lot of money for them in real life). I can imagine what the broadcasters of this episode should feel, they will probably start staring at their machines throughout the day fearing a baby will break into it. Sad! <br /> <br /> 3. AGREEMENT !: The show has been going on for years and people are still making stories and new series and spin-offs for this. Get Off! The Simpsons are for almost the same time as this, but they are much better and harder than babies. The show is simply about the graded! People, where is your common sense! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was surprised. T.V Stations around the world want to air this series even today. The show was completely messed up and never had to be produced. The two movies for these cartoons just suck the same! 10/02
