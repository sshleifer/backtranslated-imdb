The basic story idea of ​​ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent - two very unhappy women meet and decide to fund their money to rent an Italian villa for a month. To cover costs further, they get two other strangers to come together. What makes this interesting is the relationships both before and during this holiday - especially how this beautiful environment really changes their outlook. Unfortunately, this good idea is completely spoiled by two major performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the movie. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a way that makes her look ridiculous. Her "do-eyed" expression and vacant stars make you wonder if it's not a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot! And to make it even worse, Reginald Owen plays a character so zealous and bombastic that I was very close to eliminating the movie - he was so terrific and incredible. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10 - it's very, very hard to understand. Certainly, the movie has a good atmosphere and a good plot, but these two sly thin appearances cannot be overlooked as it undermines the rest of the picture. Sorry, but this movie was hurt for a repeat!
