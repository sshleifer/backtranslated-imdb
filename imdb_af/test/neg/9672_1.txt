Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and / or annoying as a Billy Mays infomercial, I had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be educated on criminal charges for smuggling this scripture in public space. The actors must be charged as accomplices. They serve no less than a lifetime away from the public eye. <br /> <br /> This production offers the indemnity, "For dramatic effect, we have taken a poetic license with certain facts" or such an insufficient statement to fully interfere with the absolute contradictory rewriting of a Bible story that no longer needs drama. What they added was enough to make your IQ. <br /> <br /> The "poetic license" taken finds characters so bizarre, you will recognize nothing but the names of a few, and of course the ark. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Noah and Lot both live in Sodom, so maybe Abram went on holiday in Switzerland. Lot's wife, played by Carol Kane, is a harp, and when she goes to a salt pillar, Lot breaks her finger and carries it in what appears to be an empty baby food. If it's 'poetic', I'm a kumquat. <br /> <br /> When Noah - now drinking wine in quantities that can help drive the ark - wakes up over the hard work of the building project, he wakes up one morning to find out that God is enough Pre-made wood to ease its load. At least I think it was God. It looks like a delivery of 84 Lumber, neatly stacked and bundled. Perhaps 84 Lumber is really an agent for God ????? Rather than carrying you with the cargo being loaded, I'll seduce you with the pirate attack on the ark. Uncompromising, do you think? This movie is filled with such offensive nonsense. After an unprecedented time on the water, Noah boasts a pirate ship that is right for them. And who is the salt ruler? Well, that's, it's Lot, of course! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not on board. If you hit a plot line, it stores everything. The piracy attempt was unsuccessful, and the swashbuckling was pathetic, not poetic. I think it was about this point that my nausea prevented me from punishing me any more. <br /> <br /> An ugly, senseless, moronic distortion of anything that looks like a Bible account. On a scale of 1 - 10, this film is premeditated mind abuse. Mute and insulting, you will be more entertained by reading the Golden Pages.
