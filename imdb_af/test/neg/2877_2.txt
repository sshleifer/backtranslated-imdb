The basic plot of 'Marigold' boasts a romantic comedy in which the film industry is backed up. An American actress Marigold, played by Ali Carter stuck in India. Worse still, she's out of money. She then decides to play a small role in a music music in Bollywood so that she can earn enough money to return to her nation. Here she gets to meet Indian choreographer Prem, played by Salman Khan. Basically, the movie fails on the script level. Just by calling a movie, a Hollywood business does not guarantee quality cinema. Marigold stands out as the best example. The art is poor and outdated. Music, Marigold seems to be a dud. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's is by far not recognized as a decent audience. Acting, Salman delivers his most amateur performances to date. Ali Larter is good and has great screen presence. Also wise, she is good. <br /> <br /> One can also find good reviews on this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310
