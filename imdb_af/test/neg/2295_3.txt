This Swedish squatter movie tries to parade / imitate American horror movies such as "The Evil Dead", "Gremlins" and others. Author / director / actor / film maker Anders Jacobsson and author / producer / actor / makeup effects supervisor Göran Lundström (did I miss something?) Was of course inspired by Sam Raimi. But the camera work is a bad copy of what can be seen in "The Evil Dead" and elsewhere. Some other users wrote that they enjoyed the humor of this movie, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> The movie rather disturbed than my entertainment. It was trying to combine tension and comedy and the final product left me with a sense of oppression, but it wasn't terrifying or shocking. The combination of different genre elements made this movie very strange. I was never sure if it was meant to be scary or funny. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inventive, except for the revelation at the hospital, but I didn't like the way it was staged for the reasons mentioned above. . The gore and makeup effects are pretty good and at least the "Loose Limbs" ranges were quite entertaining, because in these scenes the filmmakers didn't try to interfere with horrors and jokes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a strange movie that you will hate or love. Rest in pieces, Bose Ed. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10 (let me hold on to US productions)
