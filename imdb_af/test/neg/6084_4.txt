It's a pity that quality actors like Baldwin and Booth have to keep silent for lousy stories and scripts just for the money. But, it's a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> It's just another of a long line of assassins who use all the usual narrative twists to try and make it more attractive than what is. Certainly, it has some nice places, it's a smooth production, there's some good camera work and editing, and it's pretty good, overall. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem? Quite simply, the whole premise is just totally incredible. Instead of spoiling a rotten story for you, I'll let you know what it's about, that is, if you can get it. I succeeded, but just because I love Baldwin and I keep hoping it will be better. <br /> <br /> It didn't. And it had one of the most anti-climatic endings I have ever seen. In fact, maybe never ... <br /> <br /> But it is harmless fun, I think, if you have nothing better to do.
