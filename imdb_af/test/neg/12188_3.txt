Did anyone else notice that this version is basically a play-by-scene recognition of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes taken out? It makes me think less of a movie it does, which shows a definite will of creativity. In all fairness, I tend to be a proponent of Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the movie looks like movie-like plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and sweet, though a little uncomfortable in presentation and transition, and then this version blocked the script, the music and even a fair amount of the scene from the previous version. I don't understand the point of making the movie again, if the method of recalling it is to basically repeat George Cukor's movie with everything that is the same as the people working on it.
