This movie is not like City of God, you can get the same feeling, but it is not, there is no intense shooting or intense drug centers, you get the idea. If you ask me, I think this movie is a waste of time, there are many other movies that give 100 times better meaning and teaching than "Wood Camera". Yes, I may be the only one who gives a negative comment to this movie, but it is in my opinion. This is one of those films where I can feel that I will be blown away, but when the credits start rolling, my friends and I all got mutual looks, and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was. To settle this matter, I advise not to look. <br /> <br /> Personal note - To speak Africans English was a big mistake. In the city of God they used their mother tongue which gave the film much more power and reality.
