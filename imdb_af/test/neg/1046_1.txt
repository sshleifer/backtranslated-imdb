"Five characters in search of an exit" should be one of the most boring "zones" ever made. It was on Sci-Fi this morning, and as usual I changed the channel. I put it in my Top Five list of the worst "zones" ever made. Pale and predictable, and not worth watching. Serling threw this theme to death (Earth dwellers in the hands of strangers, who were often giants), and in this particular version it just doesn't work. Anyone who hasn't seen it will find out quickly. This is another Serbian philosophical mood, perhaps with the plight of those in the prisoner of war or concentration camps, where the prisoners lose interest in finding out where they are or what they are fighting in prisons. William Windom, who is the last to fall in, is the only one who is curious to make the effort, and it does not take long to determine the outcome.
