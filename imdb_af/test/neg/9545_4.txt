Am I the only person who thinks the entire Forensic and Scenes of the Crime Community in the US must deny this almighty slap in their faces. A new policeman is the first to go to a crime scene where her backup is so slow to respond that she has time to send the child who got the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time he returns (still no senior police, SOCOs or other help for the beautiful Jolie - it's New York isn't it?) It started raining and she was getting work to photograph the evidence only after she stood in front of an Amtrak to disturb the scene. <br /> <br /> I want to know the name of the camera, as the photos were so incredibly detailed that there wasn't so much zoom in! The horror goes on: - Not in the movie itself (I'm pretty scared, but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr. Washington. This man is a highly committed forensic crime scene investigator with years of experience who, instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene investigators, transfers work to an untrained police officer, a vegetable club, who continues to find clear clues and move them before they photograph and thereby pollute every item and make DNA profiling very impossible. Now it was a shining idea, eh? I know that one can suspend unbelief to some extent, but those who say this movie is intelligent had to fully utilize their thinking skills to find this film credible. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4. / 10 for the wonderful play by Denzel Washington and for me. Jolie's lips are the only items that suspend my unbelief!
