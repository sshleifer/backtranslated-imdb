I just saw this film on the fact that it was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and while I was happy, I saw it because it is now another Video Nasty. On his own merits, Andy Milligan's film is really not worth it. Of course there are far worse movies on the notorious list; but it doesn't hurt to see this one easier. Of course, the film was shot at a very low budget, and it translated into writing. like Bloodritters is working on an idea that is often seen in horror theaters, and does nothing else. Basically, the plot centers on three couples who find themselves at a house awaiting the results of a will. It's not long before they get started ... blah blah blah. For most of the film nothing happens; And when we finally come to the scene that justifies the movie, it's so amateurish and stupid that it's impossible to take seriously at any level. It's a very good thing that this movie doesn't have a very long running time, as it could otherwise be used as a particularly unpleasant method of torture. It all comes down to an appropriate boring end, which also manages to be an eternal episode. Apparently, this movie is still banned here in the UK; but somehow I doubt it is because of its shock value. Basically, Blood Rites is not worth seeing and I personally see no reason to recommend it. Unless you made it your business to see everything on the Video Nasty list ...
