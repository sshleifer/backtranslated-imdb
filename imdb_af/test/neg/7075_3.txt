I saw this movie and I love horror movies. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what to expect, but as soon as the movie was on its way, it was nice to see it. The idea was pretty original and the acting was nice. Especially Jenna Dewan as the exciting / evil Tamara. <br /> <br /> The hardest thing about horror movies is to make a good end. But the movie failed. For a change, an end scene in a hospital, where all employees are gone. First, do you see doctors and nurses running around, but then they all went home? <br /> <br /> No crying for help while being driven by Tamara, escaping to the roof (also a smart move ... not) and off course, some kind of open end. <br /> <br /> No .... the movie has grown, the bulk of it was nice to watch, but they really ended up with all the clicks of bad horror movies. Jeffrey Reddick failed with this movie in my eyes, after making some really good movies like Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you have a good horror full of clich√© finals, Tamara is a good movie to watch. For me, I like movies that surprise me.
