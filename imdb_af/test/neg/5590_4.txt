STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring) are a few in Budapest , about business relationships and staying at a luxury hotel. One evening they met an attractive woman at a nightclub and invited her back to their place, where they ended up in a threesome. Even if it is good, until David gets a few negatives in the post, and he and Tish are eventually suspended. But when some of the people involved in the deception are murdered, things get messy and they are forced to enter the seedy underground world of pornography and hardcore slavery to find the key to everything. <br /> <br /> While the original film dealt with the concept of sniffing movies, this straight to DVD sequel is the healthiest (!) theme of triangles and messy sex. It plays like a porn movie, a cheap piece of titanium with very hot T / A action. If it sounds like your idea of ​​a good movie, you will probably like it, but you'll probably be more at home in a porn shop than a video store. <br /> <br /> It is trying to copy the original copy. film's dark and voyeuristic feel, but although this is a pretty good job of this, it still can't hold the original. It has an apathetic story, with a dodgy story flow. And compared to Kage, Schaech comes across as a crucible. <br /> <br /> Better than I thought it would be, I think, and better than your average one of those DVD direct successors that apparently comes out. many days, but really, have we not seen enough? **
