This movie surprised me. I couldn't succeed. Think I can miss something. Please see that most of you agree with me. This is not always the case (see my recent review of RE: Erasure). <br /> <br /> To explain the mistakes of this movie, a glorious loss of time ... will be. .. <br /> <br /> They are dressed like cowboys, but it's modern time, right? No? I don't get it? When I picked up the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL! So it was presented. Haven't seen it yet. Hope they did a good job. <br /> <br /> They didn't! They tried to create an iconic character that would grow a series. They didn't. <br /> <br /> They were trying to make an Aussie indie zombie movie on the caliber (and maybe on the foxes) of the very well done "UNDEAD". They didn't. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe they just wanted to make a confusing, unpleasant, mess of movie salad that could eventually be edited. They didn't! This is the new number 2 on my list of the worst zombie movies ever. There are actually only the two so far, "DAY OF DEATH: CONTAGIUM" is the first (not confused with "DAY OF DEATH", which is one of my favorite zombie films of all time). If you're going to make a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie movie maker, I'm just an expert) make a good one. Escape from the living dead is a good example of decent recent zombie films. FYI. <br /> <br /> If you are truly forgiving, do you think they didn't at least throw something in to make us feel like we didn't want our money back? Guess what ... they didn't!
