Well, this movie wasn't as terrible as I thought it would be. I expected to give it one star. I chose to give it three. Why? Well, for a cheese-like horror / sci-fi movie, it's not that bad. Probably the characters are tough (as they act - including a young Leonardo DiCaprio), the effects that look cheap, and the monsters ... let's just say I've seen even more effective Halloween costumes in Elementary Schools ... But there was something about this movie that showed me to the end. A little humor helped a little. And if you ever wanted to see an alien fitting gas, this movie will make your dream live. 10/03
