It's definitely one of the worst of the series of Carry On movies. It doesn't have the usual fun and brilliance and even the film looks embarrassed by the poor dialogue. By the time it came out, the series was in terminal decline and the boy showed it! If you come fresh in this range, avoid this one near the end.
