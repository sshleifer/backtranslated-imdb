First, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It can show you, but it's not bad in a good way. It is boring, unreliable, poorly shot, ridiculously written and lacking in cool disasters. <br /> <br /> Worse, it is totally patriotic without a trace of irony or fun, moving in the sense of Japanese uniqueness and victims. Everyone leaves the Japanese in their hour of need. Especially the Koreans. The most noble characters choose seppaku - go down with their ship as their beloved island sink. "Only Japanese will think this way," said the prime minister. <br /> <br /> If this movie in any way reflects the Japanese opinion of their place in the worldview, the first thing they do to fix the problem should stop making movies like this.
