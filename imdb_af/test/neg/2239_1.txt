Little Quentin seems to master the art of eating and eating the cake. <br /> <br /> As usual, the pure sadistic display can be explained as a cleverly thought-provoking way to return violence to the audience's face. <br /> <br /> Sure, Mr. Tarantino. Violence is Baaad. Sadism is Baaad. It is worth it to load it in to make it. How very brilliant. <br /> <br /> However, the youthful part of the audience cannot be clever enough to follow all the clever references to higher levels of consciousness, but I am confident that they will one day see the light. . <br /> <br /> Thank you for making this small world a little better. You deserve a medal.
