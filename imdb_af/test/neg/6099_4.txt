The Three Stooges is probably the largest comedy team in film history. For that reason alone, they deserve a much better end in Columbia than they received with this brief. <br /> <br /> "Sappy Bullfighters" are just not good. Granted, it's not all Joe Besser's fault. Personally, I feel that some of his pants are fun enough, simply because of the departure of the Stooges' usual fanfare that they contain, and the fact that Larry is sometimes displayed more. However, this short will not. And the fact that one knows that this is their last card ever showed, it just adds to the overall dislike. <br /> <br /> This film only highlights how short subjects were on their last dying breath during this time and how little effort they made to make. This short is so sloppy. It's a simple repetition of a curly short, "What's the Matador?", Filmed earlier. As if this fact was not bad enough, the studio actually caught up with the original of Moe and Larry (who was filmed nearly 20 years earlier). Are these things not obvious? Laughable or sad? You're the judge. <br /> <br /> Another part of this brief that makes it unhappy is the fact that it is basically a Joe Besser showcase. He shows that everything he is (at least in this movie) is a curly-will-be-totally-wrong! Tired and Larry has little to do in this brief. As a Larry fan, I also have to say that I feel a bit shameful about using Besser to use the joke Larry made popular in the short "Ants In The Pantry". To see Besser say, "I can't see, I can't see!" and Larry has the simple "Why can't you see?" while Besser gets to stop "I closed my eyes" is just wrong at all levels. <br /> <br /> The two brave soldiers who stuck It is for all those years, Howard and Fine, so little to do in this brief. There is almost no funny bit with them. The only thing that qualifies is that Larry hides under the bed of a jealous man and tries to be "Pepe", his dog. <br /> <br /> One cannot blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe give it all to them. No matter how ridiculous things can get (and I'm sure they had their opinions at this point in their careers). Howard and Fine never gave anything less than their best. Their efforts are not apparent from 1934-1959. <br /> <br /> I often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss horribly. I'm all for their more "experimental", unusual shorts. At least it contains new ideas. But this short, I think everyone can agree, is just not good. <br /> <br /> Thanks TV later discovered the boys after the shorts department was closed. If they were forced to go out this way, it would have been a great injustice for all the years they invested in making audiences laugh.
