It's great to see if you wake up at 02:00 and turn on the telly. I didn't know they showed such movies. I immediately thought of Roger Corman, who reused movie venues or used other movie venues for his own movies. <br /> <br /> Making this movie can only move the corners of the camera and take some time and they will have a XXX movie. <br /> <br /> There was no story, just a minimum dialogue that led to poaching and sex. I bet there were not 100 words in the whole movie, but there were probably very big breasts and hot lesbian action. There was also male / female action, but it was only about 25% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing came to mind when looking at this movie that might interest those who buy hip def DVDs. Sony refused to license Betamax for adult filmmakers and adult movies came out on VHS. You can guess what happened to beta clash, as the adult movie industry makes millions of videos. Sony has once again refused to license Blu-ray for the adult movie industry and has just signed an agreement with Toshiba. You can guess which high def system will disappear.
