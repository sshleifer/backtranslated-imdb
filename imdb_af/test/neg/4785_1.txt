My Name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Overview: ...... Because I saw it. <br /> <br /> This is something else. First, how is it rated so high? I can't understand it. This show is filled with either annoying people, stupid people, or unlikely. The "gags" are ominous. <br /> <br /> I saw one episode where Earl's brother's wife wrapped and washed with dead fish. Not joking. It wasn't funny, it's repulsive. Then she and Earl's very stupid brother (and I mean stupid) then had sex. I almost threw up. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the most desperate attempts of comedy in a long time. Jason Lee is a talented actor, but is trapped in a helpless role in this terrible "comedy". <br /> <br /> Earl is now in jail for the current season. Let's hope he gets the chair, just like this show is out of his misery. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: This show will be funny to people who think Larry is funny. To the rest of the world, NOT a chance. Avoid like the pest.
