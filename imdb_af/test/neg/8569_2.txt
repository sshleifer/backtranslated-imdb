I didn't buy it, I didn't rent it, it was on PPV and someone burned a copy of it and loaned it to me, so at least I didn't waste any money on it. For someone who's darkness, the nameless, devil's backbone, it's a nice lame film. Seems to do something with a lot of girls who were at a monastery in the day and now they are all big and are being persecuted one by one and killed by a nun coming out of the kitchen sink, the toilet, and driving even the revolving doors in a hotel. And what makes this nun so mean and nasty? And it is so boring that it somehow stays about halfway, I just stopped, hid it and looked at something else. Wasn't even interested in finding out, really. Oh yeah, there are some lovely young ladies to look at, but hey, are two of them lesbians? I think there is a picture on the bedside table of a young woman's bedroom and what self-respecting horror movie would not be complete all day without a lesbian couple? Yes, whatever. 2 out of 10, if you want to see a valuable non-horror movie, try "Desecration", "Dead Waters" or "The Convent" (and this is the one with Adrienne Barbeau, by the way, not the one with John Malkovich) .
