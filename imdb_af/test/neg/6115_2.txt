These writers are trying to re-create the characters they have on "scrubs" in another, but the characters they have captured have no charism or acting ability to speak. It looks weak and effortless. These guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing wasn't so disgusting, leaving the show just lifelong to be two handsome teachers, who hardly keep it alive. The humor in this show seems to be trying to guide an audience with an IQ. of 40 or below. Another reason why this show is a failure may be that the show on the show "scrubs" is excellent and this show has to follow to leave the viewer in a strange position without knowing whether he should cry or just lose hope in new sitcoms all together. It's just my opinion, but I think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves than they already have.
