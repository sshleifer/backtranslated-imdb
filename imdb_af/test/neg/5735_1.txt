sdiner82 has seen the movie in decades, and its memory is terrible. His attempts to paint the Mark Lester shearing scene as a suspect are completely flawed, just as his wrong commentary on the bad man, "creeping chicks with the child's body." Lester is dressed all the time the man is in the room, and the man barely gives him a look. <br /> <br /> The scene is a rough attempt to show Lester's innocent curiosity about the man's body. <Br /> <br /> Like everything in this movie, it's done badly, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Even sdiner82's commentary on Savalas's character who "casually sent a German family to their death by their trailer from a rock" is nonsense (it was a single woman, she was already dead and she was in a car). <br /> <br /> I suggest that sdiner82's review says much more about its own, far from the liberal mindset, than it does about this worthy movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I even made it difficult to look for it was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after Kojak. <br /> <br /> The movie is a worthless piece of 70's trash, but sdiner82's review is the worst kind of blasphemy. He breaks his review into pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that he is immediately wrong at virtually every "factual" issue he discusses. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he looked, which is disturbing. Now he can return to burning copies of Vanger in the Rog.
