One of the most notorious of the banned "Video Nasties" of the 1980s is also one of the most over-rated. "Slow down" is about what you expect from a Umberto Lenzi-directed jungle boiler, inventive (but poor) indigenous torture techniques, a ridiculous "social commentary" (yes, even cleaner than the "canonical holocaust"). , and many guts are chewed. However, the film's explosive violence is often only briefly displayed and never lived for a long time, reducing its effect (interpreting it). The dialogue is Lenzi's usual folly, as our male heroes show their love for women by calling them "tw @ t" and so on. The company of famous faces (including Lorraine De Selle, Giovanni Lombardo Radice, Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) are doing their best in the face of the escalating idiot (including a completely ridiculous "castration custody"), but cannot overwork, common attempt.
