35 years after it's made, Castro still rules. Unfortunately, we shoot our head and wonder how the dull mania played by the cold Jack Palance made it to 1960. I recently stumbled upon this and was amused by the rebels' unmatched Sid Haig and "B" movie favorite Paul (Untouchables). Fleischer was clearly past his prime as he directed this folly. Some of the lines are classic in a "Did he really say so?" The other thing I just noticed is that the score and the sound (NOT the dialogue) are actually excellent - the only first-level elements of the whole production. So don't watch how to learn about history or acting, but if you like to see it as a shit, bring the beer and enjoy it.
