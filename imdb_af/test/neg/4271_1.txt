total crap. <br /> <br /> I was so excited to see this as it was the only movie version I saw from Mansfield Park. I suffered from the first four episodes, but when it came to the proposal scene between Henry and Fanny, I broke and had to switch it off. Whoever uses this Sylvestra Le Touzel woman must be blind and deaf because the woman is the worst actress I've ever seen in my life. The whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. I do not know. I just don't know why people who write Jane Austen screenwriters are unable to give her the respect they deserve.
