ALL GREEN UP is basically a twist and not much else. The original Nickalodeon RUGRATS cartoon featured the babies Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Lil and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Susie and Kimi (Chuckie's sister) and Dill (Tommy's brother). ). I grew up with RUGRATS and thought it was a great cartoon. It has excellent humor, good stories and the shoulders' creators, Klasky & Csupo, were, of course, very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies. The new show ALL GROWN UP tries to regain the magic of the original cartoon. I was disappointed when I saw it. I just found the all-grown Chuckie annoying and the whole "pre-acting-mature / trying-to-popular" applied to (alas) * all * of the characters dull and washed out. There are still some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting how artists would make the whole baby look like RUGRATS, ten years of age in their original show. Overall, this show is "fair" and only viewable if a) you are a hard fan of the RUGRATS, b) never seen the original show; c) you are a front desk who has nothing to do, or d) you are so bored that you somehow forced to see this show. This show is not that good. It doesn't compare to the older RUGRATS episodes in quality, humor and everything else.
