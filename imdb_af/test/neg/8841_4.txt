Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only general point: the small washing-up town of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange movie as it has a main character (the movie spends about 20 minutes on each story) except the city of Obaba. Any story is very well explained and the fact is that it is very boring. This was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but it doesn't say too much. The only good thing about the movie is the precious scenarios. It's filmed in a very precious valley and it's better to spend time looking at the scenario rather than being aware of the story.
