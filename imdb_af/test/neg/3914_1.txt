Okay, <br /> <br /> I realize there are a few Thomas's out there. I was one of them ... but then I saw this masterpiece of celluloid. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that the scene in which George Wendt is sucked out of space by the spaceship, trembles. I sometimes sit bolt upright in my bed and scream like an old man at a proctologist's table and think about it. If the director reads this ... I would pay to be an extra in the successor.
