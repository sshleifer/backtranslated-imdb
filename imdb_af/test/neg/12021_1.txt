Everyone has their choice for the worst movie they have ever seen. Some like to choose Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some choose classic like Plan 9 from outer space. Since I was 14, I have often said that this is my Problem Child 2, and 9 years later I feel exactly the same. Not one of the worst, it's not just an expression. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> How much fart, pooping, peeing and puking can you put into a single movie? I don't need to see a dog who gets a dump that comes to my waist! Why is it so difficult for my filth? I have nothing against the bathroom or a brutal humor. Heck, I love the American Pie movies. It's a bad idea to have so much of it within 90 minutes, but the right point is to do it with kids! To name small children, name each other sexual names (IMDb won't even let me put the word here, but here it comes from the mouth of 8-year-olds. Think of the irony in it!) And blow on everyone else just make the whole thing softer. The worst rule in the movie: "I think I have to jump into more people's offices." <br /> <br /> What other movie has: urination in lemonade, dynamite sticks exploding toilets, a little boy who filmed his babies and projecting sex on the side of the house, and a little girl scratching test? <br /> <br /> My absolute favorite moment must be when the same girl is on a carnival, say, "I'm going to break," open her mouth, and false cans look straight from her open mouth into a perfect 90 degree angle! The puking scene in Scary Movie 2 looks more real than that. <br /> <br /> I think the only redeeming element in the movie is Gilbert Gottfried. You get the impression that he didn't even have a writing, but was just his usual self. He must act stupidly while throwing pizza at him. <br /> <br /> You know what? Think of the movie so much just let me go. Goodbye!
