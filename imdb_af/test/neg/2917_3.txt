This lame Harold Lloyd sound film has no laughter in it, and one wonders if this Lloyd is even the same that made all the beautiful and hilarious silence. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's boy equivalence becomes soft and slack when we can hear him speak, and a slow, steady pace replaces the zany antics of his silence. Lloyd plays a young boy from a missionary who is growing up in China and finds himself transferred to contemporary New York City without an idea of ​​how life is outside his Chinese village. He finds himself as an unlikely winner in a mayoral election and soon draws the seriousness of all governmental organizations as he refuses to face the other side of disastrous corruption. When attempting to bring him down, he decides to play as dirty as everyone else, and a fake execution of every scammer in NYC as a frightening tactic. This dark satirical end doesn't just feel differently in the movie, but it's the only part of the movie that comes to life. All the others are a dull drill. <br /> <br /> I don't like to admit that a Harold Lloyd movie fails because I love him so much, but I don't have a choice with this one. <br /> Degree: D
