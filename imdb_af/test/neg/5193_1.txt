While the movie has a decaying feature, some striking shots, e.g. the lap of the sheep hanging from the tree, the scene of the funeral march on the raft or the scene of the boats leaving the village (influenced by the scene when the warships were closer in the fantastic "Fellini Satyricon") more photographic than cinematographic and would have been better appreciated on a wall hung in an art gallery, but embedded in a painfully slow film that came in at a brilliant 162 minutes and suffered from terrible dialogue, extremely poor character development, acting, uninspired symbolism and heavy styling. This is the first film I've seen at Angelopoulos, and his reputation has preceded him. I expected much better, but can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I'm not going to go out of my way to look at any of the directors' other work in the future. The four friends I will see agree.
