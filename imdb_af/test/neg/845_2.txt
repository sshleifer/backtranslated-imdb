In 4 words, Captain Corelli's Mandolin was "totally out of harmony" with the book. The novel provides sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges that characters need to overcome; the writing author chose to ignore the details. If they ignore them (eg the priest's role initially as a buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, the fianc√©'s inability to read until he is taught by a socialist rebel, advise the bomb experts on Corelli and his ultimate irony, the story and characters fall flat. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I've ever run between mid-year. Interesting cinematography, big actors don't make a movie; do the story.
