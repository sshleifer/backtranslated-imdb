my friends and I watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. Anyway, this was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Initially it was acceptable. It was a BAD IMPROV but it was beautifully hilarious, despite the fact that the screens were too long and exhausted and the terrible quality (I read the $ 400 budget above ... sounds right) of the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem came from the lack of writing; With a background in improv, I know how difficult it can be to keep scenes short and effective. What happened in this movie was that the actors had to improvise the plays and they didn't know when to stop. They only worked on stupid subjects forever. I initially thought it was because the movie was short and they needed long, useless scenes to flesh it out. As the film progresses, I realize it's just a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> There were many parts where I could see that the filmmaker had a very good idea for a shot, but not the resources (or talent!?) to pull it out effectively. Many of the screens have been taken from a single shot (because you know, improv) for what felt like a very long time. so boring! If you can stand to stop and an hour and a half from the terrible improvement, watch it. It's really funny on parts, but also really stupid and annoying. the acting varies from alright to absolutely terrible. The only good parts seem to be the parts that have nothing to do with the main chart; the ballerous child who swore a lot, the barber shop, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Yes. painfully bad. Like I was literally hurt. After an hour or so my friends and I just got bored and walked away.
