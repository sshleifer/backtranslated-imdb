I just have to say that this was the third worst movie I've ever seen after the assassination of the killing tomato's 3 and star ship troops. in the walls. It was the terrible play. No wonder I have never seen these actors before they all probably slept with the director (s). I think I'm nice to this movie, but that's just because I'm tired of screaming at the movie (just seen). My advice is to buy as many DVDs from this movie as you possibly can and burn them so that no one can ever see this terrible waste of time, money and movie.
