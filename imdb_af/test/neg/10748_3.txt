There are places for political commentary in film, but "Masters of Horror" is not one of them. I get enough of these things from Newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. Now I have to see it in horror movies? C'mon! All I wanted was a good zombie schlock movie, not another Bush! rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his politics, allow him Air America. And if you have to insist on making a "message" movie, be a little more clever about it. It had all the insinuation to be slapped with a dead fish. <br /> <br /> By the way, Joe, do you really want the left vocal block associated with brain-dead zombies? Maybe you want to think about it before you make another political horror movie (God help us).
