I must confess right away that I have not watched this whole movie. I missed the first hour during an exchange of Sci Fi channel. Or was I spared the first hour? The other judges pick this one up nicely. It was pregnant. Poorly written. Poorly acted. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The whole movie, which appears to be baptized, sounded like it was done in someone's garage. There was an adult echo of the words that just served to hang the bad dialogue. And hang. And hang. Even a TV movie has to admit it. <br /> <br /> And the idea that alternative dimensions are differentiated by color saturation, retired in the 1980s.
