It's the worst movie I've seen so far. 85 minutes of overall bad acting (half of the cast looks like Asperger's syndrome), horrific wigs, weird make-up (including wedge-area triangles) and more sacred than you sanctify characters than your dialogue that drops you. One comic aspect of this movie, if you have the patience to see it, is the sheer number of costume changes that occur to the unfortunate movie from scene to scene. Was this movie supported by a catalog maker of desperate dodgy pastel clothes? Was the throw in clothes paid for their efforts? They certainly didn't deserve to pay with anything else! This frightening attempt by a film produces a looting plot in the first half and blends into an equally confused arch of Christian Bible in the latter. The entire casting and production team must be burned at least, or at least crucified!
