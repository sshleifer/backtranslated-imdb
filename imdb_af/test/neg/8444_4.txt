Obviously this is not the "Piranha" directed by Joe Dante and manufactured by Roger Corman. It was not so obvious that I bought the DVD for only $ 2.95, as the DVD cover art matches that of the Corman comedy / horror "Piranha", even the DVD menu halfway through this stranger. watching movie, my girlfriend and I started thinking, where is the piranhas? After the movie reached the climax, we realized we had to see the wrong movie, as we saw the trailer, which had completely different footage. The blurb on the back of the DVD did not match the story we watched and the credits actors, producers, directors) were also completely different. Instead, we have a few jungle melodramas about a girl and two guys looking for diamonds and eventually confronting an evil animal hunter. This easy-to-use exploitation thriller is boring and useless and is just slightly amusing for old school, camp value. Strange that a DVD can be made with the wrong movie, but I think it's an easy mistake to see if they are both B-rated movies in the 70's. Read other posts made on this movie, I noticed that I'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the DVD. How can this be an INTERNATIONAL mistake? Is there a kind of DVD phenomenon where unsuccessful movies are trying to gain recognition by being placed on the wrong DVDs? WHAT IS HAPPENING???
