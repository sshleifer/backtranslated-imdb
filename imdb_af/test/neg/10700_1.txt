This is a horrible Norris movie, featuring one of the most annoying appearances ever performed in Calvin Levels and a poor writing. The characters were horrible, and it hardly had any action, and even Chuck Norris stinked in it! Christopher Neame is very poor as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting, and Norris was bored with the whole thing and I don't owe him as I was. Calvin levels give one of the most boring performances in a movie ever, I couldn't stand, because I was tempted to rip the tape out of my video recorder, plus Norris and Levels had no chemistry together! . If you are looking for some good Norris art, it won't be close, but if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, it doesn't look like an action and a bad play! It's a horrible Norris movie, with one of the most annoying acts ever coming from Calvin levels. Avoid it like the plague! The direction is incredibly bad. Aaron Norris does an amazingly bad job here, with no excitement or excitement, mere camera work and keeping the movie in a dull pass! There is some blood and violence. We get 2 gory impaling's, ripped out heart, explosive body and some gunshot wounds. The Acting is really bad. Chuck Norris is not AMAZING as he usually is here and looks very bored here, his one linen is flat and his play wasn't so good and I'm a big Norris Fan, it's his absolute worst! (Norris still rules!). Calvin Levels is indifferently annoying here, his shiny wimpy performance has shaved me a lot, I hoped he would get it right! Christopher Neame is pretty weak as the main villain, his voice was cool, but he had a lot of time! Sheree J. Wilson is beautiful and has done well with what she had to do. The rest of the role is terrible. Overall, please avoid this, it is not worth the torture, even if you are a big Norris fan (like me). BOMB out of 5
