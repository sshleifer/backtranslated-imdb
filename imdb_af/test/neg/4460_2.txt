Alan Gibson, British television veteran, "Dracula A.D. 1972", qualifies as one of the least appetizing entries in the Hammer Studios series on Bram Stoker's immortal blood sugar. In fact, it represents the first time since Terence Fisher's memorable "Horror of Dracula" (1958) that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing fought each other as mortal enemies. A few years later, they would represent the same roles in the last Hammer Dracula: "The Satanic Rites of Dracula." Furthermore, it was the second to last Dracula for Hammer in which Lee acted as the notorious catch. For the record, "Dracula A.D. 1972" was the seventh Hammer Dracula. <br /> <br /> The exciting prologue of 1872 prepares you for something other than the rest of this disappointing horror trick. Everlasting rivals Count Dracula and his nemesis Professor Lawrence Van Helsing is literally at each other's throat at a runaway in London's Hyde Park for a powerful opening scene that seems to be anti-climactic. The cars fall down and Dracula comes to half a wooden wheel, with its broken spokes embedded in its chest. Of course, Christopher Lee must catch this broken wheel against his body, but the images are striking enough to pass his monster. The count decays and also his opponent Van Helsing. But one of Dracula's disciples sobbed the count's ring and kicked some of the vampire's ashes into a safe for safe keeping. <br /> <br /> Don Houghton's script made the action for the hundred years running to turn London into 1972. meets a smart young man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame of "No Blade of Grass"), who likes to raise hell with a group of hippies who collapse parties and run British police with their fianc√©. Alucard is the descendant of one of Dracula's servants. Now Alucard has the spade's ring and a vial of his dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses the face of a displaced church to arrange a black mass. He invites his trendy friends, including Laura (super sexy Carolina Munro from "The Spy Who Loved Me"), Gayner (Marsha Hunt) and Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) to attend this black mass because it offers them something different. Not surprisingly, they raised the spade and the evil blood sugar lit his eyes on Jessica. Meanwhile, after Laura's body is uncovered, blood relatives, Scotland Yard Inspector Murray (Michael Coles of Doctor Doctor and the Dalkes) are in need of assistance from Van Helsing's progeny Lorrimar (Peter Cushing). Dracula wants to make revenge on Van Helsing by using the latter's granddaughter as his bride. Lorrimar traces Alucard; They are fighting in his apartment in Chelsea, and the young vampire is drowning in a bath of water. Remember, running water is just as deadly for vampires as sunlight and crucifix. Van Helsing finds Dracula in the deserted church with his daughter waiting for the spade. Van Helsing and Dracula strangled. Van Helsing throws Holy Water into Dracula's face. The vampire falls into an open tombstone with a roll waiting for him and he dissolves again. <br /> <br /> The main problem with "Dracula AD 1972" is that we don't get enough of Lee as the spade, though we get significantly more from Cushing than Van Helsing. In addition, the spectacle Don Houghton Dracula holds the ramshackle church and never let the vampire venture into the city. Despite the low budget, "Dracula A.D. 1972" could have been much better. The scene where the contemporary Van Helsing Alucard has to put down and play it back to get Dracula looks almost laughable. You will think he will know about this backgammon test. Unless you're afraid of horror movies, this one will make you. Sometimes Gibson offers us a wonderful proximity to Dracula with its cracked patches and bloodshot eyes, but it's about as scary as this colder, and it doesn't say much.
