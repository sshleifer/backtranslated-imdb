It was the first action film made in banned in the USSR Hollywood action style. It's not even close to the Hollywood action movies of that time. The plot is childish, the direction is so-so. This movie was successful because it was the first time in Russia. Although I watched it many times, I have to admit it was kind of naive and I didn't like it. This is not the best example of Russian action. It's just the first experience.
