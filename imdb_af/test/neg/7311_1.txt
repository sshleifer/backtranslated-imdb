This movie was bad. I believe Elton (or is it Mike) Wong played in it. Anyway, it was the Wong who didn't have that gorgeous smile and looks mean. He plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers brain damage. He recovers and becomes revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one worth seeing in this movie, but he can't do much. But how little it looks, the <br /> <br /> looks like other pale. Also, the movie has a few cheesy rubber hooks that control the Wong man. This movie is not worth renting or buying.
