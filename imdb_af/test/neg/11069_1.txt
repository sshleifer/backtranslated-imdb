I recently saw a string of piano movies and this movie has managed to combine all the worst aspects of this kind of movie. You get very little appreciation for the caves or the monster they face, while the characters are clicked (spiritual man, leader with tragedy in the past, etc.) And the end was just weak. It really irritated me that the director shook the camera or had almost total darkness to create atmosphere. I read that this movie made a real representation of the game and yes, I think the caves are dark. Show near the total blackness for half the movie that really brought that home. I really enjoyed the descent that made my money better, had more tough caves, better samples and a good ending. <br /> <br /> **** spoiler ****** <br /> <br /> The monster seems to be a guy whose plane crashed and parents were dead so he was in the caves grow up. He apparently developed super strength and speed, but why is never addressed. Perhaps the same power that their torch batteries have drained, but it happened during the movie when someone is killed, and you get the impression of something big with claws that run out of every victim. see how much blood the walls splash!) But in the end, it's just a man with a fur that has turned over him and a mask? I would be prepared to think about it when there were huge stresses, but that was hardly the case. Then he begins to rape the last remaining cake and roll credits. Almost absurdly bad I thought. Sometimes a movie is so bad you can appreciate it and maybe have a laugh, but these movies fail to record themselves lightly. <br /> <br /> You watched it, you can't make it careful!
