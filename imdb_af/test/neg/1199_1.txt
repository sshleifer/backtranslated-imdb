Okay, the idea is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not have planes. 2. Children do not race aircraft with dirt bins. 3. It made the air force look like total idiots. 4. The children's father would not endanger his entire career so his son could not go with him. a reserve colonel <br /> <br /> The successors, I'm sure, were worse than these trips. The soundtrack is about the only redeeming quality of this celluloid waste. I'm sorry, but I just don't understand why anyone in the world would write directly and deliver such an undisputed litter. The Iranian Air Force is fortunate to rub a few parts for an aging F-14, and this kid does not hit 1, but 2 are charged and fueled F-16s? Go break.
