(Spoilers Forward!) The same exact plot of this movie has been done before. This is done at Ferris Bueller's Day Off! Marques "Bat Man" Houston plays sick. His believing parents believe him. His sister knows he falls, but she still has to go to school! She's crazy. He has a party with his friends while his parents are away. By the time his parents arrive home, he is ill again and his parents never found out about the party. I like Immature better when they were in Home Party 3 and still immature!
