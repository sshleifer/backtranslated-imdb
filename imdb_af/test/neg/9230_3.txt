People call a 976 "party line" to talk to strangers and maybe meet for a sexual liability. A wrong, somewhat turbulent sister and occasional transvestite brother uses the line to kill people, usually married to men, but do not discriminate! A couple of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun, as if of course older. One of them works as a babysitter for a married man who is warm to her (or anyone). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a vice-police is being murdered when he is the first to discover one of the sisters' victims. He is with a female assistant to the District Attorney. <br /> <br /> Nothing too special here. Richard Roundtree has a bit more than a cameo than the police chief. One of the dirty-talking sixteen-year-olds is played by an actress who also voiced Peanuts character Peppermint Patty! According to the IMDb, the other is quite young dead, just a few years after this movie: sad.
