Based on a fairly common "bestseller", this movie, like most other life movies, played more than a reenactment as a real movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter wasn't in it. The women in this parent don't get as long as 20 years old and the acting is generally pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The characters in this were all clich√© and one-dimensional. The story was of the cheesy nature. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who love the book and people who will see that network all the time. I just watched it because my friend wanted to see it so she didn't have to read the book her sister had borrowed from her. It's not for someone like me - my girlfriend eventually screamed a little, so she didn't think it was as horrible as I did.
