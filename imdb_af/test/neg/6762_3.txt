I once heard this movie described, or you would like it or hate it. From reading some of the other reviews and ratings, I'd dare say it's true. I put myself in the hatred that it crowds. I saw some really bad movies, boring movies and even low budget films. This movie is bad on all three fronts. <br /> <br /> This Island Earth's Exeter (Jeff Morrow) returns to its sci-fi / b roots as dr. Lesson (minus giant major prosthesis). The doctor and his assistant Arnie (George O'Hanlon - also the voice of George Jetson), along with Les's friend assistant Vera, follow a meteor. This is the core of the cast and is almost a double date. Les has Vera and Arnie has his "Susie" (Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equit Sensor - also the computer). Just the relationship between George and his robot girl, Rosie, (and his relationship with Susie) is more credible than the cold, moist feelings Vera has for Les (and vice versa). The object of all their interest is, however, no ordinary meteor. It is really an alien art nouveau / art deco energy storage device, which moves like a 3-legged dog. There is also the little alien "energy" that dr. Hubbel (aka, the chief scientist there) controls. The alien is, of course, of going away, malicious and evil. Is this the kind of science we give out? No wonder the strangers of the explorers were afraid of us. Looking at some of these movies, we first shoot. There is no need for questions afterwards. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is synonymous with looking at some very boring science experiments, such as cooking an egg or adding food color to celery. It's not the fact that it's a low-budget sci-fi movie, or it's a bit cheesy and outdated. It's really really boring. The whole movie is about trying to figure out what's going on. This is it. Most of the things we learn about what's going on are by monologues and self-dictators. Add a crazy dialogue, cardboard and cheap sets and you have the work of an Ed Wood clone. By the way, Ed also made great movies - avoid the Orgy of the Dead. The dialogue ... oh, the dialogue. Jems like: <br /> <br /> "..of less than 2 miles from the ocean? <br /> <br /> Why ?! It came through a billion miles in space." <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> Do you think you can respect a man who has probably drawn the scientific boner of all time? " <br /> <br /> This movie is obviously drawing a banned planet, this island earth, magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer boundaries, twilight zone. Namely, a low budget sci-fi movie (or TV episode) that is compelling enough to overtake the technical issues and strange situations. In essence, these movies are at some level pleasant (the story, the underlying meaning or the mere comic nature of the dialogue or situations). This movie has nothing of it. It's just 90 minutes of boredom. I couldn't even enjoy it at an Ed Wood level. I definitely recommend moving this one and seeing one of the movies I mentioned above. It's so bad that, as my name dr. Forrester was, I would never think to show this movie to anyone ... except Frank maybe.
