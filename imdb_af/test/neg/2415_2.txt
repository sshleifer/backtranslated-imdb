A party-hard girl's sister is brutally murdered by a street gang and sends the young man into a sudden psychotic rampage. He and his friends killed half of the city to bring his sister back. <br /> <br /> A year after this film, SAVAGE STREETS was released and was more entertaining. Linnea Quigley, who has a precious role in this movie as the sexy (and short-haired) girl of one of the guys, also went to SAVAGE STREETS. <br /> <br /> This movie is subpar, though it does provide enough escapist entertainment and gratuitous nudity to retain its intended audience (me). <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for strong violence, nudity, language and some sexuality.
