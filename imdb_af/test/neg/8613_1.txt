Well, I watch tons of movies and this one really sucked ... BIG TIME. I'm sure we're all sick and tired of the low budget effort to make Vampire Movies using a "Martial Arts Teacher" show "actor" type of movies. I'm also so tired of the man who knows a form of fighting technique and can then fight his way through a somewhat boring movie. I forced myself to watch it and one of the main reasons was that the leading actress was very nice. Well, I hope it helped a little and if you have time and your brain wants to rest, watch it !!! Well, hopefully these kind of movies won't be released one day, but then where all the Low Budget actors will go :-) <br /> <br /> The movie also contains a lot of Bloops, but I'll leave you to find because it adds quite a bit of fun while you look and even if you are a little perfectionist, it will bother you ;-) Cheers !!
