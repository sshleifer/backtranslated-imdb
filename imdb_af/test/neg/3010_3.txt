A professional production with quality actors who simply never touch the heart or the funny leg, however difficult it has been. The quality choice, the strong attitude and the excellent filmography created you for Fargo or High Plains Drifter, but sorry, the soup had no spices or meat. A 3 (out of 10) for effort.
