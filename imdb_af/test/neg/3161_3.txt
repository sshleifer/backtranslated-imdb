It is a film with lots of potential, well done and performed, with quite a week and inconsistent writing. A young woman with two children is moving to her mother's cramped apartment because the men are slamming at the workshop where they are stealing cars, aggravating their son's asthma. He gets worse in jail when an ex-patrol's stolen car is traced back to his shop. , ex-clap ends friendly, generous and naive shmoe (and rather cardboard and we don't learn anything from him), but ends with the girl who "trades" despite being sexually satisfied with her husband. I expect this movie to be successful in Czech, as it will be welcome due to its obvious premise: "Their ex-pats may have money, but they can even get our wives, but they are old, gentle and we want to be women, happy, we can be poor, but .... if only, Marcela will be happy so she should not play with herself or if he has already had an existing family in Italy. .. but it would complicate things.
