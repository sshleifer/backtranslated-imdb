In short, this movie is a statement of artistic bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> Almodovar is easily the most important European filmmaker of the 80s and 90s. No other living director shaped the style and content of today's European film more than he did. It is therefore not easy to say that his latest effort is not just another disappointment after two ill-considered films, but rather a total and total disaster that confirms his empathy for ideas, humor and worst of all. He created characters. <br /> <br /> This is not due to the complexity of the story. All Almodovar films are almost impossible to summarize. This time it's actually easy to be familiar with his previous work. "Broken Embraces" is a remake of "Law of Desire", just this time the director is straight and the jealous beloved lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with that movie, I do a summary. If you don't want to know too much, please skip this paragraph. A blind man, who used to be a well-known film director, gives a sexy boxing woman presenting a paper to him after a chance on the street meeting (yes, really, that's how it starts). Just then he visits his agent and best friend. He mentions that he has learned from the newspaper that a certain millionaire is dead, taking the story back 14 years. He can still watch and direct his next film. He dies the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire as the lead, as he is immediately beaten to her. The millionaire discovers their case through silent videos made by his gay son, which he intermarried through an interpreter (some great scenes, Cecilia Roth). After the violent battle, the mistress escapes with the director to a coastal resort where he learns that the millionaire, who made the film, released it in the worst possible change, destroying the directors' reputation. The couple decide to return, but have an accident in which the director gets blind and the actress will die. Back in the present he learns that his agent kept the negatives of the film and began to reconstruct it. <br /> <br /> As in "Bad Education", there are several sub-graphs to refurbish this rather thin story, and Like in "Bad Education", the result is more confusing than satisfactory. For example, the agent's son, who works as a DJ, has a casual drug overdose - which is totally unnecessary for the plot, and also very badly interpreted. <br /> <br /> Usually, however, the actors are not blaming, but how their characters are written. Blanca Portilla as the agent has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character. Lluis Homar is an old man's dream of a protagonist who lives in an artificial world where an English alias and some sweet words can seduce a supermodel. And Penelope Cruz is the embodiment of this old man's sexual fantasy. Her character is completely lifeless. It remains quite incomprehensible why she would go from one old man, who at least helped her family, to a slightly less old man who was not enough to persuade as a romantic hero or a passion-fist. <br /> But all these shortcomings wouldn't make this movie so terrible. Almodovar, however, makes the worst thing about a director (or any kind of narrator) from ideas: he picks himself up, something he has done more and more, and very little advantage. The movie-inside movie, which uses Broken Embraces as a plotting device, is actually 'Women on the Edge of Nervous Disorder' (1988), but this time it is called 'Chicks and Bags'. This spectacular title can give you an indication of how these beloved classics are being treated here: while the dialogue in which the last ten minutes of 'Broken Embraces' exist, is a spectacular, over-the-top exchange of one-liners in the original film is. Here it is a strict, colorless, troublesome business meeting. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's the DOA brainchild of an exhausted creator of previous miracles, almost as terrible and disappointing as the last Indiana Jones feature. Perhaps not so many people will agree, because Almodovar was such a genius. I'd rather offer my respect for his accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to watch "Everything about my mother", or "Tie me up" or "High Heels" or "Matador", all of which testify to Almodovar's unique and unparalleled talent. A few more movies like this, and his legacy can be very well destroyed for good.
