I mostly gave this movie a 2 because it actually has a good role, but the movie itself is just like that (insert unusually rude word from the sixth letter of the alphabet). It is useless that I felt bad when I voted it was the lowest vote a three. <br /> <br /> Very predictable plot .... two nasty-do-well musicians have no money and lots of money problems. However, if a friend gives a bag of money (belonging to drug dealers) in their care, they give it up and then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> Not an original idea in this whole movie.
