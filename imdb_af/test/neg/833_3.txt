This is a classic example of what happens when a sit com on television is far too long. Everything gets tired and the jokes are repeated over and over. OK, from the beginning the first few series were very good. You have pursued an entertainment manager (Simon Cadel) by his deputy, played by Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady who is wearing a yellow dress, an alcoholic child-friendly Punch and Judy man, a curved jockey, and a standing comedian. As mentioned earlier, it started well, but went too long. After Simon Cadel was away, it retired quickly, you have a spectacular storyline, and a new entertainment manager who has cast Ruth Madoc again. When a comedy is all filmed in one place, there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked. Unfortunately, it took so long that every joke was 3 or 4 times over. If this comedy was stopped after 2 series, it would have come down as an all-time classic. As it is, it will be largely remembered for the terrible last few series.
