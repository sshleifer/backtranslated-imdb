This is actually an exercise. Complemented as a tribute to firefighters, it contains dull scenes of "we are just a bunch of wacky guys" in the midst of "my goodness, it can be really dangerous" parts. Usually this is not stupid. You can't believe for a minute that real firemen are acting like that. It's so terrible I couldn't watch at times. If my daughter hadn't hired it and insisted on seeing it to the end, I would have had no option but to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Thing is I am a John Travolta fan. Every maintenance of what I saw just increased my opinion of him. I think it was strict for the money. I'm sure he'll be happy if this one is forgotten.
