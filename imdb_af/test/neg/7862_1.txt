The Wolf's curse begins as a reluctant Werewolf Dakota (Renee Porada) to escape from her "suit" and to the city where she works in a veterinarian six months later. The rest of Dakota's suit is unhappy and wants her back, their leader Michael (Todd Humes) says she'll come back, but fat Werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) picks up her scent and the suit decides to force the problem and return her to get. use her love for her human friends, including her boyfriend Danny (Dennis Carver). Can Dakota save Danny and eventually get rid of her Werewolf pursuers? I doubt you would mind ... Performing, writing and directing executive work by Len Kabasinski, who also had a pretty big part in the movie as Stick. I was scared to look at the curse of the Wolf since Kabasinski was the man. behind Swamp Zombies (2005), which is surely one of the worst movies ever made. Unfortunately, my worst fears have been confirmed and one has to say that the Wolf's curse is a truly horrible film in every respect, both conceptual and technical. Curse of the Wolf is the kind of movie where the low budget dictates what happens and the writing rather than the writing that dictates the budget. You get the impression that everything is written and designed to take advantage of the few sets and actors they had. You can almost think the makers say we have some actors, basic equipment and a few places so we can make an abomination movie around them. The story is terrible (Michael finds the location of Dakota by watching a big dog, two women take a step), the character is terrible (a big fat Werewolf guy who sails), the dialogue is terrible ( just about every line in the thing) and there is never any motivation for anything that happens (why is the suit so desperate to get back to Dakota?), people just seem random and since director Kabasinski's background in martial arts is, he asserts that he randomly introduces martial arts combat sequences into the plot. No offense, but it's meant to be a horror movie, not a martial art, isn't it? In fact, apart from the presence of a few Werewolves, you would be hard pressed to describe the curse of the Wolf as a horror movie approach. For nearly two hours it feels like it's going to be forever and is so slow and incompatible, it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> Director Kabasinski obviously works on a low budget, but film makes it bad a crime. There is no continuity between shots, the fighting scenes look awful and are so poorly staged that it is untrue and it is sometimes impossible to follow what is going on, whether due to the cunning editing and poor camera angles or the fact that it is Sometimes it's so dark that you can literally see nothing. Seriously there are times during the curse of the wolf where the screen is completely black and you cannot see anything, I will hate to put it through to watch it on a fuzzy low resolution VHS. The sound is also terrible, you can hear the wind and wind on the microphone! There are also many other unpleasant and unwanted environmental sounds during almost every scene. Did the production actually have any lighting devices while it was made? It doesn't feel that way. The special effects mostly consist of Werewolf masks that look like the kind of stuff sold at Halloween for kids. Basically, it looks terrible. <br /> <br /> Technically, the Wolf's curse is as bad as they come, m sorry, because I know it had a low budget, but it's really awful to go through and try to get some entertainment to get. It's a high school movie student quality, I'm sorry if it looks bad, but it's a fact. The acting is, well, you can guess, so I will stop here before I say something else negative, I mean, I've done enough of it and I really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The curse of the Wolf is terrible, both conceptually and technically, it is a real task to go through. The curse of the Wolf is the kind of movie, as you watch the time seem to be quiet, it's the type of movie that lasts almost two hours, but feels like two years. One of the worst movies you or I will ever see is definitely one to avoid.
