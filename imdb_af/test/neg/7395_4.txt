Imagine a GILLIGAN ISLAND in the African desert in modern times. Add people nowhere as close as the Skipper or Marianne - and enough fear to fill a German psychiatrist's office. Throw a plot that succeeds only to be episodic and literary parallelism that never delves deep enough to really satisfy. Season with a real morose topic that has been exploited since the first world travelers found themselves very, very lost. <br /> <br /> If the King was alive, it was not a product of the ruling Czars du jour of Dogma 95. This movie is being given so much attention? Dogs 95 are after Hollywood as Danish modern is to rococo. A by-product of digital technology, this Scandinavian movement - dogmatic - seeks to remove artificiality in film processing, using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling. PEARL HARBOR, for example, is the Dogma Antichrist. <br /> <br /> Director / co-author Kristian Levring's case considers interpersonal relationships and human nature when placed under the fire of a life-threatening situation. Eleven people aboard a bus driving through the Namibian dunes are suddenly stranded in the remains of a deserted town. An African local who doesn't speak their language serves as an observer and narrator (whose insights are one of the most beautiful films). As the strongest heads go for a five-day walk to the nearest village, the other stays behind, survives on canned roots and transforms their probable future as a vulture chorus. Former Thespian Henry decides that this rather unpleasant crew needs a distraction and writes KING LEAR out of memory. He gives roles, and the group runs many days of teaching and rehearsing, in an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable. <br /> <br /> Gradually, does it throw it to lose and the atrocities of its nature? ? Or, William Golding can say, human nature begins to surface. If you've ever seen the planes, you know these things can get ugly, as in a lifeboat situation, even Mother Teresa can turn into Calcutta's PMSing Termant. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot Using an international ensemble of American, English, French and South African actors, dictating the Dogma dogma, they develop themselves and their roles very organically. The King is also chronologically filmed, adding a sense of realism to the ever-increasing despair of his characters. After three hand cameras shot in digital recordings, the results were transferred to 35mm film. <br /> <br /> The most compelling show comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays a boho Pop Tart that spirits the group in every way she can. Henry (David Bradley) is another finely played character, whose passion for his life's work ultimately saves the gang of despair. It is hard to regret the other cruel women and their oafish men, hirsute old women, such French intellectual, rich men who have more important places than they have destroyed in the Namibian desert. Beckett may hate this question, but why does this group drive a bus first in remote Africa? Life-threatening morbidity! Desperate despair in graphic details! An indifferent boring fit! Enjoy.
