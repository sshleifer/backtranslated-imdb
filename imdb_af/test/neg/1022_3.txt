Formula film about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilean experiencing a fortune and being noticed in the case of bad people and falling in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks a lot like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I was bothering this was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises here, even though it's nice to see Vargas. Large-scale Chilean landscapes display on each other, but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. Michael Ironside usually plays a bad guy, but it is not one of his most memorable parts. The chase is standard money.
