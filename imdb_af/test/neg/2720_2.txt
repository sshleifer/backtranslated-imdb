I seem to be in the minority, but I thought "Radio" was pretty terrible. It seems to contain almost every click in this type of "heartwarming" movie. <br /> <br /> The motivation for the characters who fell in love with Radio was never really explained. We were just supposed to accept that everyone was on Radio, except for some bad apples. <br /> <br /> You could see almost all the great moments in the 100-meter story away. When the movie wanted you to go "Awww" or pull your tissue, I roll my eyes and wish I had looked at "Rudy". <br /> <br /> There were some good performances by the role. Too bad they were not given a better movie if they wanted to appear.
