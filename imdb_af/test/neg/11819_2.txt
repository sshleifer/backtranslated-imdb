And you'll be right. Black Mama, White Mama, also known as 'Women in Chains,' is exactly what the prospect of trashy and crappy b movie is. Pam Grier was thrown into a prison with some other women. This place makes the summer camp where Martha Stewart is now locked up, now looks like a maximum security prison. It's not five minutes in the movie that one of the hottest streaks line up and get wet and then we are introduced to a prison life that looks like a college man's fantasy of what is inside a a girl's house is like. <br /> <br /> The prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower as it is a Girls Gone Game shoot, then they all hang out in their sleeping place, smoke open and discuss in a large group that would be the best ways to escape. I have never been in prison myself, but I have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing you want as few as possible of people, prisoners or guards or otherwise. The biggest difference between this prison life and a fantasy sorority life is that women in this movie all wear orange heart crosses (and no pants. Go figure) that says PRISON on the back. Must be those prison generic prison kits that can't afford affordable accessories such as their prison name or prison numbers for their uniforms. <br /> <br /> And, as expected, a prison that can't afford to put in prison Captive identification on the back of the uniforms can't be expected to find guards interested in protecting the prisoners as much as they are in the generation with the prisoners and one another. <br /> <br /> The movie's title conflict refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) spent much of the time on a blonde prisoner named Karen, as they are under police force after escaping from prison. I won't go into detail about how they escape, except to say that you might have seen something like it in The Fugitive if they couldn't afford to lead a train wreck, and that led to the hidden story of the conflict. interests that also chase these two women for different reasons. Karen and Lee both have their own gangs, everyone who wants to save their respective escaped prisoner, and the police are both so to them. <br /> <br /> (spoilers). So Karen is involved in a lot of hippies who want to revive life as they know it. Meanwhile, Karen just wants to get off the island, something she's been trying to do for years, and it's not just perfect that they should all go across the sides of the island to reach their goals. So, we get this strange couple, and since they are a strange couple, it is not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the movie, but will be delighted at the end. <br /> <br /> In a movie with so many conflicting interests, especially when the conflicting interests not only drive the two main characters in opposite directions, while following their goals, it's not unreasonable to expect there to be a climactic moment will be in which the competitive gangs at some show in the movie. Not leaving anyone to dissatisfied, at the end of the movie they throw a stupid gang, where everyone shoots machine guns on each other, murdering each other while the two women are safely and quietly rowing across the river in a small boat. Nice. <br /> <br /> Better still, at the end of the movie, after a large massacre in which many people are shot and bright red paint everywhere in the place, police chief of the massacre seem to cover death criminals with terrible, terribly special effects, and we learn that he will be great for dinner. Not a bad way to end the movie, the criminals all kill each other and the police get all the credit, but here's the last line in the movie ?? "It's better to win, isn't it?" <br /> <br /> Is that why the Captain will be promoted to bulk? Because he found out ???
