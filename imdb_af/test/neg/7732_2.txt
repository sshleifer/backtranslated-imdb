My gosh, this movie was nothing more than movies by numbers. Struggling trader can't make it in New York, mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing, struggling seller moves to California and makes it big, then loses it big, then jumps back with simple life, then hits rock bottom try back to the top. I don't think I can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. Spoiler: When the John Kapelos character calls to say he and his girlfriend have come to Santa Cruz to visit, and James Woods says there is virtually no chance he'll come, you know with 100% certainty that they are entering the next scene or two. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Sean Young certainly looks good.
