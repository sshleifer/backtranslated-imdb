After the Blues Brothers DVD release, and their mention of "Wired" at Belushi's bio, my boyfriend and I were hungry for more information on John Belushi. I heard of "Wired" but didn't get it too much and found it in the back of the local rental shop. I understand that Dan Akroyd was really p *** ed about this movie and I thought it was because it didn't portray them in a good light. But it has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, until they wheel into John's body. When he wakes up at the autopsy table and decides to run for it, the total tastelessness of this movie begins. John is subject to his life and all the turmoil he created with a bad sense of humor with a Puerto Rican driver, with an "Angel" who is subject to criticism and trying to get him to cross . <Br /> <br /> The two actors depicting John and Dan do not see anything even close to the real actors, but let no one else talk about it, Lorne Michaels. It makes it hard to really try to focus on it and how they were in real life ... but that's the point of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> I believe it's supposed to be an "art" film - John is constantly being tormented by drugs (ie, the powdery soap in the bathroom that is cocaine), so it was also difficult to follow. The flashbacks are hooks and also make it difficult to understand. Probably the most tasteless scene was when John (literally) was forced to undergo his autopsy and was in pain while removing his heart to weigh it, saying it was abnormally large due to drug use, obesity, yes, we got the point without the grotesque depiction. <br /> <br /> There are very few actors we know in the movie (where is Carrie Fisher For example, they were incredibly close and Jim Belushi would be a wonderful person to show.) It looks very cheap (We felt it was the graphics from the early 80's or late 70's). It felt like it was filmed about a week and didn't show the way to John at all. I felt I knew a little more about watching episodes of Saturday Night Live. <br /> <br /> On one last note Bob Woodward comes across narcissistic by placing himself in the movie and arguing with John about writing his life. story. For someone who was supposed to be a Nixon breast, his caliber of someone could be a writer in the National Enquirer, and therefore he lost my interest in any of his work from this point forward. <br /> <br /> SKIP THIS MOVIE. If you want to see more about John, watch his movies, see Dan Akroyd's clips talking about him or hoping someone has the taste to make another movie on John, the men say on the moon. It's finally what we expected. I think it was a "moral" kind of movie - you know, don't use drugs, but I think the creators of this movie didn't understand that his death stopped a number of people (like Carrie Fisher) have to do drugs for that reason altogether.
