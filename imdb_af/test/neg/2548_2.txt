I rented the Matrix, with a friend of mine, reviewed. We both loved the Matrix and we both love movies so we wanted to see what's going on behind the scenes of The Matrix. It appears that The Matrix Revisited tells you nothing about the art of filming or even how the Matrix was made. It's basically a big commercial for The Matrix, a movie that has already seen The Matrix Revisited target audience. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know about the process and the problems and the stress and detail that went into making The Matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original DVD of The Matrix. There are things they show in that documentary I didn't even realize, had to be done or done. The Matrix was such a difficult and challenging movie to make it earn more credit than a "documentary" that is as informative and interesting as an MTV special.
