OK, I gave it a three A three! It only earns one star without questions. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie seriously and taking it as a legitimate B-Horror movie does, it will get one star. But I think it's clear within the first few minutes of the movie we are about to go through is a piece of crap. <br /> <br /> With this movie, me and my partner, I watched it with the ability to turn it off and put in something more "Hollywood" but we just decided to eradicate this whole movie , from start to finish. We laughed so much, it was almost when I watched a comedy. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible ..... The consequences and death secrets are so bad. ... <br /> But the fact that they're trying to make a serious horror movie. Prick Less! <br /> <br /> The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters walk into a supposedly "dark cellar" that is clearly lit, and they pretend not to be in the bones hanging from the ceiling. can't see. Bahahahaha is just terrible. <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is, along with the fact that it was made in 2004 than seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Why do I write so much? Nobody knows about this movie. I doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha.
