I grew up watching the "Bowery Boys" in the weekends and even at a young age I could say it was low rent as the name suggests. Still, it was nice to watch Satch (Hall) get the Muggs (Gorcey) better after Muggs had beaten him. The East Side Kids stuff was never shown, although it was public domain and probably cheap to run, just setting a standard for kids, although we had just 5 channels to watch. Fill in the year 2005 and I repossesin about my childhood. I can't find Bowery Boys on DVD, but I found The East Side Kids on the disk and also on a public domain website. Luckily I saved my dough and saw Bowery Blitz on the web for free, and it really really blows. Now I can see there are some Bowery Boys and maybe Monogram bad movie lovers here who bought this melodrama got a 7 out of 10, but it's not even funny. It's an East Side Kids drama, not a comedy, so it's not good. The best part was to fight Muggs at the end, he reminded me of my grade school days that got away like a girl when I was in a fight, it was a bit. Leonard Maltin said in his mini-bio this movie is one of the better ones, so you can only imagine the rest. If you want to see half-over-the-top East Side action, Ghosts on The Loose may be watching, but the bottom line is usually a comedy team that starts out strongly in their career. These cups started early and it went slowly until Hall's ancient dominance. as they were at their best. Another 2nd level well below the 3 stooges, who are following them but amusing to those who grew up with them. This feature will not bring back pleasant "Bowery Boys" memories and is best left over from Monogram fanatics.
