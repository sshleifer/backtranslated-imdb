Well, I start with this: I love horror movies, not even the worst plot or the worst, terrifying play will ruin the experience as long as a certain amount of gore and tension is present. second; this is the worst movie of all time. It even beats average rifles, and the assault of the killer threats. And for that I pay tribute. <br /> <br /> However, the involuntary humor was only funny until half of the movie passed, and so everything was so sad. To my great surprise, the reviews are somewhat divided; and you rated this 7 and higher C-movie crap; I KNOW YOU ARE JOKING! GOOD ONE !! HAHAHA! Because if there is any reason in the world, and we have just a little bit of the same idea of ​​what quality it is; You can't really be. <br /> <br /> Worth mentioning is already well summarized, so I'll leave it. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> But the scene where the dressed rubber masks drag the woman back and forth through the doghouse for ten minutes, with such a horrible music party and The Thoughts Between the two blow, it really makes me.
