Ohhhh MAN this movie is terrible !! <br /> <br /> This kind of tripe is what gives Canadian Cinema a bad name or no name. Well, to be fair, I think, most Canadian movies give the Canadian movie a bad name. <br /> <br /> In addition to the characters (there are some that are best in movie history), the most annoying thing is the editing and fitting of the movie. It's like a drunken snail who's going to die. <br /> <br /> Thanks Melanie Doane is nice to look at. She's the only thing that made me look. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie was interrupted. <br /> <br /> Good to laugh though, if you have a bad Canadian Movie night, <br /> <br /> Did I call Melanie? Doane? The only good point (too bad they didn't have the point of keeping the camera on her for more than a look at a time). <br /> <br /> Another addition to the Canadian Hall of Stinking Movies.
