Why can't there be better TV movies I made, and I watched this movie on a satellite channel in the UK. What a terrible waste of my time it was. Poor sets, poor acting and oh my god that is a terrible flood. Blimey, the woman can even pour a stream of water !! <br /> <br /> I really want people to make TV movies with better effects, better or at least more credible plots and much better acting. Killer Flood is good there with poor acting. A few bits of ham could not get worse. <br /> <br /> One final thing I really agree with the commentary about the dog, but I believe it will already be in real life!
