With my two stars I will probably hate the IMDb head. "For this seemingly very popular TV series. <br /> <br /> No less because of the enthusiastic comments made on this site, I decided to buy a DVD edition of the series. Find British humor, adjust it to me well, I gave up in the middle of the second installment and, according to other comments, were the funniest pieces already. /> <br /> So now I know, according to another comment, that I definitely Have a sense of humor, but then I had to be crazy while looking (and looking again) Fawlty Towers to which Black Books is - even if it's difficult to say thematically - why the different reactions are a mere generation thing. yet the differences can be pointed out. <br /> <br /> Both Fawlty Towers and Black Books are in businesses that are meant to financially support their owners, both businesses are not successful but look like a miracle? Fawlty Towers is funny because the protagonists are dealing with situations they can't do not handle. The fun lies in the fact that they make a serious effort to succeed and while laughing, feel sorry for them. Black Books has no situations, it's just there and the owner succeeds in being sorry for himself. If a situation threatens to arise, it is quickly driven away. It is remarkable how fast and how often a subject falls and the protagonists change something completely to produce an additional joke. Jokes tell and not very well - everything seems to be Black Books is over. Why bookstore? A hardware store would just have done the job. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. It's a bookstore because the protagonists are supposed to be sensitive and cultivated under the veneer of rudeness, vulgarity and arrogance. They are not a few low gorillas, but staggering semi-intellectual losers. Hey, they're like you and me. The way the series makes the claim is the only way I can explain its success. There is nothing remarkable about the protagonist's actions. What is special about them is their economically unrealistic living conditions that many viewers might be envied for. Those protagonists who told narcissistic and foolish are a trademark of the time the First World currently lives. <br /> <br /> Recently, I watched Tittybangbang, also a fairly new British TV comedy program. I found it incredibly funny. It is often very tasteless or xenophobic ?? but always with a purpose and save the bull's eye in his social criticism. The humor is mainly created by situations or characters with a purpose. The low ratings in IMDb may indicate that this humor is not consistent with the times, but I am glad it still lives and kicks and hopes it will continue to do so.
