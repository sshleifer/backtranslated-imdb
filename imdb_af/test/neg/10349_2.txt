I tried to watch it twice, though I was unable to make any episode. For me it's basically just not funny. I can say where to laugh, but I can't. I have never seen the original, so I do not compare. I also love comedies, including out-of-the-wall comedies like married ... With kids and family, but this show just doesn't do it for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the play is mostly annoying. The ads made it look, but it is not. They try too hard to be different and bind to force the humor. The style usually doesn't work too well. I don't think this show ends the season. Of course I can be wrong.
