So this is a space movie. But it's low budget. You ask, "What about the consequences?" The effects are sometimes good, and sometimes it's really bad. I mean bad. And notice that I started with the effects. <br /> <br /> There's a story here, but it's being told what I think is the wrong order. I don't mean a wrong order of Tarantino style. I mean, it's being told in a completely nonsensical arrangement. Most are about a mother (in the future, because you know it is sci-fi) as told by her daughter, which is mostly written in the narrative from the daughter's perspective. Once you are the first hour and hear Paul Darrow's voice as a computer, you realize how much more acceptable the constant story would have been if he had read it. This story is so constant and inclusive that the actors on the screen hardly say a word for the first time. <br /> <br /> There is also a lesson here for your upcoming movie makers: if you don't do 2001 and want some action (this one does), then hire a good fight choreographer. Otherwise your battles will look, well, what's in BATTLESPACE. And note the title has the word "fight" in it. Ugh. <br /> <br /> I think it could be the classic scenario of making a movie based on nothing more than a concept. And some effects. My biggest surprise is that the IMDb owns this $ 1.8 million film. When you compare it to something like PRIMER, which did better with a few thousand budget, you realize in the low-budget movie-up, it's all about the story. I didn't expect much, but I was still disappointed. Two out of ten stars.
