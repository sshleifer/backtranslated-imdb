After reading the book, Heart of Darkness, the movie did not do it justice. The film disgraces the book and anyone who has not experienced the book will get frowned upon and plot because it is so poorly portrayed by the movie. In the movie, the characters were just some of the gaps in the movie. The director left so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works. <br /> <br /> Of course, any book is better than the movie, but it wasn't even comparable. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the wisdom of the written word. The movie doesn't even start from this. Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book have been completely abandoned, such as how Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Also, when Marlow wanted to deliver the news to Kurtz's intention, she reacted differently to the movie rather than the book. Another big difference was that Marlow did not see the picture of the lady blindly seen at the end of the movie, like the book. It was influential on how the audience observed Marlow, and the movie totally messed it up. <br /> <br /> The book was so finely tuned to what each place looks like, but the landscape in the movie was a downside. There were lots of stockings of false backgrounds and compliment, a lot of the bad actors to go with it. There was one exception to the horrible actors and it would be Isaach De Bankole, who played Mfumu. His character is best portrayed. Although the movie was not so good, I would only recommend it if you read and understood the book very well. That way you can see what the differences in the film and book are and consider it. If you didn't read the book, I didn't recommend the movie, because it's a boring, lifeless mess. I loved the book, so you should definitely read and enjoy it.
