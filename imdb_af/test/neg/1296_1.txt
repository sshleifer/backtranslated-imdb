I was hit by the horrible play and the screenplay for this movie. All the characters seem unbiased through personal issues - rather than deer. They blow around and cry about their emotions when decisive actions have to be taken. I yelled myself on the TV screen and tried to wake them up to their situation and DO ANYONE! The plot line is unreasonable. Each time there is a major decision to be taken by a main character, one of the other characters must face all the problems with the obvious decision rather than making the decision more difficult. It's an appropriate melodramatic trick and just wants to make you groan It's clear that the decision to make the decision is clear - you don't have to treat the audience as idiots. Overall - there is just too much emotional melodrama in the whole movie.
