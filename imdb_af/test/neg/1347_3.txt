This movie could have been a decent repetition, and gosh knew it was trying (or trying English). The compilation of talented actors with a successful and experienced writer / director should be a decent movie formula. But me. English's experience - according to her IMDb bio - is solely limited to television work, and it's suddenly obvious in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that none of the reviews I've read mention what I found most unlikely about this movie, and what kept it from reaching even a part of its potential: it looks and feels like it's made for television. To give me some credit. To give English, many of the jokes that simply didn't work on a movie screen would have been great on TV (and maybe a track record might have helped). So much of the camera used and the lighting would have played well on TV, but looked awkward or strange on a big screen. If the whole movie was cut in a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But it is cinema and unfortunately Mrs. English's talents not translated. I got so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors and writers I felt like I came out of the theater halfway! Meg Ryan is her usual beautiful, cute self (except for the terrible plastic surgery she had on her face), but where did she have the chance to use her talent? She made movies where she did not recreate her stereo-typed role and did it well ... but not here. Annette Bening was simply going through the movements - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! I enjoyed the other women's characters, but they were more caricature than dust, and it was sad to see. What worked in this movie in the 1930s doesn't translate to the 2000s, and no one has Mrs. Helped English to get the changes and updates or subtleties right. If she only helped (author, director and producer) for help, I think it could have been good. But it wasn't. <br /> <br /> It is so frustrating to go to a movie with good stars and a good writer or director and feel it was a waste of everyone's time and money! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate: A few movie shows have a meeting and the caption reads: "Let's recall a classic with everything worse!"
