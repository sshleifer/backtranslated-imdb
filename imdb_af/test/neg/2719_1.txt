Radio is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen, and at the same time one of the worst. It made me laugh at places where you were supposed to cry, and I curled at moments you were supposed to laugh. It didn't have any kind of character development, which is usually a sentimental movie that is. a few questions, why did Ed Harris's character take radio under his wing, it's not properly explained, and I'm sure their relationship (which is the main aspect of the movie) is the most sensible as ever. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Cuba's gooding's junior work, he is a villain actor and must be heavily encouraged until he takes another line of work. <br /> <br /> If true stories go, it's not that interesting. That is why I said it was one of the best movies I have ever seen, because I still enjoyed it, even though it was porridge. laugh at the screenplay and most monologues who are really the work of either idiot or someone who is very clever to try and show how easy it is to make a crappy movie about a retard that gets everyone's favorite joke. The fact of the matter is that Cuba's character is comedy for the people who watch the soccer matches.
