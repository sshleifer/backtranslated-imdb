Forgetful story in which mercenary Kerman and employer Agren travel in the jungle, looking for Agren's missing sister. <br /> <br /> Despite the relationship with the cannibal movie family, this film is more of a extreme version of Rene Cardona's "Guyana - Crime of the Century". Lenzi aims to exploit the active Jonestown massacre by portraying a rogue, righteous zeal with a love for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov). dedicated oblivion. With a sister in the toe, Kerman and Agren try to stop the rock, but after several failed coups, they end up in the "Green Inferno", just to seduce the locals and their infamous appetite. <br /> <br /> One in a series of exorbitant feasts that began in the late seventies / early eighties, where every new addition resembled a one-man game with his predecessor, trying to get the most imaginative and graphic graphics ever taken to movies. This inferior installment uses all the motives and gimmicks of the other, but with much less success. <br /> <br /> Was it the so-called "Amazonian Natives" that seem to reject Bollywood (this film was made in Sri Lanka), or the disgruntled "domination" and "castration" scenes that seriously affect the authenticity reduced what occurs in the "Cannibal Holocaust"? You can decide. Without spoiling the conclusion, it seemed as if Lenzi, in his shock and awesome emphasis, was placing more emphasis than the basic requirement for a coherent end, resolving all loose goals. Most unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As with others, where the magnitude of the graphic depictions of violence against people is limited (grateful), the filmmakers have spared no effort to strive for the worst possible cruelty to careless animals in the most. sadistic shocks. Unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this film is that it mentions, among other things, the ilk, which is more convincing about the subject. <br /> <br /> If there are any redeemable features, Kerman is a concern as a three-dimensional front man, and his face from scarce dressed fellows (Agren, Lai and Senators) pauses some of the ruthless slayings offer.
