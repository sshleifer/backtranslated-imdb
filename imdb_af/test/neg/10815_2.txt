I can't help but forget that incredible scene in Alien, when the extra region erupted from one of the men's chest. Or even in Predator when the invisible monster sniffs the destroyed soldiers and cuts them into pieces. Both of these movies have fascinating ideas about the characteristic feature of the milestone. Back to the era of cheesy B-movies and watch big men in fiery suits and try to kill people in small towns. Now remember that the two movies above have revived this genre. The cave does nothing to improve on it. It doesn't try anything new, and worst of all, the cave doesn't even have good gores. Sorry for them all. <br /> <br /> Converting into sexy spandex is the one-dimensional characters of The Cave. Everyone who doesn't care if they experience the death of their colleagues. They just walk along, unknown to the evil creature lurking in the darkness. The plot is very easy to understand. So you have the two brothers, the black man and the sexy female scientist. The rest (in other words, I mean everyone who meets creepy deviations) is even more unaware than the other. We have the Korean assistant, the risky outdoor chick, a Russian scientist and two divers, who both lack a sense of emotion and are foolish enough to go astray. This movie exceeds many clich√©s, as everyone but the black man, one of the brothers and the female scientist comes to an end. It also appears that only Americans can survive the terror, as Russian and Korean die. Don't be offended if I discard details. In any case, there is no real surprise. <br /> <br /> To be straight ahead, they find this cave. They go into the cave. They got stuck in the cave. They start dying in the cave. One of them is infected in the cave. More die in the cave. They went out of the cave; just to discover that one of them has a parasite that will make them a terrible monster, which they really don't bother. It's the simplicity of the shiny plot. It doesn't even try to be original. It even has the part where they decide that their leader is unable and divided. We have seen so many times before. <br /> <br /> I know in such a movie that people don't care about the performances, but it's worth mentioning how bad they were. Everyone is just as sad. Cole Hauser was particularly unsophisticated and didn't get me on Eddie Cibrian, which is often much better. Morris Chestnut is the best hand in the movie. His performance is actually decent. He portrays the man who calms everyone. All the other actors are at their best average. In a show like this, it's really not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Now we are going to this movie genre; the action of course. Well, regrettably the action was boring. The dead scenes were all boring, hell was the whole movie. There is hardly any blood. It's either gone and found later, or they fall on and die without a bruise. To see the Korean man's death was the only exciting action I could find. <br /> <br /> It's pretty amazing. The bad things about the shade, most of the good things. A good example is to say the special effects were well done, what they were. The only thing is wrong, since everything in a cave happens, it gets dark. I found it very difficult to distinguish between the cave walls and the samples. So it was difficult to see even the creatures. Although I like the special effects, there was nothing original about the samples. They all looked like each other and they were not scary at all. <br /> <br /> The Cave is a direct debut for Bruce Hunt. I don't see what he's been trying to achieve by making this movie. Of course, he made a big mistake. Almost everything about this movie looks like a stink bomb. A stink bomb is probably even more enjoyable than watching this mess again. Only the most forgiving movie maker will find this forgiving. I got up all the hope in the middle of the movie when I heard the phrase "hell" for the third time.
