I'm Mike Sedlak. I wrote the score for this movie. And proud of that. <br /> <br /> And I love all the comments. Some did not go far enough. <br /> <br /> The movie took place in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was full of friends and family. We all slapped. <br /> <br /> Five days the latter was drawn from all the scenes in the Bay Area. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in hearing from theater according to stage details, which can make the movie even more enjoyable, please let me know. <br /> <br /> We can start with the shot where Gideon Blake throws the toilet bumper to divert one of the evil henchmen who keep the radio beacon on the deck of Bud's guard. house. <br /> <br /> Or how Gideon spread the bomb in the original version. <br /> <br /> Didn't help. It's still bombarded. <br /> <br /> Bring it on.
