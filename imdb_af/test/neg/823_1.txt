Bean, Kevin & Perry, British TV creations making successful transitions on the BIG screen. Now she's Ali G's turn and I'm afraid to say it's not one of them! <br /> <br /> Ali was always obscene but funny about it. This film was extremley sick and not funny at all. Scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and pedophilia should not be portrayed for the sake of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Ali G In Da House is garbage and earns very little money. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
