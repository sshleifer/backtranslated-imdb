Roger Corman has enjoyed his film business shares in his illustrious lower-budget career, exceeding 300 films. While little (if any) would call him great, his films' dark connections with the underground culture (through reference, tribute or influence) guaranteed him a shortened legacy of all sorts. During his career, he also developed a bad habit of developing his own films ("Piranha", "Humanoids from the Deep", "The Black Scorpion", etc.), without even improving them. "Raptor", "written" and "directed" by "Jay Andrews" (Jim Wynorski, the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures, "Chopping Mall") takes the exercise to a disturbing new layer of Corman's mid-90s. "Carnosaur" trilogy. <br /> <br /> Wynorski's credits are in quotation marks because "Raptor" is not a tribute to the Carnosaur movies, or even a remake. "Raptor" IS the "Carnosaur" movies, or at least the movie's dinosaur-induced death scenes, randomly nailed to trace elements of the original plot and a few new screens (many of which consist of "dino's eye view" shots in a lame attempt to insert the inserted scenes seem less obvious). The "new" material is written around the footage, rather than the other way around, and is completely imperceptible, with large logic shortcomings (eg two separate teams are submitted by the army, just a picture of parts 2 and 3 where the soldiers of different uniforms can be included), which is wonderful considering how little logic is playing in the Carnosaur movies. The actors' lack of feelings in their characters (although fair, a character dimension is only presented once in the dissertation, perhaps twice), remembering the horrible timber that appeared in the 1950s movies and it certainly doesn't matter the torn screens that are worth watching. Even more embarrassing to the actors of the new scene is when there is a clear difference in the physical building between the new actor and the actor in the original scene. When the only scene on any reaction appears in a movie, the oldest trick in the horror book, the "jump-loaded animal", is something seriously wrong. <br /> <br /> As it stands, it's a despicable exercise in two b-grade figures (who don't have to worry about destroying their reputation because they don't have one) rip their own material, for the cheapest and quickest dirty tricks, simply because they can round off a series intended to be a finish of the "Jurassic Park" series?). There is not much more I can say, except that this film bears my utmost recommendations against performance; The only good thing about it (except to look at Melissa Braselle's navel) is that I don't have to look at the Carnosaur movies.
