Heart of Darkness Movie Review Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is pretty dark, deep and very deep. I have to say that reading the novel is much better than the movie. The character Mr. Kurtz, played by John Malcovik, was completely the wrong actor to do the part. He fits in the character "Van Muise en Mans." The film made up the key key parts that I consider important to get the real message from the story. <br /> <br /> The movie was poorly edited. It shows many non-important and annoying flashes. In the novel it has a very exciting atmosphere, but in the movie it is not such a feeling. In the book there is so much left to the imagination of the reader. For example, when Marlow waited timeless hours and days for rivets and the whole scene was left out of the movie. In the novel, Marlow waited very long for the rivets to come and fix his boat. It was a great source of futility in the novel. The film added more parts that were useless and kind, didn't make sense. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book, Kurtz hit the neck and killed him. That kind just ruined everything and didn't make me feel that way. So my suggestion to you is not the movie, just read the book. You will understand more and have a better interpretation of the story. <br /> <br /> ~ Chris C.
