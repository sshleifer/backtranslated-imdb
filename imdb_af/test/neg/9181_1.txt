By far the most racist and ghetto cartoon for children 7+. Children watching this cartoon will probably try to dress, talk and act like the characters depicted. I'm disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for permission to air this terrible program. The Wayan's Brothers can be good at movies meant for young adult viewers. They have to stick to the movies and no longer make episodes for this cartoon. Young celebs usually start working in movies and vote for cartoons, and then they get older as they get older. A good example is Nick Cannon. He first started with everything that appeared in All-That. Later in MIB II, then Drumline, and now his TV show, Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'n Out, where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples of how boyfriends watching television, not long ago, can become those who engage in non-child-friendly programs. It is very sad that this happens, but all the celebs change and grow. It's just the opposite of the Wayan's Brothers new cartoon. It's bad enough to handle all the bad people from the ghetto. By looking at the young generation, it will only transform the children with the possibilities for those who have no chance of a good life. Just my feelings on this cartoon and my beliefs about what will happen to our children if they should see it.
