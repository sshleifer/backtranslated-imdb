As if the world needs another Seagal movie. Add a bunch of actors who are good ... not really actors, a lot of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course a nice crazy chick in leather with no hips, and we stop being half the budget . . Why, oh, why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such movies? <br /> <br /> FBI catches two friends and sends them to "New Alcatraz," where the prison's first resident has to run, has unexpected guests. <Br /> <br /> First thing we all do, especially any scene involving tragedy for the good guys. However, the director was seriously trying, and made a modern, hard edge for the movie, the best he could do. He went too often to the pit and half-dead was too boring too soon. What else can you do if the prisoners just hang around and talk while the hostages are constantly asking what motivates the most important guy? An incessant action movie that is small, if not "a-ight".
