I understand that it was Llyod Kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was the well. The whole movie is pronounced since the sound rule was wasted. The voice wars were so bad and terrible quality. As much as I like Troma, they tend to be a little heavy on the voice over work. The acting was terrible. One thing I enjoyed about this movie was the fast coming of Trey Parker who did the aristocracy with a sturdy wig. There are many directors in this movie, such as James Gunn and Eli Roth (friends of Lloyd Kaufman). Again I think it was Llyod's attempt to save a crappy movie and not try to lose thousands of dollars. I won't keep going, but this movie was a mess. Look at other Troma titles.
