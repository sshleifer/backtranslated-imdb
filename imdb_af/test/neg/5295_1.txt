This movie is such a waste of talented people and Hollywood budget. It made me think everyone in the movie paid a favor by being in it because they were all out of place and wasted talent in this horrible trash of a movie. It's a contracted plot that's just pathetic, unrealistic and not even fun or interesting. The only thing that kept me interested was the many big names in the movie that didn't jump for any apparent reason and had no action or good lines to contribute to the mess of a movie. I expected it to have good stuff, since all these people were cool in other movies. But it never came. This film should be regarded as a punishment, but it will be cruel and unusual. You will be shocked to see so many recognizable faces that see such a horrible pathetic writing, with flat lines and horribly bad acting. This movie reminds me of another complete waste of time with many recognizable faces. BIG PROBLEM (2002), which also went on the readable scale on the suction o-meter.
