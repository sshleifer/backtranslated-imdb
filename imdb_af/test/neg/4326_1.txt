Look, some movies have ever been the worst. I suggest it could be India Song. When I saw the movie in 1976, it was at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, a place where people who care about film play. About half the point people simply flooded out of the theater. My girlfriend didn't want to leave us, but by the end the theater was virtually empty. I told people if they left that good part to come. And it was. The good part was the screen at the end which said "fin." It was the only good part. I'm still annoyed by this film 24 years later. It was pointless, stupid and distracted (Marienbad, part 2). See it only if you want to spend an infinite two hours learning to distinguish between just bad and just awful.
