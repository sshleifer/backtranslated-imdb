A blatant rip-off of "Air Bud", this movie is really about parents who worry too much about parenting. All the characters of the characters (eg adult coaches who do not know the game) are taken to the limit - so much so that they are absolutely incredible, not funny. <br /> <br /> There is no question of reality here, people and you will not develop sympathy for any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the instant (uniform) of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays. Perhaps chosen because the area is believed to be near Arlington Heights, IL, home to Columbus Crew's franchise player Brian McBride.
