A group of friends discover gold deep in an old mine. But by taking and thinking about the gold, they grew big, they awaken a long dead miner who is hell. He is protecting his treasure. "Miner's Massacre" is a chintzy b-horror movie in the extreme. You have all your famous clich√©s, your group of mentally handicapped teenagers, characters go on their own to investigate strange noises, a few pop-scares, the mysterious sheriff, the old lady who is all thinking nut. -colored Karen Black no less), and so on. Nonetheless, it is done in an amusing, non-pretentious way that entertaines the film in a "so bad, it's good" kind of way. The characters and dialog are what you would expect, known, routine and original from this type of movie. However, the actors all do a decent job, since I actually saw bigger-budget movies, it's kind of worse play (I know what you did last summer, somebody?) And add some credibility to the movie itself. The villain in this movie (The 49's) is of course derived from the rank of Jeepers Creepers, to the brown overcoat, the hat and the long white hair. Like the rank, he never spoke, and it's ugly to start. The gore is, in my opinion, somewhat disappointing. There are a few awful moments, but too much is out of the screen and the dead scenes are often laughable (Spoiler ahead!). There is a really hilarious moment when a girl is beheaded by the villain mentioned and to achieve this 'effect', the filmmakers hid the body of the body under the villain's coat, pulled out her head and put on a false blood placed her neck. Seriously, you can see the outline of her shoulders! I think they could have done a little better there, even though the budget was low (And I'm sure it was, but still?). The special effects are cheap but sufficiently effective and for the most part, moderately well done for a low budget film. The consequences of the guys or the director seem to be a thing of explosion and fire. Almost every scene at the end of the movie has set at least a few characters on fire (Always filmed in slow motion) or explode ANYTHING, be it a car or an old mining rock. Seriously, no one ever heard the term; "Stop, drop and roll"! "!?!? <br /> <br />" Miner's Massacre "entertaining, and as long as you don't have expectations through the roof, you'll have plenty of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I feel generous, so I will give it a 4/10.
