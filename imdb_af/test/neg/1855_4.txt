The real surprise of this effortless lightweight movie is how such a top roll is combined for nothing more than a hammie-uninspiring thing. Presumably it was a proverbial snowball that gathers a hill that fits, size and shape. One might think that Miranda Richardson was contacted by her agent, did the conversation: 'Do you want to write a movie in Dublin written by Neil Jordan? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already in! "It's a dull" comedy "that sees Michael Caine and Dylan Moran trying to pull out a well-planned pressure where Moran must imitate a London gang (whose arrival is on himself) for a substantial amount of cash from local king Michael Gambon to raise. The rest is simply a memorable skirt that is unfortunately quite fast. Moran is generously amusing in places, but this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hits such as Black Books. Caine is indisputable in its role and gives consistent performance without being overrun. One can only imagine what made him this movie - it can't even be a summer in Dublin, as many of the scenes look positive in the background. Gambon actually steals the show, and everyone who has caught his performances, such as: I have news for you, will know he's a wonderful funny man. But overall, the result is disappointing, and it seems like a lifetime ago that Neil Jordan made good films from the likes of Mona Lisa.
