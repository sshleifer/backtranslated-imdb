Wakayama Tomisaburo's depiction of refugee ex-Kaishakunin Ogami Itto felt completely natural. His attitude, his voice, his appearance - it all talked with disillusionment. When he got into a room, as well as characters on the screen, I could feel that he wasn't there and that his determination to be there was trouble. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere Wakayama actually took Kendo (Japanese swordsmanship) training and it will explain his comfort to the katana, which has shown great in every cutfest. When you look at the movies, from the moment he pulls, he turns off the sword, as if you see something inevitably ugly. He will even turn the katana quickly to flicker off the blood before wearing it and it will be effortless. <br /> <br /> Nakamura Kinnosuke's version is over as a version. It feels like he's trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story. As a result, I lost my grip every time because HE didn't really have a strong grip on the role. As if it were uncomfortable for him. <br /> <br /> The swordmaking in the TV series was also completely old school Hollyweird. Camera cut to mr. Nakamura's discomfort with the catana disguises, slow action, targets are silent, etc. Very bad, from the viewpoint of the viewer. There was a moment in the episode The Castle Wall Attack when Mr Nakamura drew his sword as a child. It was embarrassing. He handled it as if it were heavy! I almost fell off my chair. <br /> <br /> And let's be honest: The story is about an excellent sword fighter. Period. Heavy craftsmanship is a problem. <br /> <br /> Realism is not: the sword games in the movies were excellent and manga-like, as intended, I'm sure. (The baby car was equipped with a group of automated, fast-paced firearms run by a 3-year-old? Yes ... manga style.) This is how the story seamlessly weighs the historical cultural accuracy into basically superhero-fantasy that makes the movie fascinating. (Read Yoshikawa Eiji's Musashi [% Historical Legend]%!) I couldn't really sit through the episodes of the TV series. They just felt cheap. Look at the movies first and you'll know what I'm talking about.
