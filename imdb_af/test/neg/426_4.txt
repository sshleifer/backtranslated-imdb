Jeff Speakman never succeeded, except for the lowest ranks of martial artists turning actors (lower than Don "The Dragon" Wilson, for example) and with vehicles like "The Expert" you can see why. There are three major problems with this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say plots - is everywhere in the place, there are a few characters that get a lot of screen time but little purpose, 2) There are only 4 scenes in totally, some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some occur in the dark, 3) The music score is overwhelming and overbearing. Strange as it may seem, it's really the worst thing about this movie: the score tries to convince your perception that you are looking at some great epic, rather than the low-budget limited-action movie you are actually watching. With all that said, there is at least James Brolin to give a touch of credibility. * 1/2 out of 4.
