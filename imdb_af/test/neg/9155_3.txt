Big book, poorly done movie. Cheesy performances and facing situations make this movie a sentimental drill festival. Flat and uninspired work by most actors leaves this movie in the post-school special category. No doubt there is a lot of talent to be tackled in this role and crew, but something has gone terribly wrong. The very talented Gretchen Mol tries to pull this movie out of the ant, but even she doesn't seem to be over the foolish dialogue. Feel like everyone just phoned. Even the makeup (Mulrooney ages 20 years in the course of the film) looks amateur and rough. Don't waste your time on this clunker ... go read the book.
