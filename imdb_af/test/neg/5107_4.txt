When I first heard that the world would be, not enough video game for the Nintendo 64. I was so excited. When it finally came out, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented it for 7 days, and I got the whole game! The game was too easy and gave too many tips. A major-dissipative successor to GoldenEye. Take my advice and don't rent this game. <br /> <br /> Certainly the guns and gadgets are cool, but one gets tired of a watch that looks like GoldenEye's right, with the exception of a red color instead of a blue color. , a bad excuse for a pistol, a terrible stinker and a stump hook that just attaches to things that are yellow and black. <br /> <br /> I think RARE should be made this game instead of EA who has to stick to good-performing games, such as sports games and must get out of the first person shooters and make the masters work.
