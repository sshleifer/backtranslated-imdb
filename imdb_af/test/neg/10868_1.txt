This is what I liked while watching this movie. I mean the amount of nudity and sex was one thing, but another part of the movie that gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of story. Actually I just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie, but I persisted. I persisted in the hope that the storyline might get better, that there might be a good turn. But I couldn't be wrong anymore. In the end, I persisted, because I thought I could write a bad review for it, anything after looking at it. <br /> <br /> I mean, don't make me wrong. There is nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but if the director just shows it with a crook, think it's what the viewer wants. insult us all. To think we're all so level to see only burlesque of rep-ratable, big movie industry players are ominous. My advice: rent another movie.
