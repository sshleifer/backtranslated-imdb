Rent it from my local Blockbuster under the title SPECK - this can be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about serial killer Richard Speck, who killed several nurses in Chicago in the sixties. Watching the movie gives you the feeling that it follows the crimes after the letter. Unfortunately, this does not make for a good movie. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had was the almost constant music that let us know it was a SCARY MOVIE, and a few divine narratives that let us know what's motivating Speck. The acting was average for this type of film; To give credit where credit is due, the movie was photographed very nicely for my taste. Your mileage can vary. <br /> <br /> Everything, if you are interested in the subject, can be worth your while.
