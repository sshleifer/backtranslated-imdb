Rabbit Fever is one of those movie peculiarities. It is a pleasant 90 minutes, demands little from the viewer, and delivers so much, and on any terrestrial television channel, even in an excellent time slot, I think Rabbit Fever might rather be well received. Which makes me wonder why it was pushed into the theater. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed in the style of a television documentary, introducing us to 6 women who are addictive to the Rabbit Vibrator. The film is primarily aimed at investigating a supposedly addictive quality to the well-known sex drug product. The story is 100% in the cheek. <br /> <br /> The storyline is strong, an introduction to some well-rounded and fun characters, a nice storyline, peripheral characters and evolving situations into an engaging story. pleasant conclusions. Unfortunately, there is nothing that feels smart or new. <br /> <br /> Rabbit Fever has a few sharp moments, some switches that give a hint to what the writers are capable of, and all credit to them, it's not just 90 minutes of buttons, and I can surely see it. my mom But there is a laziness about some of the screens that have held it back, those moments you got for it, if you want to, and everything you get is a pop-up sit-com. <br /> <br /> I struggled, I left the scene, empathized with the characters, but I also thought that someone made a 90 minute rule for television, entertained and tried put it in the national movie. <br /> <br /> I think Rabbit Fever achieves some of its features, it's a weird topic, a well-rounded story, a great presentation and a good 90-minute distraction. But there is nothing that can justify the excess of a cinema environment. On the contrary, a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer the opportunity to get a breath of life that Rabbit Fever looks like.
