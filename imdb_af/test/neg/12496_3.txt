Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent who, however, prevents the murder of a senator while he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker on his tail. The tracker by the way is bent on ending Phillips. The most obvious inspiration for this low budget cheeseball action movie, of course, is Robocop and while the movie has some imagination and real energy, it has just a real life boxing champion running away from a robot. The movie is not that terrible, because it is just empty and repetitive. The story is written in clich√©s and the characters are set up to be cut through the various firearms. Don Wilson, as usual, is terrific. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (Poor)
