I was in 6th grade and this movie broadcast on PBS during a series of Wonderworks. I clearly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down the end of my face. In the film, Jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Due to a very simple but careless error, one of the two dies. I found the story very powerful at the time, because the fatal error is exactly the kind of mistake a child would make and so a child watching the movie would find it very easy to identify the emotional weight of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Last year I finally found a VHS copy of the show. I probably had to remember my memories. I watched the show as an adult. I was absolutely shocked at how horrible a movie it was. My girlfriend also had a similar reminder of the movie, and she was also very sad about how bad the movie is with her memories. <br /> <br /> Many adults probably have a good memory to watch this movie when they were kids. I strongly recommend that these people leave their memories altogether and avoid seeing this movie as an adult.
