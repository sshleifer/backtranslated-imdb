This movie is of interest to fans of the well-known rock band "The Band" in that singer / keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in various scenes. It seems to me that the film might have been shot a few years before 75, by judging Richard's appearance. Interestingly, Jones would later act with The Band's Levon in a much better movie, "Coal Miner's Daughter." Anyway, you really need a special reason to watch this tricky movie. Unfortunately, the famous sensitive Manuel will commit suicide. I've never heard him land in a movie. Four of the five band members will appear in another bad movie, "Man Outside."
