This film is a window in Britain's world in 1973 - a world of holiday camps, flags and birds. I was actually at Pontins Prestatyn while it was filmed, so it is fascinating to see where I was born, and what a world we left behind. The plot, as it is, relates to Stan and Jack's efforts to make a job at a holiday camp (25 per week!) To an opportunity to chase young women and liquidate Blakey. They are joined to the rest of Stan's family, and Arthur (Michael Robbins) and Olive (Anna Karen) are laughing at persistent chuntering, as well as the sheer strangeness of Blakey, but the idea that young women would like to see something in brilliantined Stan (Reg Varney) or lecherous Jack (Bob Grant) is not risible. Insecure enough in his time, now it's just an early age curio.
