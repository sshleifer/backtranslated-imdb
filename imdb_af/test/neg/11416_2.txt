"Stop while you lie" is a phrase they never learn. Typical Hollywood sequel: If the first movie was just shocking, the second was not the third worst to hit the screen this year. Even worse are the prequels, of which events have already been explained in detail. If you haven't even seen two movies, you won't like this one. It's like watching the Lord of the rings or Star Wars with the last trilogy movie. So "stand alone" this movie is not. <br /> <br /> Remember in the first film about Lucian's revenge? Remember the second about the long lost cruel brother? Well, if you saw those two 5 minute moments and glued them together, would you get it? a 5 min prequel. But the creator eater thought these 5 minutes were important historical events or just wanted to give some work to some actors, cast and crew and maybe make money in the process. "I have a lot of money, I make movies for a life and I'm bored. What will I do? I know, I'll make a movie." So anyway you get this 5 min prequel and you stretch it for 90 minutes ?? It's this movie. And you know what will happen to the most important "immortal" characters, so there is little tension. By the way, all the drama of the movie is in those 5 minutes. The only thing that made my eyebrow rise was that mama killed in the begging of the movie. Ill. The rest was Braveheart remix. If you want a comedy, Braveheart only sees this movie first. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to make a little rant? the movie put me in the mood. Who invented the concept of "vampire vs werewolf" in the first place? It's older than me and has just become so fast. And why do vampires look like Goth girls in heat, while werewolves look like psychos? Hide bad movies behind fission failed. Isn't it time, we have a purely slimmer weather waves with an upright posture? How can their immutable werewolves even breed if they all get ripe? And why did the vampires with all their powers not rule the world? Blue, blue, blue? What a waste.
