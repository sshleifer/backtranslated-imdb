Here are another great film critics will love. The problem is that it is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie show is simple. Nine prisoners escaped from a prison after the tenth fell and told them where the treasure was. <br /> <br /> The first half has lots of bangs, many of them wide, while the second half is a character-driven fantasy in fantasy and melancholy. <br /> <br /> The two halves simply don't mix. Individual scenes work very well. (The guys who collapse a friend's house with a new Philippine bride are hilarious. While a later scene with the big man in the restaurant's treadmills works at the heartbeat.) They simply don't touch each other. br /> <br /> The movie also misses the entire set-ups. One scene desperately wants the guys looking for change under an abandoned machine to buy a bite. The next scene put the entire crew in a suit in a restaurant. Where did they get the dresses and wigs? (The crew includes both the big man and a midget) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And the most mysterious is why are they dragging in? They are obviously guys in the grief. And since there is something more memorable than witnesses than a big man and a dwarf wearing a meal like women? I call the big man and the dwarf, because besides the old man everyone looks different in each other. (In fact, they wear most of the flickering white jumpsuits). The movie has very little character development in the first half and consequently the second half really has no emotional punch. As we often try to find out who is who in their individual outreach. <br /> <br /> In the second half all the wonderful versatile camera shots and great emotional moments and good symbolism film. It is also extremely slow which means a boring movie. 9 Souls is a big disappointment, the reviews are about a good movie and it is there somewhere, and it's good to find it yourself.
