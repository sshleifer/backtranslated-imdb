It's a movie about a black man buying an airline and turning the company into an African hub over the top airport. They even portray the owner because he is not only in charge of the airline, but also controls part of the airport at the airport. One day this man wins $ 100 million a next time you see him, he runs across the airport like the owner of the airport. Everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this movie screams parody! This movie is a flop and will be in the $ 4.95 bin at Wal-Mart forever. <br /> <br /> I can't even say why MGM will waste $ 16 million on this movie. This movie does not guarantee straight-to-video status. The writers (one black and one white) must be blown out of Hollywood forever. Not only about stereotypical blacks, they portray them as ignorant people. I would be ashamed to go to a movie that humiliates me constantly. Don't waste your time at the video store, wal-mart, pay-per-view, or on a Sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on TBS.
