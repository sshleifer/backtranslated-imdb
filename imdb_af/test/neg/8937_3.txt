A less than redemptive hunka junk who is graciously free from the suffering of skill. Some northern idiots come to the deep South, looking for some confederate guns stacked on the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are threatened by scary hillbillies, in a broad nod to Liberation; but it seems the hicks stand in front of a northern marijuana trafficking badass. It is revealed so early that it cannot even qualify as a spin. The women were imprisoned and raped in catatonia; rather than saving them, the guys went to town to get the sheriff, who was lazy and didn't believe them. I think if my girlfriend is raped, I want to take the shortest route to the shelter. That's right, because once they hurt the bad things, the girls are all cheerful and hopefully around, if only in real trauma. Also with a backwoods man with a beard who makes lots of tiles. Not exactly bursting at the seams with ideas.
