It looks like an exciting prospect, a modern dress "Othello" with Christopher Eccleston, which was so terribly good in "Shallow Grave" and especially "Jude" and Eamonn Walker, who brought such intensity and introspection to its key role. on "Oz." One would see both of them natural Shakespeare, but both artists were blaming: Walker's Othello is a reasonable cookie cutter, with a whispering delivery that doesn't make much of an impact; and Eccleston scares it terribly like Iago, almost blinking at the camera, almost a scandalous parody of the role. It is likely that he was demanded by his director, whose florid approach could have worked better with the Elisabeth language, but which seems a striking, pretentious choice for this modernized script. And the script itself is less disappointing to be modern than it goes without saying? It is as if Andrew Davies sketched the famous plot and then just wrote what made the first dialogue in his head. All in all, a failure. 4 out of 10.
