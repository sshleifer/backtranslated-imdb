I read about every big book about the Manhattan project. Most people know what it was, but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project. Its scope was unmistakably massive - in the history of the United States, perhaps only through the space program of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There were - literally - millions of people who were involved from all walks of life in many areas (most clandestine) across the country, each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project they could not talk about the person sitting in their next door, much less their family. The logistics are overwhelming, especially given the considerations of war communication, security and transportation in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> As an example - my colleague's dad was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the Manhattan project. His job was to oversee a crew of about 30 other carpenters, who were responsible for producing concrete molding molds for the massive research installations in Hanford, Washington. That's all he did six days a week for almost two years. These carpenters need food, housing, sanitary facilities, hospitals and materials as much as Oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid. Just think about it! That being said, it is simply impossible to do the subject justice in a 2-hour movie. In defense of Joffe, however, I would say they had an impossible task, especially because he chose to have a diverse script with multiple sites, polygons and multiple characters. What did he think exactly and how could he be so arrogant to think it would work? That's Hollywood, I think. Vetman and little boy have so many mistakes that it will take a book to list them all. Terrible casting. Terrible (and politically motivated) writing. Bad science. The portraits of Groves and Oppie are especially inaccurate and straight gallows. Despite the show's everyday agenda, it's still incredibly vague and messy. <br /> <br /> These errors were listed elsewhere on IMDb, but I was particularly impressed by the fact that scientists had so much time on their hands - softball, horse riding, parties, semi-formal meals, ballet, etc. , not to mention romance, and of course, circulation of political petitions. According to FM & LB, if this big brain got their duffers and actually spent time in the lab instead of seducing Laura Dern, we could have won the war for D-Day. <br /> <br /> One last grip - - FM & LB mentions that the "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were the codename of the two atomic bombs, but it does not mention that these names are a semi-benign jab Groves ("Fat Man") was for heavy stature and Oppenheimer ("Little Boy" for his light size). Another reason why Paul Newman should not have been in this movie ...
