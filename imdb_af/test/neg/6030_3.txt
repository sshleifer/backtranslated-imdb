I don't think this movie had the effect on me that was meant to be: as American soldiers shot wounded soldiers from the other side and shot wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them to make them speak, I was other side rooted. It made sure that US forces looked like "the good guys". Was it supposed to be acceptable?
