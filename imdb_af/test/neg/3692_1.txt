In Moscow, priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to lead him into the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) who is missing while legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell investigated under the city. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. I'm totally disappointed as this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't understand how Val Kilmer accepted to participate in this production. There are two shameful reviews in IMDb that promote this movie and they are typically fake, written by users with only one review in this site. There are two possible ways to see this boring and horrible movie: my wife and I have many times because of the monotony of this senseless story, and we used the rewind button of the DVD to repeat every lost scene. The right way, however, is to use the quick or stop button to end this crap faster. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cidade Sombria" ("Dark City")
