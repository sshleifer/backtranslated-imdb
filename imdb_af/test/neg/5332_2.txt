This movie is bad as we all know it will be. Usually I usually like the bad 80s / early 90s trash comedy (haha no pun intended). I list Ski School, Career Opportunities, Hot Shots, Summer School and many more around this time. It even has the classic but forgotten comedy by Dean Cameron (aka Ski School Section 8 Instructor and Party Maniac for Summer School). But this movie is just too slow. It takes almost 30 minutes to go and we need to put in a useless dialogue between the semi-finals of the Sheen boys (E&C). And yes, I can hear the bloggers die killing me "in order of course you don't see 2 and 1/2 men. Well, Charlie was not at the level he is in this movie now ... He is now worth the look, Charlie just shines when his fellow stars support him and Emilio is no more than an over-utilized miracle offering little support, actually this movie is written by Emilio and it shows. has no real ending (come to Emilio, even the ski school 2 authors have ended.) No idea how a problem was solved, no hot babes, no curse to alleviate the bad plot, characters, acting "I'm tired of these tirades now. Just save your time and watch the movies I listed above. You'll enjoy them a lot more.
