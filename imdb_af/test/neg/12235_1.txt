This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. His attempts to parody various sports films are half-baked and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Even funny things - like the Indian female kicker who always wears a traditional dress over her uniform - aren't really funny. The fact that the soccer team is studying and getting good grades that make the coach bad does not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot to get a traditional loser gets another chance by coaching a looser high school team has really had potential as a spoof. It's a classic and sporting theme. But unfortunately, the screenplay was too weak for ANY threw to pull it off. And that is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is free use of women in bikinis and underwear, so it's not bad. <br /> <br /> But Animal House or Talladega Nights, that's not.
