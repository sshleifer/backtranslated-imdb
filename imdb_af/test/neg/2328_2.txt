I had high hopes for this David Lynch, which I really like movie, but the poor who are all acting, but Naomi Watts was the first idea that it was a waste. Some Twin Peaks characters are recovered in this movie, but it wasn't terrible, it wasn't interesting (except for the topless Watts scenes) and the features were poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I'll probably give Lynch another chance, but the hype around this movie just doesn't matter, especially for those of us who saw Eraserhead when it first came out.
