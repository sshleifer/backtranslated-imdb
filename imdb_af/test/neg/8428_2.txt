Historically terrible. Barely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity. One cannot keep up with the contradictions while you look. As with all songs and loaded movies, nobody bothered to ask any rail consultants. Events and techniques not even created until the next century are shown. One of the shots of runners jogging in a 400-meter high-performance actor portraying the high-jump and jumping star winner, one has to know absolutely nothing about the job of getting even. Probably thrown in 1984 as a tribute to the games just before the Los Angeles Olympics.
