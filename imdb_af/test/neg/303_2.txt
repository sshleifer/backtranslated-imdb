This movie was previously done. It's basically an unauthorized combo of "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Sordid Lives." There are a few funny bits, but otherwise it's a clich√© drill. It is a good first film attempt and the director (who is also in the play) shows a lot of promise. But the author was kind of brackets and the story wasn't very original. I swear I heard some of the lines in other movies. However, the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to see that gay-themed movies are not so tampered with with political correctness and tired stories of anxiety. The main character looks pretty well adapted to a gay teenager in rural Texas, so no saccharin, come out here drama!
