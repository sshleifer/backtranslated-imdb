*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've seen since last year, "The Village." An insult to anyone of any intelligence. Poorly written and surprisingly confronted. No one, especially in Los Angeles, speaks the way these characters do. No subtle. If the point of this movie is to say that "we all have a bit of crossbeam in us", he does a horrible job of saying the obvious. Not only was his point clear basis, but every character in this movie was incredibly dumb. The carbon scene almost made me run, along with the rescue and oh, the whites of DUTY Rookie COP don't forget an exciting black rogue and ... I can go on and on. Terrible, just terrible.
