On the positive side, it contains interesting information on a wide variety of topics, especially with Himmler, the SS and their research department. It also has good keyboard music, some interesting footage and excellent camera work. <br /> <br /> However, this is a very poor piece of historical work. It has no clear purpose and the whole thing can be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> Himmler has set up a department in the SS for research on the origin of the German race. They went all over the world. They did a few things and launched expeditions to all sorts of places ... (none of these roads were investigated, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refusing). They wanted to find out that the Aryan race and the German people were one and the same through historical evidence. They didn't find anything. The members of this research group were chief professors, members of the SS and thus linked to the Holocaust, and were considered OK after the war, and led German institutions. <br /> <br /> These facts are intriguing in themselves, but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that condemns or exempts these people. It also does not seem to be the purpose of the program, but the purpose of the program is unclear. It's hopefully from topic to topic. The witnesses, although presented credibly, are few and do not support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program doesn't know where it goes or why and doesn't impress. The topics are fascinating, but this program is trying to tackle a large area of ​​research and therefore does not seem to know what is going on. I will avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also the "Holy Grail" is the German bloodline, nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology except in passing. Mentions of expeditions to search for the Christian Holy Grail are made, but never followed. The title is misleading and the content of this documentary is inconclusive and incomplete.
