I saw this movie when it was first released in 1986. Then I was young and I enjoy all the normal comedies available, viz. Monty Python, Jim Belushi and SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech & Chong, so I believe my judgment represents most "healthy" individuals. <br /> <br /> The absolute best part of this movie was the trailer that was initially played. of the movie for the new "My Little Pony" movie that came out. <br /> <br /> This movie was so horrific that it actually came from most theaters before the initial weekly run was completed. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that anyone will waste their corporate money to replicate this steaming hope of human waste. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money to rent or watch this "movie".
