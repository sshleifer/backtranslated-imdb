Another movie from Swedish hill country, which is always the northern part. If black people are shown in this way, there will be screaming about racism and good reasons. <br /> <br /> It's a farce and you have to laugh at the "smart" farce clich√©s. But this is usually tiring. A Gangster comedy, with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) find. And most of all, of course, is Norwegian, according to Stockholm bias. <br /> <br /> Andreas Wilson is the only one trying to make a show that reminds us of reality. It's not funny. It's not even exciting. A burlesque to mourn to make you interested in any way.
