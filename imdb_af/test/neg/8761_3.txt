<br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in the Bayou, Larry Adams (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington (Mauritz Hugo) are informed that a friend has died. At the meeting with local dr. Von Altermann, (John Carradine), he repeated the idea that they were mysteriously dead. While they were there, they realized that the help consisted of zombies, revived dead people doing their master's bid. As the bodies accumulate, he reveals that he used the creatures in different experiments and tried to stop him before it was too late. <br /> <br /> The Good News: It gets very little right. The opening is easy, it's best because it has several great points for it. From where it starts, with the Greek silhouettes in the dark until the revelation, these miracles work for both his mystery and a great image. The big one is a real scene where the creature comes from a coffin in a long, slow and creepy shot. This is all done before the opening credits and is a fun face. The screens in the waist where the creatures in the coffin wake up are pretty cool and look really good. The last big positive is the very fun end. With the kind of termination that feels like so many universal efforts, this one fits into the style. From the creepy reanimation to the right action that is close to the swamp, this one is fun and really works with the other to just give it a real positive. <br /> <br /> The Bad News: This one has just a few bugs. , but they are big. The first is the movie's biggest boredom of inactivity. Almost nothing happens here, mainly because of the tendency to do everything with speaking rather than anything else. There are only intermittent scenes that have been moved to the zombies, but there is nothing here that spends any action on the movie. This one simply has no action, and it hurts the movie. It seldom generates a scene that is of interest, and it sometimes makes it much longer than it really is. The last mistake in the movie is pathetic excuses for zombies. Those who use more modern rates will find it difficult to get any fear from these creatures, and they actually only serve multiple scenes. It doesn't treat the zombies as threats, and makes them even less frightening. Small screen time, non-threatening nature and impossible behavior of these zombies destroy this one. It is here that really hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: With bad zombies and almost anything worth watching, this one is a weird attempt. Those used to find modern zombies find little interest in this one and come out the same as this one, while only classic horror fans are advised to give it. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating PG: Mild Violence
