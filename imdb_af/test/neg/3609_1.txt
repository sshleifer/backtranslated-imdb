To think that it could only get better was the worst assumption I ever made. <br /> <br /> Drivers don't describe this movie enough! <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot thin, but I get more emotional from my pet fish! <br /> <br /> It was a pity to see Pete Postlethwaite, who I respect as an actor trying best with the little he had to work. <br /> <br /> I think a cardboard cut from Stephen Baldwin would do a better job and was actually more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! It can be really dangerous for your health!
