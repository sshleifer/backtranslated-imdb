Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made up of a lot of rank amateurs who succeed in coming down as a kind of semi-professional movie. Unfortunately, the poor effects, woodworking and inexplicable story make it a very mediocre atrocity at best. Dark Harvest is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen. It's just nothing special and has nothing to justify a second watch or hope for a successor. You know a director has uncertainty about their own horror movie when a) there are some senseless celebrities and b) the movie is so short, they add a bit of boring outings to the end credits that no one really cares about because the movie was not so good! A slightly better movie I can't help feeling was the inspiration for Dark Harvest, the eight-year-old movie "Scarecrows", which is a good movie but still fairly average. Dark Harvest is not so bad some of the other comments say it is, don't think you'll be very entertained either. One thing I should also comment on is the character of Angela who has a very terrible English accent! What was the point in that? To give it a certain touch of the class? Yes right! English people DO NOT say "WAAHTAAH" if they mean to say "water" and I don't care what part of England they are! If you can't find a true English actress or a non-English actress who can bring a brilliant English accent (not many of them), DO NOT BOTH! Wow! Final Score: 4/10
