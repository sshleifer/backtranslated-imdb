Jon Stewart (aka John Liebowitz) constantly collects conservatism and anything Republican. This liberal cartoon is anything else, as he throws his cut "humor" into the throat of impressive youths. I watched the show while I was in a waiting room while my car was being repaired and the man bound to treason. He will take Al Queda's side over Bush every day. He is shameless and everything he says is spelled out by a false track. I remember four years ago when he had an interview with John Kerry. The two made faces on each other which seemed to be a make-up session. It was like, "Get a room, you guys." Not only do I love cute little traitors who provoke their propaganda. Call my level. The Daily Show had a long term and there are many beloved liberals who have a hatred for republicans and conservatism. I'm not surprised at his success, but do many people actually look at Comedy Central? That Mancia guy makes me goof.
