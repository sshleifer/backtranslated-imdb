I was unable to keep this terrible movie for ten minutes. In the age of DV cameras, it looks like it was shot at VHS without the help of any color correction or microphone. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker myself, I know the limitations of film making and even these things in mind, I am surprised that movies can be made so weak. <br /> <br /> The only praise I can offer is that this movie is distributed, as I have seen much better movies that are still modestly domestic or international release. I guess the box is what it sold ... it has good craftsmanship, but it all goes down there. <br /> <br /> Kantnoot: The director seems to have 11 friends as no one on The planet will give this movie a "10".
