It's as if someone has taken a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting theatrical wisdom we have to go through. <br /> <br /> Now let me go by saying how much I love Chinese fantasy movies. Of fun and stupid, to those who focus on martial arts, to the more dramatic and romantic types? This is a genre I enjoy very much. Movies such as "A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box" and "A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella" (both written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "The bride with white hair"; "Butterfly & Sword"; "Green Snake"; "A Chinese Ghost Story"; "Swordman II"; "Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain"; "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"; and others. That's why I'm looking forward to "a Chinese Tall Story." One of the characters of the movie is the Monkey King (aka Sun Wukong), a well-known character in Chinese mythology, which was first told in the story of the "Journey to the West", the epic adventure about 500 was written years ago. (The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also the focus of the "Chinese Odyssey" films, among others). Other famous characters appearing in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujing. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong? Well, let's take an example for Western audiences. What about the Robin Hood mythology? A well-known story from the old days. Let's say we played Robin Hood movie Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood, and Haley Joel Osment as Friar Tuck. Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez. Let's also give Sir Robin a Uzi, because you never know when to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham. They may also need rocket packs, and while we are on it, they give a tactical nuclear weapon as it may be useful. If you think it sounds like a real narrative of the Robin Hood story, then a Chinese Tall Story is the movie for you! As I mentioned above, this movie is a mess. In the first 30 minutes we are not only exposed to Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing, but also to the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main character), kidnapped children, a "millennium bug demon" (which shoots laser beams ), an underground Tree God, a lizard tribes, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the Lord Chancellor Tortoise, a Sea Dragon King, an ever-magical golden staff, a chatterbox imp girl, wormholes in the space and the Four Heavenly Knights. All these things won't be bad - the stories and myths that have passed over the years certainly have all sorts of fantastic elements. But I assure you that Chinese mythology does not include many of the things we are going through in the last half of the film. (Useful advice for the filmmakers: Just because your computer effects parents can come up with cool search spaces and images of intergalactic war doesn't mean they should be.) <br /> <br /> You know your Chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks (and I don't make it up, it's a direct quote from the comment). "I asked the composer if we could have a more rock-and-roll type of music if she changed some kind of android-like thing." Is there a story hidden here somewhere? Yes. Yes there is. Most of the adventures follow Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse? Gen-X Cops, "Time and Tide", "My Schoolmate the Barbarian") and Meiyan, the lizard girl (played by Charlene Choi and a computer) . Choi is the best thing about this movie. You can know her as half of the Canto pop group Twins and other movies like The Twins Effect (Just One Look) (a surprisingly good drama / romance / comedy). Poor Choi, which is a lizard and everything, is barely recognizable by her warts, cut teeth, doughy nose and knocked back. This is until the computers get hold of her and beautify her, which makes it somehow worse. Tse is wise, but all the supporting actors were unnecessary. A few recognizable faces in little parts are wasted. <br /> <br /> At one point I talked to myself whether a Chinese Tall Story was a spoof. I was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very nice Fan Bing Bing) stuck out a Marlboro (!) While talking to Tripitaka who was martial art in a Spider Man costume (!!). But it's not a spoof. Of course, there is a typical Hong Kong silliness, but the movie takes itself seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (with a hamstring of violets and voice-oriented cells) and exciting action and adventure. <br /> <br /> You might think you could see it on a Netflix rental and it won't cost you anything. (Oh, but it'll cost you good.) <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say? Sure. The colors are alive (they are the best aspect of this movie). And the filmmakers definitely tried very hard. All the trouble went into a movie that's not much more than a bad video game.
