This movie is so daring it doesn't try to hide its similarities with The Shining. It doesn't have the originality to do this. And when it does, try to cover his story. "Dad goes psycho under the influence of a skeletal haunt in a strange place." It does so by bending a few other already established conventions and ideas. In other words, it reduces him to mere cliche. But hell, even I enjoy a good predictable horror or thriller, as long as there is an interesting story, one with violence and gore, somewhere before the movie the terrible turn into predictable and thin. Well, this movie doesn't have a good story and I was really disappointed with it. What 'Darkness' goes for is remarkable direction and cinematography. It's a well-shot movie that has been carefully built up, full of fun, flu corners and shots. What "darkness" does not go for is almost everything else. To start with a small issue - editing in this movie is unattractive. It jumps from one scene to the next, sometimes meaningless. For example, the old man in the film (who carries the background story pretty much, which is later completed by another character) is underlined by a hamster cycle. I mean, it looks cool for the first time, but why use the same picture? I think you should see it for yourself, to understand what I mean. Another problem with this movie is Anna Paquin's character, which mostly blows, cries and cares over the whole movie - she is the failed attempt of the movie to make a character-driven horror movie. The movie has plays of overwhelming sentimentalism and the family drama it portrays is simply not credible. By the end, 'Darkness' is a confused melodrama, with a non-covenant secret that is too easy to end. And it's hardly scary.
