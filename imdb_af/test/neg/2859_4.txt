Pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie. It's not terrible either. <br /> <br /> The play was at least on Pinocchio's wood. The dolls have had 2 expressions. If most of the actors, except oddly enough ... have the secondary characters ... Most of them were nice over. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this are beautiful "B" and, as I said earlier, the puppet has really blown. <br /> <br /> The two best scenes in the movie are the knife by hand ... looks good, I think they spent about a third of the budget on it ... and the shower scene ... WOW ... I think they had the other 2 / 3rds of the budget to talk to the actress who did that scene to do it. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it's a bit below the average "b" horror pop movie ... rent Chucky if you're an urge to kill dolls. <br /> <br /> The story had some interesting ideas, enough to make me look at the end.
