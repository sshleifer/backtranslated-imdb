To be honest, I didn't see much of this show. Probably because it was not as good as the original M * A * S * H, but I want to remind them to post it on the weekly schedule. Some shows just aren't worth walking around every week. But I first tried, so it wasn't bad. Maybe I just expected to improve it, but I can't give this show a 1. In all honesty I can't give it more than 2. <br /> <br /> It wasn't MASH (I'm not going to type those dumb * every time). And it was trying to be MASH without doing any effort, as it would just magically happen. Well guess what? No magic. The best thing I can do here is to compare it to other shows. <br /> <br /> Trapper John, M.D. was a much better performance by far. However, they had to call it B.J. Hunnicut, M.D. because Pernell Roberts looks exactly like an older BJ, but not like Trapper John. Keep everything else the same, just change its name and the name of the show. Presto! After MASH was not the only prosecutor to completely bomb and defame the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame follow-up of All In The Family. It had no heart, no conflict, no depth? all the things that made everything in the family so memorable. Similarly, MASH was funny because the doctors responded to the impossible absurdity of the war. Remove the war and remove the row for 99% of humor. Potter can't shout at Klinger for wearing a dress, because Klinger doesn't wear a dress because he's not being kicked out of the army because he's already out of the army because the war is over. (breathing) All the jokes are forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the viewer, to stay around and see the show. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, the whole show was Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy, who are just unnatural there. a trio of Vaudeville artists. It was reminiscent of Good Times, where they stood 90% of the show behind the couch and talked to the audience, trying to make them look natural. They were not. And it feels even less natural on After MASH. <br /> <br /> Another random timing I remember is that people who made MASH never received royalties from the spin-off. The studio uses the absurd excuse that After MASH was really a devastation of the movie MASH (which they own) and not the TV series. Nice tried, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie, and he was never deaf. I think the studio executives will do everything for a goat. Anything other than making a worthy successor, that is.
