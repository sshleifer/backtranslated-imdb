Where to start ?? I think only three other movies led me to post a review on IMDb, and everyone was positive. In this regard. <br /> <br /> Apparently, horrible, tragic, embarrassing, catastrophic, stupid, annoying, completely and completely over. <br /> <br /> I was saved, it made, never give up a theatrical release. I think I'm literally in shock. <br /> <br /> I'm not a snob. I didn't expect beautiful movie-making or intense character-depth, but it's really beyond joke. We just have to claim more of the movies we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like the Black Death.
