Some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, some Marines and scientists are in control of the scorpion project to the sub to get their load. After finding 200 corpses, the Navy commander told the doctor: "I need to know if there's something here that could be a danger to my men." Uh, give ... do you think? She refuses to tell him what is there, with the mention "must know". Yup, that's pretty good. One of the scientists is apparently some idiot savant - heavy on the idiot, light on the savant. He has the task of fixing the lights. He finds the control panel for the lights, cuts a wire, and screams like a banshee. Then he does it again. Then he takes a hammer and breaks the control panel into pieces, causing all the lights on the submarine to start working. <br /> <br /> And so it goes. Apparently it was made in Sweden; I am not sure whether Sweden has a very strange sense of humor, or if they are just really horrible movie makers. I tend to think they are terrible movie makers. If you guess there's a big explosion at the end of this thing, well, sorry, but it's on a need-to-knowledge basis, so I can't tell you. <br /> <br /> If you have I should definitely watch a giant scorpion movie, let me imagine Tail Sting, who is a cheesy and fun movie about scorpions on a plane, or Bugs, what a Reasonable descent B movie about scorpions in a tunnel. Watch this movie as an absolute last resort. Oh, it's vigilant, it's hard to turn it off just because of its mere insanity, but it's all about it.
