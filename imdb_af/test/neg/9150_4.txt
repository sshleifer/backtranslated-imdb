Yes, it is true that it is Jessica Alba who leads me to this movie because without her I should never have chosen it. <br /> <br /> But I find it long, boring and, above all, original. All the time I thought the story was full of clich√©s and the direction very boring. So it was a surprise to see that the director and writer were the same person. I take note of remembering to avoid all of his next movies. It is a pity that all good things were at hand: Malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the British Empire and the movie is wonderful: Jessica knows how to open her soul and for once, she found a suitable movie for this . Bob Hoskins showed a great experience and he had to win an award for this role. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is that it makes me see a world map to find this island, because if you think this is happening in South Asia, you don't know exactly where! Oh, the little plane flight with red lines in the Indiana Jones movie !!!
