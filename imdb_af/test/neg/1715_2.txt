I really enjoyed Tycus, if not much more than the production values ​​mock. Dennis Hopper was good, although I wonder if he'd signed on the project, he saw the special effects they used. And further, what was the scene with the ninja? It was just totally out of step. Maybe someone with the bright idea came mid-shooting. Oh yes, this movie is great if you are drunk and need a good laugh. Cheers.
