Visitors are a hard, hard movie to enjoy. It was so slow and led in the pacing that I sometimes drifted off during the film. It was about 11am on a hot, sunny day. I might not add a cold winter night at midnight, so you get an idea of ​​how slow this movie is. Strange thing is, it's not long. At 100 minutes, it's just ten minutes longer than the average straight to the video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf I watched the day very happy. It's just a terrible piece, enough to lose your interest. <br /> <br /> If it doesn't fail the S-L-O-O development for the atmosphere, visitors are good enough to act to make it impossible how slow things happen. While flashbacks are both inexpensive and annoying as a way to eradicate Radha Mitchell's sham, the ghost stories / strangers / who are actually rather creepy and effective, especially when her suicidal mother arrives and starts sniffing at night. Full points for the consuming makeup all over the shop as well. The single boat is a creepy place, and sometimes the movie uses the full power of the place and the deserted sea to scare you from hell. <br /> <br /> However, I find it difficult to recommend visitors. I found out that I didn't just watch a 4-hour movie, not a 100-minute movie, but also felt that I was somehow in the mood, as if I had a lot of explanations about the ghostly (Mind games? Real ghosts? Space aliens?) Visitors don't choose one for definite. All that Radha Mitchell looks at is talking to her cat and Dominic Purcell is not melting for a clear reason about an inexplicable horrific past. Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he tells you what happened, but crazy / silly, you might think so. If you don't watch a lot of these movies, your fresh perspective will probably improve, but I found this slow, boring and highly-derived. If you want to scare yourself, there are many better places to do this. If you want a smart thriller, there is much smarter.
