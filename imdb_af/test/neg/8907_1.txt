Honestly, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for a bad play. (Heather Graham can never survive ... it has three titles for a reason - to protect the culprits!), Beautifully bad dialogue ("Do you like it ... ribs?"), And a plot just " a mother can approve, it is your entertainment on Friday night! <br /> <br /> My roommate rented it under the title "Terrified" because he liked Heather Graham, but afraid of what we felt after the final credits. Not because the movie is frightening, but because someone actually paid money to make this maze on a movie. <br /> <br /> Horrible movie. There are a few no-name actors who offer unintentional comedy, but nothing is worth watching. Heather Graham's dramatic climax was also one of the most pathetic and disturbing things I've ever seen. I don't give this movie a point, and may God be merciful to his soul.
