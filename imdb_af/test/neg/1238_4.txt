I'm not sure these reviews contain spoilers, but I'm playing it safe by indicating that it might be. It is unlikely that anyone will see this film that is not familiar with the book. <br /> <br /> There is an old wisecrack on how to work and bring a mouse. "Comanche Moon" is such a mouse. <br /> <br /> The novel focuses more on the Indians than the Americans. In adapting it to TV, McMurtry and Osanna rightly argued that the audience would be more interested in whites than the reds. Unfortunately, there is little in the novel that we do not already know about Gus, Woodrow and their friends. So the movie usually gives us a prominent front-rash of what will happen in Lonesome Dove. The Indians - who have told their own story - are largely rejected in the background - so much so that someone who has not read the novel will really wonder why it is titled "Comanche Moon". <br /> <br /> The novel has no overall story line, or much of a "point". It could be solved in the movie by losing the contrast between the Indians who were losing their countries and lifestyles to those Americans who were "civilizing". This opportunity was missed. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Lone Dove", Comanche Moon has some elaborate scenes that develop character or relationships - at least among Americans. The extensive scenes with the Indians were largely removed or shortened. And for a (just) four-hour movie, it's remarkably episodic and messy. One gets the feeling that the scrip was originally longer and cut to reduce production costs. <br /> <br /> The script consists mainly of clich√© dialogue, aphorisms and platitudes. Come from the author of "The Last Picture Show", this is a surprisingly bad writing. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to solve story and characterization problems, but did not. <br /> <br /> Some of the best dialogue from the novel is missing or changed, for no apparent reason. For example, Clara (Cassie) shows her intense hatred of Woodrow (Jack) by condemning Gus (Ennis) because he always runs out with his "pard". That little little revelation of Clara's sexual jealousy is gone. Then there's the scene where frightened Woodrow Maggie warns not to make Jake Spoon compromise. The exchange in the novel is shorter and harder; the movie shows off, and does not expose Woodrow to the socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone he is. (When I read that scene in the novel, I wanted to knock Woodrow in the stomach - or worse.) There are other changes, some of them understandable. Inish Scull's eyelids are not cut off; To do this would like expensive CGI needed. But Buffalo Hump has no hump! (Perhaps it was unreasonable to ask West Studi to move such a large prosthesis.) And Buffalo Hump's character is "kindler and gentler". He's not as violent as he was in the novels. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this nearby turkey is Steve Zahn's remarkable performance - not so much as Gus McCrae, but as Robert Duvall plays Gus McCrae. It's rude. He duplicates Duvall's ways and manner of speech, without ever being "deliberately" or self-conscious. Like Duvall, he is completely "inside" the character. And he actually shows that in the third part our Gus becomes more Gus. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "Comanche Moon" is that it doesn't spoil our love for Lonesome Dove, not just a great Western, but a great American movie. <br /> <br /> PS: For those who think Rachel Griffiths was above, she was in the book.
