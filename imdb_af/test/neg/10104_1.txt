This film is truly pathetic in every imaginable section. terrible, terrible, terrible. It's only about eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol movie (then twenty hours in the Empire State building will be much more interesting). <br /> <br /> Where to start ... the bad writing, the disgusting cinematography, the bad his bad acting, the spectacular dull effects, terrible music, or just the wafer thin plot that looks like a sieve . This movie is a disjointed shambles. A particularly notable scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, the waitress looking through the cafe window commenting on an average English accent. "God damn". To fix that woman. God condemns this terrible monstrosity. <br /> <br /> Everyone involved must be ashamed of themselves. Let's hope the director never gets the money to work again.
