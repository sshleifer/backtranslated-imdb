Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good TV director with some good full length for his credit, "Homegrown" is just a mess in his writing and direction. Despite appearances by Billy Bob Thorton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, the movie can't save. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaalics will know that Jake and Maggie are in the movie, but you don't see very well and Maggie is only 30 seconds before as a babysitter who turns Lithgow's character off a bust. It's not even a lowbrow pot comedy as the movie was meant to be. It just wasn't funny.
