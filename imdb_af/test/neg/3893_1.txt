Don't get me wrong, I love a good movie and after watching The Thin Red Line (and like it), I was eager to find Terrence Malick's two previous films, and I just saw how I watched the Days of Heaven, my enthusiasm to see Badlands virtually disappeared. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of rave about the beautiful photography, but I saw this movie on a terrible old vhs band, which looks very horrible. All I can say is I hope photography was wonderful because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this movie. Not since the replacement murderers I fell asleep during a movie. This movie felt so long (and it wasn't!), The editing was sloppy and unfounded, the storyline didn't exist, the voice over was an incoherent rhythm, the characters developed poorly and the whole thing was unfinished . I know Malick was uncertain about how to do the movie. He then shot a lot of footage and then worked out for two years in an effort to cut it all together. It is very clear on the screen. Everything seems cut, every time a scene looks like it is momentum (or a character development), it will cut down obtrusive screens of people who are boring. It was as if someone was trying to collect a story from stock images of people who farm. The few good points are the music and the chase scene near the end, but those things aren't close enough to keep interest. I will normally pass a bad movie without being tuned, but if it is so high, something has to be said. <br /> <br /> Maybe a farmer would like it?
