And the worst is that it could have been good. But something terribly wrong. First thing first, they shouldn't have been in this movie Amitabh Bachchan. He's too much of an icon to tackle such a delicate and controversial topic, let alone the role itself. <br /> <br /> Second, Ram Gopal Varma should be ashamed of the classic story of Lolita and make it into a pathetic predictable slut's feast. His Lolita is called Jia (played by newcomer Jiah Khan) and when we meet her, she is without any intrusion of stolen innocence or that delicate naivety one would normally associate with the intricate story of the original Lolita that is in the original story gradually nymphet. Varma's Jia is already a whore with her eye on the prize, even before the camera meets her. And he doesn't practice chastity in the way his films are his leading novelty. From constant panning shots from her cross to fixations on her vulgar gestures and ways, Varma sure he doesn't have one person in the audience less than uncomfortable with his voyeuristic pedophile camera angles. <br /> <br /> Let's not talk about the non-existent chemistry between Jia and her so-called friend Ritu (Bachchan's character's daughter). These girls are supposed to be best friends, but look like worst enemies even before something goes wrong between them. Nothing they do together is credible until they become enemies. Perhaps Mr. Varma worked on that aspect of his screenplay rather than focusing on destroying any credibility that Amitabh Bachchan might have left as an actor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is perhaps the subordinate depiction of the character of Bachchan's character's wife. Her role was so underwritten and ludicrous that it was impossible to really feel sorry for her. I actually felt like hitting in the screen to not react to her like any normal woman would. Instead, she just stood there and there was Irritated and Helpless, because I think many of the viewers of this movie may feel after watching this train wreck of a movie. Look at your own risk.
