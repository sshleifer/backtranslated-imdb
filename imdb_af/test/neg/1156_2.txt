I'm a big fan of horror movies, and know a lot about serial killers. It is clear that the director of this one refused to investigate the film he made because half of the movie was fictitious. More than that, the character of Ed Gein is portrayed in the wrong light. I didn't rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend Erica. I hired it to watch Ed Gein and his legendary story. This movie was terrible, the only reason I gave it 2 out of 10 was because the gore wasn't bad. Acting = Horrible Actors = sub par Movie = wasting. <br /> <br /> A big dismay around, but I won't give my search for a good horror movie.
