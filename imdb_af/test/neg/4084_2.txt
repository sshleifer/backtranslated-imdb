The only way I can feel good about handing over these precious minutes of my life, tells how terrible it was each day. And even if I say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life, I won't fully get my point. Not stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a difference in movies like this and movies like Elephant or Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid, two of my other least favorite movies. The latter two were terrible, yes, but it was. Evan Almighty takes a strong role and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... WHY GOD WHY! All these people have much better talent, every time I see one of them, I will think of this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 was when I saw the movie, there was a mentally challenged elderly woman who thought the bird dome and money by tools - while jokes were at stake, was so funny that she didn't stop laughing all the time.
