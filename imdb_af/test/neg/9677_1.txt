How this movie can be classified as Drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I'd try to delete it from my CV. It was so historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses informed Noah. Lot, Abraham's cousin, Lot, became thousands of years before he was born. Canaanites have destroyed the earth ... really? What did the writing authors think? Was it just ignorance ("I remember something about Noah and animals, Lot and Canaanites and all things of Sunday school") or tried to insult the maximum number of people on the planet - from Christians, Jews and Muslims to historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ... as one of the fact, did anyone not offend? Anyone who even had a taste would win this one!
