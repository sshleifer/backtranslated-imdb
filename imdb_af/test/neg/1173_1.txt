I did a review for these directors' fictitious recreation about BTK. I also saw this movie and it was terrible. Please save your money and time. This movie was terrible and this director was unsigned. I don't understand how he finances these movies. They are terrible. I decided to make sure I see who the author, director and producer is, and if the name of this director appears, I won't waste my money. There is nothing worse than renting a movie on a Friday night, making the popcorn, and then realizing that you were immersed in creative art in front of the movie box. Stay away. So I think I have to make things up to fill in the lines? I've always reviewed IMDb for reviews, but I don't think I will. It's ridiculous. I've been remedied too often in my reviews. Not enough lines? You can cancel my account. Your website is a pain.
