It is a voice of a person who has just watched the second season of Rome, and grabbed the opportunity to see "what happened next". This movie goes out where Rome ends. If you find an abomination to Rome, a bad scam with little historical accuracy, then you can enjoy Empire: August. But if you feel Rome, it is a good thing, if you enjoy the intricate plot, the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors, Empire will of course appear to you as an exaggerated, redundant and abundant soap opera, with not much salvation. factors. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who seem to me a bit better than those in Rome. I especially didn't like Rome's image of Cleopatra as a drug addict sex addict. There must be a great deal of power and dignity in the woman, and the actress in Empire fits the part much better. O'Toole and Rampling are good, and so are some. But then ... If you got to know - and love - Atia as the super cool bitch, you'll find the representation of her in Empire - as a tearing belly in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. There are supposed to be a few meager characters in Empire, but these actresses rely heavily on men and nothing more. You won't find any interesting female characters in this epic. There is also the painfully comical Maecenas, which we see as a screaming queen of draws, although there is little historical evidence that he was like this (he is called once in the annals). <br /> <br /> The interiors are fairly slim and rely on clichés about clichés. Cleopatra's big hall looks like something from a computer game or a children's room in an Egyptian amusement park. There is a loooooooooo of really poor 3D graphics, not up to 2003 standards. <br /> <br /> The action is presented as a series of flashbacks that the old August brings. So we get a quick look at some historical events, some of which are well presented, while some do not. A disproportionate amount of time is being wasted to show Livia as the "eternal flame" of August. This matter doesn't even catch up for a moment, the dialogue is superlative and everything is seasoned with a rocky tear-penetrating musical score. Whatever the reality is intended to capture the show, every last piece of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing. Most of the actors are not English speakers. <br /> <br /> Everything is lukewarm in this epic. True, there is more historical accuracy than in Rome, but dramatically it is simply boring. The characters have depth and depth of dialogue. Camera work is often reduced to static shots, and lighting offers nothing to please your eye. <br /> <br /> There is really no one to love and hate nobody in Empire. Whether you like Rome or didn't like it, there are much better movies and miniseries. Ancient Rome: The rise and fall of an empire would be one thing I recommend.
