Most Lorne Michaels films seem to be failing because they are really only extensive versions of sketches that have barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. "Tommy Boy" is a character right from "SNL" - a big fat sweet (in their opinion) who doesn't know anything. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets the grateful overwhelmed Everyman role. He is accompanied by the Annoying Obesity Slob and they endure unfortunate injustices while traveling over land to save Dad's business. <br /> <br /> Initially, the plot is really faulty. The whole premise - Daddy dies and a rich stupid boy needs to save the family biz - can be traced back to just about any movie you want. Like any SNL style movie, it is limited to a simple motivation - empty, level; just a reason to see a fat man and a thin guy is "funny" together. <br /> <br /> The movie's biggest "influence" is the 1987 comedy classic "airplanes, trains and cars." The movie is great because the plot is not celebrated and retrieved. It's basically yes - a man going home for Thanksgiving gets stuck with a slab. But it's really, dammit. It makes the difference. The characters are real, the situations are much more real. "Tommy Boy" is pure slapstick and his ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we don't feel anything for them and we don't care what happens on the screen. "PTA" runs the cautious line between outrageous and utterly credible and relationships. "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-head light that really doesn't change in a fight with a dead deer, then wake up and wreck their car. <br /> <br /> The whole wreck car thing is completely stolen from "PTA" and it's scary how many things in this movie actually look like the Steve Martin / John Candy movie. <br /> <br /> Farley is just too unnecessary to find equal. I have never liked to watch him in any movie and it hasn't changed me. Spade is given very little to do, which serves as the movie's most ungrateful character. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the Evil Baddie plans to destroy Daddy's Business. The end is a joke, and not in a "har-har funny" way. More like an "oh god are they serious?!" way. <br /> <br /> Some people dig it, it's cool. But I just can't succeed, nor do I appreciate all the things it "borrows" from - not just "PT & A" - without any credit whatsoever.
