Three young filmmakers are tasked with re-opening a long-closed, ancient theater, many years before a shocking series of Greek killings. Much more murders have seemed to have occurred since then, but all of these remain unknown to these three young start-up workers who are hopefully eventually making their own. As they approach the great reopening evening, things are becoming increasingly strange and more alarming with items that suddenly begin to move themselves without any help and a frightening old man who apparently haunts the premises. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's really awful. In fact, if it wasn't that Mary Woronov's secretary character was such a strongly independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals virtually every scene she appears and the incredibly hot chick that played the incredibly messy but totally sexy Selina, this is a total loss. The only other good thing I have to say about this movie is that some of the movie murders are done in really inventive things, though not too high (a preference for me, but not necessarily for others). The rest just moves in constant sleaze (so extreme the scarce pair can actually find humor in it) and runs through the predictable shooter killing characters from one to the other routine.
