A great disappointment for being named as an amazing movie. Incredibly bad. Very predictive. It would be nice if someone just created a high profile role for a young woman who was not a prostitute. <br /> <br /> We don't really learn about this character except he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage, as usual, plays an excellent performance, but I feel that this role and this script has dropped. And how could he, after being unable to perform for the entire film, be set up on his deathbed? Very terrible and I felt I needed a bath.
