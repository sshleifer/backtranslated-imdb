I had a hard time putting it through. Every turn and turn is predictable. You sit there waiting just for that ... wait for it ... and yes, there it is! Just as you predicted at the beginning of the movie. Or 10 minutes out. And so on. <br /> <br /> Smart Writing? No <br /> <br /> Torture porn? No, there is no nakedness. Other reviews calling this torture are probably written by people on heavy drugs. Unfortunately, there is no torture and no nakedness (yes, no nakedness). <br /> <br /> There is no thrill in this thriller. The only good part of this movie is the end, but I'm not going to spoil it. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10. A 1/10 will be a terrible B movie. This movie performed better.
