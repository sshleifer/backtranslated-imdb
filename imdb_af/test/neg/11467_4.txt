I just went to see this movie with a friend. I watched quickly and read a brief summary and thought that sound interesting. We came out of the movies, not very sure if we didn't like it. <br /> <br /> The acting was good enough and the connection with characters was OK. The main character I thought was much like someone like Van Helsing. Yes, this was quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> But the plot I felt was used by other movies. The writing was a bit weak, I'm not sure, every time something bad happens, the main character says every time: "Oh my god." <br /> <br /> The special effects worked well, but it's a pity. spoiler) The main monster at the main climb reminded me of the Balrok from Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was OK, but I felt it was already done. Go look, buy everything, but don't expect too much.
