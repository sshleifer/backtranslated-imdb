I encouraged to watch this movie because I heard a good word: it was supposed to be this exciting real crime milestone, disturbing, shocking ... all the jazz. Well, I was disturbed because I spent money on it, and I'm shocked that something so God-horrible was actually released. It's about it. <br /> <br /> This is a new show at Charles Manson's family of crazy losing junkies and their murders. But if it's a "new look", it's probably "new" as in "fresh and completely improper": just to look, my head has given up and I had to give up trying to make any sense or even to understand what the director meant. <br /> <br /> I think I have to say something about the plot, but the fact is, it was so silly and incoherent that I barely remembered if there was even a plot. There was something about a "Manson band" delivered to a radio DJ (or a TV producer?), Then an hour of relentless random footage from the family in '69, then the Polanski murders (Looks like a bad school game) And finally, an idiotic part about a bunch of skins is drunk and the hell smashed into a path (I don't kid you), and then it ended (thank God). Don't ask me to do that, I just remember what I saw!) The shows were terrible too. And how difficult is it to make a convincing "Manson"? Get a short, slender crunchy, put a dirty wig and a rough beard on him. There's your Manson. But this "Manson" doesn't even look right. He looks just like a look in a cheap wig and a black bearded Santa beard. <br /> <br /> Or maybe that's what this movie is about: Manson's family didn't make sense, so this movie doesn't make sense either. This is symbolic! (Yes, right) I'm still so angry about spending money on this. I stopped and registered my normal quiz on this site to vote just 1 for this movie and post this warning, which hopefully will prevent others from spending their money on this garbage. Stay away from it, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> PS. The recent American TV production "Helter Skelter" received bad reviews here, but I saw it last month (I also saw the 1976 original) and let me tell you, compared to Manson Family, that the new Helter Skelter BRILLIANT and FLAWLESS is. And I was disappointed with that! That's how bad "Manson Family" is: it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing TV movie look perfect.
