It has become clear in the first 25 minutes to see the writers really want to make a movie and they probably certainly enjoy the whole process, but then it seems that it needs a decent plot! As the best they could do, 3 of the dull characters entered the real world and had "all sorts of amusing hairdressers," then they had to leave alone! I didn't even laugh and the whole "Adventures of Baron Munchausen / Time Bandits" that happened in the middle was very, very poor! Convaluted, confronted and very loose. It just looked like a whistle stop tour of anything they thought "worked" just to drag it to a feature. <br /> <br /> Full holes like the Royston Vasey characters need writers to go on writing Order to save them, but Jeff managed to write himself in the sub-story / timeline William and Mary and the era . If he could do that, why didn't they just write Royston himself? And Herr Lipp's audition? What was it for? I mean what was the point? He did it, and we heard nothing else about it? <br /> <br /> My main point is that while I loved the series, it was a bad idea, seemingly rushed project. Put it that way, the plot is so poor that if we don't know the characters (and as a fan I had a certain loyalty to continue watching), and we relied solely on the story itself, should that happen flat on his face! At best, it would have gone straight to video, and in the worst case it was never in the first place! Or maybe it should be the other way around? Actually terrible ....
