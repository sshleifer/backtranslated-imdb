It was earlier that video distributors such as Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films would release low-budget, shot-to-video horror movies to a selected market of gorehounds they ate nicely. This is acceptable to me, because you can see these movies a mile away with their clumsy goat art and cheesy titles. <br /> <br /> Now we have the Lions Gate in the mix, they just decided it was better to suck poor bags by placing a "professional" lid on it and the same price as one of their higher budget , professionally-made features. Do not swallow this! Granted if you saw Dark Harvest 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3, but there's a place for movies like this and it's not on a video industry rack next to the professional features. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of independent theater and watched several low budget, shot-to-video productions that were still a worthy rental, but it was one of the worst movies I ever seen. The "acting" (if you could call it) was unnecessary. It was amusing to laugh for a minute or two for the horrible line-reading, but in the end it was too much to take and became unbearable. The story is bad, the dialogue is worse, the acting somehow even worse. The only possible saving grace for this is a disemboweling scene that is still terrible, but it is an award-winning effect when compared to the blood splashes after a girl is sleeping or the mannequin dapitation. <br /> <br /> It took me three tries to make it through this whole movie and I just did it because I paid good money to rent it and feel like I should at least finish it. Stay away - stay far, far away from this one.
