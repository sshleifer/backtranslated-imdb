Low rent version of Ashley Judd's Double Jeopardy. Sutherland is too professional to be bad, but what was Brigit Fonda thinking?!? The Penelope Ann Miller curse continues. (Think about it - when did she ever work in a good movie, other than other people's money? And I'm not saying she's bad, but all her movies somehow fail).
