Dramatically? Yes ...... Historically accurate? Not quite! .... This movie turns the Bibles details of the flood by meeting Lot who meets Noah during the building of the Ark. Fascinating time travel for Lot made partly by NBC .... Lot was not born until 2136 BC, 234 years after the floodwater (2370BC) .... It's like George Bush meets with William Shakepeare! And how about this man to drive sales items and nicknack's to Noah? <br /> <br /> You can make a movie based on historical facts dramatic, but don't turn it around to place people where they are ... especially when it comes to God's Word.
