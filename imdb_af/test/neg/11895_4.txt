I saw it last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was bad. From the script to the editing of the play to the movie - nothing worked. Not to mention the set design / costumes was so horribly wrong for the period (it extends over the years from the late 70s to 2006 or so). Even John Hurt, who is usually a wonderful actor, was so overbearing. Granted, Quinten Crisp is an overarching man to start with, but Hurt has given nothing to work with. I don't know much else to say, except the audience I saw, with absolutely loved ones. So maybe it's just me. But audiences like everything at film festivals when they sit next to the director and all the actors. It's not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play. Personally, I thought this movie was terrible. On the other hand, it was so terrible that it was hilarious. Get drunk and give it a shot when it is in 2 days in HBO, if it ever goes that far.
