Doesn't it seem a little familiar? Oh wait, that's right. 90% of the jokes in this movie are already in the TV series. What is the point to repeat yourself, may you ask? Is it beneficial to the Americans who didn't see the program? Did the writers run inspiration? Or maybe everyone on the set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia, and did they forget that they had already covered this ground? Anyway, for someone who sat through the first three series, it was just very boring. I had to turn it off during the 'tablets that change your water green' section. Yes, it's very funny, but give us something original for the sake of good! Actually, if the best new stuff you can come up with is Leonard Rossiter's Saturday night Fever, you can forget about it. <br /> <br /> The guy they had to replace late Richard Beckinsale is a good thing, but not half the actor. Personally, I would have challenged the role as a sign of respect for him. Or better yet, didn't bother to make the movie at all, and just let the hilarity of the TV series speak for itself. But no, they can't. Not as long as money was made. Sad, really. 10/04
