This movie was horrible, especially in view of the work that had to be done in its production. Though not as bad as Ax Em, it's pretty awful. Notice the obvious rip-offs of Gladiator and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and what do you get? This smorgasbord of terrible makeup and woodwork. <br /> <br /> The movie starts as most zombie movies do today. An assembly of interesting journals and a radio broadcast of the outbreak at hand. We see our hero (Ryn, probably the worst 'zombie hunter' in the modern era, counting four or five times when he also scratched his head with his barrel's pistol or pushed the barrel of the barrel while he was blowing) of the zombies cut. We later learn that these fingers are collected for grace. <br /> <br /> Well, Ryn seems to be a rebel in his ways of dispensing zombies; go so far as to buy chum * gasp * from his French friend Hans (who is not really French, speak with a strange Middle Eastern accent). As Ryn uses the chum to collect an abundant bounty of Lost Hills, hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> And the horror of the movie. The zombies are poorly assembled. I saw comments that gave up their make-up, but in my opinion it was rather amateur. Clear Halloween adhesives were used to make the zombies' faces and there were points with which one girl seemed to have donated a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face. Oy Vey. <br /> <br /> To sum up the next sixty minutes in a few lines: Hans is stabbed by Rijn (who made a deal with other zombie hunters, Blythe is the lead leader), gives him a second chance gets Hans again stabbed by Hans, then shoots Hans and comes to Union City where he finds Blythe poison the cities for profit. <br /> <br /> It's really about plot. When Ryn Union City reaches, all the bad people get together in a house that is apparently so massive that it takes Rhine hours to reach the top floor. People die, Ryn lives and the movie ends with one of those cynical "will he kill himself?" scenes. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * I have to blame most of this mess on Nott. The direction was terrible. EVERY character rejected a different shoe than Hans, who was easily the best 'actor' in this group MacBeth. When they arrive at Union City, a lot of zombies attack the crew and the zombies have given no hints or ideas on how to walk as if your attachments were rotten. One woman swings as if she is swimming in the middle of the air on a Sunday walk. <br /> <br /> Some movies are terrible. This movie is one of them, simply based on how logic is left to make a story flow. Occasionally work, but in this respect (where the story was already in society), it doesn't. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless you want a decent laugh.
