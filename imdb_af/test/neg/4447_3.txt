Seriously, all this Satan comes to Earth, the Catholics always roll. Why don't Lucifer ever waste the other denominations? <br /> <br /> The plot is that Asmodeus (played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a plot to become human (but was not always a demon) by getting this young girl pregnant his sister is with his child. Besides maybe she's not his sister. The plot is not clear about this, and they violate these scenes where he sees a shrink about his problem. <br /> <br /> The head girl gets pregnant while still a virgin, with an incredibly creepy scene from her father giving her a gynecological exam to prove her hymns are still intact. Eeeewwwwww. Her sister (played by a flush and watch much worse for wear Denise Crosby) comes to the conclusion that it is a sign from heaven. Be Prize! <br /> <br /> Well, the devil's baby takes the mother's body for a joy and counts down, sequentially, a truck driver, her boyfriend's boyfriend and her friend, all watched by a former military priest become whose mission is. to kill the baby when it is born. We discover that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic Cardinal performing the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The end is pretty incomprehensible, and if you could make it straight, you have a stronger stomach than I did. . (I paused the movie several times, it was so terrible.)
