Some Janapese modern horror movies are very good. Strong plot, terrifying moments, good acting, while others are just ... Uzumaki unfortunately belongs to the latter camp. <br /> <br /> I'll be based on 3 elements: Plot, Scary Factor, and Acting. <br /> <br /> 1) Plot - true to the name of the movie, the plot moves in circle and never really explains itself. OK, the town is enchanted by the spiral curse, but why? And why do people so foolish? There is a brief attempt to explain what happens to the reporter. Unfortunately ... 2) Scary Factor - if it was meant to be an abomination, it failed. I can't really remember a frightening scene with enough work on it. <br /> <br /> 3) Acting - very monotonous. People walk around and say meaningless phases. I can't feel much empathy for our tragic heroes. <br /> <br /> All in all, there is much better modern Japanese horror movies with a coherent plot and strong characterization. Don't waste your time on this wannabe.
