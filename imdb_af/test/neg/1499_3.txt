This home movie is basically scandalous, but you have to give them 3/10 to try. The blood is rubbish, but the grandmother who kills them is pretty funny, and I think the concept is good, and the makeup is good for a home movie. But thank you, it was just 55 minutes long, and the turn to the end is literally Fight Club (as in almost as garbage as the movie). Just read this comment, don't watch the movie.
