A bad movie about a bad movie. Is that original, or what? If it is, then this is the only good thing about it. The beautiful Ally Sheedy couldn't prevent this bomb from destroying movie theaters and videos anywhere. It should also be noted that she and the other actors hired by Danny Aiello were charged with themselves, as well as the characters they played in his D-rated movie. To call it a B-rated movie is too much of a compliment, and will lead to delusion of greatness.
