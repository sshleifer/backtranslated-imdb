This movie was an all-encompassing uninspiring movie. It was a non-moving story that certainly doesn't make you think otherwise, where are all the strong moving material the other critics say about the movie. The 3 main players are good, and there are a few laughs, but again it becomes another movie you keep watching in the hope that it gets better and it's just not. I watched this movie last night and wanted us not to watch our precious time (while the child sleeps) the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not planning to recommend it to my family and friends, as well as anyone who wants to rent it. I was hardly impressed with everything about this movie.
