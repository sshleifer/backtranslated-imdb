... and it says something. No matter how bad a movie gets, I can usually sit through it so I can judge the full movie. Through this one I did it about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the DVD, or maybe it was my laptop, but I couldn't hear the dialogue, even though the volume had changed altogether. Sound effects were good, so with the volume that came up to hear the dialogue, I blew my tears with the effects. As much as I wanted to see this thing, I wouldn't sacrifice my trial for it. <br /> <br /> From what little I could tell about the plot, the movie was a big flashback of the main character's daughter. It seems the mother, a military pilot, had to flee her ship because one person on her ship she trusted seems to be one of the enemies and now he is striving for a desert plan. <br /> <br /> The only thing I like about the movie was the appearance of the main character; there was something I liked her hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Oh, this one seems to be in the dumpster ...
