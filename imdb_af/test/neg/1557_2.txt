This is a completely forgotten picture. A friend of mine bought it in a bargain at a local $ 50 rental site. He had to claim a refund. Or at least a discount. <br /> <br /> The plot is like this: A giant monster threatens the earth and aliens decide that the most average human on the planet should be chosen to save the earth. So a small holographic space-stranger appears before a job worker and tells him he is. <br /> <br /> The devil is in the details when it's time to judge a movie, and count on Zarkorr! The intruder failed miserably. The monster Zarkorr has only a few short moments on the screen, which may be 5 minutes tops (with a generous estimate). The cute alien hologram has even less screen time and can be the most interesting character to watch, and just because she is wearing a stereo teenager's outfit, complete with a fun-looking short-wired dress. The climatic final battle with the monster is over before you can say, "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, over." In the next moment you will be checked to see if you have just experienced a train wreck or if someone has drained you 3 tarts of blood. <br /> <br /> Although this movie did deliver one line that my friends and I are still repeating and laughing to this day, they were the only brightest place in this otherwise mutilated picture. As the cast of "protagonists" is "interrogated" by the fuzz, one of them responds to the question with the statement "What are you, a kind of paper?" It is so remarkably delivered that if you sit with a group of friends (which your friends won't be long when you have actually looked at your friend), you may actually experience a cry or two incredible laughs. <br /> <br /> Although not Manos or Eegah (it's not even bad enough to be classically bad), this movie will still spoil you with its terrible dialogue, imaginative characters and non-existent special effects and still deserve to be under 100. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
