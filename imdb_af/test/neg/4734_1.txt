This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and it takes the price of the 2007 rotten movie (made by me), anyway, this movie misses every ingredient of a good movie, I mean come on the actors have a bad performance, the story is just crap. I'm really very disappointed that they could do better than this piece of junk. I just lost my time and money on this movie. I wish the production company could return my money. Anyway, I have high expectations on this movie, and I have been disappointed. I do not recommend anyone to see it. so if you want to waste your money on something, do it on something other than this piece of junk.
