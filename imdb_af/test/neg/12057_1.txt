How to call up every possible cliché and solve stereotypes that exist in the horror genre and then make it into a massive lousy movie? The answer: "Camp Blood". It is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a micro budget and a little too obvious inspired by "Friday the 13th". Four of the most unbearable teenage characters you'll ever see? they are like a combination of ugly, stupid and annoying? go camping and find themselves quickly pursued by a murderous mania in a clown suit. Don't even ask me what the killer's motivation was or even who he / she was, because if it appeared in the movie, I totally missed it. It is one of the worst films ever made, without inspiration or craftsmanship whatsoever. The production values ​​were so intense that there were players playing various roles without even making them unrecognizable. The only half orderly and precious order throughout the "Camp Blood" is the opening in which the impressive, turbulent Meredith O'Brien scouts the bush with her geeky boy. Yes, I am fully aware that it is a shallow comment to make, but then it is a young and delayed movie again, so who cares?
