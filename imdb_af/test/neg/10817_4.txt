Some scientists, for some reason, go to a cave and there are some creatures that kill them. <br /> <br /> I usually give a more detailed plot, but I don't pay too much attention to it. Overall it was boring and the only time you really pay attention was during the action scenes after which the director was wonderful. <br /> <br /> The play is good, but the characters are so boring and forgotten. they blend in your mind. You will forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons: 1. Death is boring. 2. The characters are boring. <br /> <br /> I might have been more shocked if I knew who was who. /> <br /> So you're looking for a creature-in-cave movie? Rather look at the descent.
