I was hoping this show would be somewhat realistic. It just struck me as another mainstream show after watching it. Didn't I feel the characters at all, is this America a glamorous idea of ​​how terrorism works? The main character is not at all a fundamentalist function, and how he goes for a terrorist is beyond my understanding. None of the other terrorists managed to really appear. One of the members, a blonde American white boy, will never be accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a French ex-skinhead, doesn't really fit into an Islamic terrorist movement. In addition, the terrorists have sexual relations with white American housewives, which I find very strange. It's just another silly misleading American TV show. It's about as realistic as jailbreaking.
