Detective Sergeant Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and the company are on the case of an evil Serial Killer / Rapist. Can Psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help or will she be the killer's next victim? And what's with the killer's hilarious White Dude Afro? <br /> <br /> Inspired by the series killer Ted Bundy, "Killer's Delight" aka "The Dark Ride" is a rather boring Serial Killer story from 1978 that doesn't offer much. If it's something, it's more of a police procedure movie than a horror movie, so much of the violence takes place from the camera. Certainly, we get braised bodies, but we don't get much in the mining section, especially because it comes from the aftermath and not during the crime. Those who hope for the "Toolbox Murders" or "Maniac" will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is an impressive scene in which a woman tries to escape the killer who gets the tone right and is pretty exciting to start. John Karlen is also very effective as the killer, even though his hilarious hairstyle (white guys with Afros are always worth it) is more than a bit distracting. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Ride" is too routine and mediocre to really guarantee a recommendation as it does not have the proper exploitation components, and even dates to the standards. Those who are looking for a better example should probably go to "Do not Go In The House" and a few others, because it doesn't cut it.
