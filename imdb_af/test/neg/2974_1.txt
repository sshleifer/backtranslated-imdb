To football fans every place - stay away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Lame acting, lame script, lame football and no directing! I rented this movie during my stint in Asia and was worried that it was considered one of the better Singapore movies. It was just nonsense and thoroughly boring. There are thousands of rich, exciting stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about the top and stereotypical Singapore?
