I just watched a forensic file marathon on Court TV. The episode was identical to the plot of this movie, up to the incest secret and the affair-with-the-sister subplot. I don't remember any Based on a True Story indemnity, but the case has written MOW about it. Apparently, her husband, Earl, murdered Ruby Morris's murder for up to 25 years for her murder. Just go to show you, the truth may be unfamiliar with fiction, because I thought the Lifetime plot was confronted and a more than a stretch as far as credibility goes. I'm at the other posters who said the play was bad. However, I didn't notice it with all the players. It was really the main character, the daughter, whose performance was bad.
