This movie really started tense when a poor young boy was attacked by a pack of wild females. After a tense rush, the grandfather saved him with a magical whip. <br /> <br /> We are then introduced to a series of annoying housemates, including one tart that is always half-dressed. At this stage, the film boosts with strange "plinky plinky" background sounds that have left me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> I stopped paying attention for a while, but when I looked back at the screen, there were strange creatures of things going around grunting and killing. A word of advice if you are ever caught in the house by some nutter - get cardboard boxes and a tray. <br /> <br /> Although we left half the film, because it wasn't quite interesting or unforgettable, we are now at the incredible conclusion, the last surviving creature thing is fighting a "Whip Duel" with grandpa and his magical whip. I won't say what is happening here, but I can say the whip battle is full of excitement, with air conditioning, fighting and all sorts of drama. <br /> <br /> I'm going through this movie through a neighbor I don't like.
