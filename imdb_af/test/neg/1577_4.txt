After a snowstorm, the roads are blocked and the highway patrol Jason (Adam Beach) joins his friend Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow) at the restaurant and advises his clients that they can only follow their journeys the next day. Among the strange strangers, Jason meets his former sweetheart Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. Along with the night, without any communication with his base, Jason faces face and suspicious activity with the clients and finds bodies indicating there is a killer. <br /> <br /> "The Last Stop" can be a mean thriller, but the script is simply awful. Most characters are horrendous and the motives of the surprising ceremony are never disclosed and the viewers have no further explanation as to why the killer has decided to kill the guests. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Encurralados" ("Trapped")
