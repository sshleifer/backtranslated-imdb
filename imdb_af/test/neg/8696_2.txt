For a great movie, you can also try to watch the movie about Saint Francis or Assisi - good for any audience. Best thing I liked about this movie was the Mexico landscape, and it made the movie a 2. I was amazed that these actors didn't have terrible sunburn, they weren't desert dwellers. And Moses said it had an impediment, but certainly not here. Even the "miracle" scenes are confronted and unbelievable. And what is the point if you can believe something in a TV story? Talking about dumbing, I thought this Hallmark-made movie was pathetic, and I can see why other Hollywood hate. I don't, just a few of these corporate profiters. You don't have to be a kind of religious to take advantage of "Jesus of Nazareth", but for this waste of celluloid you have to be bored, with nothing to do, immersed and religious. And for a real movie experience, try "Short Cut to Nirvana", a very highly rated movie.
