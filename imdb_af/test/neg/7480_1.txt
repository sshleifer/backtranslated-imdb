Before Last Call w / Carson Daly, my local NBC affiliate delivered much more valuable programming after late night w / Conan such as second city TV, 3rd Rock From the Sun & Carline in the City Reruns, and some on comedy. Nowadays, nothing is worth watching, because everything I see is Carson Daly and his horrible show. He is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be known because he is not a good speaker or comedian. <br /> <br /> On his 21st show he was trying to use an internet Meme called the "Rickroll" on his show. He failed. This event confirms that Carson Daly is terrible.
