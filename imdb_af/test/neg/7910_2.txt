After a humiliating experience on a plane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sucks the airline and uses the money he wins to start his own full-service airline. What makes his difference is that it has sexy flight attendants, an on-board dance club and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cabin. <br /> <br /> Soul Plane is a very racist comedy, except that it's just funny. Soul Plane is described as an "urban" version of the aircraft. The problem is that Soul Plane is not even close to reaching the plane's lips. The jokes in Soul Panel are too offensive and they are mostly original. I'll lie if I say I didn't laugh because there were a few funny moments. However, I expected more and I disappointed the theater. <br /> <br /> I would compare Soul Plane by plane 2. The latter was just a rehash of the first movie while the former only had a rehash of outdated, rough jokes. There is really no creativity behind the movie and there are just a few fun places. But I don't think Soul Plane is "bottom 100" bad. Right now the movie is ranked at number 82 and it's a bit hard. I'm not saying it's a good movie, but it's not terrible either. The running time is just 86 minutes, so it's not too much of a pain to watch. For stupid comedies you can do much worse. <br /> <br /> No one in the cast is very good, but they seem to have fun and help. Kevin Hart was very annoying like Nashawn. He had some funny lines, but he's a very poor leader. Snoop Dogg, who was gentle in Starsky and Hutch, is quite brave here. Tom Arnold was actually tolerant and it was the biggest surprise of the movie. The most annoying person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. He was not funny at all and he would never be funny. The funniest members were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and they made me laugh most. In the end, Soul Plane can fit the account if you are looking for a stupid comedy, but it will probably be better if you just overshoot the movie. Rating 4/10
