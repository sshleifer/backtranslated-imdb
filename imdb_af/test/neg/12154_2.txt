I'm really surprised that it has 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and a nomination for the best foreign film at the Oscar. The 7.3 rating on IMDb ... it's not that much of a surprise as the way IMDb users recently voted. I just can't get into a movie where the real facts about his main character are clearly distorted, and not at all to make the film artistic, but to make it melodramatic and less boring. What it does seem to make it really boring to anyone who expects to see a serious and credible interpretation of Genghis Khan's life. The conquered and over-dramatized Mongol often echoes those like 300, a movie that may not be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, Mongol takes seriously. This is Stoic seriousness, mixed with the obvious inaccuracies, it is truly the most boring movie I have seen this year; possibly the most action or biopic movie I've ever seen. The characters are pathetically written. Honestly, I doubt Genghis Khan was as boring and passive as shown in this movie. What is funny to me, because if there is something I think needs to be changed for the sake of theatricality, make it a boring person in an interesting person. The romance between Khan and Borte is also boring, simple and stupid. Also, without giving away anything, Mongol contains the only stupid scene I've seen in a long time. There must be a good 20 minute plot development. The movie just jumps without explanation. It looked like something from a Saturday Night Live skit that had parodies with epic action movies with horrible pacing. (Did I mention how serious Mongol takes himself?) Meanwhile, it is dragging like a movie I've never seen before. Even now, I can swear it is three hours long. About 45 minutes in there I checked the time, and I was pretty sure it was almost finished. Aside from some beautiful scenery and quality that comes from Asano (of course), Mongol is just a disaster. It completely failed me or relieved me anyway. I'll never give this movie a second chance. And not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever, but give me every day a trashy and irrepressible American epic about Mongolian. At least then I know what I get, unlike Mongolian, where reviews and ratings led me to believe it was really worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about how much I hated Mongolian is that I have friends that I know will no doubt love it.
