This movie started with a few promises: big name cast, nice pieces, but then it fell apart. <br /> <br /> Most of the time it can't tell if it's a serious movie or comedy. One minute they talk about how there is no joy in the murder and the next there is a battle scene that sits on funny music and funny bangers. <br /> <br /> Some of the plays are pretty bad, mainly from Patrick Swayze and Piper Perabo. She also gets some groaner lines like: "If I get married, it's about love." Ugh. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring. Not enough action, not enough humor, not enough plot, not much of anything. Just a few claws and cheese moments. <br /> <br /> Also a movie with "Dragon" in the title should contain many more dragons than the few (and pathetic CGI dragons) that appeared in this movie. <br /> <br /> Couldn't the Wifi channel show * any * good movies?
