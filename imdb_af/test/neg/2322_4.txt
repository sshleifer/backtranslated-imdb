I'm not really into an Abbott & Costello fan (although I enjoy "Who's On First") and frankly there wasn't much in this movie that would inspire me to watch more of their work. It wasn't really bad. It had some spectacular scenes, and actually a very convincing giant played by Buddy Baer, ​​but somehow, with the familiarity of the duo and the respect in which they are generally held, I must say I expected more. As the story goes, the couple fall into a baby seat, and while reading Jack & The Beanstalk as a bedtime story (with the child reading it after Costello), Costello's Jack falls asleep and dreams himself in the story. There is a "Wizard Of Oz" feel of the story, as the characters in the dream are all the equivalent of Jack's real acquaintances and open the movie in black and white and move to color during the dream sequence. The battle scenes between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are one of the amusing parts of the movie. Of course, Polly also leads one of the questions of the movie - what happened to her? Jack and gang left her in the giant's castle! I know - it was just a dream, so who cares. Yet I wondered. There were also some cute songs and dance routines. My 4-year-old giggled a little while she appreciated the humor. I found this to be an acceptable time wiser, but certainly not something that will convince Abbott and Costello as comic geniuses. 10/04
