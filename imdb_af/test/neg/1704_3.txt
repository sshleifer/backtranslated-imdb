This film, if done right, has so much potential. Parody movies are always funny, and people tend to like them because they are light, silly and stupid but fun. This movie was funny in some parts, but it could have been very funny. The action itself was OK from all the actors, but ... I wasn't satisfied. It was a bit empty, and my summary title says it's all about the effect. Proper green screens have not been used for this movie ... wallpapers have been added, which just looks awful. No wonder this movie went straight to DVD lol. It wasn't ALL total loss, it's funny and will give you a good laugh (IT, not most of the time).
