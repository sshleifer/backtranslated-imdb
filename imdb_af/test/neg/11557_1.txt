I think I can safely say (without really giving away anything) that this movie had no robots in it. The guys in the "robotic" costumes have not acted or spoken, and the evil entity behind the whole "plot" is also not a robot. <br /> <br /> The whole thing looks as if it was shot in a city park somewhere, with pictures dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set. I can't even use words to describe the acting ... <br /> <br /> It can't even offer the hilarious end of "Star Crystal". In short, this is clearly one of the worst science films of the 80's and I will be so bold as to say "of all time".
