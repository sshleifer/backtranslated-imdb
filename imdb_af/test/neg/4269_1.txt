This horrible action ?? sci-fi movie is a crap. I spent only 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story doesn't make sense, there are many mistakes in the script, the characters are poorly developed, the unknown movie is terrible, the main character is too old for his role. I was encouraged to buy this VHS, which has a beautiful cover, and see this crap due to the illogical IMDb user rating and some ten star reviews. I just checked the authors, and each one has only one short review (of "L.I.N.X.") issued in IMDb, and nothing else. Why do they promote such a garbage? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Conex√£o Letal" ("L.I.N.X. Lethal Connection")
