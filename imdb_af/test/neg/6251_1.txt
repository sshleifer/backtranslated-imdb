Even as a huge fan of the low to no budget horror genre, I couldn't find this disaster quite amusing. With horrible acting, a painful generic plot and no dimensional characters, no matter how bored and drunk you are, it's not worth your 81 minutes. Don't make the same mistake I did. Hire something else. Anything else !!!
