I decided to flush this show of my memory out of the toilet of a bad TV show in the eclipse of forgetful, disappointing, useless, garbage TV show hell. <br /> <br /> The Skyler man who host / star / creator of this show is boring, uninteresting, unbelievable, not very nice and not funny. In short, why is this man on TV and especially why is he in a comedy show when he is not funny and pretends to be a professional man when he is definitely nothing more than a clear pretender? Others have already said it here, but this man is a total fake and fraud. If you believe any of these disadvantages, I think you should seriously consider letting your head go, because they are all fake and those who may be true are so useless that you spend the whole day giving someone out of you. to get an average meal at a restaurant? Seriously this man must break away, this show remains canned.
