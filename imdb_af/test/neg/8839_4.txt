Lone Star Productions chose them in the 1930s, and Star Packer was thrilled with one of the more. John Wayne is American Marshal John Travers. He investigates a crooked chick, known only as "The Shadow", which is responsible for stealing cattle, stages and others, and gives orders from behind the door of a false wall safe. Yakima Canutt is Travers' reliable Indian sidekick, named the ... well, "Yak". <br /> <br /> Earlier we find out that Matt Matlock (George pre-Gabby Hayes) is the shadow; The dead is giving away when he offers to buy out his (supposed) cousin Anita's half of the Matlock Ranch, as "it's not a girl's place". As Anita, Verna Hillie doesn't have much in the movie, although in a comical moment she uses a six-shooter to scare the shot of one of the villains in a night-time. <br /> <br /> There is some curiosity in the movie - for one, Wayne's character alternately drives a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film. In what a neat device could have been, a loggers in the middle of the street is a vast tree trunk. And finally, the movie doesn't really live, because Sheriff Travers never wears a weapon in the movie, it's a star pack without a star. <br /> <br /> The horse races, the runaway play schools, the cliff's stage coach (another curiosity, the horses are easily detached from the stage). But John Wayne fans will want to see this one for the charism he showed early in his career. For those who are more critical, the white kerchiefs carried around the forehead by the good old poses just mean they all have headaches.
