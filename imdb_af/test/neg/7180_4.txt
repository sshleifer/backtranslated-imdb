This movie just doesn't work. No two ways about it. I saw it back in 1998 for the first time when it was released and I didn't like it. I bought it just a few days ago because I thought "hell, I'll try it." I'm not sorry for the money I left out for Hamilton, but the fact remained the same. This movie is senseless, boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Stormers are usually a joy, but that's when he makes movies in the US. Back at home he didn't do the trick. Probably the movie was made good (if you forget the strange stock film here), but ultimately the only thing Hamilton really raises is higher than one star roll, Hamill's turn as the bad old Hawkins. He has lots of fun with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments in the movie. "Swedish intelligence, huh? Now there is a contradiction in terms" and when he allows Hamilton to have a word or two with his wife The phone by the end of the movie. And it's really a lot. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
