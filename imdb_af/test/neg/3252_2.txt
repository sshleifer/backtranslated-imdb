This movie should never be made! It's stinking, it's terrible, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. Start seeing a pattern here? Jackie Mason is definitely not Rodney Dangerfield. Away was Ted Knight and Bill Murray, who were essential to the first movie with Dangerfield. It seems as if the three of them (the stars) all knew a stinker of a script when they saw one. The one who did not have the good sense to bow to this was Chevy Chase, who was holding on, but I think both were movies. This movie is simply not fine. It also has no other engaging properties. This thing is very dependent on anti-Semitism to work and it works to its detriment. I hated this thing. A waste of everyone's time.
