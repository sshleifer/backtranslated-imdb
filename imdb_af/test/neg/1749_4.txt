I like most of this movie. As other reviews have mentioned it has a good throw, the plot is interesting enough. All in all, it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> But the end, I feel, is completely numb, it worried me. Yes, do you expect people to cross and cross each other in this kind of movie, but with four-fold crossing? Well, if justified by the plot, why not? <br /> <br /> But it's the bad part, there's nothing needed. After all, it's all twilight with no meaning at all. (here comes the SPOILER). After the airport, Enrico and his accomplices already have the money. I couldn't understand the need for the rest of the scam. Is it all necessary to just rub Federico's nose into being deceived? I don't buy it. <br /> <br /> So 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of the movie and 2 out of 10 for the end.
