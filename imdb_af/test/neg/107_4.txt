Low budget horror movie. If you don't raise your expectations too high, you'll probably enjoy this little movie. Starting and ending is pretty good, middle sleepers at times and apparently nowhere for long periods of time, as we look at the folly of the mad who adds atmosphere but does not promote the plot. Quite a bit gore. I enjoyed Bill McGhee's performance, which he made for such a low budget image reasonably credible. He could sometimes attend the movie when nothing much happened. Nurse Charlotte Beale, played by Jesse Lee, played her character well, so be prepared to hit her by the end! She really makes stupid mistakes, but then it makes these cheap movies so good! I would have been out of that place and five countries had long held out before she even thought it might be a good idea to leave! If you enjoy this movie, try Committed from 1988, which is actually a horror of this movie.
