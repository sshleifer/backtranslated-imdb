I just added this comment because I couldn't state the fact that a positive note appeared on the "complete information" page. I really think it's the worst movie ever made in my country. It's not just because of the horrible plot, the crappy English and a tension curve that is as flat as our country. No, this is because it was a serious effort to make a good action movie, according to the Hollywood standard. It had to be "The European Action Movie of the Year". For this reason, they even rented Fejda van Huet, actor in the Oscar-winning picture "Character", to do the job. I don't mind bad movies, I can even enjoy them if they are unpretentious. but I can't be horrible, but supposed to be a type of movie.
