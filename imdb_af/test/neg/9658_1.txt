This movie was absolutely horrible. The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews received from some here is that it was written by people in the film. It was actually painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) couldn't see it. As far as I know, this movie never made it to the theaters and for good reason. It's like some people sit around a beer and say, 'Hey, let's make a movie. Who wants to be in it? ' It's so bad. Besides Luke Perry, who is only in a small part of the movie, I didn't recognize another actor. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is in this case. I like Sandlot (I) and I usually like stupid and foolish movies, but this movie doesn't have a single reasoning quality. The people who wrote it do not have the slightest idea of ​​how children think, speak or act, and the movie is an unpleasant mess of horrible wheat lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative reviews but it's the worst movie I've seen since Man's best friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen in my life. If you rent it, remember I warned you. The fact that some people regarded this movie as good is a sad commentary on their taste and intelligence. I'm not exaggerating.
