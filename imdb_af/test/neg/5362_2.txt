I give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called Haunted Homes. But this kid and his friends do their investigations like total idiots. They assume that there is ghost and if they ever find rational statements behind the experiences, they should kick and shout drugs to admit it. But in addition, the whole format of the show is incredibly annoying. Although much written, the college-educated children who make up the film can speak almost English, but still insist that they try to use "big" words they obviously don't understand. And the main investigator, Ryan's ridiculous self-evident voice calls, just let me throw the TV through the window. (and he looks stoned all the time). In short, this group makes TAPS guys on Ghost Hunters like MIT scientists!
