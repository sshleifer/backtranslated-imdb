The third film based on Charles Belden's play "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933) focuses on the generation of X-Tasy. Twin authors, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher films - a promising start. Their condition guarantees an authentic point of view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not much of a strain on the world's favorite heir. She sees "In Style", striptease boys, chats on a cell and frets about a pregnant pregnancy. Her regular routine has changed. Hilton reached the climax of her performance - not so hot - during the "1 Night in Paris" (2004) parody. While the pimp-my-ride is in motion, she is eagerly "seeking lip balm" in her boyfriend's (Robert Ri'chard) shot. Finally, the "actress" atones for using the "N" word on the sex band. Director Jaume Collet-Serra is attacking his twin who are in conflict with the past theme. Each one has exhibited opposite qualities, while a few things or bad things can come out today. The latter, however, does not exclude the former. Birth is the happiness of the draw. Spectators can hardly see Vincent (Brian Van Holt) as a contemporary Quasimodo. Granted, the resluses share some similarities such as works of art, dismay, submission and murder. Yet one small variable between the two makes the difference. Vincent is even better on the inside than on the outside. Collet-Serra's "House of Wax" pays homage to actor Vincent Price of the first remake in 1953. The film leaves clear Van Gogh points to the imagination of the audience. Yet, choosing to divide the antagonist into two eliminates a lively end to end. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod's unmasked runner-up, but the scary one in horror movie history belongs to Lon Chaney in "Phantom of the Opera" (1925). As for the new contender, the aftermath of separation surgery leaves the effect. A surgeon should know that it works on Siamese twins, scars - physically and psychologically. Their father should call some colleagues - Dr. Phil to consult and dr. McNamara to nip / tuck. Despite what the trailers have said, "Wax" is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning it.
