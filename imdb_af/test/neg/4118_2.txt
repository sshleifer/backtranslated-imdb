What a waste of great acting talent. It is a pity, because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni and Melvil Poupaud (to be no less known in America) it is very acting talent to waste. This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After enjoying his "Kings and Queens", this movie completely bored me and frustrated me to the point where I actually left before the movie ended. The film revolved around the central storyline (with Catherine Deneuve's disease), hit by every peripheral storyline and supportive character that appeared on the screen. The film also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters differ so much from each other (this was a story of family function) so that the lack of coherent story became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (falling from hip hop to Bach to Mendelhson's Midsummer Night's Dream) violated the emotional temperature of the movie and hid further emotions that the viewer had to feel at the time. The photography (the director often started screens with a mainly dark screen, where our only face is through a small opening, which feels as though we are looking through a viewing hole then expanding) was also pretentious and inexcusable.
