The propaganda-pro-American war effort film released in 1942 made the East Side Kids find it difficult for any Japanese to touch their own environment when they learn they are too young to enter. Eventually, they learn that in some people's distrust, they have become wrong, but also bumped over a spy ring, which then erupted. The film is innocuous enough in its fashion, although some may be offensive, given how innocent Asians really were in World War II. Overall, this is a very generic effort, and both Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall will have better moments, which are best tended to come here when they are ad-lib.
