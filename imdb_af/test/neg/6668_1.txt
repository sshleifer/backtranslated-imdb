I felt I had to add a comment after seeing the other comments. I was taken to see this movie as a child by my unaware parents, and expect a normal Norman Wisdom jolly skirt comedy. Instead, what you get is this awkward British sex comedy of the worst kind where Norman (Norman!) Plays a swinger aimed at performing as many 'birds' as possible. Absolutely typical of the genre - poorly filmed and performed, no verdict of a script beyond the worst kind of double-entender, and many vague tips of 'sobriety'. And all apparently on that special grain film stock reserved for the British low-budget films of the 1960s and 1970s. About the only memorable thing is the annoying, exciting theme tune that appears in my brain for another 30 years. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the last scene you also see Norman naked over the sand and looking frozen. I think so anyway - at that stage my mom took me out of the theater. I saw it again, many years later, and guess what, it was still dire. <br /> <br /> If you are any fan or interest in the little man and his career, you will arrange the '10-foot barge pole' on this. Believe me, you don't have to see the back of Norman Wisdom.
