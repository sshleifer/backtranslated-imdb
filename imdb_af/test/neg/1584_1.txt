I'm not surprised to find users commenting on this movie of filth, like this movie "proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way." I start this way, not to criticize a particular reviewer, but because this quote characterizes the hyperbolic, uncritical treacle spreading over this movie, even before it hits the theaters. Even the best of movies proves nothing and doesn't intend to. The best movies entertain and move the viewer, and "The English Patient" fails on both criteria. <br /> <br /> I remember the studio's promotion of "The English Patient" very clearly: "Of the producers of" Amadeus "and" One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, "" it announced. " An ignorant or indifferent listener may miss the important word, "producers", in this ominous statement and mistakenly associate the director of "The English Patient" with the real great director, Milos Forman. Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr Forman. <br /> <br /> While the novel by Michael Ondaatje on which the film is based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film does not catch any quality from the book in any way whatsoever. of the flute elements that just seem like, the role of the film looks very much like the novel. <br /> <br /> Despite the injustices that started when I heard the shameless deceptive advancement, I made this movie in the theater, as it began to unfold, I realized that the version of the novel's strange magic failed, that the actors did not know their words but their characters, and that their characters were flat, boring and unrelenting. The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatje's novel and a completely-born film of the worst description. <br /> <br /> Those who thrive on this movie are very capable of speaking with adjectives, such as "cattle" and "big" and "hypnotic." Well, that's not one of those. In fact, even Ondaatje's fine novel can be described as "cattle" or "big". It can be described as "magic" and "hypnotic" - but it is exactly the features that the film has completely failed to deliver. It was almost as if Minghella, as a reader, had completely missed what was valuable in the novel and could simply eliminate a pale, skeletal version on celluloid, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but focus on the wrong characters He produced a cinematic transliteration that had not only respect for story's metaphors, but also no evidence of them. <br /> <br /> Minghella took the central focus from Hana and Chicken and placed it on the patient and katherine Clifton, missing the narrative route of the novel as well as its "essence". <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas have unbounded, uninspiring, uninvolved, unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great, passionate love affair to the viewer, but it has only an inexplicable, perfunctual liaison between two flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unspeakable, and no performance has provided the viewer with the great emotional response that is obviously meant by Minghella's grandiose and overwhelming performance. <br /> <br /> The "big, cattle, David-Lean-like" features that the many injudicious judges of this goofy movie love to simply refer to are not there. The comparison with David Lean ("Dr. Zhivago") is positively offensive to another good director. For example, take the Patient's sandstorm scene, which is undoubtedly one in which these "great, sweeping" features believed (or should have been): the sandstorm is not great - it is not even convincing. The subsequent burial of the characters in the car and their rise to the storm, which was undoubtedly supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, lacked any drama or emotion - in fact, because it was so vague, it had an air of comedy about where comedy was clearly out of place. <br /> <br /> This movie failed. It failed as a version of the novel, and it failed as a movie. It looks like it was the "anointed Oscar vehicle of the year" (at such over-trumpet cinematic slosh as "Kramer vs Kramer" or "Terms of Endearment"). One can only thank God that even the hype-driven Academy <br /> <br /> had the good sense to offer Frances McDormand the best actress award for her truly deserving performance in the truly outstanding movie, " Fargo. " There wasn't a single show in the ecrable "English Patient", it wasn't an embarrassing overwhelmingly overwhelming (Willem Dafoe) or truly forgetful, mediocre acting (Fiennes and Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> Why this non-entity of a movie retains a covenant of fanatical (and clearly tasteless) dedicated will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the sin of the time will permanently bury this mediocrity of a movie, and unfortunately it will not have the power to dig out.
