This film was compared to the hilarious British comedy "A Fish Called Wanda", although I can't see why. The only connection I can find is the Monty Python one (Eric Idle in "Nuns", John Cleese and Michael Palin in "Wanda"). Otherwise the two are incomparable. <br /> <br /> Idle and Robbie Coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of business before they die, so they decide to snatch their boss and make Rio. When the getaway goes wrong, the two are forced to hide in a monastery as a monastery. <br /> <br /> What once promises to be a riot will soon become a predictable, average movie with the usual tasteless sex jokes and pale humor. Again, there are sometimes heights, but not casting or crew managing the process to inspire. An attempt to make a male finish of a Wanda type fails, along with the hassle of "men in drag" humor, which is almost surprising. If you think about it, men trying to be women are funny, men trying to be nuns are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
