This movie actually hurts to watch. Not only did I laugh, I had a serious headache. Sometimes I felt so sorry for the actors involved. The best way to summarize it is to note that under sex comedies, it's probably the least funny and least sexy of all time. I'm sorry, I can't give it less than one vote. To give it a score of one is an insult to every movie that shows two or better. <br /> <br /> Now I see they are filming a sequel. To hear that someone is actually paying these people to make another movie, convinces me that there is just too much money in Hollywood. THEIR TAX UP! Making a sequel to this movie can well be a crime against humanity; Perhaps an international tribunal should be convened, or UN sanctions applied to filmmakers. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a very bad movie. Really, really.
