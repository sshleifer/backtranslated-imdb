US Tourist on the recent package tour in Asia decides to break the law by: 1 Ignoring foot clock; 2 Join revolutionary army; 3 Possession and use of illegal firearms ...... etc. What a political and educational statement should be about the so-called atrocities of a military dictatorship in Asia ends as a "How To" travel guide for disillusioned Americans. .. especially those who want to protest that the water in the hotel does not work .... Unfortunately, the authors of this silly yarn have no idea about Asia ... and it doesn't seem sensible either. Our human rights hero who desperately looks for medicine in the furthest outreaches of the Asian jungle mile from all over comes across a farmer and asks, "Do you excuse me - does this town have a pharmacy?" ... Well .... those who know something about the Asian jungle will appreciate how ridiculous that scenario is. Think you were recently in the Thai jungle and an American asked me .... "Excuse me .... do you know where MacDonalds are?" This film is meant to be a serious drama, but ends up as a parody and rip-off of all the "deadly" types of films designed to confirm and re-affirm the Asian stereotype held by many Western "civilization". like this ..... The basic message of this photo is: "Our Americans ... who come from the world's only true democracy, have a divine right to go to all other nations ... and correct what they are wrong ... convert their environment .... and teach them freedom ..... "(for example, see the beach ...... at least Leo did it with a little more style). ... of course Vietnam is another story .... And ..... the educated Asian may well ask why the Yankie Gungh-Ho attitude about Asia should come from a nation whose main contribution to humanity help spread cancer ... Aids .. Gun with kiddies and Jerry Springer ...... et al .. At the end of this picture, the cynical viewer can be good for the Burmese military ..... 3 out 10. <br />
