I've read almost all the books and have seen the music production in two different languages. I absolutely worshiped everything I had previously announced. But lately I've run out of resources to keep me fancy. I still have a few books left, but they are in transit or they are the persecutors I did not rush to read. Such an idea arose at me - Sink me! There are movies I didn't watch! So, I have to watch them right away. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of this series was ... acceptable. In fact, I really enjoyed the variation of the reason for the condemnation, however different it seemed. However, it has already gone downhill from there. Chauvelin was too ... foppish? And I'm too old for this role. Not nearly that dark and pounding figure with its terrible non- or. (And what was it with a random bed scene with him? It was too creepy - wasn't his only love Madame Guillotine, and his only interest - his work and his only obsession - Sir Percy?) Marguerite ... Prettiest woman in France? Cleverest woman in Europe? I do not think so. Although, all that forced her to break into Sir Percy's study, I didn't have the worst idea. And what my lord Tony did to earn this death? Yes, every member of the League promised his life to Mr Percy, but he would never have threatened any of them, and would not have been like a coward if his dearest friend died. And if he had to mourn his companion, he would have done it, mourn, don't just move as if nothing had happened. That brings me to another point, Mr Percy. His portrayal was very terrible. He was also not a lazy kid, or a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations. He didn't deal too much with cravats (his pronunciation of that word only blew my ears) and with his own hands he never killed anyone. So what was it about him to walk around randomly and kill people? <br /> <br /> The costumes were just too flashy for that time. It's post-revolutionary France we're talking about! Not pre-revolutionary. People in dresses like this are pretty easy in a crowd. It was all just ... good! <br /> <br /> However, I have to admit, after looking at other parts, my opinion has changed slightly. Considering it as a separate work, independent of Scarlet Pimpernel's range, it was acceptable. Just your other average hero in the mask. But what they were trying to do was still miserable.
