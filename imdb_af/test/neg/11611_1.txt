I'm in no way facetted when I say that this movie is worse than any other movie ever made. Worse than "Batman & Robin". Worse than "Manos, Hands of Fate". Seriously, it's so bad. When people tell me that a movie is terrible, I use the scale "Two Girls" to figure it out. If the movie is comparable to "Two Girls" then I won't see it. If it's twice as good, maybe I'll see it, but just to laugh at the delay someone has made to make it, because a movie that's twice as good will still be a piece of garbage be.
