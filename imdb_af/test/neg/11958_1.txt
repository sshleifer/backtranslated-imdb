Another sequel! Why on earth are they still doing it? It must be the worst franchise ever, but it is still funded and continued. SCARECROW WANTED GAME - what I just watched so that I can officially rubbish the whole series - brings the evil straw man back, who again beats some college kids ... That's basically it. The play sucks (as usual), the screens are out of pathetic, and do not be deceived by the title. This thing doesn't have as much nudity as you might think. A few pretty topless girls, but nothing too flexible. Just let me deduce my persistent insult (or review) on this movie by saying: if I get a SCARECROW IN SPACE or a FREDDY VS SCARECROW on the video store shelves, I'll be in absolute awe ...
