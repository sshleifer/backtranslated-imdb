I knew I was for a LONG 90 minutes when the opening voice on the word "scarecrow" voiced the word "Scare Crew". And probably enough, 90 minutes later, after seeing outside staggering plays, it ran boring drama, scarecrow's bumps nowhere near their intended target, but at least "Know" it, Ken Shamrock "acting" and the most stupid I saw what I saw. my life (ok, no, I'll take the last one back, in a week). After all this, I openly knew that I could not just go to Lacuna a la Jim Carrey and just delete it from my mind. Any thoughts I may have had that director Brian Katkin might have made an OK movie, given the right circumstances I had after watching "Slaughter Studios" are completely out of my mind. <br /> <br /> My Degree: F <br /> <br /> Cookie Cake: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert are topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (available until 22 September 2005)
