This story had a good idea about four elderly men who share a deadly secret about a young woman they met 50 years ago. After all this, the young woman turns revenge on the men. This story occasionally chopped me off during the movie in the midst of tiring lift music and the equally consistent thunderstorms. But it's finally worth waiting for when we find out who the mysterious woman is holding the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life. Most of what I had in this film was the tension in which the young woman appeared before the men just before their deaths. The special effects were something. Every time I hear her calling, I'll think, "Don't face again." But it was a good movie, I just wish the pace wasn't that slow or the play wasn't so tiring. And what I like about the movie was the jump-back of the 20's, very authentic as well as the original costumes.
