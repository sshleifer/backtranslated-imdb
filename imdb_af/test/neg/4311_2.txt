What a clunker! <br /> <br /> It must be made for TV or cable. <br /> <br /> See: Forget the script - forget about the many forgotten actors. Excuse me? Continuity? The NSA / NIA / whatever he is (an agent) takes in an F16 - it is displayed in an F18 and his aircraft are picked up and later the aircraft is indicated as an F4 Phantom! Oooh, wish I could be so cavalier. <br /> <br /> Outside the male actors (!?) The women are WASPS: blue-eyed and long-legged and eventually get the heroes crying save them. Even when a solid welding can save most of the cosmo-astro nuts, the blonde drops the welding machine. Duh! <br /> <br /> As an SF movie one in ten. As a movie per se: 1/2 (that's half a point). They had to throw out the space station and go to Mars. <br /> <br /> Large raspberry.
