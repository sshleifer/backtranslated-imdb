It's a new approach to the comedy. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> The joke is that it is supposed to be funny in itself. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a French short story, located in Paris, and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard, for example ... played by ... Bob Hoskins? The movie also stars the equally French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar and the characters are playing back from years as if they were in those Carry-On movies. <br /> <br /> I believe it's jokes too - to cast those actors who are not trying to act French in any way, to show them in the way of the broad English dance hall comedy, and to the whole flower's secret inexplicably to the audience. <br /> <br /> In the humor department, it's almost the Algonquin Round Table, isn't it? <br /> <br /> The movie is trying to be charming and peculiar, and I think these features are kind of funny. Not as funny as Ducksop or Love and Death, perhaps, but more funny than the Deer Hunter or the Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> This is an example of personal movie entertainment. It makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience, but remains true to its point of departure and its internal logic. Although all the situations are incredible, they are logical within the film's own bizarro world. <br /> <br /> I like this kind of eccentric movie in general, but I found this one to be too slow to be boring, boring, and too little pleasant surprises or true white. It's just a kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways, and wastes some wonderful talents on the go. It must be the lower point in the career of each of the big stars, which are all different players. I found this to be the biggest waste of talent since The Betsy, and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this thing. <br /> <br /> So call it an interesting lady and give it as a rent unless you really have a lot of time to kill. <br /> <br />
