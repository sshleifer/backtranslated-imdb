It is quite possible that I simply did not give the movie enough opportunity, because it was so unpleasant to me (something similar to Triplets or Belleville happened), but I really had to catch up with the movie and my roommate, " An exchange student from Japan immediately started laughing at the movie and said it sounded silly. Now, I disagree that it is stupid, the animation is very simple but clearly very skillful. It's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism while at the same time being strict in the kingdom of the surrealistic area. <br /> <br /> But the subject is completely unattractive to me. It has an interesting message about solidity and greed, but it's wrapped up in such an unpleasant package that it's hardly worth learning, especially since you already know it. The sound effects while the man is running running cherries and candle bumps are indeed repulsive. <br /> <br /> There was a clever scene of animation as we endlessly dive into the hole the man in his head as he pulls the juice out of his scalp, but it takes so long to seem to overshadow everything. There is so much stock in one order that it almost looks like the whole movie is about it. <br /> <br /> As I said about Triplets or Belleville, would it be a good thing for a late-night TV program such as adult swimming, or his Japanese counterpart, but an Oscar-nominated movie? It gives me the impression that there is generally not a long list of animated short films that the Academy can choose from.
