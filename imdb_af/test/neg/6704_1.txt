First of all I am a gay man, although my life does not live within the so-called "Community", and it is because of films like this that Gay themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90% of them are crap . Like the one. f I can give it a zero what I want. (I don't understand all the positive comments unless they're all made by people who made this movie). I actually stopped it at the 24-minute point when the so-called straight "Anthony" Adam kissed outside the restaurant for no reason. And how does the boy steal from dinner if he doesn't even live in the village? Wire Transfers? The acting was HORRENDOUS! The audio editing? (Listen to "Anthony" and Adam when they sit and eat on the fence. Every time the camera changes between the two so-called actors, the sound changes, as there was no filter on the microphone). Never rent, or God forbid, buy this movie. Horrible Horrible Horrible acting and just a stupid story.
