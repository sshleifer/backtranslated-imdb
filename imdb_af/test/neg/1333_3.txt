I rented the DVD yesterday, and it's only bad, it's a 4: 3 relationship movie, and it just gets worse, the acting is so bad and the movie itself is a way to be predictable. I was like watching the movie and telling myself: this is going to happen next and guess what happened? right ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good action box movie, don't look at this one that you will disappoint about this low-budget movie as I did. Ali sees his way better!
