I discovered "The Patriot" in a DVD store and thought it could be a real action thriller. No, it's rather a low-budget movie with a ridiculous story. It is undoubtedly a cable film and not one for the theater. Luckily after 90 minutes the movie stops, otherwise the audience would have to have an anti-sleep. One thing came: it was the nice country where the film was shot. You can really feel the American air, but that's all. I hope for Steven Seagal that he will eventually succeed in a big hit. It's not a must see because my wife and I chose an average of 4/10.
