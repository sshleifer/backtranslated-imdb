"Son of the Mask" is a terrible excuse for a movie. I saw it with my friend and I still wish we'd seen "Winn-Dixie" rather. I have to say it's partly my fault, as I agreed to see it with him. To be a fan of the first Mask movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious). I was hoping it wasn't as bad as all the critics said it was. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was heading for a disaster. Disgusting and useless attempts to be funny have seven and eight year old children screaming with laughter, but the rest of us listened to the screen in disbelief. <br /> <br /> Finding the movie as repulsive and unfriendly. It was even surprising to me, as I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman", two films that many people I know have found rough and offensive. But the thing is, "Son of the Mask" is not funny unless you are under the age of ten. <br /> <br /> The movie contains a lot of CGI in it, but it can't save this piece of junk. Anyone who allowed this movie to make it on the big screen probably thought it had potential, considering the success of its original. Unfortunately, it doesn't have one of the laughter, fun or excitement of the first, which creates a mockery of the original movie. I recommend renting the original "Mask" to anyone who thinks about this one. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this terrible mess.
