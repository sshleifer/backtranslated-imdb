It's another Bollywood remake of a Hollywood movie. Hitch ... If I'm correct. <br /> <br /> The movie has some fantastic moments that will make you laugh aloud, which actually comes just from Govinda who has become a legend in the Indian cinema and will always be his A Game in terms of comedies . Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav; who is hilarious as the gangster mimicking 'Don', an Indian icon of cinema. Lara Dutta is a plus ... I know I sound level, but it's mainly because I have a soft spot for her, she's trying to be funny, but it seems to be forced. Her play is weak ... but she still shines. Salman Khan is horrible, he tries to bring the cool, charming depths, but fails, he is about the deeds and shouts for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> "It's not acting partner, it's a spiritual challenge." <br /> <br /> Katrina Kaif is just bad ... not very good for anything. No charisma, no talent. And I don't see why people consider her beautiful. The plot was far-fetched and I had a hard time believing that Katrina's character was attracted to Govinda remotely. The only good thing is the music ... "You are my love" was the best in the soundtrack.
