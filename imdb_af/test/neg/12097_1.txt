For starters, the writing is immitative and inappropriate. The characters are shallow and formative. The plot has arbitrary reversal and non-followers. Baldwin's direction is terrible - these actors can do better on their own. The jokes and wastes fall flat. The shooting screens are clumsy and incredible. Baldwin puts himself as the wise brave hero, but spends most of his time in power struggle with women, especially with the wasted suppressed woman in their tunneling team, who always asks and denies. The conductor suffers from absurd incompetence, because he is unable to effectively employ a pistol he is carrying. Aomalies: A rifle with rifles bumped through a railroad, shocking people. The next time we see them going to sit, talk, eat, read, knit their business in their seats. In the New York subway, people sometimes get on the train to make some musical or dramatic numbers --- maybe that's what they think was "happening".
