This movie was so dreadful, so boring, so badly mistaken - it did a lot of work to make what was a sure thing in such a travesty. I love Lucille Ball, but she absolutely bumped into this movie. Too old, couldn't sing, looked like a truck that grabbed gravel, even if she didn't sing - and the biggest sin of all - she wasn't fine. Even a small one. The studio shot in the foot with this one, and for the destruction of what a fantastic screen version of a fantastic theater music had to be, other body parts should also have been wounded - or perhaps they lacked all those parts. This can explain it. But for Lucy to think she was ready for a part that SINGING needed - well, that's the saddest thing about everyone. It's a very good thing to know your limitations. Even a legend cannot come from a stinker and still smell like a rose.
