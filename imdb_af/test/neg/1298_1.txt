It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen; I gave it one star because it is the lowest score possible. Who thought Flood would ever be a good movie? The director and cast should be ashamed and then it set me up. It can all be part of a shambolic scare tactics. Only propaganda can be so bad. <br /> <br /> The redeeming feature of Flood is that it makes horror and shameless formula story funny. If only the characters had the same depth as created by the flood, but they galumph from sound bites to sound bites without any emotional response whatsoever. <br /> <br /> The sad thing about this movie is that it could have been so much better, informative, imaginative and tense. Flood has the amateur streak in many recent British films, where a more focused use of funds has made for better entertainment. <br /> <br /> Where was Smithee?
