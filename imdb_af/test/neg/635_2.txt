Look at Alien EXPRESS inspired feelings of awe, shock, pity and, yes, sheer horror. To think that actors who did good work in the past should come to such a thing. The horror, the horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me if any of these are known. <br /> <br /> A train specially designed for a political campaign is on its way to Las Vegas for a great rally. For the candidate, a Texas Senator (Barry Corbin, the only actor with roles both Foreign Express and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD PEOPLE in the same decade). At a railway crossing in Utah, a meteor burns a car waiting for the train to pass. <br /> <br /> The train stops. Local law enforcement is called in. Oh, could it be? The Senator has a lovely young lady (Amy Locane of CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who was married only once to one of the 911 callers. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND MAKER, LA BAMBA) is the former man. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, eeeeevil aliens have managed to hide on the train. <br /> <br /> Leaving the train. Lou gets his partner to run a helicopter so Lou can move on the train (about 70 miles per hour) so he can save the day. As the friend's reward, he falls into the helicopter into the mountain. <br /> <br /> What is another example of how poorly written Alien EXPRESS is. The police chief's sidekick must die, we all know it. But he is supposed to die near the end of the third hand, usually while saving several lives. <br /> <br /> Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel Bruce Willis into the HARD by wearing a women's t-shirt. Yes, Lou is 46 years old, but he hit the gym. The part he plays is not worth bothering, but he is in good shape. <br /> <br /> The Senator will have an afternoon delight with Miss. Utah, but negotiating aliens and both he and the woman are young enough to pay his granddaughter the ultimate prize. <br /> <br /> Soon we have bomb threats, increase aliens, and of course the train goes out of control and speed after its fateful date while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) are trying to save so many lives as they can. <br /> <br /> There is exactly one surprise in the whole movie. Early in the story, a few wine glasses lift up to their thirty-fifth birthday, hoping for another thirty-five years. The dude is burst, but he and the girl both live. Perhaps the writers just turned away from them. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you'd like on the wall. These actors who did better work (and really deserve it better than that) are probably just happy for the job. Did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile, or were they crying (and / or drinking) to sleep at night? At the end of the story, the (fairly numerous, all-contemplated) gatherers survive in the last car of the train, which is untouched. The other cars go over a cliff, but the one that contains the lead players just stops an inch from the cliff. <br /> <br /> Lou and his ex reunite. Happiness rules. I would have thought the first thing they would do was to get off the train so they had solid ground under their feet, but I'm going out. <br /> <br /> Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is bombarded with meteors that will be torn open and crawling crawling puppets with large teeth will be everywhere. <br /> <br /> It has come to a point that the words "The Sci-Fi Channel Presents" on an "original" movie tell us we will be happy to have Ti-Vo so we through the next two hours can move forward. Or, better still, just go ahead and wipe it in the story for two minutes and spend that time wisely.
