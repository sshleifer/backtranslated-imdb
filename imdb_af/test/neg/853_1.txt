Looking at the back of the movie, it seems to me and my friends can look forward to 82 memorable minutes. And it was definitely memorable. Puckoon was the kind of movie where you asked yourself how it was possible. How it was possible that it was released on DVD. Of all the movies that were available at the video rental shop that night, we might have picked the worst. And yes, they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this movie even amused me a little. Who got the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story through suggestions from the main character? From all the stupid things you can completely destroy a movie, this is my favorite now. The character Foggerty, the village idiot, played by Nickolas Grace is the most annoying character since they started making movies in color. If there is a single movie that you definitely shouldn't see this year, please let Puckoon be because I don't think it can be worse. I still wonder if it was the worst way I spent my money, and take my word that I made lots of fun in recent years.
