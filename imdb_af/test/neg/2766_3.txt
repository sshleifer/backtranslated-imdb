The film starts with a little girl (Rita) since her father was murdered. He was apparently a criminal who squealed on his fellow crooks. Later, and this part makes little sense, the girl grew to maturity and still her father's past haunts her! A little later, Rita meets a good-for-nothing and dates him. At one of his dates he was a bit drunk and drove like a total fool. The police are chasing and he is speeding away - in the meantime killing a pedestrian. Here comes the Really stupid thing. He convinced her to confess the crime, as he assured her, his lawyers could get her shot free. Why, oh why, will she agree? Yet she is doing and spending the next few years in jail !! And shortly after her conviction, this boyfriend disappears and shows that he is a total heel. What a bunch !!! Later, after her release, her friend (Jack La Rue) tells her about the truth about the boyfriend. Then he explained that the boyfriend's family had been loaded and she had to shed them for a lot of money for all the trouble he had put on her by taking the rap. Honestly, it makes sense - because they probably owed it to her - especially because they knew she was going to go to jail and had every intention of using her and then setting her aside. <br /> <br /> Now the idea of ​​booming money from the rich clogs is a good plot idea. However, there is no way it would have been in the first place, because it's hard to believe anyone can be so stupid to take the rap for a hit ride! In an interesting twist, the silly lady decides about a crime life - give a wig and pick up a rich man and take him in the desert and rob him of the gun! Wow ... how she changed! Apparently she likes the idea of ​​stealing phonics - that is, rich hypocrites. But it didn't make any sense, she soon stopped doing it and started shaking off the old boyfriend's father - why she was bothered to make some small robberies in the meantime, making little sense. And what was also a bit hard to believe was that instead of having money from the old one, she wanted him to put his influence behind a mob-controlled man for mayor. Strange ... very, very strange. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, another plot develops a young Alan Ladd. He is a shelter agent who infiltrated the gang. He was chosen because he was just a dead ring for a real crook - what a cliché! But it doesn't make sense that this real crook is not in jail and commits crime while the false gang infiltrates into another town. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Ladd's evidence is uncovered enough to issue lenders to the babies - including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing because in the meantime she has decided to become a decent and legal woman, as she has met a very good guy with whom she wants to marry! Wow, what's the chance? Overall, it's a goofy and rather stupid movie that suffers from 'kitchen sink syndrome' - in other words, there are too many plot elements and strange twists to make the movie the least credible. Plus, since the movie is just a little longer than an hour long, it all looks very much constrained and confronted. This is a relatively bad B-movie from the crap studio PRC of just performing Alan Ladd just before he got to Paramount the following year. <br /> <br /> By the way, this DVD is released by Alpha Video --- a company that sometimes releases amazing obscure titles (mostly public domain), but never cleans the prints or adds closed captions. In other words, the DVD production values ​​are strictly 3rd rate ... at its best.
