It's a pity to throw such a good idea. The main idea of ​​the movie is to travel in past lives, which fortunately is not a time journey, but a journey within man that has nothing to do with the past or the future. (Maybe they shouldn't be mentioned in the film at all, now I think about it. Another minus, I think). It's all in the present, in a different space ... Very interesting without causing much religious distress. <br /> <br /> The music, however, is quite repetitive, melodramatic, sentimental and out of place "!" There had to be more variety and more thought about where there would be music and where it was. space and running time and is completely unnecessary, the acting is not bad, although the language has better understood me. <br /> <br /> I think the idea needed some more thought, developed The interior scenes could have had better background settings, because in many cases it looks unreal, so I want to say that this movie leaves much to be desired ...
