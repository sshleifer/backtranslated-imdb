Honestly, I didn't really have high expectations for this movie, but at the same time I was hopeful. To direct it by Albert Pyun - one of the more well-known b-movie authors - didn't raise my hopes exactly. I mean how much Albert Pyun movie arranges it so high? Yes, exactly ... but still the film has advertised a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (premature stars), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. <br /> <br /> All this, however, is obstructing as the movie is so boring and so slow that the energy just seemed to drain straight from me the longer it went. It runs over 90 minutes, but it tells a story that could tell flat in 30 minutes. I don't know what Pyun went to here. I mean the movie drop artificial style, but it's sometimes a blur and maybe I'm an idiot to expect more of Pyun this time. Here it looks as if he actually has a budget and a potentially good role for the material, but it is all wasted. Crazy Six is ​​not much of an action movie, it's not much of anything. <br /> <br /> I think what's the worst here is the fact that I found the end credit the most entertaining part of the movie. The music score is actually half-decent with some smooth female fever, but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better. Avoid.
