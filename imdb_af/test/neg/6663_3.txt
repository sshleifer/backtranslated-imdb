While traveling by train, a woman (Stephane Excoffier) ​​accidentally enters a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. Earlier, she finds that a strange lone marketer (Jim van der Woude) does not speak her language, is the only person in that area and that was the last train in that track. The man lies in his house and they develop an unusual wordless relationship between them. <br /> <br /> "The Swap Guard" is an overestimated boredom, with another but uninteresting story going nowhere. I like movies outside of Hollywood, but this story is too absurd and finally has no message. The sexual tension between the two main characters is, in an instant, funny but too repetitive. I saw this movie in an old VHS and the picture is too dark; I don't know if the DVD will be the better-quality image. In the end I was absolutely disappointed with this feature. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Homem da Linha" ("The Man of the Line")
