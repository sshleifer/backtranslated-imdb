The creators of this movie have to sit down one day and say, "Let's make the Russians fun and at the same time show how advanced we are (Americans)." The film portrays the Russians as an inferior people who cannot understand the brilliant ideas of the Americans. It is true that US campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in any other country. However, this film goes a long way and it exaggerates the differences between East and West. For me, it looks like a propaganda film made during the Cold War.
