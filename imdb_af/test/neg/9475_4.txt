Well, first, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one girly and one is tomboy (Ashley is bigger than Mary-Kate already) and their boyfriends are not even French, so it is bad because they lapse the accents. Lamo. It's not that bad either, not their best. I'm a big Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, don't get me wrong. the storyline is right and it's funny to watch. It's not the type of movie you will watch over and over again. But hey, when they made this movie, they were always new and making their own movie thing. The girls also act as they are older than 13. But if you're a young viewer, it's a good movie. Not as good as you are over the age of 13, unless you are a parent watching a movie with your kids. then that's right. Good luck MK + A with your future movies!
