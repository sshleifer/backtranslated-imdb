Take your video camera, turn all the lights in your home and movie people around for an hour and a half with flashlights and you have the basic idea of ​​what this movie looks like. It is very annoying to watch this kind of movie. To be honest, there are screens of daylight at the beginning and end of the movie. I like scary movies and creature features, but this one just didn't do anything for me. So sorry. I really tried to enjoy it. There wasn't much of a plot except that we had to find a way here. Didn't learn too much about any of the characters, so it didn't matter if we lost one or two along the way. It's not the worst movie in the world. "Open Water" holds that title for now.
