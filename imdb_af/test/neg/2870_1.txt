I'm like Bam Margera, so I was curious. <br /> <br /> But looking at home production with someone else's friends and family, with a decent camera and a good guy, it's just not good movies. <br /> <br /> The writing, direction, acting and editing are at best improper. But I sat down half. And why? <br /> <br /> This film gives perfect examples of what not to do, it's a movie student's dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process. Cut it into film school curikulums across the joint! <br /> <br /> So thanx Bam! Now I know Jackass is really because you're not looking for an Oscar, men :)
