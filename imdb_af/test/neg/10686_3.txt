The animal eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. After watching Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The roughest was when the man ate the head of the mouse. But they were so quick and few that they didn't bother me. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the movie was just as interesting. I always like the silly voice recording. They never sound like you think the actor / actress will sound in real life. I like the bright colors worn by the princesses. The shots of strange search bugs were also cool. The youngest princess looks really young, almost 14 or something. The fighting scenes were not as long and boring as most fighting scenes, so it was good. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
