It's one of the nicest bad movies I've ever seen. I can't believe who wrote the review above was serious. Maybe he was bound to make it. It has nothing to do with it. There is no tension, the play is bad, the direction is hopeless. The music score (?) Is three trite notes played ad nauseam. The plot (?) Has been taken five minutes to write. The dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come to when asked to do a homework project. The only (slightly) redeeming feature is the actor who plays the psycho himself, who is grimace, trembling and gurns wonderful and therefore sometimes amusing. The only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you suffer from a weak bladder. Don't waste your time.
