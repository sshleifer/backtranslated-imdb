Don't suggest watching this movie 'TV', if it's not spiritually mature, the movie creates a fairly realistic simulation with the steps they take to prevent terrorism if such a touch of attack happens. London sets up a beautiful and cold city, while these kinds of wars are still going on, just wasting the time and money to study and live, every time you walk past P Square, the feeling is really obvious, uncomfortable , I don't want to vote, the point means nothing, just 4 'fill the white' <br /> <br /> Only juice and positive thinking cities encourage better economy and investors to invest time, energy and money to invest
