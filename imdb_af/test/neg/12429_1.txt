Something strange happens in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear, not cold. A giant robot-plastic monster appears and kills Scots! What is this movie? First, I love reading stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When I saw it for sale, I thought it was a cheap discount from jaws. No. It was terrible! The story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only side was the cool mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracy, wrong places, and bad things. Not worth it, just leave it on the shelf (or rubbish bin) you found. On the second note, this film was shot in Cailifornia, not Loch Ness, a huge dissection to Nessie fans.
