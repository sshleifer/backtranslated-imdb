A few weeks ago, at a kiosk, I saw a movie by El Padrino (2004) labeled "The Latin Godfather". How lame are we, Latin, just because he's a Mexican? I remind you that ANY Latin comes from or is related to Lazio, Italy. The original guy in the Godfather movie is therefore more Latin than the Mexican Godfather. That is why we are called Latin American people because we speak Spanish, a language based in the Latin language that originated in Rome. Placing a movie poster like 'The Latin Godfather' is not only ignorant, of course, if we are trying to relate this movie to the original Godfather, but a desperate and unashamed attempt to get credit by copying the title from a movie classic. Now about the movie, I hate just as much from 1 to 10. I think it's 3 most.
