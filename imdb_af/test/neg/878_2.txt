This is one of the more unromantic movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Casting: Richard Gere is just too old to look for more romantic roles. Diane seems a little eager to satisfy as usual, but she seems unsatisfied with the romance itself. Supporting role not too memorable. <br /> <br /> Story: The medical drama he handles is unconvincing and is not interesting. The story is weak - not enough to make a movie. There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here. <br /> <br /> The environment is a bit pale and the house in which it is set is unattractive. <br /> <br /> Not destined to be a good one to remember.
