Having eaten and properly consumed Human Pork Chop, I encouraged and obliged to inform potential viewers. It is NOT fun and the content of LAW nutritional value. This is according to the sowing The nature of this film, the following is a WARNING more than an OVERVIEW. This is the first time I want an IMDB "I-don't-care-to-rate-this-movie" button because the only response to this boring TRASH piece is stasis and indifference. Every possible rating will be wrong with all the other items listed here, but a "10" is in any case questionable, "1" may convince some readers that this is one of the cases "it's so bad that it's actually VERY bad and it's kewl! ", and" 5 "is also unsatisfactory. People may think it is a movie and good, if you want a little fun, it's not ... Honestly to God it's not a "10", a zero or a 5, it's nothing , a black hole, a philosophical work carried out by an embryo. I bought the region 3 DVDs, which were at least cheap ($ 7!) And of good image quality, I bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted under my own entry. Oh boy, I had to BE UNDERSTANDED. This movie is not shocking, nor disgusting, nor is it. It's not even laughing, it's not too serious to laugh, but still serious enough not to be slips. A truly unbeatable, amateur effort. The only order I found is when two giggling villains put an ugly dog ​​in a bag and bash it against a brick wall ... but even such a cruel point of departure leads to a poor performance. The further quoted TOILET SCENE is unrealistic and filmed without any sense of tension, suffering or humiliation - the faeces look like painted marsh milk! There is a butchery scene at the end of a tan 85 minutes, where three men are dressed in plastic raincoats (an essay also found on the cover of the DVD) starting with the female body. Remind me of "American Psycho" and "Shallow Grave", now these flickers are worth watching and true masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Let's be REALISTS for once and not hurry to make a myth out of every Asian-wannabe scary movie, as it seems recently ... <br /> <br /> looking for an eastern abomination, then try Danny Lee's masterpiece of the same (English) title "Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren raw Cha Shao Bao" (Human Pork Chop) from 1992 and compare - without reason I could add - with "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer". There is also a similar film that tells the same story to another movie person named "Ren tou doufu shang" of the same year, like a competitive production. Available as a 3 DVD region, it is considered to be better than 'Peng shi zhi sing jin tian liang'. I can add a few more words about the special effects ... what special effects?!? There are a few pieces cut off, they look terrible - in the wrong sense - probably "Made in Hong Kong". /> <br /> It's all about the information I can share on this topic, hopefully it'll be helpful ... enjoy your meal!
