The best scene of "The People Across The Lake" is actually the creepy, nocturnal opening scene with a home, a murder and a lake. After that, it's quite a lot of descent as far as the horror is concerned. A family (mother, father, sister and younger brother) has the (mild) dangerous environment of suburbs, and decides to live near the titular lake. From then on, the movie has too many lame happy family-related doo-doos near the lake, with occasional bodies appearing here and there. The few scenes where they discover the bodies are pretty convincing (in terms of creepiness), but they are in stark contrast to the rest of the gait (with just the daily life of the family they establish). The truth of the matter (the mystery about who does the murder) is learned too soon, leaving only the family unaware and grabbing the viewer during the undecided final (with a discovery in a cellar and running around the house), As if this made-for-TV thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror movie. It's not really bad; the content and story just isn't interesting enough. The only highlight in the film is Barry Corbin, although his performance / character is a bit too goofy to be taken seriously. Blonde candy Tammy Lauren (the daughter) can also be a recognizable face for eager horror junkies, as she also played in "Wishmaster" (1997) and made for TV outings such as "I Saw What You Did" (1988) " The Stepford Children (1987). However, she doesn't have much to do in this movie. Skippable, but viewable, if anything.
