Forget the fact that most people expect an action movie Seagal. This movie simply had nothing. Very long, pulled out and boring. Screens were much longer than they needed to be - the camera would often focus on something for a long time when absolutely nothing happened. Cure for insomnia. The worst Seagal movie by far (I like some of his other movies). 10/01
