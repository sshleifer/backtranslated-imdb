I can't remember when I saw a worse movie. The play is overshadowed, the dialogue is about to listen painfully, the special effects second class and the overall story laughing. <br /> <br /> I never wanted to go to a movie again, and if I was alone, I did it about 30 minutes, and I have almost two TWO EXTENDED HOURS of nausea-inducing dialogue and a Plot with more holes saved as a Swiss cheese. "The size of Texas." I just can't think of what a miserable experience that was through this collosal waste of perfectly good celluloid. <br /> <br />
