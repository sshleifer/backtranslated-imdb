A new wrestling show gives way to the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell is doing his utmost to sign the WWF champion Rip in the squad to watch Zeus for the 'Battle of the Tough Children' championship. But Zeus is in contrast to any rival that Rip has ever faced. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would give Hogan a gap as a wrestler who switches to a movie role, but this movie did not ask the Hulk for much of a stretch, it simply asked Hogan for himself to play, which he failed. 'Tiny' Lister made a good effort as the mighty Zeus, but even his work lacked the film, acting! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you like, with a salt grain and a sense of humor, otherwise you'll have to turn it off just over ten minutes.
