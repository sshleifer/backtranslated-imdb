The movie starts with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant fights the same vampires. This scene is probably the best in the whole movie. The rest of the movie is unfortunately cheesy, highly unrealistic and a Buffy the Vampire Slayer ripoff. The end time also sucks great time. <br /> <br /> Some moments like the scene where Gypsy and Helen (played by popular Chinese duo band Twins: Charlene & Gillian) are fighting over a stuffed teddy bear is especially afterwards. The storyline is also paralyzed, surely they could come up with something scary as a book called "Day for Night". <br /> <br /> Some good parts though. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong portray the film with their comic roles. But the good bits just end there. Charlene & Gillian (of Twins) has never been able to act well and make you too bad and the "friendly but difficult vampire" role was unfortunately given to Edison Chen who is a talented beautiful boy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 -
