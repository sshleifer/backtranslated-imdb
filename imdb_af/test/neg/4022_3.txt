What was it, Zucker's brother? I don't care for a little humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder's "The Private Life of SH"), but this version of "The Sign of Four" feels like a Grand Guignol-like episode of "Murder, she wrote" (right of the opening credits, which is of the worst possible type: a screen adjustment of the movie) as indicated by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a fine actor and certainly sees the part (he's a deadly call to The Strand's drawings!), But his interpretation of the character is wrong and excessively humorous, from the stupid smile he regularly sports (I thought the drugs Holmes was in cocaine, not weeds) to his expressions of comic stiffness in the carnival rows. Not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man, he is so over and over that we recognize us despite the fine makeup. David Healy is an unforgettable but, given the circumstances, acceptable Watson, and not too much of a buffoon ... at least no more than the rest of the characters. Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) plays Mary Morstan in an exaggerated grace fashion straight from a 1930's vaudeville. <br /> <br /> Stories show, there are a few pointless additions (such as giving Tonga vampire teeth, an appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live and a rejection from the island of Dr Moreau) and we are even denied that we discover the mystery next to Holmes, because we are well-informed about everything that Holmes finds out. And this is full of tired clich√©s. Not only do we get the infamous "Elementary, my dear Watson" (which, as any Sherlockian will know, Conan Doyle never wrote), but we are exposed to such blatant communities as having Hindi music. pop out nowhere when Holmes goes to see a white man in Hindi clothes. Bottom line: In Britain, in the eighties, two competing TV companies have been trying to create a long-running series of Sherlock Holmes adjustments. , and produced original TV movies as potential pilots. One of them was Ian Richardson, the other dying Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one who got through several episodes is the good one! <br /> <br /> 3/10. Mockery.
