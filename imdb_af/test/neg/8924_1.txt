I ran across this movie on a local TV channel last night. Honestly, I've never heard of this movie. Simply, I lost Seagual's recent movies, each one being worse than the previous one. Here again we have a dull Seagal as if he was asked by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted violently. The plot is ridiculous, acting under zero, and there is no single aspect to the movie. I just have no idea why Seagal did this movie. Man, this is even the worst of 'Out for a kill'! If you watch this movie, you will feel sorry for Seagal. He seems to be out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.
