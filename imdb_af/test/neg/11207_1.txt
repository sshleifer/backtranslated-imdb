What crack do you smoke? This movie, while wonderfully entertaining, is terrible! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are so obviously false it is kind of sad. The colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so hilarious, it's hardly worth mentioning. And when Joe stuck the bucket over his head and defeated the other lower man, I only relieved me. I can go on ... <br /> <br /> Entertainment, probably so. All right, no. Well done, definitely not. <br /> <br /> As a comment on America as rich, it's actually pretty good. Joe as a typical white victor is not so surprising, especially in the context of the American 1980s.
