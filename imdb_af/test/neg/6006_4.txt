This movie was really poor. I expected the theater to expect something exciting, and instead I had the opportunity to "turn the next story before it happens" skills. Seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick chalk so that everyone could see. Nothing was really shocking. In fact, even the gore was met with such a complete suspension of belief that it didn't really add much. <br /> <br /> The excessively creaking and talkative store at the crime scene made it all seem more ominous. And the scene where Lambert's character struggles with clues and reaches his "investigative epiphany" largely goes to indicate the level of mind of the audience - little. Probably the most annoying aspect of cinematography was the "X-Files" treatment: Every building in the movie, whether it's built, or a home at noon or hospital, suffers from a lack of any observable lighting (not to mention a lack of patients' in the case of the hospital). I don't remember a single scene when someone was sitting on a light switch. It would have been nice. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lambert is not really an Oscar-grade actor, so I think you should take this movie for what it is worth. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the only thing this movie will make is more entertaining to watch the "Warriors". Otherwise, you stay with a dull and indomitable effort, and nowhere near the equal films of the genre such as "Silence of the Lambs".
