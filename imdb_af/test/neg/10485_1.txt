This inexpensive and rubbish film is about a NASA test rocket that is sent with a load of animals in space. It disappears for a while and comes back unexpectedly, accident in a forest, and releases a vicious mutant creature. <br /> <br /> Like many movies of this type, Night Fright, stupid dominant boogieing features up to 60's of music before being murdered. None of the murders, however, is just a small thing, because we see nothing really. However, one thing we see is that one of the teenagers is about 40 years old and plays an impressive silly haircut. <br /> <br /> For a creature to work, it really needs its viewer to the viewer. However, in this film we only get the shortest glasses of the monster. It looks like it's alien to Robot Monster. But I'm not sure; as photography was so dark, I simply couldn't figure out what hell did much of the time. Although my feeling was that I probably wasn't missing much.
