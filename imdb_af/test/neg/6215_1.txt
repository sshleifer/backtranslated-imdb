The alleged author and director Mr.Dhawan almost copied the entire story of the Hollywood movie "HITCH" with Will Smith. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The plot is just copy pasted and some low grade humor (probably Mr.Dhawan's own creation) and regular dance was added to increase the movie time to local standards. <br /> <br /> Although Salman Khan and Govinda's acting have given us a few smiles, but they don't fit legendary artists as they are part of plagiarism, especially when they keep telling people about stop buying pirates!
