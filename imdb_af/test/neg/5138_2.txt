Forgetful pilot who never really explains why Nostradamus is really important for the plot of this movie, but Rob Estes plays a honk policeman who is for some reason Nostradamus and who is running timing medieval monks running around with guns people get started. fire to start the apocalypse. Oh yes, there is also a sexy FBI agent who is a pyschic and tries to get Rob to believe everything before it's too late. Badly they couldn't predict a better plot. Yawn. <br /> <br />
