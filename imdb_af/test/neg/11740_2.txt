* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an incredible movie, unlike any previous one. Every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was perfect. Not only did he break the rules, he set up a whole bunch of new people. <br /> <br /> Here's the spoiler: there's absolutely nothing new, different or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant not only pays tribute to Hitch, he rejects every idea and does it in a less original, more conventional way. I had nothing against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie. I like Drugstore Cowboy and I thought my own private Idaho was a very interesting movie. The question in Psycho's mind is, "Why did you do that, Gus?" In my mind there are only two reasons to do a remake: 1) The original was a good story, but the movie sucked. 2) The original was a good movie, but someone thought of a fresh, new approach to the material. Neither of these factors is not present at all in the Gus Van Sant version of Psycho. Apart from being in color, and there is one scene in which there is an astounding image of the title's possible inner dialogue (which I found unnecessarily), there is nothing new. <br /> <br /> I also found that the decisions left something to be desired. Anne Heche was good as Marion, but she lacked some vulnerability that Janet Leigh portrayed in the original. I did not feel so sympathetic to her character, because the choices she faced were much less limited than a woman in today's society, as opposed to the choices she made in the early 1960s as a single woman. would have had. Vince Vaughn had a few laughs with his version of an incredible naive Norman Bates, but I feel that Anthony Perkins's timing and nervous, ghostly appearance was much more effective. The only show I enjoyed better than the original was the character of Lila Crane, played by Jullianne Moore. She was excellent as usual, and brought a new strength and intelligence to the character. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is a beautiful camera work, especially during the well-known "bathroom scene" in which Van Sant takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of crimson. And yet, throughout the film, I had this annoying sense of love. Didn't I see it somewhere before? Oh, wait, I've seen it somewhere before! Almost every scene seems to be copied shot for the shot of the original. One almost feels that the director has made this film a school project. "Look, I can also make a Hitchcock movie!" <br /> <br /> If you're not finished, check out the original. It gets over the years and beats this little mediocrity, hands off. You won't be disappointed.
