I loved this movie when I was a teenager. Was crazy about it. However, it didn't grow big. Perhaps this is because it is a melodramatic cargo of old garbage, full of macho-holding, cheesy dialogue, overwhelming slo-mo and characters who say 'Goddammit'. The resounding narrative is jokingly slap from one character to another, one plot string to another, without bringing it all together. It doesn't help William Baldwin's mono expression of a performance wet enough to put out every fire in the movie. overlong runtime. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland are worth looking at, but no one is really at the top of their game, and the women's population is getting particularly short-lived. The only real impact comes from the impressive fire fighting, and Hans Zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all-time favorites.
