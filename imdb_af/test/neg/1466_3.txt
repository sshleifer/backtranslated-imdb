Hey, remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant? What a time it was. I want to say the book of life was when things really started to descend, but I will say he at least went up this one. A movie that seems to have been filmed on someone's cell phone does not have to be a bad thing if it is distinguished by an interesting story and dialogue, but unfortunately it lacks with Hartley's sparse dialogue. In their place, boring exposition on themes of Christian end-times and a short story of a modern Jesus in a coercion, packed in a hip-modern world where everyone looks like someone from a Hal Hartley movie. While it picks up a little in its second half, it is never enjoyable or particularly sensible. What happened to hell, Hartley?
