Get Smart to be titled Get Stupid. There is not one funny line or gag in the whole movie. This movie is so bad that it sees the Austin Powers movies Shakespearean. A few more movies like this and Steve Carell can kiss his career well. What is Anne Hathaway, what is she doing in this movie? She is a good actress, but is just terrible. <br /> <br /> The writing is pathetic lame. There is not one funny, smart or witty line. There is not one good point of view. <br /> <br /> Directing is terrible. Comedy relies on timing. Someone has to tell the director. Every line that is supposed to be funny (and not) is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 0 stars
