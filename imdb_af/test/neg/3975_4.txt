This movie is a mediocre, low-budget movie. I've seen much worse on MST3K, I can assure you, but it's still a nice crappy movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is about Clonus, a top secret government facility that uses clones to give organs to politicians. It is an almost Orwellian society, actually: almost (but not quite) effective. <br /> <br /> The movie starts descending when the main clone (Tim Connely or Emergency fame) falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who appeared in this and at most four other films (and it wasn't her first movie)). They start to suspect something. After a beer can was found in the nearby river, the plot begins to unravel. The clone receives no responses from either the chief scientist (Dick Sargent from Bewitched) or the "Confessional", a computer that probably knows everything, so he breaks into the main Clonus building and (in a scene that is suddenly destroyed by Mike and the Bots) find the truth (including a clone video that honestly shows the exact method used to clone Dolly five years ago ... and this movie was made more than twenty years ago ...) about Clonus. He broke free, pursued by two guards. He has one hell of a time through the two foot high fences, but he has a much harder time to climb a few rocks. From there it remains slipping. In addition, Peter Graves (The Beginning of the End), as the presidential candidate and Keenan Wynn (`Dr. Strangelove ',' Piranha ',' Once Upon A Time in the West ') and Lurleen Tuttle (' Ma Barker's Killer Bread ', 'Psycho' as the elderly couple helping Clony after he escaped. <br /> <br /> The MST3K version was priceless; one of the best episodes ever. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the film; 10 for the MST3K version.
