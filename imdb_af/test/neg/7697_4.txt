I watched this short movie on the DVD for Ridley Scott's movie, The Duellists. There was no performance by Scott before the movie, but it just started straight. <br /> <br /> Boy and a bicycle are hardly an example of Ridley Scott's other work, it doesn't look the same. The film shows a boy, played by Tony Scott, riding a bike. Guess what? That's all that happens. The boy drives around and continues with a useless, confusing dialogue. The film was shot in black and white, and as it was directed by Ridley Scott, I expected some cold cinematography or visually striking sets. Instead, I was treated with nothing. This movie isn't even good for a first try. However, I recommend that any Ridley Scott fan should check it at least once.
