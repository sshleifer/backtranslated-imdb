Oh, how completely, I'll reveal the secret: this movie stinks! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are a few ninety-nine dinosaur effects that were very exciting to watch for their time. Now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. They are just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. So they just sit there and I sit here and look, not laugh, not excited, just, well bored. It stinks! <br /> <br /> For a moment to practice my Jay Sherman, the movie really does. The box promises cowboys to dinosaurs and delivers in very generic sense. Kids dressed like cowboys are fighting some big dinosaurs. But really these guys are a lot of sissies, and the hero is a loser (more about this later) and the dinosaurs are hardly intimidating. The plot is a yawner, and there isn't much technically wrong with what is there to laugh. It's all just gray and slim. <br /> <br /> After an awful night kinematography (filmed in one and a half colors, I call it), we get the plot that some people do, do things. That was what I caught. Oh, and they're in Mexico at the beginning of the century, so they at least dress like cowboys, even if they don't. <br /> <br /> Such a lot of these people, I think, were human, they went into the desert, and they stumble upon these dinosaurs (after getting a miniature horse ... I don't know, let's go ahead). Then the film falls into a really pathetic King Kong ripoff in the final act. At that stage I lost the will to even keep my eyes on television, and I drove in and out of consciousness. <br /> <br /> The "hero" is played by the man from below the planet of the monkeys who essentially played Charlton Heston's role when Heston decided he didn't want to be in the sequel. He's chosen, shock, shock, he looks exactly like Heston. It's about everything he's going for him. I was very upset when he was the hero of the movie, because everything he does is shine, snow, the chick falls into the movie. (Who is called TJ. Unfortunately, she is not a prostitute or eventually the origin of the name would be revealed). Meanwhile, his friend killed all the dinosaurs, saved the day several times, and what did he get for it? Not recognition, nothing! And he dies and sacrifices himself for his friends! They don't even wait for him to escape! <br /> <br /> Drilling, long, slow, with little to enjoy until the movie decides to copy King Kong's script on its own, it is best to avoid this movie unless you enjoy pain on the scale to drop an anvil on your eyeball.
