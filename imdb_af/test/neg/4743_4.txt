When I saw Alien vs Predator a few years ago, I must be as stupid as a successor it was, it was quite pleasant. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of good movies in the theater, so my boyfriend and I decided to just go ahead and see what AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem was. So we saw it a few nights ago and I have to say that there was absolutely nothing excited about this horror prosecution. It took a completely different turn from the first AVP movie. It is not a bad idea that they took Alien and Predator and put them in the front-class suburbs, but from the idea of ​​the first one explaining their reasons for existing, it was just an average and predictable horror continued. Not to mention a story that contains every new scene of new characters, where I wasn't sure who to keep in mind about who the main character was and why, so I couldn't keep the story together. <br /> <br /> Of course, what I have collected is the Predator and the Alien in space to deal with the bunch of typical sitting neighbors, they just beat the lights apart and they decide why. ? Go ahead and take it out on some Earthlings. So they crash and Alien takes over the suburbia utopia. But teenagers, including a troubled couple who look like Ken and Barbie, will make a female marine and her daughter make sure they kick a spaceflot, if the predator doesn't even get there. Being ticked off at the Alien, I encourage you to start the festival without him, lol, just to joke, actually to kill some of his friends. <br /> <br /> AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem is not the worst movie of any standards, it's pretty cool with lots of visual effects and the battle sequence between Alien and Predator is so cool to watch. As the first successor to Alien vs Predator, the role is the role of the film, and they seem to be not well developed. I know it's horror, but the original Alien and Predator movies have characters that you care about and want to win. But it was a semi-decent successor I would say is a look for fun, especially for Ken and Barbie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
