What could have been a good movie about late poker pro (pre-poker craze) Stu "The Kid" Unger has become a disappointment. <br /> <br /> You can say the filmmakers worked on a short rope. budget. Everything looks like the cheap film. Timelines came to me slightly. <br /> <br /> Casting Michael Imperoli of Sopranos was also a bad deciding choice. He looked too old to play the baby-sighted Stu. He looked too healthy for a chef addict (if you look at the WSOP main event of 1997, the true Stu was so thin and had almost no nose for too much cocaine so he wore the sunglasses to hide them) , and I expected Adriana to pop up and shout "Chris-tu-phur !!!" <br /> <br /> They also surrendered to having a son of Angie's previous relationship who committed suicide in the late 80's. <br /> <br /> Every time I see Vincent Van Patten appear, I thought he was going to announce: "Show tunes in Stu's head." as he does on the WPT. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for real Stuey footage, watch ESPN Classic as they relive so often the 1997 WSOP Main Event. Or try YouTube. Avoid this move as a bad measure.
