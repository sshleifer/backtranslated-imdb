This film is by far and beyond any shadow of doubt, the single worst and most enchanted film in the history of the universe. <br /> <br /> It's really * so * bad. <br /> <Personally, I always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a horrible movie, and hired this one to think it would be one of those. To my great disappointment it was not. <br /> <br /> The script was delivered in a way that reads the lines directly from posters, the story makes absolutely no sense and the real movie looks like it's shot on a home video camera. I couldn't even finish it. It's even worse than the "Witch Academy", and it's quite an achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> I can't even understand how a director could shoot this movie and still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release. <br /> <br /> Painful, terrible, terrible.
