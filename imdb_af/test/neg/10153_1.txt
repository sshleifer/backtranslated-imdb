I did it on a dual-function DVD called "Scream Theater" and this is undoubtedly one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. And I saw some very bad people. The school's out, and of three girls (who if they are teenagers, I want to eat my hat) talk about "non-stop party", so of course everyone goes to the girl's home whose parents are the strictest for a sluimerpartytjie. Meanwhile, a psychotic escape has the local backyard where one girl's father works and is loose with sharp objects and green scrubs and sports-wide eyes. I think it is to show he is bonkers. Of course, since he has a bone to pick up with that particular doctor, he goes to his home, where the place is obviously common knowledge. In the meantime, some dumb-jock types are beating out and out to frighten the girls, and of course the loony also shows up and begins to cut the throat. And it's about as the heavy metal music moves in the background in the background. Or, maybe it's not, but really, that's all you need to know. Unless you spend your time continually stoned or drunk, you will find little interest here, and even if you are wasting most of the time, you may be insulting your intelligence. 1 out of 10.
