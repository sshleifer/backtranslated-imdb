My wife and I enjoy bad science fiction movies. Some movies are so bad they are good. Mansquito was one of those. That one was bad, but it has some redeeming features. It makes you wonder how a self-respecting actor lines like "Hey! Mansquito!" Closer. <br /> <br /> This one is so bad, it now has its place as our bad standard. It's not just a bad movie, it really stinks. There was the coed strike force, the "Indian" driving around in a black robe and using a SWORD to cry out loud. He shot a helicopter with an arrow !! <br /> <br /> We've been trying to laugh at this movie, but there were no points that didn't rise above it. We couldn't come up with any redeeming qualities except one. These were the words "The End" <br /> <br /> There was no plot, no character development, and no point for the movie. Someone in Hollywood must be fired.
