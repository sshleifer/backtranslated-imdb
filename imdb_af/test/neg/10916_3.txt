1983 was a bumper year for Stephen King books making it on the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone and Cujo are all released from each other within a few months. While The Dead Zone was easy to pick from the crowd, Christine and Cujo were both bad, and that's a decisive thing about what the least of the two is. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, fresh from success as Elliot's mother in "ET - The Extra Terrestrial") is a mother whose family has a good answer. marriage to husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) hangs through a wire. She had a relationship with a local worker and now lives on whether to leave her husband or not. Tatty Trenton (Danny Pintauro), the son of Donna and Vic, and a beautiful, revamped child with a chronic phobia of darkness, often leading to severe panic attacks, are dragged into the war. Donna and Tad take the family car to a nearby mechanical yard for repairs, but when they stop their car splitters. Things get worse as they discover that mechanic Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) is not there (he was cruelly murdered by his pet dog Cujo, a giant St Bernard recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) The dog soon caught them in their car and tried to get everything in the vehicle to tear these two victimless victims apart. The weather is hot; Not a living soul knows they are there; the car will not start; and the dog wants their blood seriously ... <br /> <br /> Cujo has the potential to be a real stranger, but it never really knocks in gear. I read the book and it's rather disappointing - certainly for King - so it's hardly surprising that the movie version is so little. On the printed page, King was able to generate at least some tension, but the film is critically obstructed by the fact that a St Bernard is simply not terrifying. The "fishery" of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that Cujo is a St Bernard. In the book it was possible to forget it. In the book, Cujo sometimes suggested almost the shape of a monster. Even with the relatively short time of an hour and a half, Cujo becomes a boring and patient experience, sometimes unintentionally funny and certainly never as exciting as it wants to be. They even left out the book's cruelly poor end and replaced it with "everything that ends well" so the audience can go home with a cheerful mood !!! Get this one as another inferior King adaptation.
