Great actors, good filming, a potentially interesting plot, and what had to be a good dialogue. Nothing else is good about this movie. Perhaps the author or director thought they could make a thought-provoking movie of annoying characters as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> Within 10 minutes I didn't think Kim's portrayal by Caroleen Feeney was so bad that it was a distraction. While Kim is supposed to be an impersonal character, I'm not sure I'm supposed to commit acts of physical violence on her. The first (of many) bizarre things that happen is that West (David Strathairn) in about 3 seconds of "I miss $ 50.00" to "She stole $ 50". It was quite unquestionable as she (Kim) never had access to his wallet, and she was not a master bag either. There was simply no reason to suspect her. Most people have lost money and misplaced and just accept that ... we lost it. The same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior that is supposed to be (I think) a look at real people. The character of Kim was, at least, suffering from a BiPolar disorder. West had huge insufficient issues, Nancy was just boring, and Matt was deceptive (especially about music). I actually turned it off about 2/3 of the way. However, to write a valid comment, I forced myself to return it in the hope that something will come together in this movie. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make it a point to miss this one.
