This ultra-low budget kitchen sink is the kind of movie that can only be made in the UK, where a market elsewhere needs to exist before a green light will be given. Probably self-funded, this is clearly an attempt to rectify important issues, but ultimately undermines its existence by demanding it. Who would ever be in distributing this and secondly if a market doesn't exist to look, buy or rent this movie, why would anyone bother in the first place? My opinions sound unfairly on a director for the first time, but it is the kind of movie that only undermines the commercial viability and quality standards that only a British film industry exists. View in Edinburgh. 2 out of 10.
