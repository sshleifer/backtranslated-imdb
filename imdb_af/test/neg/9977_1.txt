I'm almost embarrassed to see CALIGULA twice. The problems with the production are almost too much to mention. The script is substandard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to deny it). The direction is worse. Most of the movies consist of long shots between cut and close-ups that occur between intersections of mostly non-erotic pornography (more commonly in the "rough" version). The cinematography is especially subpar, which gives the whole production a cheap washed out appearance that undermines some of the extended set designs. The movie had to look much better. The overall concept of placing name actors in what would easily be an X-rated movie (Guccione calls it "paganism"), is thin after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud went out. Of course, Bob Guccione made a lot of money on this, but it all looks like a big waste. If you want a better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, watch the BBC's production of CLAUDIUS in the middle of the 79th session. And if you want, you see, Louise, look somewhere else.
