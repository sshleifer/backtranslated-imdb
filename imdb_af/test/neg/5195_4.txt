If I knew what I had filed myself, I would have fled the theater. The film is terrible, in the literal sense of the word. In spite of striking images, interesting places and a fascinating subject, the film died. <br /> <br /> I was unfamiliar with this period of Greek history and was prepared to experience a wonderful movie. The filmmakers' hand is heavy. it is not enough to see a train; We have to see it from afar, we need to see the car by car, we must see the smoke, we need to see it slowly, and we have to see it stop. The director's approach is didactic. Likewise, the characters he creates never develop, they never change. They are so stereotypical that we wonder, are they meant to be Everyman? Everygirl? Everyoldmusician? Is there any reference to this allegory? This is the most pretentious movie I've seen long ago.
