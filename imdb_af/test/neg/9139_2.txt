After enjoying Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi, I look forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and see what direction it has taken. Rarely did a film so spectacularly fail to live with its predecessors and lose its way. While trying to represent 'civilized warfare' in the form of sports, science, commerce and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the coherent developed themes of its predecessors. War is chaos, but even wars have a purpose in mind and this film has little structure and unclear goals. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic mix of images that do little to develop its theme. On the positive side, it wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of last century's wars. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is so unique that I remind you several times that I didn't watch an ad that the American promoted. way of life. Perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing "War on Terror". When portraying "sport as war", the prominent team logos ensured that the US was portrayed as the winner. Therefore, it missed the opportunity to portray some of the many sports around the world and show that humanity is united in the use of sport as a form of civilized warfare. <br /> <br /> Apart from the news rule, the footage was similarly shot on a budget in New York's borders and there was little recognition of "life as war" in the rest of the world. The waxworks gallery just cut the need for important people outside the US. The makers missed the point that globalization does not mean Americanization. <br /> <br /> The Philip Glass soundtrack looked very much like any other Philip Glass score I heard (with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi) and best described. as "unofficial", do not add or detract from the chaotic imagery.
