CONGO is probably the worst big-budget movie of the 1990s. It's so bad it is visible over and over again. A lot of people with different agendas sin deep in the darkest Africa, experiencing a wealth stamp, just like in KING SOLOMON'S MINES - but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding the wealth. On their side, the people have a "talk" gorilla named Amy who saves the day at some point. So much for the plot. The whole dialogue is impeccable, the acting is almost uniformly horrific, definitely champion (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are both going to ensure the ham factor) and the special effects are uncomfortable. Wait until you see the cannibalist gorillas. And the lava! Oh yes, did I say there is a volcanic eruption to bowl out the big finals? Laura Linney of all people is together for this biggest ride. What could she think? It's about the same time she appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in PRIMAL FEAR, a movie that helped to guarantee her stars.
