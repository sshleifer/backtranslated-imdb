Considering the film's reputation as truly the worst of the worst, I look forward to Wood's Crappus Opus (my word); It is not necessarily more than indifferent to the other Woods I watched - but from the REEFER MADNESS (1938) school's film, GLEN OF GLENDA is not as easy as enjoyable as its genre efforts. br /> <br /> It also appears as the Horror legend Bela Lugosi's nadir (his first of three collaborations with the director): one wonders if he was really aware of what kind of movie it was (taking into account the actor's history of heavy medication and the mere senselessness of his cameo). In addition, Lugosi's idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps in his most uncomfortable way ... although Wood's manuscript usually blames it - the impossible dialogue (with repeated indifferent clues to "puppy tails" and "big fat beats") he handed the sick star. ! By the way, Wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym Daniel Davis) - and it is just as worthless in this area that it has become an everyday dog! Dolores Fuller - his wife and co-star - was also disobedient (she will also appear in JAIL BAIT [1954] ... but at least the image where the latter eventually allows Glen to wear her angora jersey, Tim Burton's loving biopic ED WOOD (1994) his famous poster! <br /> <br /> By the way, the latter film contains a presumably fictionalized meeting between Wood and Orson Welles, well, for all purposes, GLEN OF GLENDA, is Ed Wood's CITIZEN KANE (1941), who gave his joyous propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques: in fact, the heaviest thread of the plot is filled with stock in general (much of it is irrelevant, such as the devastating cases of S&M) and relentless dream sequence (highlighted by the presence of an indifferent devil's sporting forest eyebrows that would make Martin Scorsese weep with envy)! The film's sincere effort to plead for tolerance and psychological investigation into the tribulation however, transvestism is sabotaged in turn by the mere amateurishness of the approach. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth is the issue I've looked at the "Extended Re-Issue Version" which included six minutes of "corrupt" footage (led by W. Merle Connell) censored on original release! Furthermore, my copy eliminated so much every time (which forced me to rinse it back slightly to get the sound back on track) - unfortunately it was the fault of the source converting to DivX as opposed to the movie itself.
