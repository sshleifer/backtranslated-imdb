* MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In this so-called satire, Chaplin puts his vision on the evils of German fascism. He plays the twin roles of Tomanian dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects, an inadvertent First World War hero and Jewish hairdresser. Through events inspired by Adolf Hitler and the Marx brothers, Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war against neighboring Osterlich, while finding time for many, odd-flat layouts. The dictator's celebrated waltz with an inflatable world is actually quite melancholy, subduing and indecent. <br /> <br /> Chaplin should definitely be praised for lampoon Hitler and for expressing strongly on celluloid - his very malicious final speech is actually the daring, memorable highlight of the piece - but the movie is simply not sharp or funny enough to earn the praise that is often attached to it, and not to claim repeated views. The best gags are away from Hynkel's tiring posture and involve the hairdresser who tries to avoid a big turnbuckle (a row stealing from the gun in The Gold Rush) and later, with a pot on his head, accidentally from the shelf off its shop. <br /> <br /> Compared to the silent classics of the directors, the Big Dictator is slow, wildly contradictory and quite somewhat satisfying, while the barren play between laughs is often difficult to endure. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing photos and the Great Dictator stands like that.
