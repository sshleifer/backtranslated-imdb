With a movie of mostly low-end stars (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert), there are bad special effects (sure, it was the 70's, but "Alien" and "Star Wars" come from the same decade) and a storyline what is so laughing that one might want to cry, it is a "flight" that must be grounded. <br /> <br /> Even the Oscar winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy can't keep this "bird" in the air. </ br> <br /> The impossibility of the third movie - aircraft under the Bermuda triangle - is far more credible than this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid "The Concorde" at all costs!
