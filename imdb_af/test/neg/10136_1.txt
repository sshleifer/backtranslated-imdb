Oh, I, hell, where do I start? First of all; This show is just another dumb American non-funny so-called comedy that has pathetic acting and very poor humor. The American way of laughing business makes the whole thing worse. How can I laugh, but nothing funny happens? Nice stupid, eh? This show is only for the American people who have never heard that there are much more fun, better and whiter comedies - not only in Great Britain but also in America (The Simpsons, for example). I simply can't understand what is so good about "Reba" that it has long been in television. It has nothing new to offer, it underestimates the (possible) viewers in so many ways and it is simply not funny at all. I could have lived with the fact that there were so bad performances as "Reba", but why the hell they had to run here in Finland. If I see a few seconds of this terrible performance, the rest of the day is ruined for me. Take my word and believe me - this show sucks ass even more than this kind of American "comedies" usually. It's simply awful. Do yourself a favor; Don't see this peace of peace. <br /> <br /> Well, I leave the comments for those who now have this language better. Thank you for your (possible) interest.
