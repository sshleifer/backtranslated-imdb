This spying melodrama has a pretty, almost promising role, and had to be very atmospheric; There is a will, or an intention of atmosphere, and also a lack, or lack thereof. <br /> <br /> Sheen plays a dissident now active as an agent, he is a loner, loves women but haughty; Mrs. Fossey is her mistress. Neill plays the gallant, generous, knightly Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> Sheen and Neill are both really annoying; Finlay does a cameo, and so do other well-known actors. Mrs. Fossey is hot; but then she is always. <br /> <br /> I'll be your true friend and break it for you. The movie is low on tension and on excitement; it's thin and very boring; The good thing is that you are Mrs. See Fossey naked. Other than that, lukewarm derived spying exploitation.
