I am currently beating Gibbon's Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire, so I had Roman things in my mind. I'm not very far in it, maybe two hundred plus pages, but it's just amazing how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe I have so far perhaps read 15 emperors and only Antony, Trajan and Hadrian have not been killed or at least killed. I am also fascinated by the evil of many of these Roman princes. Not the least of these was Caligula. This brings me to reviewing this movie. I think of the film on a historical basis as I understand it from Gibbon's explanation of Rome, as well as other research on some good sites and some fiction novels related to the period. <br /> <br /> My point is, I don't think this movie is what it believes by many of its proponents. I don't think the depravity shown by the sex and abominable violence of this movie qualifies it as accurate. The general ideas of the movie seem accurate. Caligula is raised on an island, banished by his family and in fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange emperor Tiberius. He becomes paranoid and scared and can never give the prized nickname given by his guards, Little Boots. It helps him grow, feel abused and powerless. He is surrendered to the emperor after Tiberius's death, the senate who hopes he will get away from the information panel killing the incident of the former trans-paranoid tyrant, and carrying Rome away from the madness upon which the dictator settled. Caligula begins as a decent as a hands-emperor, but gets sick, almost dies, and returns from the edge of feverish death to a true monster. His perversion with his sisters started here, if not before. He killed Macro and many others who were his original supporters. The acts of madness were not Caligula's murders as much as its new thinking of itself as a living God. He saw how he spoke to the image of Jupiter as an equal man. His violent outrage would have been doomed to him anyway, and three years was a decent run for Tiberius's successors. Well, the movie basically sticks to these lines, while being able to be coherent, not quite common. It does so while trying to shock the audience on all turns. At each stage, the movie desires you to be disgusting through the depravity. of ancient Rome. The shocking scenes are about which this film is completely built and where it completely fails. It is just too much to see successive rulers see that men have been murdered, raped, tortured, without intercourse. The depictions of violence are possible, but not likely, accurate. Murder was definitely the order of the day in imperial Rome, torture was ahead of time. But the directors' visions of these deaths and the bored entertainment of their protagonists, while the bystanders watch with nonchalance, just don't see it go exactly like that. The killer, the controller, is definitely something you've never seen in movies, and something you've ever seen will probably never forget, as you wish. Drinking the wine while cutting the penis is the same. If you've seen this shame, it's yours forever. These things hit me the director and the pornographic fantasies. They came from their sick imagination and not from any proven record. <br /> <br /> The play is pretty good. Actually, I think McDowell is the worst link here. Mirror is always something to see, and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful. The portraits of Nerva and Tiberius are well done by their respected actors. The movie could have told so much better story, it's such a failure so it's just a whole different layer of what a shame this thing is. For example, it could have given an opinion on how and why Caligula got angry or showed that he was angry, paranoid before his illness and that the fever had broken the spiritual limitation he had previously. It could have shown Claudius' weakness and the miracle that he survived Caligula. It can have this and many other things, but it sticks to its sad nightmares. <br /> <br /> Finally about the sex. This is porn. It shows that these sexual acts are done by many people throughout the palaces. Male on man, woman on woman, man on woman. It's passionate, disgusting sex. Sex, if your point is to get out of there, I seriously doubt you. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been sex addicts, and orgies may be common enough, but the visions in this movie seem to be more than a Greek one as a Roman. I don't think the kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies that were straight in the open was common to the strange, corrupted rule of Elgabalus, and he was killed for it. <br /> <br /> This movie should never be watched, if you are curious about it, let it go. This is something, as I said earlier, if you see it, you will still keep sick visions in your mind for years. I don't think she's an accurate historical picture in particular, even though it's historically the whole.
