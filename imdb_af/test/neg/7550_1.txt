I saw Rik Mayall in Blackadder and the New Statesman, so I thought I'd try this movie. <br /> <br /> About 16:00 I bought it, around 20:00 I started looking at 8.15pm I quickly transferred the rest of the film to see if there was something for a person with a brain was on the watch, but it wasn't. At about 8:45 I threw the DVD into the garbage. And that's where this "movie" belongs. <br /> <br /> What ever happened to British humor? The humor so fine and witty, intelligent and artificial that you find in Yes, Minister, Blackadder, Vicar of Dibley, Fawlty Towers or The Fast Show? The black humor Britain is so famous for? I don't want to offend anyone, but I suppose even stupid children won't find this funny. They deserve more intelligent fun. And Rik Mayall, you can do better, so please, do!
