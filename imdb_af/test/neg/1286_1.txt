This movie comes down like a square pin in a square hole. A badly made pen. An item that is so cheap cannot even be produced in a sweetshop assembly line in Chinatown, Mexico. In fact, if you try to push the pen into the hole for which it was apparently designed, it crumbles into sticky, disgusting pieces that smell like rotten rot and don't wash off. Quigly is such a pen. <br /> <br /> This movie is so sensible, it can't even be created. A movie like this had to be the result of an accident of nature; a little freaky entity standing and holding somewhere in the corner of a branch office and growing until it was too big and scary to look at. Only science would be interested in such a thing; Anything that is not bent on studying it will stick it out of this world. <br /> <br /> What matters is: if you're the kind of enjoying first-year violin, racism, or Coke Zero, it's just your birthday.
