There were so many reasons why this movie could have been. I'll give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Sienna Guillory. She is very hot in this movie and was the reason why I chose to look it first. <br /> <br /> 2. Tim Curry. Wonderful bad guy and I am always excited to see him in movies (even House Alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3. Jason Donovan. For all your Aussies and Poms out there, it's a rare treat. Former neighbors star 80's heart-slapped in drag clothing selling drugs. <br /> <br /> Neither of these things nor the fact that the film about the drug / rave culture has managed to make this movie even interesting. The script was dull, the performances were ordinary and despite the scenes with J.D and any scene with Sienna, I searched everything about this movie. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
