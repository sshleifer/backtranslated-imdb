Why? Why? Why on earth does anyone tell the truth about this horrible, LOVE movie? I wake up in the morning and ask God why He did not prevent me from seeing this rebellious "comedy". I can't believe I paid to see this offense after my cinematographic taste. I'm starting to think that the 5 stars have it because of Martha Higareda's nudity and all the men who can't buy a porn movie and it won't see. I'll call it because it calls it movie. insult to the Mexican film industry. The characters are a great clich√©, the acting causes involuntary laughter and the writing is ... well, I can't believe one wrote it. And just when you thought you were tortured enough ... the last half hour was so painful that I wanted to squeeze my eyes. The only good thing I can say about this horror is that it only lasts 90 minutes (it wants to feel for centuries, but still). Really, avoid the pain !!!
