What Welles said was that he was his entire career. <br /> <br /> There was an interesting story here. Unfortunately, Welles was completely impossible to tell. Instead, he tried to tell a lot of different stories, about Elmyr, about Clifford Irving, about his pumping views of critics and experts. Oh yeah, and try to jump, start his current friend's career by giving her unnecessary screen time. (Oh, honey, when they told you to sleep with the director, they didn't mean a whale on a beach!) <br /> <br /> Welles was probably trying to deal with A lot of footage from Clifford Irving as Irving is becoming a household name with his role in the obsolete Howard Hughes autobiography. Unfortunately, this means that the subject of his film, Elmyr, didn't have the time he deserved and he was probably the more interesting story. <br /> <br /> The big tragedy of Orson Welles was that he started early, and then spent the rest of his career sputtering, eventually doing wine dealers and terrible documentaries.
