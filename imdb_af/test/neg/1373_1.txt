while man's mind could be summed up as nothing more than a clone of chappelle's performance, it's really worse than that. First of all, Carlos Mencia is a jacket ** that is as funny as he was originally, which doesn't say much. The show features lame spoofs of American television advertising and political issues, and Mencia's "comic" insight into politics adds to the low quality of this show. In addition, mencia throws in more ethnic jokes and stolen Jeff Foxworthy lines than I can count on one hand. while Carlos gets a cheap laugh each time, he spends the rest of the time insulting everyone in sight, which means his own audience is exploited. With the exception of the South Park, drawn together and standing on Friday night, this show shows the end of the chappels' glorification days, which were for those who had not heard before going to Africa.
