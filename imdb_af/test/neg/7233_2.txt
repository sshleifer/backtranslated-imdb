I bought this movie on DVD for Â£ 4, but it was a waste, the movie is very bad. The plot is your average monster movie, where it kills a few people, the mayor / chief does not believe it, and they fight at the end. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, movie quality is great, and New York's setting is impressive for a budget movie - as opposed to a small coastal town. The play is also reasonable. <br /> <br /> But the special effects, main stage in a monster movie, are laughing and the addition of a random bus load of kids to the plot halfway just gets weird. The end is just bad. <br /> <br /> In summary, when you have a chance to see it, do not - there will be something better. <br /> <br /> RTC "True horror movies don't have a PG rating"
