I read a lot of books in my short lifetime, but this is by far the WORST !!! I just finished reading this worthless piece of waste and when I finished it I threw it over the room! I hated it and let me give the reasons! 1. The soldier dies. Why would the author kill the soldier? Why couldn't she have kept him alive like a good love story writer? I greet Patty a lot to try and beat the FBI agent's eyes. <br /> <br /> 2.Ruth is fired. Ruth (the black housekeeper) is fired and for no apparent reason! She tried to comfort Patty and then Patty's SOB dad didn't fire her for no good reason! Ruth and Anton and Patty were the only points in the book. Oh and the grandparents too! 3. The perm. Yes. The perm. Now you can think of people why the perm will upset you? Well, here's why. Patty's mother asks the girl if she wants to do her hair. Patty says no, but the mother calls Mrs. Reeves (the terrible hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a perm. Why would she do it on God's green earth? Why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a perm, just to get her a perm anyway! The mother always pretends that Patty has a say if she doesn't have a say at all !!! She must be given the "Worst Mother of the Year Award" for the things she teaches Patty. Thanks, Ruth cut off her perm! 4. Discrimination, Racism and Bias. I hate the discrimination in this book. They use the word * beep * too much. Yes. I know blacks were free in those days but basically had no rights, but come on! Why do today's children learn the word! It just teaches them how to discriminate people. Not only were blacks discriminated against, but also the Chinese. In the book, people refer to Mr.Lee (a Chinese man) as "The * beep * It is really despicable and last but not least ... Jews and Nazis. I hate the town to have a little girl spit wrong for her love Anton, she is a 12 year old girl! It was just a loved one. Like a 12 year old, I really love a 22 year old. is not 'Lolita' and 'Lolita' is a good book, not a piece of dirt! I am surprised that this movie is not considered "dirty" as "Lolita". <br /> <br / > 5. Patty goes to a reformer. Patty shouldn't have Reistoria is for thieves and murders, not innocent 12-year-olds. The teacher or whatever she's called Patty, an ungrateful, spoiled brat. Patty was not spoiled, because her father and mother never had to have Patty community service or anything, she did nothing wrong, she just helped a friend. <br /> <br /> 6. Favortism. parents played favoritism with their c hildren, Patty, theirs First-born daughter is clearly the least benefited while Sharon, five-year-old Brat, is their favorite daughter. The father says he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood, but clearly forgot his other daughter. <br /> <br /> 7. The father. I hated him! He was so mean that Patty had only Hitler as her father. Her dad doesn't hit her for any obvious reason and the way he eventually speaks to her will make you so angry that you're caught. "Patty will get better treatment in a concentration camp." <br /> <br /> There you have people. 7 reasons I hate this book. Instead of reading this book, read "The Days of Anne Frank" or something else because I warn you, it is very depressed and it will make you very angry! The only reason it gets 4 stars is because of Anton, Patty, Ruth and the grandparents!
