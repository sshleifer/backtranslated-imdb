What? - That was it? The villager (John Agar) blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write it? Did I just see it? <br /> <br /> With instrumental instruments by The Wildcats, "Night Fright" is one movie never earned as late as 1967. The gorilla's boom was over and anyone other than Ray Corrigan in a monkey pack is just asking for trouble. Repeat in black and white and set the story for about thirty years and you will have at least a 4.0 rating on the IMDb. But unfortunately this one had never had the chance to see the light of day. Oops, there is another view - you can never say whether it is day or night in the story as it exchanges with each other. <br /> <br /> I'll give it to you, some of the early malt shop Skerms looked like they could go on air like Coke ads. Think about it now, it was probably the most beautiful and best performance of the picture; Coca Cola must have paid for them. If they saw the finished movie, they could be better served to prevent it from being released.
