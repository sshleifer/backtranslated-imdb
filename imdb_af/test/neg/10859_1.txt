I would not recommend it at all. It was like being stuck in the middle row of a theater so I couldn't leave and watched some porn movies (except they didn't shake their clothes - it was the body language and definitely the language). I must say I was ashamed. Filming was a very low budget, no good dialogue. Bah. Actors stopped except The two best characters shot dead (?) And they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It shot dead from Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys driving the dessert on their choppers. You know what I mean. blah blah blah. Filming was granular and only very low in quality. There was no one in the theater that looked like this movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.
