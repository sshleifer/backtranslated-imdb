National Lampoon's Dorm Daze is easily the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen the movie Kazaam. Anyone who thinks this movie is good in any way, shape or form has no idea what a good movie is and should never watch a movie again, because they are indeed stupid. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to name everything wrong with this movie. First, the plot is everywhere and can't follow all the various "misunderstandings" very well. The acting is terrible to say the least, and the whole thing is made poor. Anyone who worked on this movie should never be in another movie again! <br /> <br /> It is too difficult to summarize this movie in just a paragraph or two, because it is so bad, but for anyone out there please read it, DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE! If you want a good movie, watch anything else on television. Even the United States has better movies than this. <br /> <br /> _vriend.
