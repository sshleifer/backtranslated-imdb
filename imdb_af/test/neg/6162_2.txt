They say David Duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie. It sounds about right. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it's like saying Saddam Hussein wasn't as bad as Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Tom Warshaw lives in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. He thought to be French this time. He revealed to his wife that he was actually American. For some reason it comes as a devastating revelation, despite the fact that she has always commented on her husband's American accent. Also, their son - remember, he was born in France and never knew his father was American - speaking perfect American English without a hint of French accent. It's just one of several great plot holes in this movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is a glimpse of Tommy's youth in New York City during the 1970s, as he explained to his wife why he had been hiding in France. His best friend as a boy was Pappas, a delayed adult who was terribly played by Robin Williams. I suppose Duchovny thinks that "delayed" is someone who's just stupid, because Pappas sometimes just comes a little slow, while he comes to Robin Williams the other time. Yes, Williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick, though he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow. <br /> <br /> Tommy's mother, played by Duchovny's wife, Tea Leoni, is a disfigured pumpkin nurse. about the recent death of her husband. Leoni does a good job, but she mostly smokes and screams at Tommy for things that don't look too important. The writing didn't give her much to work with. Tommy is also a friend of a woman (whom he calls "Lady") who is in prison and gives him advice through her jail sentence (this house of detention is briefly called House of D, thus the title). Tommy has no barriers to shouting his personal problems aloud on a city road, so these prisoners can give him advice, and he does so many times without care. <br /> <br /> I don't want you with the full movie summary, but plot holes are abundant in this movie that is trying too much to touch, but comes off as, well, bad. Actually bad. Actually really bad. Near the end of this train wreck, the screenplay becomes killer and maize and ends with a smiling whipped end. <br /> <br /> Critics have torn apart "House of D" and case law. I can't believe some people actually like this movie. It's a painful movie to go through and I felt bad - not emotion, but how terrible it was.
