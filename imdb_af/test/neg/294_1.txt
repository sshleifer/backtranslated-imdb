I'm not going to call the plot - it's strictly a B-movie on its way to darkness. The shock to me, however, is to see what has become of some of the actors in this film. Erika Eleniak, never something you want to call a thespian anyway, seems to be in Anna Nicole Smith (in her Big Age). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost scrubbed a tear. He was always a favorite of mine because of his martial arts skills, as seen in the Blood Sports series (also B-movies, but if you use martial arts, it is equally viewable). Here he is a shell of his former confident, he is older, but does the mercenary and doesn't even seem interested. I don't get it. Don't invest these people? William Forsythe is another "heavy" I have always liked, but his last several roles are what you would call "submit it". I'm not even going to mr. Reynolds does not mention - his gig here is a throw away, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usual a creepy, evil, pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can dash milk - the best kind! It's a movie you're watching for laughter. There is nothing else.
