The fact that this turbulent series can provoke dozens of comments (far fewer hundreds of votes) speaks volumes about the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization. <br /> <br /> Read Proust, you moron! ! Or at least Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes anthologies. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris. Wrap your brain to the fact that to judge or write this series you had to spend minutes. More hours ... Look at this poor kiss that catches the boards and tracks with less emotional impact than the bile that uses the right time on your local service. <br /> <br /> PLEASE DON'T SHOW THIS! SAVE YOUR FEW REMAINING BRAIN SEL!
