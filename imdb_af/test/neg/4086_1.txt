The only redeeming feature of this movie is Steve Carell. Like John Wayne, I never saw Steve Carell as an actor, but it doesn't matter. He always plays perfect one role. <br /> <br /> As Marty Feldman once said, comedy must have internal consistency. You can put 4 men on the stage in rubbish drinks, and that's good, but if you bring a fifth man on the stage that isn't in a rubbish bin, then explain to the audience why he's not in a garbage bin is not. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Evan accept his role as a messenger of God? Why, if he accepts it, is he so embarrassed with it? Why is no one more impressed with the way animals surround Evan (they are perhaps explained by circuses by thoughtless doubters as 'trained animals'). There is a terrible flood at the end, and most everyone sees us hopping on the ark and being saved, but surely thousands of people would be killed by the flood; there is no emotional atmosphere after the disaster. Instead, most congresses finally came to light and the once-off imperishable congressman would prosecute for "benefit". <br /> <br /> I have to admit: I also kept the fish in the aquarium which is the presence of Evan.
