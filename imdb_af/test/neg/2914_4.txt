I don't want to add much to Bowlofsoul23's bulls-eye comment here. But as the first Brazilian (born, educated and living in Rio de Janeiro, in an environment, just a few kilometers from the Vavário Geral's favela, depicted in the film) to comment on US-funded "Favela Rising "here on IMDb, I get mixed feelings: on the one hand, it is good that the brutal situation of Brazilian favelas gets more attention from filmmakers and the media, both from Brazil and overseas, as local governments have long surrendered. On the other hand, it's incredibly frustrating that Favela Rising is such a missed opportunity for the enlightened non-Brazilian audiences on the issue, because first time directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who are from the US and understandable, neophytes on the matter) change the biography of AfroReggae group leader Anderson Sa in a glamorous canonization in these superficial, one-sided, under-researched and deceptive documentaries. Good intentions, hidden results. "Favela Rising" looks like a TV ad, is level as an excellent television interview, and biased as a promotional video. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" feels awkwardly fake for a Brazilian viewer, and not just because of its hype visual treatment of a dark reality, and its misplaced feel-good happy ending. "City of God" is a clear reference here, with COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen having no other reason than "hype". "Favela Rising" is allegedly a documentary about the AfroReggae group and its leader Anderson Sa, but beware: when you see the screens in favelas shot in the beautiful Rio Shore line, you can also be warned that Vigário Geral of AfroReggae and Anderson is located in an area of ​​Rio far away from any beach. Strict choice of place, at least. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" is probably confusing to non-Brazilians, who will not know much of the interrogators (and the movie won't tell them) and will have to wait for the closing points to come out. find that many of the songs on the soundtrack are NOT through the AfroReggae band (although you will become suspicious when you hear Pink Martini from all people!). They will also not know that the important issues are simply not left: why does the film push the idea that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not recognize the many partners that provide it with substantial financial and logistical support, such as Rio's City Council, private Brazilian corporations, multinational survey companies and international NGOs, without which AfroReggae may not even exist? Why don't you make it clear that Vigário Geral is still plagued by violent drug wars and that his residents are still living in constant fear of men and police attacks? Why not clearly state that many of the archival material clips that show police violence and corruption did not occur in Vigário Geral? HOW and why did Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? WHY on the freaking earth wasn't he an interview at the end of the film again? <br /> <br /> As far as Anderson is concerned, the movie leaves very few points for the viewer: what is the story about Anderson who is "two" mothers? Is the baby he holds in his arms, his son? Why is he inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a Candombé woman appear on the beach when the films call Anderson's "miraculous" recovery of the accident? Is he a Candomblé follower? Why not let him contradict a drug-fighting group and at the same time praise Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a pride-building movement for black people of favelas, why are the AfroReggae girls restricted to outrageous routines? No, you won't get answers to these questions either. <br /> <br /> Instead, the filmmakers are interested in Anderson's to make a compound mix of pop star, Malcolm X, Gandhi and Christ. that last image of the image of Christ the Savior above Corcovado Hill, immediately after Anderson walked "miraculously" after his operation. And this is the WORST thing the filmmakers can do to Anderson and his cause: turn him into a special CHOSEN one (by the time they scarred his operation, you're ready to believe it's a point of God) . <br /> <br /> What is remarkable about Anderson - who is the most common man you can ever meet - is that he helped change his environment, NOT by being "special", but by the copying and customizing winning projects (such as the Olodum movement in Bahia) to its own community, with strong support from friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, businessmen and the media. If you're not in Portuguese, you probably won't see that Anderson is not very beautiful or articulate (unlike his sharp witty partner José Junior), as much as he is not very talented as a singer, lyric or musician . Yet his "ordinariness" may have become the movie's true "inspirational" core: to show that ANY with idealism, perseverance and steady support can indeed make a meaningful contribution to his or her community, does not have to conceive Jesus. . For what is really important is the movement - AfroReggae - not the old one, see? Didn't we have enough of personality cult? <br /> <br /> At the end of "Favela Rising" you probably won't know much more about Rio's favelas than you did when you arrived. You just have seen some of them look.
