I also chose this movie. This movie has been in my "must see" list for a while because people have talked about being "disturbing" and also the VHS box contains many quotes from people who say "amazing" that is, or how "so close. if you can come to Texas' chain murder "and such lines. But sorry people, I was very disappointed. The idea is interesting, but the writing is so underdeveloped that every character becomes a wrong creation of evolution and people do indeed the stupid movies in the film. <br /> <br /> This, in turn, removes any credibility the plot may have otherwise. I couldn't believe how unnecessarily some were "where is he, let's find him" rows. A few greedy moments to please the gore fan, but they are so few that we don't come by them by the time. If Luther is a geek, the filmmakers really need to be on the food chain.
