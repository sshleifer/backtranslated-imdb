Empty shortening of John Irving's novel bravely strives for courage, but eventually becomes absurd. It is a peculiar, gay and bittersweet sketch region that tries to explain a man's growth from birth to maturity and how he deals with the feelings of lust and fanaticism surrounding him. Garp was born for a formidable, unmarried, mother Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close. (The different stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actors before Robin Williams takes over as Garp reaches maturity.) The story follows him through a boy's prep school, where Jenny is the school nurse, through his high school. -passion wrestling, writing and sex-to-marriage with his high school sweetheart, children, marital problems and a writing career. Jenny has meanwhile become a well-known feminist, who has an unorthodox cause. The plot contains an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and foreign adventures. Williams gives a cherub performance. This writing was not suitable for his wildness and anarchy and so his talent was lost. He is like an injured bird out of control. John Lithgow's role as a transsexual father, who gives wisdom, doesn't make sense either. This film attracted considerable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry into movies. Williams recently cast out his Mork and Mindy campaigns and focused more on insurgency and movies. Audiences were confused by this film, especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.
