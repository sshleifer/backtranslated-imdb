This movie is a pity, especially as Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur but professional director. But this movie fails to deliver everything you can expect. <br /> <br /> First of all - I'm Polish, so I can tell all the background story because I read books. But how can you say there is even a war of this movie - a lot of people go back and forth, some soldiers are screaming ... This is really World War II or soldiers are on holidays? <br /> <br /> Acting and Dialogues - poor, miserably poor. A. ijmijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A.Chyra fit into their roles, the rest of (Polish) cast is out of place (especially M.Ostaszewska, one of the leading characters, what a unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogue players are not spoken, they are just there, actors have trouble doing and this is no surprise considering what strange things they had to say. <br /> <br /> And this leads us to the most disappointing issue - you can't feel it. Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, there is no feeling. There are many original images from World War II and guess what the material is much more powerful, dramatic than A.Wajda did. <br /> <br /> I can only see one positive - despite historical errors (such as acronym ZSRR, it was made for propaganda purposes after 1945, to use the Polish, that ZSRS was gone, and now was there ZSRR, but in 1940 there was no ZSRR!). Fortunately, it has undoubtedly been shown that killing in Katyn was done by Soviets (yes, this is a fact, not a controversial gossip). Large, two hours for 5-10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway - wasted time and potential. It is a tragedy of epic relations, which will barely fight in 1939, without declaring war on the Soviet Union by Polish authorities (not shown here), imprisonment of soldiers shortly thereafter, in the shameful circumstances , hope and fear that will come next (barely shown), and then ... extinction. Hand in hand with Germans - Soviets were wiped out of Polish nation, aimed at people who were the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately, they succeed, and the results are still visible for this day.
