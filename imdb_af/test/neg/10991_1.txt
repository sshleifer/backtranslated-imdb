As the other comments say, it may be a surprise to those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But if you've seen Delicatessen, there's nothing new in this movie. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this movie is just too late to be of any interest. I don't think it's a worse movie than Delicatessen, but it's a drill to see it now, as it's likely to look at Delicatessen again. There is really no point in the film, nothing that really matters or stays with you. There may be a distant match with Kusturica's films, but he is really in another league, so you should rather watch his movies than waste your time on Tuvalu.
