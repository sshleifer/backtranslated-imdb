It was so bad I couldn't even check it out. So I will have a few sentences about what I have seen and it will be up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Captain Kirk, with toupee and tubby gut, is the mountain climb of Yosemete's El Capitan. Spock meets him halfway on a swinging skateboard-like hovercraft. Kirk choice. Spock flies off, takes him thumb before Kirk hits the ground for the first time. <br /> <br /> Later that night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy eat beans around a campfire. Spock likes the beans. Then, Kirk and McCoy sing "Row Row Row Your Boat" and want Spock to participate in the three-way harmony. Spock doesn't want to sing. And later that evening he didn't agree. "But life is not just a dream, Captain." Should I continue? <br /> <br /> Good ... An apostate Vulcan, who spotted Spock's half-brother, is leading a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the enterprise land on the planet, and Uhura, who fifty-five and weighs two hundred scarce pounds, attracts the natives with her bare legs. But they can't deceive the brother, who claims he can find God. <br /> <br /> He kidnapped the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a great bearded phenomenon, claiming to be God, haunts Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Spock's brother, realize it's not God - but is really a form of himself - or something - joins the shine to destroy it and ... sparks fly. <br /> <br /> Then, after things are too complicated to explain what Klingons looks like Lorenzo Lamas, ... <br /> <br /> The Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite (Did I mention, Kirk wears a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt?). With Spock playing a kind of funky Vulcan guitar, they sing "Ride Drive Your Boat", this time all three harmonization is the credit roller.
