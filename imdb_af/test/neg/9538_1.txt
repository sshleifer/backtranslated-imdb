OK - says a college in southern California has a class that makes class. And a few dudes were just enrolled for movie girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk / stoned / or just plain stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned it on for their degree. And failed. <br /> <br /> This is my only explanation for this, this thing. Good God, they left the date and time counter during some of them. The picture starts in the new scene before the sound, and forgets about a plot. Well, there was one and they had to tell it all as soon as the 3-hour introductory series was finished. But I'm glad they did, because I never got to see it. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this.
