Although it is true that the film is a bit interesting, the performance is much to be desired. Much like Blood Orgy of the Leather Girls, I spit on your grave and were born in the Flames. I don't think it's porn, but porn is in the eye of the winner: if it acts as a porn for someone, who should I say is wrong? I was rather surprised at the statement in Winkimation's judicious review ("So Shame") that once our husbands faces one day when they come. "A few years ago I did occasional voluntary reviews for an adult and I remember many men's faces having seen when they came. I think it's probably more common when the movie appears on the few male porn stars (and especially if the man is the director). Although I cannot surprisingly refer to any specific titles, I know there are a few cases in Ron Jeremy's work. I also don't know that I agree that a man necessarily shows vulnerability in his face when he comes.
