I must admit I was disappointed after I saw this movie. I expected so much more from the trailers. The movie was absolutely horrible. It didn't have a real story line and the acting wasn't exactly the best. Don't waste your time. The movie is not what the trailers lead you to think it is. I have to say that I usually do not write about movies on IMDb (this is my first one), but this movie was such a disappointment that I registered just to let people know that they didn't waste their time or money. The story line is that of a hoist that is going to happen and it looks like it's possible to be good, but the things that happen in the movie are a bit far-fetched to be credible. See another movie, maybe the inside?
