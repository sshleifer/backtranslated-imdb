Spoiler with plot explanation: A poor family is thrown in the middle of the war between the evil man (who comes out of nowhere and asked no questions ...) who went wacko and Casper tried the friendly ghost to kill his death. avenge. With every frame, the movie becomes more and more predictable, a great disappointment. The downside of the seams is completely silly, it has nothing to do with the movie itself, I think someone runs out of ideas or just comes to the point that the movie is like this or others, so it can only be a stupid end have. Save time, resources and money. Actress play is very poor. If you think of the dialogue, you can find out that family conflict is constantly being applied through poor communication between characters. Some scenes happen to be. In summary: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. Save time and money.
