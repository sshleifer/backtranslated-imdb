To actually possess to make such a horrible movie! Actually, I'm more embarrassed that I'm sitting through the whole thing. An old 80-year-old sci-fi movie seems to have been completed with a super-fake "special effect", a spectacular image, and a very cute dialogue. Maybe that's the way they wanted it to look, maybe they think it's cool to do movies in the 80's, as it will come back in style. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think the promised eye candy will save the movie, you're in a disappointment - so-called "babes" are manic and straight ugly. They can't act at all, I don't understand why they can't get chicks if they want babies! But I think if you make a movie, it's stupid, you don't get very good choices, hot chicks don't just like this kind of nasty shit!
