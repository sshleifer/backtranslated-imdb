I work at a video store so I can see this one for free - thank you, if I paid it, my review would be less forgiving. <br /> <br /> Well, the main idea of ​​the movie (geeky girl takes vengeance) is not so original, there are a few parallels with "carrie" (an average joke on a loser, except for a beautiful girl who is really sorry for her, tamaras and carries bad family background). I still think it's a fun idea for a trashy teen horror movie. Unfortunately, they didn't use much of the potential here, and rather emphasized all the wrong things. <br /> <br /> That worked: I liked the actress who played tamara. she looked nice (and when she was hot) and her cats were nice ("Sean can't come to the phone. He is f ** king patrick!"). <br /> <br /> What didn't work: The whole Wicca thing was stupid. I usually prefer rational statements (she could have plundered the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge). there were many logical sizes and the gore really looks bad (when the boy cuts his ear and his tongue - please !!!) <br /> <br /> The whole idea wasn't bound to Oscar buzz, but I just think they messed up the comic and the exciting potential they had. it was bearable but far from good!
