I was actually looking forward to this movie. The ads made it look really cool and action packed. And I heard that Claire Daines's character for assault was arrested, so I thought she might kick many ass and it would be cool. BUT NOWOOOOO !!. They were almost no action and the character was all so bland. The only saving grace was Omar Epps and even he didn't help this movie much.
