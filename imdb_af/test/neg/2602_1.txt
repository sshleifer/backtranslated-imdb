You know what? Family Guy started out as something fresh, funny and more original. Use the random humor to be funny. I actually thought it was the best animated sitcom next to The Simpsons. Watching the new episodes broadcast over the past few weeks; I grew up with the show too much at random humor to be funny. South Park died right over FG when they educated the Manatees and the idea balls. <br /> <br /> And look at the show itself, I don't understand why my parents like it so much; there is nothing good about it. The "intellectual" humor is funny and would have been better if the show was not at random.
