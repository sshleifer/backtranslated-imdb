I'm sorry, but for a movie that is such a semi-classic and a scary movie, but I think seriously, if the director is unintentionally laughing at me, it's not a good thing. The characters in this movie were just as top and incredible. I couldn't just laugh at Issac's voice, it was just like a high-brand new girl's British voice. Not to mention Malicai's dramatic dramatic sting. <br /> <br /> Children of the moon go over a town where all the children killed the adults and worship a God that commands them 20+ people. When a couple has a bad car accident, they come to town for help, but of course they get trapped in the child's fall and are sacrificed! But Malicai has other intentions when he is ill to follow Issac's orders. <br /> <br /> Children of the Korn could have been good, but played a bad role over the top movie you could easily make. As much as I like Stephen King, I'm sure it's not what he meant and it was a nice story, or at least the actors destroyed it. As I said, look for a good laugh, but I warn you, it's pretty pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3/10
