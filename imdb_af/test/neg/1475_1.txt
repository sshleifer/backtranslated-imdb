It was a horrible, boring movie, even for a documentary. Sometimes it provided insight into life and also had humorous moments, but overall it wasn't worth seeing. Every time I started to feel sympathetic to Mark and started hoping he would be successful, I would be disappointed by his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse.
