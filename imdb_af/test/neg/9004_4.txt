I had a little hope for this hour-long film made up of footage from old poverty rifles. Certainly it had the potential to look more than a home video mass marketed to the world. Unfortunately, this movie is rather like a home movie, but thrown in stock. <br /> <br /> The plot is about the planned reading of a will on a liner at midnight somewhere in the tropics. The ship is sinking and well ... it's the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie promises to release Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney and others from old movies to communicate with new material. We get it right, but most of the time we get many new videos made to look like black and white film, in which new actors survive. Old footage is mostly between tracks to set the scene, but very few of the old and new ones actually match, so it's obviously just an aptitude. It's not very convincing and is very disappointing because someone like me was looking for a better constructed movie. <br /> <br /> If you know and love the old poverty driving movies, it might be worth it. reading. I will warn against purchasing this, but it can be about five dollars, the price of a rental), so the choice is yours (Although you can get away with not paying, do it). <br /> <br /> disappointing.
