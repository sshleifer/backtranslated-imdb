The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly have to pay for this crap. Yes, the American rip-off has been shown in Australia for about two episodes, but has not been rated; probably by curious viewers who wonder how bad it would be. Answer: LOCAL, a total waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and they do not easily grasp the nuances of Australian writing. Good luck to them because they are doomed to dip with this turkey. My advice to US viewers is NOT. <br /> <br /> Americans should be best advised to find DVDs from the ORIGINAL VERSION on eBay, but be aware that some DVDs are in a different "zone format" for the issued in the US. Otherwise some DVD players will use both / all zone slides.
