If I were British, I would be embarrassed by this portrayal of incompetence. A Special Branch Protection Agent unable to defend herself from a sick, unarmed and untrained attacker? The Household Office sends a single "Science Advisor" to investigate a possible Level Four biohazard, and that the "Advisor" doesn't have the sense to wear even a mask and gloves? Totally unprotected London police officers work side by side with technicians in full biohazard suits? The "Advisor" and his bodyguard have been experimenting with a sociopathic doctor on people without experimentation? Puh-leeze! One wonders if the producers could not afford to hire any technical advisers, or if they decided for a desperate reason to put the principals as hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who has no background in any medicine or law enforcement, rolls her eyes into disbelief. After the first episode, I was discouraged; Now I saw two episodes, I give up.
