I watched this movie last night. I had high expectations, but was definitely disappointed. Within 5 minutes of the opening, Williams is already fighting for his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So there is all that aspect of the movie. The first half hour is hilarious. Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst. It becomes less of a comedy, and more of a thriller / drama / love story ... which is useless. The movie does not go anywhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes. There and there are laughter, but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and just the beginning. At one point, the greatest courage I heard in the audience was when a person in the crowd shouted 'boooo' during a very confusing emotional scene. Williams gives a good performance, similar to his comic style. Walken also has a strong supporting role, just as he can. I think the one character underestimated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and politics, it's funny to see that he puts it down for a PG-13 rating. Overall, I won't pay to see the movie. After seeing it for free, I was disappointed. The first half hour is solid, and it's all downhill from there. Not really in a category, the film halfway realizes that it should be nothing more than a one-hour comedy central. 4.5 / 10
