Come on? FANTASTIC DRAMA ON SCREEN? Are you joking people? I won't be terribly Molly Gross playing even in school play! Where did these people learn to act? Do some papers borrow from their neighbors actor? Terrible plot, terribly observing. Hey ... why are you taking us for an imbecile? What more can I say. I understand it's a TV production and the play isn't supposed to be one of Citizen Kane. Yet, they must try harder to earn their money. And apart from what can be said in 10 LINE for a simple movie like this? You want article in the morning script? To say what? Worse movie in the decade? OK, you want it - you got it!
