I just finished watching one episode (S1- # 5 a boy in a forest), so maybe my review isn't very fair. <br /> <br /> But based on that episode it's a very poor version of CSI, the acting is crazy. The main character, Dr, regardless of her name, is so fake, it actually hurts. I won't throw her to make a dog food supplement! <br /> <br /> The other hurting thing is David Boreanaz of the "Angel" fame, a good actor, doing a good job, but wasted coz of that woman's idiotic acting. <br /> <br /> Supporting role play is OK, but everything is ruined by this dumb scene of Emily Deschanel. Very disappointing version of CSI, very sorry to see It appears on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved. <br /> <br /> The woman is really sh # t, at least in that episode. But at this glance, I won't even invest to watch it, even if it's shown on a lift screen.
