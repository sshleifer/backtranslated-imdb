I never saw a movie so terribly that I was sick. It was a BIG waste of time to watch this crappy movie. There are many things I hate about this movie: The songs are so terrible (a little catchy), I hit my head against the wall (especially the song: "Grandpa will send out the pants from santa" 10 times * shrugs *, the character design, and the evil, greedy, and Bitchy cousin Mel. <br /> <br /> I can't stand her for one second, she must be one of the most beautiful person I've ever seen. Although I am similar to her southern voice. <br /> <br /> The only blink is that Austin Bucks is played by the person who is the voice of Liquid Snake by Metal Gear Solid. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend watching people for the holiday because it was a great shame for x-mas.
