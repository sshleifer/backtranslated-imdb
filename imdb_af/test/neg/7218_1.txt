The original Road House was a classic cheese 80 movie, which, although not dignified or performed in close proximity to the award, was a very pleasant and popular film, mainly due to the presence of star Patrick Swayze and the major supporting role . with some excellent battle scenes and eye candy. <br /> <br /> 16 years later, and MGM / Sony is trying to re-create the magic, which has left us all and cited one of the three rules. a movie quoting all the original one's best linen and quoting the three lines. <br /> <br /> It was an amateur movie, it would be seen as a loving tribute to one of Swayze's most popular movies. As a professionally crafted film, it falls flat on the face into the DVD Bargin Bin. With its continuous reuse of lines and plot from the original movie, it becomes more of an annoying sign of lack of originality, rather than a cool reference to the original. br /> It said, with new lines like "I'm going to kill you, just like I killed your dad". No wonder the scriptwriters decided to reload much of the original script. <br /> <br /> I knew it would never be anything special, a straightforward DVD sequel, but at least I was hoping there might be some new ideas and new stuff to go to Living the Road House name, but what you get is simply a 2006 remake of the same movie, with some drugs added. <br /> <br /> If I was the director, I would have removed all the references to the first movie so as not to decorate the original and that is characters. As it is, we have Patrick Swayze's character, now supposed to be dead (shot dead by Jake Busey) and his brother and son, now the main characters, who strangely have completely different surnames. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was that Dalton's 'son' ran the same car that his dad did, a really cool tribute, although later destroyed by reaching the car's end, exactly the same way as his predecessor did. This is a good example of how this movie goes too far in the succession and ideas of the '89 movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, who can forget the legendary moment where Wild Bill promises to kill Shane? Just as I murder your dad "and then continue to try to send him completely different. Wonderful writing there. I see Schaech listed as co-authors. Hold on to acting, or preferably nothing. <br /> <br / > Overall, however, it is an OK movie if there is nothing else to look at and you want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half or if you have it The first Road House has seen, but hardcore fans from Swayze Its classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of insulting themselves on how much of a rip of this movie is of the first. will not see! "Stay at the original Roadhouse and relive the good old Swayze days!
