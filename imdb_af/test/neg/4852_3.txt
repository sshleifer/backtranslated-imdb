I was waiting to wait for this movie to improve, but it is the worst kind of escapist movie: a spinning sugar bowl weighing under the weight of its own insignificant self-interest. The pass stumbles like a legion stranded in the Sahara. The absence of good dialogue leaves the handsome stars with little to do, other than to look good in white linen. Ironmen still play a valid charmer who had a touch of the sun. Cheese is a pleasant singer, but not much of an actress. Fortunately, the writing doesn't call her often to think of the jazz club microphone. All the enjably relaxed, beautiful, unnecessary characters take turns mastering the landscape with an air of tired sophistication. The whole exercise is like an unlimited Ralph Lauren ad. <br /> <br /> If you're past forty and believe Francophilia is the key to sophistication, you might miss this piece of carduette cardboard. Well, if you like this movie, you probably feel smart for the appreciation of Godard's leaning Ã‰loge de l'amour, and you can even sit by Le Divorce without cringing.
