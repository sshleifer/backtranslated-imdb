Edge of Madness is a story about a woman in the 1800's who is handcuffed by a dirty Scotsman who can't hold his penis in his pants. He just happened to have a younger brother who was raped and killed him, but constantly said it was an accident. It makes his wife crazy, she gets mad and she falls the fall because she loves George too much. <br /> <br /> As I said, this kind of thing has been done before. It is more "artistic" because it is Canadian and it is an indie production done on a low budget with almost famous actors (except that one Lassie child, yes, he is in it). I don't know if it's going to be Oscar, but it was so boring. And it's based on a 40 page short story. Half of that short story is recorded in this movie, and I'm happy. Otherwise I would die. Unfortunately, I had to look at it in my Media Fundamentals class, and I had a command to do so. Read the short story and compare and contrast the movie to the story. BORING. <br /> <br /> It is harder to answer movie questions when you don't like the movie. Oh, I hope this is the last kind of assignment my class and I get. For what it's worth, Annie Herron was quite hot, she had a nice, soft ass and I liked the naked parts of her in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for boring, Oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality .. plus nudity.
