This movie is sad. According to my co-IMDb users, (* SPOILER *) uses RAPTOR inventory from the Carnotaur movies. Well, since I didn't see the Carnotaur movies, I can't say. But I notice a bit of bad editing and even worse acting. This movie is a big pile of s ***. It makes absolutely no sense. Here's this thing that calls him a plot: Mad scientist creates raptors again. Raptors kill people. Sheriff investigated. * SPOILER * (although I do not know what I am spoiling). The sheriff gets a bad doctor's plans. Army guys are filed and raptors start killing soldiers. Raptors. Yes, right. I can make a clay figure that really looks like. The FX is the cheapest ever used in a movie. There are many gore. Cheap gore. It doesn't even seem real. I would agree with another person who rated this movie that the only thing this movie is about is the fact that it ends. There is about two seconds of originality in this movie. And it only comes from when the sheriff is talking to a tax agent on the phone about his electric bill or something. This idea was used in about 100,000 other movies with 100,000 different names. Overall, I give RAPTOR 1/5 just because it ended.
