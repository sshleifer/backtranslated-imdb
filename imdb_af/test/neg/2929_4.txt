From Kiarostami, this art house visual and audio exposition is a surprise. For a director known for his stories and sharp observations of people, especially children, ask for this trip to minimalist cinematography for questions: Why did he do that? Was it to keep him busy on a beach holiday? <br /> <br /> "Five, 5 Long Takes" consist of, you guess, take five. They are (the title names are my own and the times approach): <br /> <br /> "Driftwood and waves". The camera is almost still standing on a small piece of driftwood, as it moves through small waves splashing on a beach. Ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "Look people on the promenade". The camera stands still and looks at the ocean horizon and a promenade. People walk over the camera frame, their faces too far and fuzzy to make them interesting. Eleven minutes. <br /> <br /> "Six dogs on the waterfront". The camera stands still and looks at the ocean horizon with a sandy beach nearby. Far away at the water's edge, six dogs don't do much, just relax. Sixteen minutes. <br /> <br /> "Ducks in line, lots of ducks". The camera stands still and looks at the ocean horizon near the waterfront. Dozens and dozen ducks flow in a single file from left to right. I assume Kiarostami has released them gradually. The last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a lot of ducks roll from right to left. I assume that Kiarostami collects the ducklings and is released at the same time. This is not the first time he has dealt with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes. <br /> <br /> "Frog symphony, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night". The camera is at night over a dam. It is pitch black, except that the reflection of the moon appears on the wavy water. It is a stormy night and cloud race to cover the moon. The screen turns dark. What remains for us is the cacophony of frogs, crying dogs and finally morning roosters. Touch me on the head when done at once. I saw this segment as a good composition compiled in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty-seven minutes! <br /> <br /> Except for the slightly amusing ducks, this exercise in minimalism has left me cold. A non-essential movie for Kiarostami fans. <br /> <br /> I thought I'd be Five, but four would earn it. <br /> <br /> The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.
