An American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes an artist and discovers himself and returns to the States so that he can fix things with his former friends. <br /> <br /> I have to think that the people who are this movie are all the X-Files fans, though there are no strangers or serial killers. Don't be deceived, this movie blows pieces. <br /> <br /> The story is incoherent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. When you get an explanation, it doesn't fit the story that went before. What that means is wearing you. For all the acting talent in the film, it's just not interesting. I spent the whole movie when wondering addict Duchovny was going to hit someone. Maybe he did it behind the scenes; they had to have filmed it. <br /> <br /> Overcoming is a story of a self-obsessed artist who is worried about minor incidents in his life and wants to make it right in some way - though it doesn't seem to be wrong to start with. There are no particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite mentioning a great secret in the first few minutes. It's just a guy who thinks his life is as interesting to you as that. It's not. <br /> <br /> I saw in the trivia that Duchovny claims to have written the script in a week, it is completely credible. The guy can act, there is no doubt, but writing and directing is of course beyond his talents. <br /> <br /> Why Hollywood likes to keep these self-analysis stories in the green is beyond me. I discover myself in the shower every morning, but I don't bother to make a movie about it. My will probably be better than this one; at least there will be some nudity.
