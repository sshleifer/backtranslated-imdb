There comes a time in every big name actor's career when they get messy and accept projects that have not touched a 1000 foot pole in their golden days. Remember "Taxi Driver"? It was a fine movie. I can hardly believe that the De Niro of "Showtime" is the same actor. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch "Time Chasers" rather than see this movie again. If someone offers to take you to see 'Showtime' or for your free pass, or whatever, run as fast and far as you can.
