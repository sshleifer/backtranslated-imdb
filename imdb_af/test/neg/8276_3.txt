The title for this review on how I feel about this movie. I can't imagine which audience would be for this thing, if not for the hard-fucking fan of the 1980s treasure movies that simply have to see everything - from that era. Otherwise, don't waste your time on this. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to most movies of its kind: something terribly happening to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage. There you did it. The truth is, none of these 80's slides was known for their originality, so I can't see the point just grinding on this movie. <br /> <br /> But where the movie fails, its tension and murder sequence. I saw some terrifying thrash movies from the 1980s that had much lower budgets than that. This one just fails to create any real tension. The director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi-professional legal directors get here and there, but they mean nothing if you're not scared. The gore is also fairly soft, so anyone who looks at these things for the purpose of seeing some cool 1980's makeup effects will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie can make you dizzy. Honestly, the key ingredient for almost any scraper is the tough pacing - you need to keep things fast and keep the pieces of the murder at regular intervals, because let's see, we don't look at these things for the big one. characterization and star plots. But the pacing, whether due to the writing or the editor, is all down. The murders are spaced at strange intervals, leaving us with a few winding screens (undoubtedly meant to build a character) that only serves to tolerate you and make you pray for the next kill (which, as I said , usually it is not done so well.) <br /> <br /> As far as the killer is concerned, don't expect anything from the original or even distant terror. He (or she?) Wears a jogging suit, a screen mask, and she (or her?) Primary weapon is a sword. I bet the author just surprised him about the idea that he had sustained an original, "cool" murder weapon, but the idea just came out impractical and stupid. There was also not much emphasis on the "whodunnit" nature of the film, as if they also did not forget or thought to place any red herring in the mix. <br /> <br /> I feel that the people behind this are trying to make something decent and respectful, and sometimes it shows that their intentions are probably a little more sincere about making a quality movie , unlike many other knockoff slashers of the era. But unfortunately, the effort usually fails. However, there is a bit of good acting (at least for this type of movie). There is an attempt to characterize, but nothing matters at all. It's a waste. Here's everything you need to do, to chase the plot and make the murder sequence feel like they can't be quick enough. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you're really slashers in these old 80s, anyway, check it out, just to say you've seen it. There is a complete in all of us. But don't expect to be blown away. or anything. What we have here is a very nice entertaining movie that doesn't make a real impression.
