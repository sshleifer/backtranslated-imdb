Missed it at the theater, but was always slightly forced. I found it in the bin at my local video store for a bad two bucks! Will I give it to anyone who wants it? Probably! No purposeful plot, one-dimensional characters, plastic world has ripped off much better movies, no decent dialogue to speak of. You know those empty feelings when you come down from ecstasy? It's the feeling here. Unfortunately, the Australia I know is heading in this direction, less the melodrama and simple answers. Interesting just to see the older Aussie actors (who had to work back in their day), against the latest Aussie actors (who should look good). Like a frightening narrative introduction to a film that never really started. Poor Kylie, also started her career as an actress ...
