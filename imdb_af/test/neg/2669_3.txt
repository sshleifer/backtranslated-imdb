Normally I will not bother to comment on a horror movie sequel, as it is usually accepted that they are BAD, and if you see them with a healthy disrespect, they can be very fun and fun to tease / laugh . However, this chapter of the ongoing Halloween saga has come close to smashing everything that has happened to the original. In the very first film dr. Loomis said I could add a lot that Michael Myers was angry and trying to explain why I could do it. According to me, he was much rarer when he was just a hungry freak. The whole goth / cult thing was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the Halloween equation. The result was a boring, predictable movie that was not scary and not bad enough to be funny.
