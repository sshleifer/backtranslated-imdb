Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero in the 1850s Russia. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, with June Foray using the voices. Unfortunately, who was ever supposed to synchronize the voices to the lips, was blind because the words never fit the lip flaps. Anyone who says Japanese movies are bad has never seen this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie's plot is immediately forgotten and therefore I forgot about the time it took the movie to finish and sit and write it down. Perhaps it's more to do with the fact that the film is one of many Reeves made in the hope of moving away from action to more plot-driven movies. It might have been a good thing for Reeves, but it is fatal to the audience who is having no-frills festivals like this, where his entire court is intrigued. In the defense of Reeves was a good actor, he just had no luck picking movies that were good. They all looked well, but many of them did not let those who had them in a coma for the movie's running time. <br /> <br /> This movie will give you a coma. Just watch it if you need sleep and all the other soft stuffs have failed.
