You should see this movie, it's a big footnote in the history of the movie. When this film was made, the American film industry reached the bottom of suction. See this movie, laugh and feel sorry for yourself to waste the last 2 hours of your life. This is the worst I have seen and even worse directed. The villains laugh at being taken out of a clown circus and if the guys who want to do a scary movie on superhero movies, they just have to take the script from this movie and a remake, Black Scorpion III, The Threat of really bad movies that somehow attract the manufacturing companies into a successor suicide.
