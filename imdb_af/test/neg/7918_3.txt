If you just watched all the dogs in heaven and learn that there is a sequel, don't see it. It's awful. It's absolutely terrible. They rush to develop the characters. Sasha, for example, starts singing about how you can count her out of love. And in the end, it looks more like a dramatic romance movie than a comedy adventure movie. They rub Charlie out of his character and replace him with a gentle, soft but still rebellious version of himself. <br /> <br /> The humor behind Carface's character is simply lost. He is a completely different dog. He no longer has a cool voice, he is not that villain you would like to hate anymore, he is just a wimp that is spoken by nobody but SpongeBob Mermaid Man. Talk about voting factors. <br /> <br /> Charlie has a completely different voice. And while it's not terrible, I don't like it. It is horrible compared to the excellent work Burt Reynolds did for the character in the first film. Dom DeLuise is wonderful as always, like Itchy. This character stays true, so this movie gets a 3/10. Just because Dom DeLuise still radiates Itchy. <br /> <br /> Oh and my last complaint. I know Ann-Marie's movie is done and gone, she now has parents, etc., but did Charlie completely forget her, or what? No mention of ALL of her in the second movie. I mean, even a small mention of Itchy would have been acceptable. (eg, "Charlie, we need to come back. You can't take care of every kid who needs to save.) Or something of the kind. I mean, he died with her, she deserves some mention. /> <br /> Don't look at this if you're looking for a great sequel.
