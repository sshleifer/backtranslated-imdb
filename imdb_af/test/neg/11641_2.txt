Why are there no good reviews? Because this movie is hysterically bad. <br /> <br /> In a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we have Jim Brown as the hero who is sitting with a hysterically incredible racist officer and just as hysterical is the way the Japanese officials brown nose Jim Brown's character . <br /> <br /> It's probably the worst movie any of these actors ever did. Stereotypes are not only abundant, but they dominate this film. The music of the sixties and seventies may be the best of the movie, perhaps because it has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> It is even hard to sit back and enjoy as unthinkable fun. This film is even more racist than the message of racism trying to deliver it. And believe me, I was alive in the seventies, and we thought it was so silly so stupid. It was never popular.
