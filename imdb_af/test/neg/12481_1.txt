This last day Fulci Schlocker is a totally unpleasant surprise that deals with an incurable player (Brett Halsey) who decides Bluebeard's style to pay his ever-increasing debt by deceiving some of the ugliest bitches you will ever see and what not rich widows! The Fulci pen script also aims to record some black comic elements - which only lead to an indecent business that includes a body that won't stay, an opera singer who doesn't stop singing. doppelganger theme straight from the student of Prague - although the two personas in this case communicate via pre-registered radio messages !! In the end, I cannot say that I am surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of Mario Bava's HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON (1970) which looks in various ways and just enough to just the disgusting gory (but non-convincing effects of rejected limbs and cleft or melting faces with which Fulci was completely associated at the time.
