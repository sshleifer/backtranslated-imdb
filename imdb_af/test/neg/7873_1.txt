One of the worst movies I've ever seen. When I tried to look at it, I had flu and I was pretty open minded for any brainless entertainment. Unfortunately, it was too much. How can so many totally unskilled actors be in one movie? This movie makes pores like European art film. Cast just speak their lines without any emotions; Special thanks to Charlie Snows (Baldwin), who is earlier this year, talking about her divorce, as the rest of us talk about the weather. Just awful (and funny). <br /> <br /> With many spits and friends it can only be as background entertainment and little laugh, just like Ed Wood movies. The plot is a joke and soundtrack straight from a shaky soapy. <br /> <br /> Hopefully no one paid to watch this movie. <br /> <br />
