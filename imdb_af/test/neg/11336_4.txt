This series, made for Televisión Española (TVE), is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, mainly as seen through the eyes of the youngest son. <br /> <br /> Based on a background of historical events, such as the rise of France in May 1968, the dilapidated Franco regime, the war in Vietnam, the rise of imperialism, and others specifically related to Spanish life at that moment, this series can be considered a simple one. compilation of characteristic foibles that make themselves so clear in this kind of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Generally being treated in a lightweight vein, although not lacking in dramatic moments, it seems that the series is aimed at people of about fifty who can inhibit those times, As it should be said, anybody who is younger is choosing to ignore such things or busy doing things. <br /> <br /> The best thing to say about this series is Ana Duato's role as mother of three children: she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well and shows the peculiar Spanish preference, especially noticeable among women, to make her mind and her actions move through the impulse of her heart, without using the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. Imanol Arias offers very little except that he is not his usual stereotype hard policeman as in other television series. Indeed, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything that is not a TV series. Its resources are limited; but his share of the working class housekeeping is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended for other audiences, even Spanish speakers in Latin America: the themes are all parishes related to a specific place in contemporary Spanish history, so that if the viewer does not live here, he will miss most of the references. It is even likely that some situations that cause some Spanish smiles will mean nothing to other viewers.
