Please do not see. I've had a lot of laughter in this movie, but they were all because of unintentional comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. Pacino played Pacino again and worsened most of the time. The screens in this movie look like they are made up of 20 other bad movies by a very poor editor. There is no continuity and I wondered why I didn't leave in 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I suggest I never be a movie led by D.J. Caruso. It was really awful.
