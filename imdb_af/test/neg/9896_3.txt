CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. An American of birth George Greenough photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years. He has been using several rediscovered cameras for several years, which he tied to his back, board or boat. In the mid-70s, he created with Surf May editor and emerging filmmaker David Elfick to create this visually interesting story of this life and photography. The 75 minute CRYSTAL VOYAGER feature is the result. Even in the 70's, audiences were a little surprised at this movie, not surfing movie or surfing movie, because George was swimming on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard. It offsets the boring George's drone (sometimes dry or dripping it was actually funny, like almost burning himself or falling). With a spectacular 'you are there' you can put on a 23-minute wave, all on Pink Floyd music. In 1974, when the Sydney Opera House opened, it was also a theater. Crystal Voyager was discussed as an artistic OZ photo and as a result became a hit: as the 'opera tickets' cost much more than a movie ticket, the audiences flocked to see this movie as an excuse to at the Sydney Opera House '... so the movie has a low budget appeal for locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they saw a show there. It created this myth that the film attracted a large crowd and spread its reputation. As a result, it coincided with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and has a trippy run through the UK and Europe as a dual feature. I ran into a coastal theater in the seventies and the crowd wasn't quite about it. Recently, George has again raised the Lord Of The Flies style with another well-photographed sea adventure, called DOLPHIN GLIDE, which dives viewers and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It's an eccentric 20-minute short with even more eccentric 20-minute George's doing it. In January 2005, everyone met a collective gift from both the media and the crowd. This makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a "you must have been there" years ago. On a special Oz Surf night at an outdoor cinema, 2000 people came up last year ... but then 2000 every night to see something during this summer season of movies ..... so the damn thing is a other box had flown in. office binge. How much it really enjoyed is very open to debate. Once again, they were more than likely simply surprised by this crazy movie with an amazing reputation. However, since 1975 Elfick has starred as a major producer and director of many Australian and international films. Look at NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or ENVIRONMENT or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for a clear and current applause on his achievements. George, however, drifts around and drags away, looking for something else to film, or launching a camera.
