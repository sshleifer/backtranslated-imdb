A clear vanity pushes for Julie in her first movie with Blake. Let's look. Where do we start? She is a traitor during a world war; she redeems it by falling in love; her friends (who are presumably patriots because they are German citizens) are consumable and must die; and his wind like a heroine. OK. The scenes with the drunk pilot and the buffalo who work for the French intelligence cannot even be described, and we will not even call the romantic plays of Rock with a woman. (By the way, when they visit a museum, look at his gaze - I relive it on video and it's invaluable). Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I don't know and you won't.
