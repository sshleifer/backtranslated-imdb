I am usually quite tolerant of movies, and am very entertaining, but this movie was terribly disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after seeing the front page that William Zabka was there (The Karate Kid bad boy) and during this movie I could see that it was the only reason. <br /> <br /> This movie is a tremendous waste of actors talent. The music and the sound are terribly rocky. I couldn't believe it from a movie made in the 90's! <br /> <br /> I wouldn't really recommend this movie unless you're interested in one of the actors.
