This story is about a safari in Africa that meets a man named Trent - convincing them to look for a tribal white baby. Of course, they seem to be amazon fighters and catch the men. The rest is pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything you can expect in a basement movie about Africa - the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage, film of NOT born in the continent (such as Orangutans, Moose, Coatamundis and Ground Hogs), a white actor in a dark makeup who plays a native, bad play (especially from Trent - an attractive man with the personality of balsa wood), comic relief (sounds like Chico Marx), A man dressed in a gorilla pack and bikini-dressed white women with perms who are presumably fiery jungle warriors - like a tribe of angry female Tarzans. In view of this, my assumption is that the movie was made for under $ 49.95 - including the development cost and paid for renting the gorilla suit! But what I didn't expect was a 4.9 IMDb score. It is poor but not so poor, as it is in all possible sense a shock production and there is no conceivable reason why the film is so high! Now I don't say the movie isn't worth seeing - it's nice and stupid to look good - especially with friends. Just don't expect anything that looks like a professional or skilled film. <br /> <br /> Finally, here is a slap of the dialogue from this jungle class: <br /> <br /> "Oolama like strong white man. Oolama wants strong white man ..." <br /> <br /> "oonga bunga" <br /> <br /> "my-to-tonga .... no .... killer man"
