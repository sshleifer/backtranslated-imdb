Parts: The Clonus Horror is a horror. Of course there are the bad fashions of the late 70's. There is the bad behavior of Dick Sargent after Peter Graves. And then there are the clones themselves. Their days consist mainly of running, jumping, cycling and struggling with each other. When they do not, they learn about America. Not the band America, or the song by Neil Diamond, but an America where they continue to become part of a larger society. But they are given a little strange drug, then they have drained all their body fluids. (General Ripper was right!) And they are placed in the freezer and waiting for Thanksgiving or Christmas when they are thawed and roasted at about 450 degrees. Oops, that's not what happens, but it would have been much more interesting than shown. Mario, of Super Mario Brothers boasts, makes a beautiful comedy as a doctor who bikers with Dick Sargent.
