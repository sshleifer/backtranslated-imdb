It is painfully clear that the people who made this movie have never seen such brilliant spoofs as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This movie is terrible, and so are the actors. They won't know, even if it hit them in the face, as I felt like doing while seeing the total hope of waste. <br /> <br /> The movie is stupid and has no humor in it. I'm sure I can make a better movie with my friends. For me it is amazing that a movie can fail so little. Not a single smart or funny line. No trace of intelligence behind it. This is a pathetic movie and I would like to meet the person who really likes this movie. Bah!
