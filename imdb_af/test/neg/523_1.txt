This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen (nothing included with or with Pauly Shore). I couldn't believe a movie could actually be that bad. <br /> <br /> Coolio should be the only worst actor (also Pauly Shore) to ever die in a movie. The temptation to hit the STOP button during this movie was great (in fact, if there was a DROW IN THE TRASH button on my video recorder, I would tend to push it.) Make yourself a favor, and do something more interesting than watching this movie, like watching the grass grow or watching golf on TV.
