It is difficult to write 10 lines of copy on this so-so film noir. There is nothing to say. It's not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a considerable number of noirs. <br /> <br /> Paul Henreid is playing a hard man here. He's not one I would think to play this kind of role, but he's right with it. He's a good actor anyway. <br /> <br /> Everything, including cinematography, is good but not memorable. One thing that stood out: the sudden end. It was a surprise. It was also a surprise to see it under the heading "Hollow Triumph". I've never seen the movie call it. It's always called "Scar". <br /> <br /> If you read about a "tense film noir", etc., don't believe it. "Tense" is not an accurate adjective for this movie.
