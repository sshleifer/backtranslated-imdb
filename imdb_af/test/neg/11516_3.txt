'Be With Me' is almost the ultimate background movie. Just leave it in the background. chat among each other and return to it whenever you want and at some point it will end. <br /> <br /> Oh, if I saw it alone, and I felt like I was watching the world's worst, longest and dripping sentimental beer trade by the time I almost managed to open my eyes keep track of the end credits and then I (just a few) moments of vigilance tested a "thank you" for the film's sponsors - including Asia-Pacific breweries. Ha! Methought: How surprising is * what * - given all the shots of Tiger beer between this most forgetful movie movie? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the dialogue between individuals occasionally delves into the depths, but everything is usually said nothing of any particular promotion to the film's overall story. It is as if you could switch off at any time and return at any stage and you would have really missed out on what would have been a missing event, or part of its plot, in the overall movie's progress. So the ultimate "wallpaper movie"! <br /> <br /> Well, I'm wondering ... Which movie were those who viewed this one positively? I wonder and continue to wonder ... It certainly wasn't this art to the point of the inexorable Singapore excuse for the role of a camera. It is claimed that 'Be With Me' is woven around the themes of love, tragedy and salvation. But all I saw was boredom, a half-baked script with a smearing of grimless text messages, and the only salvation was what happened when this totally useless movie ended. What a voluptuous waste of time has finally become! It was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious, except for Theresa Chan, who is a "remarkable woman who swore adversity ..." Well, no contempt for Ms. Chan, but because she's such a wonderful and was wonderful character, why did the screenplay involve the stories of other characters without the most efforts to connect their lives together? Yet, it still turns out to be an almost indifferent movie whose highlights included the credits. Rather than sticking to the fate of all characters, I really felt that the movie was finally impossible and clearly dropped between the stools, as far as any viewer involvement was concerned. <br /> <br /> I am generally an art-house movie fan and usually not object to slow pacing (of which there is no shortage, you believe me !!). I hate such movies as 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but for example, look at Eric Rohmer as a great movie maker. So I hope this puts my criticism in some perspective. However, there was no releasable feature throughout the film's concept and delivery that could keep its eyelids from hanging slowly down every minute of Be With Me. Watch this movie if you want to waste time. Otherwise, your life would not be the richer if you missed it. 10/03
