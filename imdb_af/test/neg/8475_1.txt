This movie, and I use the term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote on eighteen months: "P.U., smelly poopies!" <br /> <br /> Like that joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature, or the very stupid. <br /> <br /> It is said, there are some bright spots. <br /> <br /> The effects, where the majority of the alleged $ 100 million went, are kinetic and convincing - I mean, can be as convincing as these kind of kinetic CGI effects. The CGI baby effects aren't good, but I think it's very hard to do well ... though it could be a hundred million dollars, they would have been better! <br /> <br /> Moose, "Frasier's dog," phoned in his usual exemplary show. Steven Wright did well with a small portion. Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings-as-villain, who we saw before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but nice. <br /> <br /> The actress who is Mrs. Avery plays, was like a button, as you'd expect, and Jamie Kennedy bumps as you'd expect. His best role so far has been in the Scream trilogy (not confused with the Trilogy of the Rings), and in Three Kings. He may need to keep more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he's not. <br /> <br /> The writing and direction was, as anything, worse than Kennedy's performance. I remember a smart (all seven-year-old smart) line I wish someone would quote exactly for the "Memorable Quotes" section. Something about Avery's proposed costume is the "crappiest crap in Craptown," it was a second joke, but kind of funny in context. Over all, since there is nothing lower than one, I give this movie a "one."
