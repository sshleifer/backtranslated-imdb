As you may not know, EÃ§a de Queiroz is one of Portugal's most lawfully celebrated writers. He was witty, he spared no one in his critics and should now roll into his grave. And it's not because of the bad movie, but it is, but due to the treatment given to one of his masterpieces, O Crime do Padre Amaro. It is treated like cheap, discarded trash. <br /> <br /> When it was announced that it would be a "modern and urban", I should normally take the book I fear for the worst, in these contexts the freedom to take the p *** * take when making an adjustment, to make it half the best. And so is the moral and social dilemma of a priest who has a secret prohibition case replaced by extra-long sections of people who handle drugs and sing hip-hop for no specific or relevant reason for the plot. That's just as it might have been very good. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, there is a lot of sex, so at least you can count on it when you get it started. Remember how each movie in the 80's, regardless of the genre or tone, always found a way to sneak into a nudity? If it was a thrill and didn't need them, they simply found a way that when they caught a criminal, "happened" to be in bed with a surrendered woman ( naked of course) when police entered Ahem, the word I think is unnecessary. Not that there is something wrong with naaktone, but here they desperately create the creators of this movie, because there is nothing else about the movie, it is completely uncovered from what you call it dramatic content.
