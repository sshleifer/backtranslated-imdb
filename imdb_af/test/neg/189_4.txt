In 1904, Tangier, a wealthy American woman and her two children, were kidnapped by Berber, murderous desert pirates who murdered the Moroccan government, thereby kidnapping "American pestilence," attracting the attention of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Fictitious historical epic is less a great adventure if it is a peculiar, somewhat excellent setback for the 1940s desert-sick movies. (With a bit of "King and I"). Sean Connery and Candice Bergen can be portrayed in two completely different movies. The one who portrays the dressed, weary, bloodthirsty leader and his messy, harsh prisoner cannot be told how far the camp elements of their characters and dialogue can carry. looks simple without proper direction). The various (and anonymous) slashings and decapitations taking place are arbitrary: we do not know any of these victims, and the great action scenes become vague, noisy montages of sand-torn violence to horse. The pluses: a much-listened music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar nominee, but a loser of John Williams' "Jaws"), fine spot shoot and movie. * 1/2 of ****
