one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but very funny (not deliberate). Every scene that has something to do with; aircraft, romance, mini-dissertation or acting are very messy. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all pilots, it's so bad you'd have to burst into the movie at one time or another (see also Airport 79: the Concorde for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Anyone else, avoid this movie like the plague (except for B movies, of course) <br /> <br />
