I saw the Mogul Video VHS of this. This is yet another of those old 1980s distributors whose catalog I wish I had! <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty poor. Although the "Do not Look in the Attic" is not erected, the main reminder that is repeated here is "Don't go to the villa." Just on the grounds of the villa is a bad idea. A character didn't even go to the attic after an hour in the attic and had to do it rather because of what was learned there. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in Turin, Italy in the 1950s. Two men fight, and a woman tells them the villa is doing them. One man kills the other, then regrets it, and the woman pulls out the knife and sticks it with it. She flees the villa, and after she's gone, a chair moves by itself (what's the point?), But in the garden comes a hand through the ground and dragging it into the ground. <br /> <br /> From there, it's the present, thirty years later. There is a view that suddenly appears and seems to have nothing to do with the movie. The children of the woman from the prologue inherit the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. At least one of the two men of the prologue appears to repeat another character. She is haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, because if they do not use it, they will forfeit it. People die. An attorney who has won all his affairs is trying to investigate a little. The end is pretty poor. Why is the family cursed? An incredibly boring movie. <br /> <br /> There is an amusing small statement that appears on the back of the video box: "The scenes depicted on this package can be an artist impression and may not necessarily be the real scenes from the movie." In this case, the cover of the box is an illustration depicting more or less the aforementioned woman dragged underground, although there are two hands and the woman is different. It is true, sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie. I also remember seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale, in which movies with illustrations on the cover had at least one point instead of photos.
