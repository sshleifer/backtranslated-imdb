Whether or not this adaptation of the Marvel comedy was made? and laid flat? so its production company can retain the copyright to the characters, it does not change the fact that it is innocent. The Dr Doom and (especially) Thing costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a lack of cash or talent. Director Oley Sassone can't even show a camera on things without using such cryers as a blind woman's POV, the dialogue is completely bleak, the team's costumes don't fit right and the effects are terrible: the Human Torch appears to be drawn on the film with felt tip pens, while Fantastic's forces are brought to life with a bendyblou stick with a glove at the end. Joseph Culp compensates for the fact that he has to wear a mask by blowing his arms violently. Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hit several terrible levels. Although it is difficult not to feel sorry for all those guys who thought this movie would get a release, it is equally difficult to think any of them believe it was really good.
