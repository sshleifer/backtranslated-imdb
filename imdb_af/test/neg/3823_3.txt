Some of the judges of this film were very "generous" with praise. I was personally disappointed, because as a result of the reviews I was optimistic as the opening credits started rolling. <br /> <br /> The well-known story line goes as follows: Deformed boy and his dad live in Louisiana marsh. Local boys mock and hurt him. Local boys start grudging's, oh sorry, I mean Victor Crowley's cabin burning with him in it. Dad tries to meet his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster, meets the Elephant Man, but crashes through the child's head. Victor becomes a murderous haunt who unfortunately hunts into his domain. Oooo ... scary. <br /> <br /> One thing I appreciated from Hatchet was that it never took him seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh. The thing is, I got tired of the Hollywood-polished, B-horror bangs. I like to laugh and I enjoy a good fright, but this movie did not deliver a solid dose either. What Crowley is the next Michael, Jason, or Freddy ... Pumpkinhead has a better chance.
