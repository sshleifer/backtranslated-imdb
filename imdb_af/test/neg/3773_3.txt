What a waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserve it better than that. To start at the beginning, JT was terribly displeased here. The role has called for someone who can convince as a broken anti-hero, someone who could watch ghost and defeat. Billy Bob Thornton would fit the bill, or even Al Pacino, but JT is just too lively and seems to have too much fun. Also, surely, someone who has been through the mill to the extent that JT's character had had some physical effects? The character presented to the audience seems to be a good end to the Oakland Raiders. Scarlett was a bit better off. Where was the pain and conflict of what surely disturbing development had to be? And as for the "plot" ... well, nothing makes sense. The characters jump from one state of mind to another apparently without cause - and definitely without explanation. The pace of the movie also leaves something to be desired, namely pace. It's a very slow movie, not that I have anything against slow movies, as long as they're going somewhere. The pace is up to the end when it moves from a slow jog to a raging race to pack as many tired cliches as possible. Here it succeeds - the only thing missing is something that a small dog involves. 3 out of 10 for this one only for Gabriel Macht's performance - he was the only member of the cast who a) threw well and b) convinced in his role. All in all, a terrible disappointment and a bit of a few hours.
