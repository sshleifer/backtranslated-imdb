A spacecraft crossing the galaxy gets a mysterious cargo ship that apparently moves into space. The crew was investigating, hoping to claim his cargo and getting the ship. But, once aboard the ominous vessel, their own ship uncoupled mysteriously and let them be wary of themselves and no one else but Count Dracula or Orloff. This creature calls itself. <br /> <br /> Not a bad start. I mean it follows any number of typical sci-fi / horror plots. The genres are enough to see that even the most original story will inevitably compare to another movie. But if you start with a fairly typical horror convention, Dracula's legend and vampires in general, combining it with a fairly typical scientific convention, a crew that's happening on something and being marooned to fight whatever they should confront. , the filmmakers are better off wearing their sleeves to print their own brand on the well-known genre brackets. <br /> <br /> Director Darrell Roodt, who also wrote Dracula 3000 with Ivan Milborrow, is primarily responsible for this total failure. So, no, Roodt and Milborrow have nothing on their sleeves, but their arms. <br /> <br /> This movie begins infinitely, with a very poorly rendered voice by Caspar Van Dien, which provides essentially enough explanation to explain who the crew is on his ship. I must also point out that Van Dien's character is called Van Helsing. And, oh so very clever, is this Orloff character of the planet Transylvania in the Carpathian system. Seriously. I mean, come on guys, we get it. And again, don't goofy and don't use such names unless you have something special in the store. <br /> <br /> So, after Van Helsing's launch of the crew, we basically caught a film about this crew in a spaceship with a vampire looking around. <br /> <br /> When it comes to low-budget movies, I'm a very forgiving publisher. Sometimes they can be brilliant, see Raimi's first two Evil Dead movies. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3rd stringers such as Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. However, unlike the EVIL DEAD movie, there is no talent behind the camera. In front of the camera, the talent is marginal, but I'm going to benefit the actors a bit from the doubt. It really seems that they don't know what to do. The best actor of the forest, Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, is quickly killed and the exquisite Udo Kier is reduced to a viewing vehicle for the viewer such as the late captain we hear and watch via a video journal. Grant Swandby is also okay as the professor, but it's hard to seriously take a scientist in the year 3000 wearing glasses and riding a wheelchair. And yes, it's a WHEEL chair because there's nothing futuristic about it. Regarding the rest of the actors, I'm sure Coolio was really scared after I became a vampire. But I don't think annoyingly qualifies as scary in most people's book. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak don't really care much either. Lister is never really more than the IL's great brawny black stereotype. Eleniak actually looks unhappy in the whole movie and never tries very hard. Eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her mid-thirties, but looks a little outdated and unimportant for the duration of the movie. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Count Dracula / Orloff played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I can't remember who exactly the vampire should be. He presents himself as Orloff, but at one stage he recognizes himself as Count Dracula as well. Go figure. Anyway, you'll be absolutely amazed at how lame this vampire is. Have you ever had those cute atrocity holders who would have local networks on their creativity feature time slots? Yes, it's so bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor who plays Orlock, had found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit. I'm sure he's still being helped by his friends. <br /> <br /> There is not much on the plot. The vampire is the last of its kind and wants to go to Earth for some reason, and there is also a lip service to defeat Caspar Van Dien's character, Van Helsing. Most of the crew are turned into vampires, including Van Helsing, and the crew uses conventional machine guns and pistols to defeat them before they find out the old game in the heart routine. Yes, that's right, dots, and yes, the year 3000. threatened, is filled with old Soviet posters and insignia and the like. The? There are also references to God / religion that are outdated systems. But these references just confused me. Did the Soviet Union return? Is there something Roodt and Milborrow want to do with it? It never goes completely out, looks dumb and the posters, etc. Looks cheap. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film is suitable and written. The cinematography is nothing spectacular, but it's done clearly by professionals and I had no problem with the special effects. The ships look like ships in outer space. Although I, as I write it, remember how god looks like the captain's body when the crew discovers him. What do they think? Why didn't someone say something? See how difficult it is to say something positive about this movie without falling back on the negative? I think that's the thing. Whatever is positive about trying to provide this sci-fi / horror debacle is overwhelmed by the lack of quality. Poor Udo Kier.
