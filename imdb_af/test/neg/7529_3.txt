... but I will lie. A relative was a crew member, and we had to watch the production of this movie for a few days (and I was an extra). I'm going to die and have a second of screen time, not that I plan to move to Hollywood soon. I just thought it was great to see how movies are made and part of them. Plus, I got a copy of the movie as soon as it was released. They did not have a studio background when making this film, so it was truly independent. Why the writing and acting are so terrible is beyond me, but the main character "Cherry" is the director's sister, who can be part of it. But cinematography was good. :)
