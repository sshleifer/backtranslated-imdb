Most of the criticism of this movie was pretty damn accurate. It is an hour and a half waste of time, following a lot of pretty high school students who cry and cry about life. There are about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no frightening or exciting moments. Our actress is treated like donkeys and looks quite happy with their position. The main characters, these sons of ipsmith, run poster games for any pop culture clothing store. You can't relate to them, hell you can hardly understand them. The story spans itself and when it finally reaches the final, it's no more than a volleyball game that doesn't last long enough with this wasted writing from the O.C.
