Yes, that's true. The movie is a horrible piece ... you know what. Almost all fans of Sapkowski's books in Poland think the same. The truth is, Polish cinematography cannot afford to produce fantasy films. This is a pity if you compare 'Wiedzmin' and 'Conan the Barbarian' for example. I hope nobody outside Poland will ever see this nightmare.
