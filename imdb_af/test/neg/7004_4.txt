I ran Yvette McClendon in a movie at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After I wrote my review of her movie there, I wanted to see more of her! Found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not her fault, she's only in the first few minutes of course she's the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie. BAD directing. Scenes run over and over, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad chest, but the other actresses look pretty good. I really like Yvette, but of course it was a bad choice for her. I can't believe I rented this trash to look for her. I hope to find her other movies.
