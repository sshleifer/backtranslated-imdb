I watched the beginning twice, it couldn't make sense, and it bothered me for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> So, work it with me: Wayne (the GOOD old) jumps on the stage coach, disarm the drivers (!) steal the money (?!) and take off. <br /> <br /> Disarm, one driver is killed and the other wounded by the bad people. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them, and then looked, it happened. <br /> <br /> Then Wayne puts the money in the dirt, saves the girl, drives into town, pulls it up with Yak (too bad about the dead guy, I think) ... and then he says later the money back on the scene. And everyone is right with it. <br /> <br /> And he is the good man? And I'm pretty sure there were no small hand lamps at the time. And Bell did his first phone memo in 1876 ... were they in homes? Do I think too hard on this one? Usually I'm happy to suspend judgment to enjoy a movie, but this one bothered me. And this is a sign that the move didn't really work for me.
