"Love and human remnants" is one of those naturally written, obviously acted, naturally educated flashes that is so clear that the escape speed of its relationships and manufacturing is beyond me. It's not worth explaining. This amateur-like movie seeks to stamp every clever line, every misanthropic overtone, into every film in every film without worrying that the pieces are fit. In short, sensational crap without the sensation ... which just leaves crap.
