If you are a stranger who thinks it is "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother, get pregnant and then have sex with her again if she has an abortion and not tell her that she is related to you, then you want this movie. <br /> <br /> Remember the fact that the husband is married and has a son at home - it makes it even more disgusting and unfortunate that he has no conscience to do what he does. , his family, or Mary. He's a loser. There is nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it is dirty and offensive. <br /> <br /> It moves slowly and it doesn't lead anywhere over the first half of the movie. I couldn't even see this pathetic excuse for a "romance". I'm glad we didn't waste our money in the movie on this one. 0/10
