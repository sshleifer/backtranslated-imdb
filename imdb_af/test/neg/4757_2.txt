From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed that they hadn't released a PG-13 Alien / Predator movie long ago. It was not well received. <br /> <br /> Not exactly sure where to go, as they thought Anderson was the best director of the franchise and they produced a true sci-fi jewel. to his small but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers. <br /> <br /> These monkeys were not sci-fi movie veterans, but saw Burton's Planet of the Apes remake and House of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Their first job: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget, but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen actors shortly afterwards. <br /> <br /> Now, the writing. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. Delivering important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Think of good new lines for the general audience to remember years - it was more difficult. They sat and acted for a while with a truly award-winning script with clich√© characters, idiotic decisions that have a gaping plot hole. <br /> <br /> So far, Fox was happy with the results, but wanted to see what had to be done. from the midpoints to the movie - the aliens and predators. The monkeys wanted to save money again in the budget, so they decided to get the big robotics used in the otherwise awful AvP original dirty and go with the Alien man seen in the old movies. The actors playing the aliens have had problems matching in the suits as they were not properly arranged by the monkeys, so they were relieved of their plastic heads throughout the film. As for the predators, the monkeys have decided that a predator was enough to fight this time (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of strangers seemingly coming out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> But what about the effects, you ask? Come on, people. They may be monkeys, but they clearly knew CGI was playing an important role in the film. Without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and paste some very fine fire and spark effects throughout. Placing red and green filters over the camera gave some excellent Predator visions. <br /> <br /> The environment was something the monkeys thought long and hard. If it was on Earth, in Colorado from all places, they had to make it realistic. That was where they admitted they could make a mistake. Look, the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department, so they thought to put out the lights in the city and play the movie in the death of the night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and raining the whole movie. To offend injuries, the monkeys that were accidentally filmed had incredibly close all the battle scenes so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, newcomer mistake. <br /> <br /> The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie R. It was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys had a habit of showing the massacre to the fact. It was simple: the viewers did not have to film the gore they wanted and the monkeys did not have to shoot the majority of action shots in violence. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors originally had questions about the script. Why does a blue fluid disintegrate the Predator's endless amounts of magic as it wants and nothing more? Why is an ex-offender all around the movie in a police car? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full body of the Aliens? Why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions just kept growing, but the monkeys ignored them and completed their masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Fox was excited about their work. So excited that they opened the movie nationwide on Christmas day and even spent a few dollars advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys have successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises. <br /> <br /> But some ask, what has become the budget that monkeys forgot to use? They made it to their next movie: Aliens vs Predator vs Hulk Hogan. They knew the general public would be upset with the title, but they have since released this statement: <br /> <br /> "For the people, don't worry about our upcoming movie. It will be R rated and violence will have. "<br /> <br /> Fortunately, everyone has ever lived. The end.
