I hired this movie when my girlfriend was away and hoping to see a serious military / specialist action. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes watching this movie, I was so frightened and scared and sick of the quality of everything. In this movie I was ready to destroy the hired disc with a flame maker. Luckily I couldn't find one. I saw many bad movies. But it's not even bad, it's total garbage and it doesn't even deserve to count on IMDB as a movie here. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the people involved in making this total disgrace. Hope it wins Oscars already: D.
