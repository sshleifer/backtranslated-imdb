I became a big fan of the Carpenters, and I didn't really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I felt it focused too much on her anorexia and didn't shine her true personality. I didn't love too much Cynthia Gibb's portrayal; especially since she knew that Karen's anorexia was suicide, it was clear. Although her family wasn't hugging and kissing, I thought the movie portrayed Agnes (their mother) as horrible. <br /> <br /> I found some scenes to grind in a way, like where she saw herself in a mirror that twists her and makes her look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) was quite effective. When the family plays pool and discusses her divorce and she breaks down and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels that her fragile body has moved (that's probably the wrong word). <br /> <br /> Overall, I feel they should bring out her more bubbly, weird side - her true personality. Even as the focus of the film, there really wasn't a point that made one understand what would lead her to anorexia (although no one really knows) and almost it seems to be basically. The movie was more poor singer-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I suppose they changed her husband's name / profession and everyone because they couldn't get his permission Actually joins him (there were some bad terms there), but the whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. On this note, I can't remember the movie explaining her longing for a family and children that dominated her life and explaining her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband. <br /> <br /> Overall, it ends up as a low-budget-made-for-TV movie that's not very high-quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan hoping to outside of Karen's disease. I feel such a legend deserves / deserves a better movie as a tribute to a wonderful person and a wonderful voice.
