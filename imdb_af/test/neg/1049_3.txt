The Kite Runner started out as one of the "major" films most people come across because they are told they should be among the elite and descended rapidly into an idiotic film of absurdly exorbitant relationships. <br /> <br /> I've never read the book, and never felt the need, because I don't really care. Certainly, I'm told ignorantly to say this, but I really have no interest in just another "pull on your passion, copy of all the other story lines to get emotion from the reader's novel, even if it is set in Afghanistan br /> <br /> That said, I watched the movie, I heard good things about his beauty, and how does it go and decide why not? As it turns out, there was a lot of good why not, not only was the so-called main character completely unpathetic (I get it, he was young and it is a movie about salvation, but frankly he was horrible. no way, he was just a dull, idiotic, self-absorbed character that I didn't feel at all), but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that I couldn't believe how everyone else was how beautiful it was, and how they cry and it moved them, I'm sorry but I just feel moved by something realistic, Sci-Fi is known to me move, also fantasy ... but this? Please. It has surpassed many other films for pure absurdity! My biggest peeve, Hassan was Amir's brother ... really? Are you sure you haven't just ripped off a thousand other stories? Positive that those particular candy are not just added to trying to pull more tears out of your audience (do the type of people know why to cry during a movie)? I threw my eyes when the "twist" was revealed, and knew that it could only run from the mountain. That's not true, it's impossible!)). Amir, Hassan is your brother. Oh, and it certainly did. On the edge filled with clich√©s and just plans stupid storytelling. Like a good old man, wonderfully bad man escapes all chances with the help of a mocking child, who, despite being terribly sodomized and having no idea who you are, is willing to help with a comfortably placed special weapon contains meaning to you. Ooh and don't forget the oh so idiot. "Ultimately, revenge on the child who plagued you when you were little, who surprised surprise, became a psychopathic adult." (Trust my guys, I understand that you like to live through movies but this will never happen. You know that kid who's been teasing you at high school ... he's not a terrorist, he's probably an accountant . <br /> <br /> Oh, and I need to call the CGI Tastes! I think it was on par with the "Matrix" movies and "Transformers" bravo you guys! BRAVO! <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie has just been made for Western audiences who need a reason to care about the Middle East (he'll work an exaggerated emotional friendship story!) This is one of the busiest movies I had the accident to see, but it's so good. But if you do, it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the heart of America's audience will do what they 're telling and follow the "It's about controversial material, so it should be good!" mindset.
