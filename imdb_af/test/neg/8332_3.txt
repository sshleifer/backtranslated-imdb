The director is sweet, just like his co-ruling wife, Shira Geffen, but sucks their movie. It has its moments (and some pretty girls), but there is too much of it: "Am√©lie" meets "Breaking the waves" meet "Pauline at the beach". You walk away to get to know more about the wedding photographer, and about the girl who likes it when nothing happens, whether in movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicide writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal immigrant social worker with a heart of gold. It seems like there is more than one real story hidden in the screenplay, but on sight it is a truck of relaxed story lines and sentimental nonsense. Hard to put out as it is.
