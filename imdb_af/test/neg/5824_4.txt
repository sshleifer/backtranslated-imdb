I think Purvis starts with a gay "Gone With The Wind". If so, sorry, Tag, this didn't happen. It also didn't happen as a gay sex flutter movie. I think I'm confused; what are we trying to do here? As I like, I simply can't come where I even care about these characters. This movie is effective in capturing a taste of the decadence living in the South. This means nothing to explain, relieve or promote my understanding of a gay relationship, or the conflict that the protagonist is struggling with.
