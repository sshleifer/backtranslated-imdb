When I first read "berlin am more", I didn't expect much. but I thought with the right people, the right places, the right music and fashion that you can make anyway a trivial movie about the hip berlin is what everyone is talking about. but egg yolk failed, it is so ridiculous uncomfortable. it is a complete misrepresentation of what it entails in Berlin's so-called scene. Of course, it's not just about hippness, but you should expect more from a movie sold as the "definitive Berlin movie". <br /> <br /> Apart from all the credibility, it's really a bad movie. mediocre acting and a rather boring plot. Interestingly, some of the actors have shown in other films that they are actually quite talented. so it really should be poor straightforward skills. <br /> <br /> Don't bother "berlin am lake" unless you are 17, come from a small town in western Germany and want to move to the big city after you finish school. then you might find it nice and completely cool.
