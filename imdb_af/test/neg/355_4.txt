As a physicist, talking about black holes and cosmology gets my heart racing. However, I found this listing too slow and not seeing enough information for the interested leak (with the most likely to see it). If you have more than a passing curiosity in these kinds of things, go to the library and look at some books. You will find that they are explaining current scientific cosmologies with much more detail, while at the same time filling more of a feeling of wonder than this movie is. Also to straighten the record: Hawking is NOT considered the "greatest mind" or the world's "smartest person" as is commonly claimed, even among the user reviews here at the IMDb. Hawking himself said: "It's rubbish. It's just media hype. They need someone to fill the role model of disabled genius." I was at least disabled. "To be honest, he is probably a genius, but among history's greatest scientists, people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss and many others are easier. It is not to respect Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist But not to meet others who have done even more than he has, but watch the movie if you're really in science, but if not, I think it will be boring to you.
