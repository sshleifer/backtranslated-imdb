Dr Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a terribly mutilated woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. When she denies the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she gets pretty. But the formula puts the worst in her and it is not long before she has a string of bodies behind her. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the expression "looked as exciting as paint dry"? It pretty much makes a summary of Satanik. During the film, one of the characters, the line is, "Something so terrible, it's unthinkable." I wasn't sure he was talking about something in the movie or the movie itself. I'm really disappointed because I had high expectations for this one. Satanik has possibilities, but they are never realized. At each occasion, Marnie made the most beautiful things possible. The writing is terrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She is not so attractive and cannot wear the film on her own. <br /> <br /> Another big problem with Satanik is the direction and editing. It's a mess. We see things and places that have nothing on the film. The camera has passed the scene too long. I can't think of a single shot that would call nothing but original. This group of filmmakers shows little imagination or talent. <br /> <br /> I am not familiar with the Italian comic on which Satanik is supposedly based, but I'm sure it should be better than this.
