I'm a fan of the old SCTV show of the late 70's and early 80's and John Candy was an important reason. He was very funny about the wall characters and was simply hilarious. Unfortunately, he couldn't play these roles in the movies. Occasionally I was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he played almost the "straight" role instead of the funny man. "Armed and Dangerous" rarely tries to use John's comic abilities, or those of Harold Ramis, for the case. It's just a very predictable police and robbers type movie. If you're a John Candy or Harold Ramis fan, the movie is vigilant, don't expect to laugh a lot.
