Okay, so author / director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood to make his own movie and fill the film with striking names. Good for him! Now what he really needs is inspiration and talent to get a really worthwhile scenario, rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe confused crap he wrote down here. "Hell Ride" is not a movie; It is a fast-paced and hopelessly fearless fan-boy who is trying to pay tribute to the notorious biker flicks of the 60's and the recently revived Grindhouse theater formula in general. With 'Hel Ride' Larry Bishop fails to embarrass his set-up and there are many clear reasons for this. He doesn't have a story to tell ?? or at least not a very interesting one? but try to embrace it with numerous excess plots, many generous and many women-unfriendly sleaze, oblong and piteous dialogues that are expected to be cool and huge amounts of senseless violence. The plot looks complex but can actually be summed up in one sentence. The old vendetta between two rival biker gangs leaves again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or may not be the lost son of a double crossworm executed in 1976. That's it, seriously! All the rest is about to betray gangsters after recruiting old contemporaries to play with his nimfomanian informant girl. It's all completely useless and confusing material. Another big problem in "Hell Ride" is Larry Bishop's own, awesome and seemingly unsaturated ego. He certainly should not have rewarded the reward of the difficult and relentless gang leader, as it comes just as incredibly pretentious and meticulous. especially if there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie. Granted, Bishop died in some real 60's biker exploitation movies (such as "The Savage Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but it was a long time ago and he is honestly not a good as an actor. Perhaps it was just Bishop's life-long dream to play a character that always adorns his enemies and for which every hot babe desires sexually and just wrote a whole script about it. The veterans in the movie, like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, don't really bother a probable impression and I can't say I'm guilty of them. This whole production is lame and pathetic, and I cannot recommend it to anyone, regardless of many beautiful babies moving around with bare breasts and naked stumps.
