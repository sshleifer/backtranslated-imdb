This movie could have been good. It is not in my opinion. The storyline is fragmented, the editor doesn't seem to be able to choose between a Guy Ritchie style storytelling style and a fairer one. There is a great emphasis on excessive violence, including torture. Too much, if you ask me. The characters are very level and stereo-typed, I would like to see more depth. It is difficult to identify with the main character. As a result, the movie remains level. Because of the movie, it gives the viewer an inside of the British criminal subclass, more specifically the Essex subclass. Soccer hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroine and violence, many and many violence. Violence due to paranoia and fear in general. In this movie no one seems to use his (or her) brain, we look at a lot of animals in clothes. As I said, there isn't much of a plot and the storytelling leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you're a man under 30, keep it from gore and hardcore violence and think it's entertaining, if it's a movie for you. If you are looking for a movie depicting real people with a well-developed story, tension and depth, well ... you can hit this one.
