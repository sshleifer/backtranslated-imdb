First I am upset there is no choice of a "0" out of 10. <br /> <br /> I was bored tonight, and as I looked around the channels, I saw Dr. Chopper. With nothing else, I decide to see it, and expect it to be just another crazy horror movie, with a similar plot of Cabin Fever. <br /> <br /> Man I was wrong ... Dr. Chopper made Cabin Fever look like it had won several Academy Awards. May I remind you, Cabin Fever contains a play of a small hick boy doing roundhouse kicking off a porch that screams, "pancakes !!", characters that make their dying friend die in a small hut and Shawn of Boy Meets The world wrongly grabbed a hole in a girl's thigh. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, dr. Chopper was a big, stinky pole-o-crap. It wasn't even funny crap. It reminded me of a horror movie I had to make in the 8th class, called "The Campout". Except for the fact that "The Campout" had a better script (we wrote it about an hour before filming), better actors, plots, bloody scenes and camera work. I was hoping to make a bit of a weak horror movie laugh, but I could only look in amazement if I thought to myself, "Was it made by 8 degrees?". <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the events and various small subplots were thrown together and didn't make sense, and the gore and violence were very few. I liked how it was from a small broken wound, people immediately died and the only weapons the murderers had were small pocket knives. If you are going to make a horror movie, the killer gives at least a deadly murder. device. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the girls of the girls who expressed their promises? Good way to walk a few scenes in their bras, even if they have no interest in the story. And I have to say, my favorite line was when the blonde for dr. Chopper says: "I would like to present you to someone .... my inner bitch." Her "inner bitch" then continues to grab a garbage can, throwing it at Dr. Chopper, miss, and back in the terror of the murderer. <br /> <br /> Wheww .... well it was a long one, but I felt I had to express my feelings about how absolutely horrible this "movie" was. I know everyone has their own opinions, but if someone is upgrading this movie above 2, they have to be shot at hell ... <br /> <br /> ... serious.
