I would like to sit down and write an intelligent, well-thought-out review, but I feel that I will spend more time in the writing process than the filmmakers did. I live in Los Angeles and I am sorry to say that the characters looked just like many underworkers and too much ego inflated ACTORS. There was not one moment in the movie when I could feel that I had watched the brave conversation of unemployed actors in a hipster LA coffee shop. One of the worst "indie" movies I've ever had with so few to recommend winning at Sundance has effectively removed any previous interest I may have attended much less than a positive Sundance review be considered meaningful. Look at your own risk.
