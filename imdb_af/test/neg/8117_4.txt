Almost everything Stephen King ever wrote seems to have been in a movie or TV series. In fact, I'm surprised no one tried to make a mini-series from the man's grocery list. Let's look at it, if they did, it could be no less interesting than Children of the Corn. <br /> <br /> Based on one of King's many short stories, this 1984 horrorflick Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton see a couple on a long car journey that gets in a spot when they are in the sleeping Nebraska city Gatlin arrives, where all the adults are murdered by children who worship an old evil that is in the wheat fields. <br /> <br /> Although director Fritz Kiersch can build up a fair amount of atmosphere in the beginning (after Hamilton's foolish song and dance, but before we meet Isaac's torch leader's torch leader), with endless unspeakable scenes in which Hamilton and Horton are hunted by the town's murderous half-feet. Courtney Gains, as violent redhead Malachai, is actually threatening, but the rest of the kids are not the least threatened; As a result, many of the film's "scary" moments fail to work. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, when we finally see the malicious force that lives in the field around Gatlin, the film falls into a bunch of horrible 80s visual effects that are likely to look pretty close to 25 years . Corn kids may be of interest to King fans who want to see the author's work translated into the big screen, but your average horror movie fan will be a great surprise to you. <br /> <br /> be the most unobstructed.
