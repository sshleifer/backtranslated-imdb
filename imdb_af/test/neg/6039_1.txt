There can be no worse criticism of a movie than the word USE. <br /> <br /> Some "bad" movies are great fun, some "fun" movies are really bad, but being, means no one will ever buy the DVD to watch it over and over. <br /> <br /> It was a movie that employed the drama class of the Antartic. They were too busy walking around to stay warm instead of acting. The main actor, speaking, is a near whisper, a crying style voice, he seems to be deceiving someone, and he doesn't care who doesn't. <br /> <br /> The movie can't make money if it's not boring, I hope this one dies fast, never seen again, death.
