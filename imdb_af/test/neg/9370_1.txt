The only thing it offers is the interesting opponents of Tru and Jack, their choices and views, and the philosophical questions it brings. Tru feels that she helps people who are not supposed to die, and Jack feels they are supposed to die, and she brushes with the plan of fate, or the plan of the universe, or so. <br /> <br /> But of course she is able to change things, so there is of course no such thing as the fate of the metaphysics of the series. Jack has no basis to believe there is. And very easily, Tru never asks him the right questions. Nobody does. Of course, this proves that the makers of the series have no answer. <br /> <br /> There is simply no plot! <br /> <br /> Instead, they make it dark to make the series. can continue with it's boring girl stuff, which is interrupted only occasionally by Tru and Jack's races against the unknown units. <br /> <br /> There seems to be nothing about it. A teen pop series that pretends to be something else. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent sleeping.
