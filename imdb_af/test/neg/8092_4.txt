Alright. This film is totally unfunny, puerile, gags from other movies, has songs from other films (Blink 182's "Mutt", Grand Theft Audio's "We Luv U"), an indescribable leading man, a ridiculous plot and " a parody of movies like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty. Reload features? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly. Enough said.
