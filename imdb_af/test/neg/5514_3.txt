As several posters "shamed," it is a pity "Star Wars" ripoff. If you now want to cut off "Star Wars", it does at least be right; "Battlestar Galactica" did, and there were some other space operas that didn't do a bad job, but it certainly isn't one of them. David Mendenhall, the youth leader, is actually not bad, though he often remains over the "cute" factor. Vince Edwards has not improved much as actor since his "Ben Casey" days; If he is something, he is even more wood than he was ten. The other performances are also nothing to write home about. Even worse are the special effects; The best thing you can say about them is that they are in common. Obviously the "strangers" are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little foam or latex beaten on them, and the "battle" scenes between Edwards's raiders and the strangers are poorly performed and badly shot. A very poor attempt by Roger Corman. Skip it.
