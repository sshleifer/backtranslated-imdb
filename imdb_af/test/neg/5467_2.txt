Many questions arise about making this movie. The first of these is: Why does a movie that plays just as little as an uncomfortable female fantasy? It's one thing to leave an audience with issues to discuss about a movie's intention. It is something completely different to go into the process of writing a script, which does not adequately address the right human issues before being placed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Why the vast melodramatic and often comic soundtrack? Why the excessive and regular clunky dialogue? Why is the main character's girl one of the tired kidnappers? What is the purpose of joking the main character's freedom of abduction by completing his "mission"? (This is a classic Little Aussie movie moment. Resort to unprecedented comedy at the most inappropriate moment.) Why so many scenes where absolutely nothing happens? (That means about 15 minutes of the movie, which is at least 30 minutes long.) Why, if a man is taken so many days, doesn't he try a serious attempt to escape? <br /> <br /> The director, who wrote the script, failed to deliver a satisfactory story on many points. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
