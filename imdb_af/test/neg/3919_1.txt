Square pigs as a way to effectively utilize cargo space are the only smart moment in Space Truckers. Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper got worse, see "The American Way," but this movie is up on the "room of the crap" scale. I think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that Space Truckers will not please anyone. Too cartoony is also taken seriously, an almost total lack of humor, and poor character development, ensures disappointment virtually. The beer and popcorn scissors can tolerate one view, but all others are warned to avoid "Space Truckers" for all of the above reasons. - NOTE
