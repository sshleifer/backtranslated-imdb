How can anyone give it anything higher than a 1? <br /> <br /> I thought "Manos, the hands of destiny" will forever be the worst movie ever obstructing my optic nerve. Indeed, I didn't think anything could be worse. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. "Galaxina" is that rare film where every ANY element of it is painful, malicious, blindly bad. How often did you watch a movie and comment, "Who is hell, this thing?" From lighting to soundtrack to effects on mini-thesis to respond to cinematography. . . Well, EVERYTHING, this movie is absolutely useless. It's so bad, I couldn't even tell for some time whether it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's too bad even to be laughable. I would eat a plate full of broken glass earlier than put it through again.
