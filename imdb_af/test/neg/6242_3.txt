Now I know why this movie can be bought for so cheap at the video stores. I was curious because it had three great-name stars, but was among the 'B' movies that apparently can't even give away the video! The answer is, it's a movie that will draw a very limited audience: more than 50 crowds with very liberal sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Whoever watches Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren, a basic message that a fraud is on your wife, as long as you still love her. This is the good "feel-good message" here, especially at the end of this strange kidnapping story. Who wrote this script ... Bill Clinton? <br /> <br /> I say "strange" because the kidnapper is the most beautiful kidnapper (Dafoe) you've ever seen, except at the end. He regularly releases his hostage (Redford), which would not dare to kidnap, have comfortable conversations about family matters, and so on. It's all ridiculous! Well, the L.A. Times says it's an "intelligent thriller". Ha ha. Well, this confirms what most people from the L.A. Times knows. For those of you who believe and have not seen it, I will not spoil it with more of the giant holes in this story, especially at the end. The fact is, it is an insult to anyone with intelligence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you can't mislead all the people, as critics still have to find out. Here's another movie they've predicted that has just been bombarded at the box and video store.
