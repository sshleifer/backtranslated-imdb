Likewise, Jim is like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two sons are total losers. Both boys, about 30, live at home, with nothing going for them. I live in the Middle East and I can't call one family like this. I picked it up because I'm kind of Buscemi-acting humor. Now I realize that I need a present agent to make that humor work. The work and camera work and editing were good. The first 15 minutes got you, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the Jerry Springer trailer's trash-type story from being completely oppressed. The female members of my family begged me to shut it down, but I was supposed to have a turning point, and we watched the whole movie. The male relatives, as expected, just walked out after the first 30 minutes.
