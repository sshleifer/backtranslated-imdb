I agree with the other user comments. Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994, because it screams mid-80s. I think it's called because the sound and the picture don't always match. If anyone can really say it's a good movie, they should be locked. It's so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. I feel I have lost the intelligence to watch it. I had a little respect for Chuck Norris before I looked at it, but now I just feel bad. I bought it as part of a $ 9.99 3 movie suit and I can honestly say I would have been better off throwing the money away. Forgive me Jesus.
