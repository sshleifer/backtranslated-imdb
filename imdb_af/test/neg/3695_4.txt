A woman who is as wealthy as she is uncertain, has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns, undoubtedly helped by a smooth-gigolo man who openly deceives her. Of course, no one believes her when she claims that he is equipped by a giant man who has walked out of a giant satellite. Much to the joy of her husband, this can be the event that ultimately benefits her. <br /> <br /> Of the many outstanding scenes, with the ridiculous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite encounter, you'll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it's so bad it's funny. Although it's not too far from the point, it's definitely not true. <br /> <br /> Unlike most movies of this genre, it's not really a sci-fi or a horror movie, but actually a serious drama that intelligently incorporates a sci-fi scenario in the plot. It's not a good or even a mediocre drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you don't expect a legitimate drama at all. The acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort and, above all, it is well edited and played excellently. It's never boring and managing to generate more than a little interest to see what will come next. Still, it is still a movie for those who do not get the chance to see a 1950s movie titled "Attack of the 50th Wife"!
