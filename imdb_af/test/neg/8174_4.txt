OK, here's the shortest of them. This movie is full of choppy dialogue, about the top acting and a thread. <br /> <br /> There are moments meant to be very dramatic, but only to go off humorous because of the top acting and poorly written lines. I couldn't help laughing at moments meant to be very serious. The bright spot in this movie is the circus. To see the circus in its infancy was definitely a surprise. <br /> <br /> There are moments that come through so well. But then it's nosedives right back into the B movie area. I was tempted to stop watching it several times. <br /> <br /> I definitely don't know how it won the best picture. It must have been a slow year!
