Watching QUINTET is no different than watching a group of people playing a word game in Portuguese or another language you don't understand. You get the idea that they are playing a game, and if you look enough, you can just start to understand the rules. But, why bother because it's clear you can't join and you don't want to have the chance. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Altman is not one to beg an audience to keep his films, let alone understand them. Sometimes he lets you slide into the picture to be part of the crowd, such as in M ​​* A * S * H, NASHVILLE and a WEDDING, movies so full of hubbub and orchestrated chaos, one or two bodies in the scene would Don't make much of a difference. And at other times, it looks like the fact that somebody even looks at his movie, disgusts like in pictures or THREE WOMEN, where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one, Altman. With QUINTET it seems that Altman deliberately dare anyone to get involved in the story. <br /> <br /> You can't rely on Altman to do the logical or the expected, which is sometimes the thing that makes his films so remarkably iconoclastic. But sometimes the unexpected do not dare, just silly. For example, in QUINTET we are introduced to a young woman who apparently is the last person on earth to conceive, and she is with the child. This last ray of hope in a dilapidated society is almost extinguished immediately; Altman doesn't even wait until the end to play his last depression card in this extensive nihilistic and pessimistic story. He lets us know how empty and meaningless life is right from the bat. Brave? Can be. Stupid? Definitely. He tries to build a story on a fast-melting iceberg, and always reminds us how useless it is. <br /> <br /> For the record, QUINTET can at least claim to be prophetic. The story is centered on an insidious game played by the various bored characters. It is a form of TAG (the murder game): A handful of people are mutilating each other, each as a murderer and each as a victim. Two or more can form alliances to kill a third. As they die, new targets are being awarded. Everyone who lives wins. All these things happen at some exotic, inhospitable wasteland. This is, to a large extent, an extreme scientific version of "Survivor" - less the commercial plugs and the faded "reality". <br /> <br /> It's not a bad concept for a scientific fiction. Epic. A post-apocalyptic institution, a microcosm of the world (the role-play is a major multinational), a game where no confidence or at least cannot be long, and where nobody really wins. Literally a cold war. A Steady Eyed director with a taste for dark humor and violent invention can have a field day. The secret in QUINTET is not in the game or how it is played, but in why it all exists. If the game Quintet is a metaphor for life, Altman seems to see nothing in the material, but a chance to show that life is an empty, meaningless game - a conclusion is as clear as it is. is false. Given the vibrant, albeit cynical nature of the rest of his diverse films, I don't believe Altman also believes in QUINTET. And if Altman has no confidence in his material, why should we?
