First of all, even IMDb is doing this movie, as the cast list is VERY "gappy". For example, even main characters are missing like Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now back to the movie. I like watching movies, but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or how many minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And the reason why it bothered me so much is because I was very excited to see it in advance. <br /> <br /> The plot line itself is good. It can be a good movie if done properly and with careful casting. Golden Brooks was a great disappointment. Now I see that the only role she can play is the hard, fun loving, energetic sexy chick she plays on Girlfriends. Melodramatic roles are not for her at all. She basically killed her character, Rachel. <br /> <br /> I love some of the cast, such as Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Darrin Dewitt Henson, but even they can't save this catastrophic movie. Of course, it's just my personal opinion that I can't stand Hill Harper as a man, and he didn't help me keep him here any more. <br /> <br /> Golden Brooks's voice bothered me so much that I had to force myself to watch the movie. She seemed to have whispered the whole joint. The director I will not even fire off boarding, he did such a bad job. The editing, photography / camera focus and just about everything about this movie was SAD. Not to mention the dialogues! Absolutely unreal and many times straight hilarious (when it was supposed to make you cry and look deeply into yourself). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a great movie, but it was seriously messed up. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are cinematographically great and want to preview their future work. <br /> <br /> Have a good day, Everyone !!!
