Lance Henriksen has a talent to be the top name in a B-movie, even in this case that stretches alongside Charles Napier, Master Control Program and Joe Don Baker. As always, he does a good job of being the bad guy, but the plot is just bad (don't even start with the end). And the editing is so terrible that it can actually be a thing of beauty. Is it just me, or does it look as if Joe Don Baker was split into the movie at the last minute? Also, when glass is broken in this movie, editing is so anti-phenomenal. Lastly, after watching it, I showed that David Warner died for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Felony, this will be the third movie I give the 1/10 score to Iron Eagle IV and No Mercy.
