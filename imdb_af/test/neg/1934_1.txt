This is probably a cultural thing - somehow, the inhabitants of this country are conditioned to find these things funny. I experienced this phenomenon first-hand during an open-air cinema event where this movie was shown before the function. Most indigenous audiences laughed, and no, it wasn't in a sanatorium or a disability clinic, it was in a good environment, and the audience mostly consisted of educated adults. <br /> <br /> It must be possible to find this amusing one in some way, but honestly to goodness, I have no idea what it needs --- maybe it's in the air or the water , prolonged exposure that causes this condition. Something should cause it, of course, the only thing I can say is that I'm sure what it doesn't cause: the movie itself. <br /> <br /> There are no jokes in it. It's brain dead, stupid, stupid, unfunny, lame. It is a waste of time. Anyone Tom and Jerry are more beautiful, and even funerals are funny. <br /> <br /> Just if you were lucky enough to never see Stooges' performances, it is three guys who run, run and even talk Similar delayed babies, causing all kinds of unfunny chaos, without plot, no real purpose and no real conclusion. It's like ugly Teletubbies without the cute costumes. <br /> <br /> Sitting in a crowd who considers this garbage in this country can be quite staggering, because you feel like you're at a lot of pots and you're just one who doesn't mind smoked. <br /> <br /> Unless you are willing to get yourself drunk to wear it, or to be equipped with whatever it is, thinking people look at three ugly old men, behaving like moron. funny, my advice on this is: stay away. Far away.
