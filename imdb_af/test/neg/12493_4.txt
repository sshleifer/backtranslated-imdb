Another version of the mother of all gangster flicks - the Classic "Godfather" and another case of over-hype due to the media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi movie by Ram Gopal Varma as director, is also the worst in his Underworld trilogy, including the other two which are the excellent Satya and Company. For the first time, Charisma, the first magnetic persona of the two Bachchans, plays father's son duo on the screen, surely a surprise to venture out. Not only strong performances, but their perfect chemistry is the biggest point where Varma should be welcomed. However, the same comparison of the duo is lacking with the other characters in the movie. Reason - the other characters look more like cardboard cartoons esp. the villains represent the typical Bollywood bad things. A character that draws attention is the older son Kaykay played, but unable to keep due to half-baked characterization. . The drama and conflict are brought alive by the excessive use of Close-shots, which has struck a claustrophobic effect that was needed to create an atmosphere. The spectacular score (Amar Mohile) and the sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani & Anup Dev), along with dark, dark background overlapping with brilliant powerful images (camera work by Amit Roy) contribute to Visuals as typical of Ramu's style. But there is over-exploitation of music, but fortunately there are no songs in the film. But can the interest of today's "intelligently growing" audience only be sustained on the shoulders of two artists and strong Visuals? I do not think so. Certainly, "moonlight heard" and here the film fails to deliver. In any adaptation, to add a new dimension, the biggest prerequisite is the slow-moving script isn't in place, so the pace is quite frequent. What is finally subject to hearing is a highly predictable, very everyday drama with very little surprise elements. Top Stunt director Allan Amin Ghani is also not in his best form. Some scenes that require a different treatment include: A minister talks dirty about Sarkar and the boy is overheard; a very amateur shoot out in jail at Sarkar, Sarkar Jr. escape from the heads of his enemies. A boy motivated to kill his own father. A boy is secretly in his father's room to kill him. A police commissioner beats Sarkar Jr - this requires a more realistic, stubborn approach that is the backbone to create the required conflict. The dialogues are poor for eg. look at an amateurist line where a CM says to Sarkar Jr. "Wo, police commissioner, moon hata diya." The women's people assume that Sarkar's work is completely ignored. The uninterrupted negotiations on criminal activities while Sarkar is with his family also seem slightly out of place. In fact, the film follows a chart very similar to Ramu's own production branch, Tak Chhappan. In portraying the struggle between good and evil, the other side of life - law, police, administration, politics is completely ignored. Surely more content is expected. Here the film definitely falls short and it can't rise above an average price. Dear Ramu, I have agreed that you are now going to laugh at the bank, and you should definitely take drastic reform measures in your film production plant before it is too late.
