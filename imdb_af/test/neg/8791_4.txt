Ridiculous movie where two swing college graduates move to California and one becomes a movie star and the other is his driver. <br /> <br /> As 10 years have passed, the star's popularity is falling, so it is determined that there is a television program where women will compete for his love. <br /> <br /> The movie is stupid and ridiculous. The girls who love mistress are made to look foolish. Only one girl seems to be the choice of the show manufacturer. She is really an amateur against some of the other women, but she is healthy and also shows good ratings. <br /> <br /> At the third scene you realize that the driver is falling for her. </ br /> <br /> We know Ryan was really meant to be a bachelor. While the end is slightly cute, you really know where it's going.
