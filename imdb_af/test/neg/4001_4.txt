Usually, I love these "Stranger Within" thrillers. A few good examples are 'fatal attraction', 'single white female' and 'audition'. Well done, they can be fun, and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares. Of course, the opposite can be true: poorly done, they can be boring and stupid. The hand that rocks the rock is one of the latter. <br /> <br /> Bartels, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) welcome another member to their family. But Claire is persuaded by Michael to hire nanny. One day a woman named Peyton-Flanders (Rebecca DeMornay) appeared, and because she looked perfect, Bartels rented her. Of course, as soon as she comes up, their idyllic life is slowly unraveled ... <br /> <br /> This movie suffers from a plethora of problems, but the biggest is dealing with the villain. Peyton is never credible. Part of this is about how she wrote and how she acted. The things she does are supposed to put us on the brink, so confronted they are laughing. The Mornay doesn't help much. She portrays Peyton as two different people. Although true, she is supposed to be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies. De Mornay's performance creates a separation between the two facets of her character. <br /> <br /> However, the other actors are good. Annabella Sciorrra is wonderful as the asthmatic Claire. Sciorra is very natural in the role, but unfortunately the script leaves her. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. However, Julianne Moore is pleasant as Claire's friend Marlene. Moore is a cracker, but unfortunately she's only been on the screen for a total of five minutes. <br /> <br /> Curtis Hanson is a good director, but you won't know how to see it. The film has some decent shocks, but it is poor, and the climax, while generating tension, is actually so nice. It is said that he works with a script that can be pathetic at its best. <br /> <br /> Trust me, when it comes to nannies, stick to Fran Drescher. This one had to go to the direct-to-video box.
