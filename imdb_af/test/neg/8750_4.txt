For all his many mistakes, I tend to be charity for "Thing". There is the nugget of an interesting, creepy, claustrophobic Hitchcock style story here. Put it in the hands of a writer such as Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer British perspective) Robert Bloch, or the man who wrote "Day Of The Triffids", and you may have a nasty, disturbing little ghost story that the was best. thing in a book anthology of horror and suspension stories. <br /> <br /> But someone chose to tell this story as a feature-length movie, and a cheap 2nd rate, and so most of the potential is wasted. . A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon to bring out interesting character characters in a better light. His classic story "The -widget-, the -wadget-, and Boff" is an example of how he can collect an isolated group of ordinary characters. In the space of 40 pages, they can be the most amusing, sympathetic and fascinating people you've ever met. A good writer can, with a few chosen words, make the reader some of the most vibrant and memorable events that ever pose his emotions. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a movie where some of the most annoying and untouchable characters ever made are crammed and made to be in unconvincing interaction. "Where did it come from?" moments just lying there. (IE the blonde psychic girl who states "You are all angry and I hope you are destroyed!"). We get led pacing and slow motion blocking and boring sets and tight actors. I blame the director for the "stiff and shallow" part. These are all 3rd character characters who never made the big time, but they are also "real" actors, and a good director could have gotten better performances from them. We become unashamed for lesbian overtones who feel uncomfortable and exploited by the viewer without making any payouts. (If I was going to exploit my basics and feel guilty, I would do better than things did). And we get more than an hour of creepy buildup spread in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climax I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Good things about "thing"? Um, well ... some of the close-up shots of the vault's head, which were quietly his guidelines, were pretty effective. The wretched and sharp widow stayed true (even though I wanted to put a sock in her mouth). The first scene where the big, "simple" ranchhand quietly turns on the oily cowboy and kills him, has a little shock value, because the plot made the effort to establish the great man as a reasonably sympathetic character. And, as I said earlier, the idea of ​​a treacherous past power that turns members of an isolated community against one another is a good one and can maintain interest far beyond the real merit of a bad performance. <br /> <br /> What it definitely is. <br /> <br /> But, as I said, I tend to be charity because the director probably works under a fine budget, breaks time constraints and the best actors he can find for the money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge over a period of 40 years, such as "The Cave," "Wrong Turn," or the remake of "House of Wax". I hope their charity is for our own tastes to support our generations' waste of film supplies.
