I won't generally review movies I haven't seen in a while, so I will plug in or rent them to provide a full and fresh movie. In the case of a thunder sound, I remembered my vow to never see this movie again, so I'm just reminding. In fact, I didn't think about how bad this movie was until I read someone's review and remember the experience I returned in 2005 when I actually saw it in the theater. My filmmate forced me to see it, though I'm not interested, and wow. (Later I forced him to see 'Basic Instinct 2' in the theater, to remind him that he showed me. So, I think we even made it.) I definitely had my part of the deep laugh (Of course, on the film's cost) that didn't make him happy, because he really wanted to see it. The time travel / butterfly effect movie had so many bad graphics, the hardest chicks of mine were when they showed the dinosaur (God, I liked seeing that dino and they were really scared of it. It was hilarious! Or just, Ben Kingsley. It's wonderful, Kingsley reminds us how human actors can be: go from 'Gandhi' to 'Schindler's List', this. (Even a Meryl Strip may occasionally do a "She-Devil", so they are forgiven.) For months I pulled an MST3k with my partner, and this movie is consistently referring to any low rent sci fi movie or Kingsley flick. Yes, the movie would be a good movie to see drunk (or otherwise failing): a horrible top performance, 'special' FX that would even turn the Nintendo64 and ridiculous plot turns. The biggest disappointment was that the Razzies did not even nominate this film for any award.
