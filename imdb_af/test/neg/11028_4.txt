When I bought 4 DVDs for Â£ 5.oo in a local store, it had been warned enough that this movie was not on the standard of David Selznick Productions. With the role of such names as James Stewart and Carole Lombard, I was looking for a real surprise. As many other commentators have said, it is a strange mix of plot and scenes that are not entirely convincing. Yet I am so glad that I have seen this movie, as I have now said the memorable: "Never let the seeds stop to enjoy the watermelon." to live. It must sum up everyone's life. Remove or spit out those seeds or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.
