I am a fifth class language artist, and after reading this book (which the students loved), we watched the movie. They laughed out loud! Unfortunately, it's NOT a comedy! The acting was so horrible, I felt like I was watching a lot of kids in the area to tackle a play. My students imitate the lines and make fun of all the way through. I have to agree with them, sometimes it was pretty bad. Yet I will show it to students again, just for fun, and compare the film with the book. We have done a Venn Diagram (teachers know what it is) to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so there is an educational value to show it. I noticed that another adaptation for 2005 is being filmed so we can only hope that the acting will be better!
