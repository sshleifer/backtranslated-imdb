I tried to watch this movie 3 or 4 times, but I just can't get past the fact that everything about it is just awful. I'm sure it was a brave move by someone to throw Jack Palance as the protagonist, but there's not one single fiber of my being who believes he can't act, much less on type. <br /> <br /> Yes, I understand that Clifford Odets was a brilliant writer, but it's not clear here. This strange and forced mish-mash of 50's hipster dialogue seems to darken a true meaning, which explains why none of the actors, even the good (Steiger, Ida Lupino, Shelly Winters, Everett Sloane) seems to know how to make their lines to deliver. - It's as if they don't understand the meaning of what they say. And meanwhile, Wendell Corey and Palance make a great game to see who can be more stone-colored. <br /> <br /> The direction is amateurish and completely overwhelmed. The physical interaction between the characters is as quiet as the dialogue. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss that terrible set? It's so busy, ugly and confronted that it adds to the robot, disconnected quality of characters, dialogue and depictions. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like I'm just sucking the energy out of me. Everybody seems to have taken an overdose of Valium every morning when they arrive on the set. It's a nice movie to make Rod Steiger and Shelly Winters look, but this one succeeds. <br /> <br /> I can see that it would have been possible as a play on or off Broadway, where intellectuals and beats could have congratulated themselves on the value of the power of the plot and the artsy flourished from the pseudo-hip dialogue.
