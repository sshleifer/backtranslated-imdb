The audience sits silently through almost the entire movie, with just a few, rare, occasional chuckles. The character of Maxwell Smart was so contradictory, I feel whispered. If it's convenient for the plot, Smart acts like a master spy. At other times he acts like an imbecile. They highlight many classic lines from the television series, but they do not work in this version. The classic "missed it so much" is funny when it is spoken with an attempt at braggadocio by someone who is a clear failure - but it loses all humor when spoken by someone qualified. To a lesser extent, many of the other characters move in a dizzying pace from skilled to cartoon-conscious. Siegfried, the main villain, looks intelligent, but he makes decisions that do not make sense at all. Yet, none of the characters in the film are as incompetent as the authors of this mess. I'm totally depressed that so many IMDb users think it was good.
