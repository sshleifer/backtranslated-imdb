The unsaved so-called comedy I've ever seen <br /> <br /> Not a patch on the naturalism of the hilariously Twin Town. <br /> <br /> Vegas I; as usual, but this writing is so much predictable as good English in the worst way (In recent years the English movies are both terrible to them). Ireland has at least made the commitments, Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 exhibited big movies and Wales has Twin Town, Zulu, Last Days of Dolwyn, Torchwood, Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood, etc. <br /> <br /> comedy is paint by numbers, the actors are dead men who run because there is no characterization and no originality and it is just as unfunny <br /> <br /> England falls behind no matter how much grim North movies they produce. It's the old class system that destroys English movies. The Oxbridge graduates spit endlessly clicked scripts about working class people they have never lived before. It's pathetic. Monty Python was not funny, and was nothing of Oxbridge. <br /> <br /> Let guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly or their own dialogue write and forget the archaic failed class system. Do the work of classmates and the right talent coming through the system take over the writing properly and the British and English film industry will rise again, writing next Prince Edward a modern Oliver Twist?
