It is a family film that took place in 1950's rural America over a boy whose uncle is imposing on sheep against his daughter Drum. He not only starts a family legal feud, but community disagreement if their town begins to take its sides. <br /> <br /> It's a formula movie that tries to touch and be very sweet. His biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were Scott Bakula (Defense Attorney), Ron Perlman (father / Drum's owner) and the dog. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, "Sissy" from the original Family Affair, as the uncle and his wife, were good.) The kids were not that good (basically they looked like they were) and that is a problem when The movie really turns to them (Aaron Fors, who plays bully Donny, reminds me of what actor Russell Crowe had to look like as a kid, with no talent, but a lot of ham). <br /> <br /> Favorite line (pronounced by the prosecutor after Scott Bakula's defense's closing speech): "We'll be happy if they don't cause us." <br /> <br /> Favorite line spoken by Ron Perlman (after his son hit the bully): "Make him your friend now, this will be the difficult part." <br /> <br /> Nice enough to rent / buy use.
