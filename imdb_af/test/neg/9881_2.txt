My first impression when I read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it would be very, very different from the book. The movie wagon said the movie was supposed to take place when Vivian was 19 years old after her parents in America were killed in a fire. She meets Aiden, an aspiring graphic novelist. Working in a chocolate shop that day, she must assume she will never be normal, because every full moon becomes a loup-garou - a deadly mythical being that can now be compared to a werewolf. br /> <br /> Most of the small changes didn't seem too bad to me, although I'm a fan of the book with the shared title of Annette Curtis Klause. I knew it would be different, but I wanted to see it support the book and think that an age change, a change in the environment and a few small occupations would not affect the story as a whole enough to let me not tear my eyes out of their sockets and let myself bloom on the theater ground. <br /> <br /> The movie has unnecessarily killed many important characters, one of which is Esme, Vivan's mother, right from the bat in the fire that was supposed to kill her father. I put it aside and challenged in the movie, tired and slightly irritated. In Romania the camera angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful and the music was interesting ... but it surprised me with the impression: "Why does Vivian look like this and why does she wear a hoodie?" I have to say that I am surprised that the screenwriters somehow support a shock, and rather than meeting the character of the book between Vivian and Rafe, the fifth leader has become her niece through her ( Aunt Astrid, who was in the novel the bitter and hated rival of Vivan's mother, and, I might add, no way with any of them. <br /> <br /> Above Gabriel somehow became the leader of the pack and was obsessed with Vivian being his partner so they could fulfill some non-existent prophecy. Not only did his physical appearance take a full 180 from the description in the book, he was also the father of Rafe. Yeah, that's right, it's a nice, tiny, turbulent knot wolfies tied up. <br /> <br /> Little things that irritate me are scenes like the bush hunt. There was a redhead that stood out from the rest of the crowd. The one who "kissed" their enemy before they were prey was free to run and hunt. Why was she there? Why did she look like Astrid? I suppose my mind is not big enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the movie without explaining why it existed other than kissing beautiful victims. <br /> <br /> I loved how the Amoeba was completely cut out of the movie. I loved how legally entangled Aiden's past was, between the so-called dramatic scene where he told Vivian how his father wanted him to learn self-defense, and then beat his father on "self-defense" to make him like that. seems to be a tragic character. <br /> <br /> Character 180's is great fun if they're completely unnecessary. At the end of the movie, I felt as if someone had sharpened the novel, scribbled half the list of character names, pulled a few connections here and there, said that Gabriel was a while, Vivian fell in love with Aiden, he fears her if he finds out she is a loup-garou of the legends, and "someone" is killed by a silver bullet "and there is a kind of happy ending because Vivian finally feels accepted by someone who loves her for who she is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2/10 because the camera shots were relatively decent, and the casting could have been worse, but in terms of direction, why do the lukewarm leap In the air in human form as if they wanted to fly (with their bowed back and tendency to jump from heights), shining briefly and then falling on the ground as wolves? The only aspects of this movie that even looked me, is to the very bad, sorry end, the wolves, the beautiful scenery and the eye-candy boy s. <br /> <br /> Together, I have to say that in order not to enjoy this movie, one has to be ready for misconceptions, strange events that are not always declared, turbulent, and not holding the book not, or the book didn't read.
