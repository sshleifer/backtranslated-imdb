I really enjoy this genre, but The Cell was one of the worst movies I've ever been unhappy to watch. While about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or completely left behind), I was stupid enough to stick it out. The main problem with this story (there was too much to list everything) is that with this type of movie you have to do two things ... one, fear of the killer (that is, they catch him 20 minutes in the movie away) And you have to give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care about whether they come to her in time or not. Not only did I lose the girl, I gave so little insight into her that she was just a vague face and when I remembered that she was part of the story, I didn't really care what happened to her. While the footage was interesting in a LSD flashback, they often didn't feel like it and it should be a lesson that visual arts cannot make up for a lack of a good story. (See Phantom Menace for another example) or wonder how the women kneeled in the field and stared at the air? Ridiculous.
