Sometimes it speaks of a good topical debate. Unfortunately, there are some interesting opinions from the audience. Unfortunately, there is always a desperate sad person who is seeking acceptance that will stop any interesting debate immediately by standing up and the proverbial "Everyone must be together and love one another" As they know, they are guaranteed to get applause and affirmation, since no one will differ. <br /> <br /> Well, they are the same people who tagged this movie so well, why did they do it? Insecurity. Anyway, that's all I will say about that matter. <br /> <br /> The movie, it starts pretty interesting, so you hope it will build, and if I come from you, you have a pair of glasses of wine and a little cheese, then you give you even more chance simply because you can't move. <br /> <br /> But if you are daydreaming, you are wandering, driving your thoughts on other things, why? because the director did too! he took his foot off the gas, and then he realized "ooops" so that he could compensate, he accelerated hard, but then he ran again, and again you do, slow down the story, the plot thin and almost disappear, you wonder even for yourself "What happened again?" As you consider your screen, Nick Nolte will run around with a certain supposed purpose, but you will have long been concerned about what he is doing and he will appear as nothing more than a screen saver in the background of your day dream. /> <br /> Michael Moriarty who plays John Converse has a wonderful ability to speak without moving his lips, or indeed his face, and like a ventriloquist, he must go to the Nicolas Cage school of expressionless face activity went or was attacked by the Phantom Botox injector. <br /> <br /> Tuesday Weld was playing Marge Converse, but instead she played Mia Farrow perfectly. <br /> <br /> In total, there are hundreds of thousands of movies to watch, so leave one to the last, you see I just dared to watch it when I could see or do something else. , learn through my mistake, nights relax is precious boring story, do anything else, bump out the old game Cluedo, practice gurning for the evening or an argument with a loved one, prune your nose hair, get rid of unused files on our laptop, it will be better spent time you should ever choose.
