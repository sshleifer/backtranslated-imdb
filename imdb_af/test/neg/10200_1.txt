I watched Gomeda at the movie in my city. My friend took me away and I was really curious how it would look. Well, I have to say. This movie was not an abomination. Maybe we can say that it is 'FANTASTIC EXPERIMENT' ... Okay, here I go. But there were many shooting, acting, dramatic, theatrical and story telling problems. . I can understand because the director is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film. OK Directing this movie wasn't nice, I see. Unfortunately, due to the restrictions placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the footage is often as dark as the storyline. And there are no powerful gothic scenes. Like a horror movie, it really fails, not scared and it is quite astonished and boring. Some say 'Gomeda' is an art movie, but I couldn't see a laughable, horrible and broken art movie. So how can we say this is an art movie! Just funny!
