If I could give this movie a negative review, I would have liked it. The humor is the cruelest thing I've ever seen in a movie. Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. There are 2 plots that do not support half a movie. Where do the "depth" others see in this movie? That no good deed is unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The movie starts well and the black and white are very friendly and well done. The acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more terrible. If you think the 3 Stooges are too good for each other, if you look at the shelter of a victim with a Bowie knife, it's a real brave sleeper. If you thought "Schindler's List" was hilarious, then this movie is for you.
