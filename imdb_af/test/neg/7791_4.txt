I like Noel Coward, the white. I like Noel Coward, the play writing. I like Noel Coward, the composer and the singer, but I renounce Noel Coward, the actor. <br /> <br /> For me it was a man who stayed firmly behind the scenes, had to write his plays and make his music and make deep and hilarious observations. He should never be allowed in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, he is one of the top outstanding talents of the 20th century, but the man just couldn't act and his voice. With its rolling R's and this is too much round tonal quality. Well, in my opinion, this can easily be cheese. <br /> <br /> This is one of Coward's least favorite offers because he portrays a psychiatrist. Starting with a relationship with a much younger woman, worse by the fact that the much younger woman is an old school friend of his much younger wife. <br /> <br /> Celia Johnson is so happy to look as ever as Coward's wrong wife. It's her performance that saves this movie from folly. I suppose her own flirting in Coward's Brief Encounter qualified her four years earlier for this role as she had to raise a few eyebrows playing such a ravenous woman. This gave her the chance to win some fans back and get some lost sympathy. <br /> <br /> She was such a wonderful actress and you can see why Noel Coward used her so much in many of his productions. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, however, is dead, predictable and on the whole boring to almost ass-clenching level. <br /> <br /> If you want Noel Coward, take the time to look into what we serve, Blythe Spirit of This Happy Breed instead. Three Noel Coward treasures. With wonderful movies like this, I think we can forgive him for this turkey. <br /> <br /> I have purified these four stars for adding Miss. Johnson gave, but generally I would avoid this one like the plague.
