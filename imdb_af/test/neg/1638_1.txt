The credits come from the Sandy Frank stitching that was made to reload this movie in Cave Dwellers. Now that it is clean ... o! Incredible, eye-catching pain. Blade Master runs scandalously on the sword and sorcery train wagon that has been started by the Conan flaps, except that the train never left the car. As such, this Italian movie is a dud trying to snatch a box office dud, with predictable results. However, it will give too little credit to the director and writers, who do not bother to maintain a coherent plot, continuity, any glance at era-accurate continuity. Miles O'Keefe is not a leading man, either now or forever (Tarzan The Ape Man proved it if Ator didn't). Just an unlikeable photo and a chore to watch.
