Well, I remember when the studio fired Schrader and hired Harlin to record this movie. They were right. Dominion: Prequel for the Exorcist is just a bad movie, it's boring, really it is. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to think that the studio puts aside a psychological masterpiece and that anyone in such big words condemns Harlin's version and praised Schraders, even if no one ever saw it. , would have been right. <br /> <br /> But they weren't. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: Schrader has no idea what a horror movie should be, and it shows in a big way. <br /> <br /> Droll, boring, unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and badly supporting throws. <br /> <br /> Save your cash and your nerves, don't see it.
