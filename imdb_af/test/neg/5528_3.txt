... but memorable because it includes an actor I actually admit! James Horan is, according to this kind of movie's standards, Lawrence Olivier. He gave proper performances on things like Highlander and several Star Treks, so it is almost amusing, if he is generously depressed, watch him break down here. Well, yes, there's a plot. Horan's character and his wife fight, he has a relationship with a movie star while trying to do his "masterpiece" film, and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping. But watch Horan is really the only delight that can be found here.
