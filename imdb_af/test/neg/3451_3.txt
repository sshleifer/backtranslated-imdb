I saw it as I think was the second show in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While attending two nights at the same theater for two nights, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast & crew at another Studs promotional screen. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with the movie, I didn't expect a masterpiece, but what was submitted to me, I don't think has all the important elements of the genre in which he settled, remained. Before I continue, two things, I accept that some filmmakers want to suppress generic expectations, this is simply not the case. Secondly, I know it's based on a play (which I didn't read, but I am aware that it is not a glittering piece of literature), but it does not apologize for the massive storyline problems that the film is having. /> <br /> My main problem with the movie is the writing, forgetting that it was based on a play, as a sports comedy that simply doesn't work, the occasional team trying to win a soccer cup, little of the games are shown (when it is, it is very short) and we are not satisfied with any of their sporting achievements. After reading so far, you can assume that it is not a rigorous sports film, but a psychological study of the relationship between a manager and a "hopeless team" of a "charlatan". It certainly doesn't achieve that, I don't even know if it was aimed at it. Any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters has been hijacked and peripheral. Overall, I found that the writing was lacking in many ways. <br /> <br /> I think the performances and music were good and technical, the movie was well made. But apart from the points to be expected at this stage of an Irish movie, I left the theater's feelings very disappointed. <br /> <br /> My judgment seems difficult, but I think there is hope for a strong national Irish cinema in the near future and this simply doesn't back the argument. If Studs became a recommended Dublin Cineworld movie (I was part of the audience at that show), most people don't look with me. That means you should probably make your own judgment of the movie.
