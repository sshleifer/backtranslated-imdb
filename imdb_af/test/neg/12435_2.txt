I've never been a big Larry Clark fan, but somehow I'm dragged almost every one of his movies. Now, I like independent movies, and I grew up in punk rock, and I want to say that this film is disappointing for both audiences. Not every punk song contains "Oi!" Not. In his fever, as they do in this particular movie. <br /> <br /> But the real problem with this movie is that it changes every fifteen minutes or about a mood and lacks any kind of cohesion. Clark made his life pretend that his fictional stories "how children really are," and as such you will allow him ten minutes of scenes of silly dialogue that go nowhere because it's the cinema he is going to. However, when shooting a ludicrous death scene (choose one of them, except for the opening station), the over-styled efforts I take are meant to be black humor, totally out of context, ridiculously shot (in most cases much worse as a student film) and absolutely ridiculous in terms of the story. John Cassavettes and "Date Movie" make bad bedloads as the latter style removes you from any kind of reality to remind you to watch a movie - a very bad one.
