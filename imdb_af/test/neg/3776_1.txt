When I read the other two remarks, I had to wonder if I saw the same movie! <br /> <br /> Perhaps life is drastically different in Australia, but wow, call it sci-fi or fantasy, but people just don't have it I can't do this review without reviewing it myself. It gets better after the first half hour, but I doubt most can make it that far. </ br /> <br /> Yikes.
