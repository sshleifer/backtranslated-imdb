I thought it was an incredibly boring movie! I heard the director could not speak French and therefore he told his actors what they wanted. Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is good as usual but I can't say the same from other actors. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. <br /> <br /> They all look very tired, it's one of the movies: tired of being together, living abroad, of their lives in general; so they sleep half of the movie in a hotel room. After a while, I felt drowsy ... <br /> <br /> I gave 4 because of some very beautiful scenes, including the last one.
