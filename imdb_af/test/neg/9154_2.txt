The MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards was a highly successful bestseller and was probably in more reading groups than any other novel during his circulation. So what happened when the novel became a television for television? Perhaps it is under the mediocre script (oops!, Teleplay!) By John Pielmeier who is consistently given in an awkward pedestrian world, which removes all sense of credibility in the story. Maybe it's the cut and paste direction by Mick Jackson, who misses the pacing and character demarcation. Perhaps this is due to the cinematography of an unknown source or the music tally of Daniel Light. For any of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-movie is alive, as it is a good thing to educate the public about the abilities of those born with Down syndrome. And for that it is attention. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives are changed by their pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky, Norah goes to work and Henry's hurry to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the help of his old friend, nurse Caroline Gill (Emily) Watson). After delivering a perfect son-child (Paul), Norah remains in work and (surprisingly) delivers an unexpected (!) Twin girl. David and Caroline immediately admit that the girl (Phoebe) is a "Mongoloid" (that is before the use of the term Down Syndrome) and David, with a history of losing a sister due to a birth defect) decides to send Phoebe. to an Asylum for the mentally handicapped: Caroline is delivering and Norah is told that the second twin is dead at birth. <br /> <br /> Caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'house' where Phoebe is deposited, shrinks in horror and decides to keep the child. Using a friendly truck, Caroline changes her lonely existence and mothers Phoebe, and gets a new life in her trucker's Pittsburgh. Norah insists on a formal burial for Phoebe - a fact that seriously disturbs the psyche of David, and Henry's life continues with only one child Paul, who leaves the underlying pains about the lack of Phoebe's presence. Norah donates David with a camera (one's life is like a camera, that's where they live - in a moment-captured room) and David becomes obsessed with photography. Norah grunts, drinks, and loses David's attention, while David finds Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford to Jamie Spilchuk) grows, discovers his mother's infidelity and is angry at his father's lack of communication and understanding. He decides to become a musician, and after Juilliard he goes. Meanwhile, Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has fallen into a very highly adapted young girl and the way the broken marriage of Henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe's and Paul's lives, along with the courage that Caroline Gill's struggle has given to win. acceptance into the world for those born with Down syndrome, concludes the film. <br /> <br /> The role players of famous actors are trying hard, but only Emily Watson is able to relive a credible character from this squishy script. Jamie Spilchuk testifies to a young actor with a lot of promise. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to form empathic characters of the wheat lines they are given to deliver. The movie is a mess, but the message about accepting Down Syndrome children and adults is an important one. Grady Harp
