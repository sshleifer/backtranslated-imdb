To watch this movie, keep in mind several words: "sophomoric", "ridiculous", "improbable", "self-indulgent" and finally (and fatally), "boring". Badly directed, poorly photographed and poorly acted, the film is a confusing mess with plot lines (if they can call it) in all directions. Someone may have used a five-year-old finger painting as a template. As a punishment for this childish crime of a movie, this throw of "stars" needs to be healed and sent to their respective beds without dinner. . All in all, George seems to need an excuse to come with his little friends for a paid summer vacation and we are the sugars that pay for it. Bad George! Bad!
