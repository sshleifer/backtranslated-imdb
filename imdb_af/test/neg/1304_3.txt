The digital effects were done on the cheap and the action sequences had no tension. It is mainly made for television and shows it. David Suchet looks bored and Nigel Planner looks straightforward! and as for Robert Carlyle's Dick Van Dyke London accent, no comment! If you want to pass an hour or two if you have nothing, it will. If you are going to buy the DVD, wait a few weeks and pack it in the bargain at Asda, that's where its heading is! If the budget was bigger and followed by Richard Doyle's book, it could have been something special, but as it stands, it's a little poor. Watch the trailer instead! Or read the book and see what could have been.
