I made it half of it, but it wasn't enough of a masochist to see it all. The first half of the movie had no dialogue! Almost everything was about commenting on the story. The screenwriter has forgotten that sometimes less is trying to explain a few millennia of detailed history in the voice. At the same time, he forgot to do any character development. Most science fiction fans do not need much character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the spacecraft destruction have insulted each other. <br /> <br /> There are good things going on in the movie. The soundtrack was well done. Some of the computer-generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.
