What an excellent hostage movie could have been totally devastated by what seems like a bored director ... there were so many directions the movie could have taken ... a vampire slide festival wasn't one of these !!! The last 45 minutes. or so, the film leads an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ... and sex machine ?? ... you sure play! The acting talents of Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are utterly wasted in this inconsiderate film. <br /> <br /> The director ... Robert Rodriguez, famous for his other gory flicks including el mariachi, desperado, once in Mexico, and the very recent sin city ... pay attention to the well-executed first half ... that leads you to believe that you are in an entertaining time ... but then apparently for no reason, and without any provocation the madness starts ... there are even poor attempts at parody and comedy. .. truly engaging !!
