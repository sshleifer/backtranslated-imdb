Atmosphere and droll dialogue do not solve these overlooked classics. Boyer is a French thief hiding in the Casbah of Algiers while police are trying to figure out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls for Lamarr and tries to escape a way. The movie is slow to start and never really goes back and forth. Recalling Casablanca in some respects, it is completely lacking in a larger theme than the wanted man who seduces a good woman. It's all talk-talk talk, with endless scenes from Boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and Boyer shining Lamarr in the shade. Personally, I didn't care for Boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was totally inconsistent. <br /> <br /> Stock 1930's character actors stumble through the coarse plot of Boyer's henchmen - guys clearly not in Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is Boyer's wild-working jealous friend. His womb that fears before her is not good for any future he has with Lamarr. <br /> <br /> Particularly bad is a long line in which one intercourse tells how another henchman has been captured. It sounds exciting ... too bad, we didn't see it for ourselves. The end is completely anticlimactic and seems to be striking, because it's not a happy ending to Hollywood. It doesn't stop it from being juicy.
