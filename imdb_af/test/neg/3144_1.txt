Well, I agree with all the Barney haters on this site. I think Barney and his friends are all ugly and unpleasant and the show is very pilot and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But the thing that I liked most is how Barney offered him, Lesbians and Bisexuals. show when you talk about the same sex parents and relatives. This would not be a problem if the creators of this show did not use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuality. I mean, not all gay men wear mascara and love the purple and pink colors, and not all lesbians are ugly and masculine with a breast falling to their stomachs. As a bisexual woman, I just think it's terrible for a children's program. If it were South Park, I would not mind, because South Park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. Many people who look at Barney are small children or disabled people who usually cannot distinguish fantasy from reality. <br /> <br /> And now I think about it, Barney comes as an ugly gay stereotype himself. Let's see, he doesn't have a girl, he is pink in color and wears clothes with sequins (yes, that's true) on it. If you claim the rights of gay and bisexual individuals, stop making a mockery of those who do not know better. If Barney was black-faced and at the same time ate fried chicken and watermelon, the show would be pulled out of the air before you know it. <br /> <br /> I give this view negative one in five. Don't show your children such hateful shit. There are children's performances out there that are so less abusive.
