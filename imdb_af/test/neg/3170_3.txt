I don't usually think of switching off a movie unless it's VERY bad. Homegrown is a movie I wish I didn't even switch on. The plot is interesting, but the acting and writing are too low. I don't care about the characters. Any movie that has drug use and free nudity as its highlights is unworthy of it. The characters spend their time high and believe me, this is the only way to get through this movie.
