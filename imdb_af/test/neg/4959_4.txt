From the point of view of the budget, 2.5m CAD is not much when you look at the animatronics, puppetry in this movie, which alone is the reason for the 9-week shoot. I was very keen to see this movie and hoped to catch it when it came out, but recently got it on DVD. My biggest problem is that it's not funny at all, it's better than Tenacious D, who doesn't have a funny leg in his body. But it was a really disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Trevor Matthews is a very strong physical artist but sucks his acting! Rachel Skarsten may give one of the most annoying and no funny performances I've ever seen. The only VERY star in this is David Scott whose artwork for the monsters is fantastic! His special elaboration work is the main reason why this movie is worth watching, the Cyclops and Troll loved and and the Prof Monster was straight from the Henson library. <br /> <br /> If you watch it, it won't be the biggest waste of time, but if you want to see it for a big Horror Comedy Skirt ... Don't bother.
