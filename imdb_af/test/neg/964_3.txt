"The Snow Queen" is based on the well-known and very beautiful fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, about a girl, Gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the heads of the Snow Queen. This adaptation seeks to capture that story's sense of adventure and light intricate images through cute sets and production designs, but fail at a number of points. <br /> <br /> Like many Hallmark productions, the potential of the story is completely undermined by heavy-handed essays and directions. The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are hardly pleasant but forgetful; Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen looks the part, but is otherwise overlooked for the role. There is a remarkable lack of dramatic tension on this winding three-hour miniseries. At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of beads that add very little to the original story, especially in the opening hours that introduce the main characters. <br /> <br /> It says, "The Snow Queen" would be about ideal for pre-teens with a taste for fantasy and a little patience. It's a great candy without being scary, and the play is on the kind of pantomime top that spells out the storyline in many, very bold text. Make sure you read their Andersens story too.
