I like watching stiff seagal movies, not because of the big plot holes, but just because it makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> oh this makes me laugh so hard, this movie has no sense at all and is ridiculous compared to this movie Pearl Harbor Rocks !!! and Ben Affleck does not have to have a drama school, just to give an impression of how bad it is. <br /> <br /> First, there are so many khaki and bad acting that it only gets worse than when striving to get out of jail a helicopter land on the first security notice and they led them when they all suddenly fly away <br /> <br /> or when he killed that man in the car and he both walks, you walk away see no oil on the ground behind him Steven notices there is oil without first watching , pull a lighter, and blow the car <br /> <br /> and there are many more goofs. Steven uses his basic action if someone shows a gun on him, he grabs it and shoots him completely bullshit !!! Like a gunman, it will ever happen. <br /> <br /> The play is also much worse at the jail battle scene. Outside where you can see stairs, please wait to get in action, just flush it a few times and you see the bad play <br /> <br /> it just makes me laugh, I hope one day it comes to cinema here in Holland, then I will go as many friends as possible to just kill myself
