Always enjoy the Classic Horror movies, but this movie was really a big waste of time and if it wasn't John Carradine playing the crazy man doctor who can control his experiments. This film was made during World War II and John Carradine was a German Nazi work to find a human weapon against the whole world. Bob Steele plays in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob got bored with his role in this movie and acted like this was his first movie. Mantan Moreland, (Jeff), delivered an excellent performance with great comedy that helped to alert the audience. I hate criticism of a film made in 1943, but it's really a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula during the 1940s, you might just watch John do his best.
