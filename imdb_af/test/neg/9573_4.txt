As I wrote it in November 2005, I became aware that the great British boomerang of theater has come to an end and while people are demanding it, it is not for the British government to give filmmakers tax breaks. I think the cause is much simpler - a lack of producer diversity over the past few years. Let's see what the British produce 1995-2005: <br /> <br /> Funky gangster thrillers. LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a really good and entertaining movie and people went out of their way to monkey Guy Ritchie's style with usually disappointing results <br /> <br /> Romantic comedies. Yes, I realize FOUR WEDDINGS, NOTTING HILL, etc. Made by American studios, they are still vague "British films". Unfortunately, because they are guaranteed to make a profit for the studios, they must follow a winning formula. Hugh Grant usually engages Hugh Grant for the umpteenth <br /> <br /> Black Comedies. Can someone explain what a black comedy actually is? In the British context, it is usually a rattling movie with often contemporary political statements that often look like Mike Leigh's NAKED <br /> <br /> Jasmin Disdar's BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE is a good example of the third kind of British film. Filmed in 1999, but in 1993 it started with two men who fought on a bus and it later revealed that one is Serbian and a Croatian, so we get a little overview of what is in the Balkans happened. The chance of two former enemies in the Balkans bumping into a London bus? This is one of the main mistakes of the movie. Irony takes precedence over probable situations, you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots, but is the outcome likely? Perhaps the biggest irony is the title of the movie. It's called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, but surely this audience has clicked on stereotypical people I couldn't believe as three-dimensional characters.
