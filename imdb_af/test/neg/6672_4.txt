Well done, yes. Very well, I have to say, even though I'm not talking to Chezck. Beautiful cinematography. But the writing is lame, really lame. A predictable soap opera, in which you know exactly what is going to happen. OK, maybe the end isn't that predictable, but is it good? This is one of those movies that you have felt that have been seen and forgotten that day. <br /> <br /> I just got a note from IMDb saying my comment was not long enough. It's really sad, because I don't have an idea of ​​what to say about this movie, which really says much about it, don't you think? The thing is ... It has no soul and no originality. Compare this movie with Barrio, or Riff Raff, shot more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recent shot The Child). It's sad to see that it's a much worse movie.
