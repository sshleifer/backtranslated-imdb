Dr. Shortly after teenager Nicholas' (Robert Adamson) died, Chopper started cutting it, but every cloud has a silver lining. In this case, it appears that his mother owns a log cabin at Lake Tatonka, which itself proclaims 'friendly place for happy people' of which she did not tell him. So Nicholas, along with his friend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) and three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy), go outside for a fun weekend. Unfortunately things don't go according to plan, the cabin seems to be a bit more than a sloping barn and their neighbors seem to be Dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) and his two nurses walking around, killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments ... <br /> <br /> Go straight to video / DVD Dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schoenburn. This movie looks like a hard time here on the IMDb with some pretty hard reviews, while I think Dr. Chopper as a horror movie is pretty worthless, I don't think some of the criticisms I've read are completely justified no. The script that takes itself very seriously is credited to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not ...) who plays a role in the film as detective crocker according to the IMDb cast list, although I can't have any character of that name don't remember Maybe he was one of the policemen at the beginning? Anyway, the basic story is good, I think although it is a bit dull and expensive too long, it's a typical slasher fare with an evil character running to hide our annoying American teenage throw. You now know the drill. Besides a few short and undeveloped nonsense about dr. Chopper using body parts to replenish his own debilitating body, there's not much story here and the writing just seems to find out situations for girls to get rid of their tops. There are the inevitable sex scenes. There is a sequence where some girls have to complete a girl home initiation topless and there are even a few lesbians here too, one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothes. Oh, and if I say topless, I mean they don't wear tops, but they all hold their breasts so you may remember there is no real full frontal nudity in Dr. Don't chopper. So there you have it, it is an average story that has a slightly surprising end to the wastage that is messed up with a poor clich√© stupid character who only exists for some inexpensive scenes and girls to show in bras. To be honest, I expect a bit more from my movies, but maybe I'm just picky. <br /> <br /> Director Schoenburn actually does, it's certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen, although it still looks cheap. There is no style here, I didn't think it was scary and there is no atmosphere either. The gore is retained and restricted to some dead bodies and cut limbs. There is nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects. Dr. Chopper is also one of those films where character decisions and motivation are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's a bit rough around the edges, but is pretty well made about what was probably a very low budget, the bushing lichens are properly isolated, although the police station looks like someone's front room and the two nurses' outfits initially look like stripper outfits. The play is good, it could be better, but I probably saw it worse. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper does indeed have a helicopter-riding doctor, but unfortunately it is not enough to satisfy me, despite the fact that it is a reasonably competent production, lacking a real gore, nudity or " A proper plot it without traces.
