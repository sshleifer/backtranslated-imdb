No idea what this movie is about, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo appeared in it, we decided to see it. Well, it doesn't seem to be the smartest decision. In fact, as another commentary puts in this forum, we felt embarrassed by the actors who participated in this movie. <br /> <br /> Whilst the movie is not terrible, it doesn't make sense at all. The victory by William Baldwin also does not help the situation. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who earned better. The basic problem that seemed to be the movie was a project that started with good intentions in making a small comedy and the people in charge jumped off the road. The result is an uneven film.
