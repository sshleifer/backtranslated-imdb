Like many people in my general age group, I remember seeing this movie as a child in '98 and coming into the theater almost in tears. It was one of the most important, awesome movie experiences of our generation. At one time or another, Armegeddeon has a sounding, action-packed, funny, heartbreaking, and truly inspiring, all-in-one, up to the catchy Aerosmith theme song and a grindy end to end. <br /> <br /> Sweet Jebus. What were we smoking? I watched it on one of the movie channels for the first time in years, and I can't even describe it. It's really one of the worst movies ever made. Where to start? Detract from the abundance of LAUGHABLE scientific errors ('staff trackers' on astronauts? Yes, thank you for that, Billy Bob), I have to say the worst of it was the remarkable one - I even dared to combine it with chopped writing. There are too many examples of this even starting here, but especially in the mind - the scene where Bruce Willis tells the Fed, exactly where to go to each of the cute-charm-mad members of his oil-drilling team ("every bar looks at it in New Orleans', 'the craps tables in Vegas',' the only black man on a motorcycle in Sturgis' ... all in the sense of 'Come along' ... it reminded me a bit of the " NEWS TEAM! ASSEMBLE! "Anchorman's scene, except serious. Ben Affleck proves again that he is by far the most paid actor in Hollywood, with less depth, scope and overall talent than anyone else in the business. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, or anyone else in this imagined piece of yarn was much better. <br /> <br /> (I have to say I got a kick to see a pre-amp Owen Wilson being killed halfway through ... is this the only movie where his character dies?) Peter Stormare is perfect as THE MOST STEREOTIPE UNSHAVEN Russian COSMONAUT YOU HAVE ALSO SCENE. (Peter Stormare apparently has another talent to play on the best Eurotipes.) It was really amusing how, almost immediately after the Americans with the Russian space station (actually called it in the movie), Ben Affleck manages to in one hand let the whole wrist explode in the spectacular Hollywood fashion. I also love the fact that Paris is ultimately the only place on earth to be destroyed, and it seems absolutely nobody cares about it. And above all, it literally gets in points in simultaneous ads for Lockheed Martin and Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am to be an American. <br /> <br /> There are many other things to go over, but I won't be ... enough to say it's a real, really, VERY horrible movie, that I feel shy to ever really love to have. <br /> <br /> I give it two stars just for the mocking factor.
