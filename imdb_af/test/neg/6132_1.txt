Here's a fantastic concept for a movie - a series of meteors clash in a small town and the resulting alien infection is trapped on a deputy single-camera dash camera as the city is slowly being taken over. Leave it on Albert Pyun to screw it up! Don't come within 100 feet of this movie! Holy crap, what a bomb ... it may be Pyun's worst! The crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in it - a whole outbreak tells the POV of a dashcam. When I heard it for a while, I thought the car was breaking into things, people were running and contaminated species breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. It'll be cool right? Instead, we've been driving around in circles all around in a wooded area, which sometimes runs in the three contaminated types that are just standing there. The last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, only sounds are heard. Stay away !!! On a somewhat enlightening note, I think I officially put an end to my Pyun look ... just took me 20 crappy movies to realize I had better things to do.
