Poor Shirley MacLaine tries hard to give a few gravitas to this mawkish, gag-inducing "feel-good" movie, but she is trampled by the run-down sentimentality of a film that is not least in reality. <br /> <br /> Is it directed by Curtis Hanson? Did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him? Hanson can sprinkle effective drama with comedy, as evidenced by "Wonder Boys." So I don't know what happened to him. It is the kind of movie that doesn't want to assume that life is rude and offensive and that neat, neat endings (no matter how indescribable they may be) may make a nice final shot, but if absolutely evil comes as the people around the movie watching is by way of anything remotely like the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> My wife and I made a game to call out the plot points before they occurred - eg. "The old man is going to teach her to read and then to die." Bingo! This is one of those movies where the characters give small speeches that summarize their emotional problems, which makes them wonder why they still have emotional problems when they are aware of what they are causing. Toni Collette (a fine actress, incidentally, and one of my favorites, if not much on it) gives a speech early on why she buys so many shoes and never wears it, movie's uncomfortable connection motive. At that moment I knew what I was for, and the movie was a downward spiral from there. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
