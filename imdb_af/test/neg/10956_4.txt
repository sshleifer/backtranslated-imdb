This is an endearingly bad b-movie. Actually, it's really much better quality than many b-movies. It had a consistent script, decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and I acted worse. The zombies were wonderful, it was clearly Romero zombies, and was really an interesting zombie story. Obviously not Oscar material, and if you're not into zombie movies, or b-movies, you'll probably enjoy it, but if you're, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> The Eastwood Knockoff Western character guy is pretty good, though they never really explain how to heal themselves from shots and zombie bites. But if he has more than a dialogue, where his bad play is really clear. <br /> <br /> It was a good ending, at least I thought so. Romero should be flattered if he ever saw it.
