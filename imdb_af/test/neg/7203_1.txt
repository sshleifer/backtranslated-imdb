I rented this movie under the impression that it was Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest, and thought it was a continuation of the Scarecrow Slayer series (another extremely laughable and all terrific series of movies). However, I was not disappointed. It was just as terrible, if not worse, than I expected. I laughed all through the movie. Every piece of bad acting, poorly shot and cut footage and horrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting. <br /> <br /> The special features include a pathetic view of the six-month filming of the film. <br /> Favorite line, "The sins of my ancestors! They have thrown to this moment!"
