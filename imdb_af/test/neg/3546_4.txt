Matthew Aldrich. This is a reminder name. It is the individual who took fingers on the keyboard and came with one of the worst scripts of all time. Clich√©. Predictable. An insult to the public's intelligence. <br /> <br /> Is he the only beneficiary of debt? Of course not. Renny Harlin took this terrible excuse for a screenplay and made it into a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris actually read it (or not) and prefer to die in it. Debt is abundant. <br /> <br /> These are the Denise Richards of film scripts. There is not enough Razzies in the universe to give proper recognition to how truly horrible this writing is. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, Samuel Jackson's profession is incredibly novel and the way it is presented is highly creative, but at the end of the day, it's all just pruning. Nice cut. <br /> <br /> Pick it up any way you want - garbage dump is still garbage dump.
