It's not a movie. It is a collection of random shots that are taken in a fascinating part of the world, with some random text transmitted. The footage is not that good and the text is not so good either. The end product is impeccably dull. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, where the comment can be turned on, some entertainment value can be given, as the director makes a controversial argument that it is a sci-fi movie. It is also fascinating to read about the exceptional risks and hardships that the crew has endured to collect this material. Too bad it is rubbish. But I think "Making Fata Morgana" would be a fascinating movie, similar to "Ed Wood".
