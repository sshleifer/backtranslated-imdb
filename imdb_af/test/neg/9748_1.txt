It's beyond the shadow of the doubt the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. It's been a long time since I saw it, but the jokes aren't funny, the plot is painful to see, and the main characters are stupid to clear their intelligence ... uggh! I just wanted to punch Tom Arnold and let him cry because he wasted two hours of my life when I finished watching this movie. I don't even know why I ever wanted to see it, but remember if you see this movie: Don't say I didn't warn you. <br /> <br /> PS Tom Arnold's character sings a song in this movie called "I'm My Own Grandpa." Nuff said.
