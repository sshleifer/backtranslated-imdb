"D.O.A." is a non-exciting thriller of directors Rocky Morton and Annabel <br /> <br /> Thank you. The acting is good and the script is pretty bad. This movie also has a few moments that will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence are <br /> <br />. For example, someone is shot near a window. We then see from outside <br /> <br /> the building that looks like that person jumped. I laughed my head when it happened. This movie tries hard but eventually fails. Just look at this movie <br /> <br /> if you have no other choice. <br /> <br /> My Criticism: ** <br /> <br /> Rating: [R] <br /> <br /> Rating Reasons: Violence and Language. * <br /> <br /> * There was no reason why it was.
