I usually loved the Carry on movies, but this one is really awful. There is very little laughter because the whole thing is so forced. There is a lot of talent on the screen and some come better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are good, but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is not tough. Joan Sims looks good, but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hawtrey it is just as sad. Thinking about the sad end of his career, the movie is almost too depressed to watch. The homophobia of the movie is nasty and it is a very unpleasant experience. The set looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series, the movie is very clear in England. The sea side looks cold and there is little attempt to create any illusions here. It looks like a cheap production. You will be amazed at how unhappy you see it, especially if you loved the series.
