PREY <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> A lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) in a remote country living house is ridden apart by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes) who is a carnivorous alien meat, the forefront of a massive invasion ... <br /> <br /> Despite its harmful budget and a leading pacing Norman J. Warren's succession of SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) is much more than the sum of his slender parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex text by Max Cuff (apparently his only writing credit): Faulkner and Annan welcome a obsessive relationship while living in isolated splendor in the English countryside (alternately beautiful and ominous by Derek V. Browne's striking cinematography), although Annan's discovery of blood-stained clothing in an upstairs room marks one or both of these do-it-yourself Love as psychologically disturbed, which can explain the absence of their respective families, some of them always staying in the house at one time or another and having "omitted" under mysterious circumstances. Stokes' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men, and partly because Annan has attracted him, causing tension that causes a climatic storm of violence. There is an extraordinary, multi-level series in which Faulkner tries to "emasculate" their clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing, although Stokes' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery. <br /> <br /> In the early scenes, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is portrayed at least with unusual grace and dignity, but this hearty sapphic link quickly proceeds in crowd-pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude, leading to " an explosion of horror when Annan sprouts her through Stokes to a violent argument with Faulkner. The closing sequences are (literally) gutwrenching, especially Annan's final scene, which was cut for censorship in 1977 and never completely restored. (The remains are still nice, so propose yourself!). Excellent performances by the three leads, enhanced by Warren's inconspicuous direction, taking full advantage of the beautiful bushveld venues, compensating for the film's budget deficits. Originally released in the US as FOREIGN.
