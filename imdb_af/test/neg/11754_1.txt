No matter what other people said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original. If it's on its own, it would be a 2-3 out of 5 movie, but it's a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 movie and so has standards to meet and we need to see if it's the standards reached. If the movie works again or, like in Planet of the Apes, a remake of the original, you could see the movie itself, just to refer the original. Imagine if someone took the model in the 'Mona Lisa' she'd put her in a different way and painted her. You could only get the framework, concept, etc. Compare to the original, but if someone just puts her in the position of the original you have to completely compare it. <br /> <br /> It said that this movie is not just as good as the original, it doesn't look spectacular, as it or not, the original was one of the best movies ever made, the shower table will never be forgotten The remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock, but eventually he and his masterpiece went through. <br /> <br /> The humiliating aspects of this photo were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It has nothing to do with the fact that they performed better or not, it was the fact that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really innocent. Norman did not really understand sex, he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he touched on the beautiful Marion and watched her change, you felt that he was partially fascinated, as he was not really sex and his appeal to she didn't understand. It makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you are his side because he does not fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his "mother". In the remake that is the whole dynamic way, I have to admit that Janet Leigh is not my kind, but she is very attractive and you can see it. Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman's 'her' Marion is incredibly amazing when you add Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbator as she looks at her and gets a Normandie just looking for a naked woman fall, no matter how she looks, but you feel absolutely no sympathy. They further destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting the porn mags in his room. It destroys a character we've come to feel and feel sorry for, it's like making a wonderful life and having the main character pimp, totally humiliating. <br /> <br /> The only other character I had trouble with Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's partner. In the original when Pat Hitchcock says the line "he had seen my wedding ring", it became a reaction of laughter because she absolutely appreciated herself. Rita says it seems plausible, as there is actually no other reason why anyone will thrive with Anne Heche over her. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I am very biased, the original "Psycho" is my favorite movie of all time, if the movie is a rework, with a different angle, then you could add these characters turned their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable. <br /> <br /> Famous, the movie will be too dark and black and white to reduce it. It also made the movie more atmospheric and frightening in its own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be caught in color and it is a sad statement about how films publicize the audience that people have said how landfill was more scary in color. But before people think he can't spell, I remember being from England and playing this color. <br /> <br /> A remake should be the same, made again, it's a fake, a complete copy and a very bad one about it. I can keep comparing, but there is no point, almost everything is better in the original. The only thing better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch calls him The Stiff behind his back) and Mortensen gives a more credible and less equal performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors who love the original. <br /> <br /> Overall a movie to be tagged 'Duration problem in the Failed Experiment. Look only if it is compared to original or if original is unknown. But also see original 'The movie would have received a 3 out of 5 if it was original or a rework, but since it is 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)
