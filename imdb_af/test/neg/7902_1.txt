Wow, it's really stereotypical, terrible waste. I feel sorry for anyone wasting their money to see it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure I didn't even laugh at this movie, I just can't believe they'll make such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I will be more careful now when I look at late-night movies. <br /> <br /> It's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not saying this is the worst movie ever to exist (although it can be), but I don't think I've seen anything so stupid and put my life into life. this makes the Scary Movie series look intelligent. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I will give it a 0 if they leave me
