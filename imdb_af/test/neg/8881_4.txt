then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. I had the first part with the Spanish Inquiry, but the film predicted many years with French ruling Tensions. The movie does little to fill you up on what happened, and I don't remember much about it. So, the movie becomes confusing. The film begins when Ines, the daughter of a rich merchant, is accused by the church, specifically Father Lorenzo, of Judiasm. She was asked the question and forced to confess. Even her family's wealth can't buy her out of jail. Her father forces Lorenzo to draw a confession and says he is the descendant of a chimpanzee, hoping to be released into Ines. All it means is a reason for the church to condemn Lorenzo, who leaves for France. <br /> <br /> The movie thrives for many years, and the French Revolution is in full force. Ines is released from prison. It was a great make-up to make Natalie Portman look. She found her family dead and sought Goya for her help. She told him she had a child in jail. Goya sets up a meeting between her and Lorenzo, who is now with the French and in power. He's the father. Goya sees the daughter and tells Lorenzo who decides it's best to send her to America so no one will find out. But before his plans are executed, the British go with the Spaniards, and Spain recovers power and he is now the sequel. That part isn't being told well in the movie. It's like the movie shows it's happening in a day. <br /> <br /> FINAL THINKING: The movie is good until it runs many years into the investigation, then the movie expects you to understand what is going on. It just became too confusing for me.
