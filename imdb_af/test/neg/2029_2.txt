Well, this movie might have been good if there was a plot for it. the title didn't even fit the first ten minutes. the wind didn't have much to do with the rest of the movie. the play was sublime and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of scary stories. <br /> <br /> as far as horror movies go, it shouldn't even be classified as one. It was a disgrace to horror and thriller fans everywhere. I hate being so hard, but I felt like I wanted the time to watch this movie back. hopefully there will be no follow-up to this. this movie must be locked in a safe and never made available to the public.
