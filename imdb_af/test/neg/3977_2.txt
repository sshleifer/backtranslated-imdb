I've never seen this movie myself, but like many others who have already commented, I've seen it as an episode of MST3K. Really horrible 70s television quake. But someone saw his potential because it just changed into a $ 125 million flop called The Island. <br /> <br /> And for the person who asked if any good movies were made in the 70's, I would remind her that it was a golden era for American movies with directors such as Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese who first come into their own. No less stuff called Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 70's were much more creative than the 21st century was so far.
