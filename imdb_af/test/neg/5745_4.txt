Slayer is a senseless vampire movie with a few twists on an old plot. Special ops team is sent to South America to hunt for blood-bearing native animals. Their leader is a true old man who has matured well. There is an environmental change because the vampire villages attack because their rainforest and the old wild animal diet are disappearing because of the greedy corporations and farmers. Lost of fighting and so much blood just never bothered to wash off the role. They seem to have slept in the bloody clothes and shone on blood. While every member of the cast brought their own talents, it didn't really all click as a movie. The effects were OK, except that the vampires of the buildings hung on wires. If you're looking for a lot of blood and violence, it's for you.
