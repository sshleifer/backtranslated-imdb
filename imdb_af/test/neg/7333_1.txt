A man wonders if his daughter is gay. At a garden shop, he finds a shotgun called "Gaydar". You show it to someone, pull the trigger and it tells you how gay they are. He tried it out, it worked and he went out to find out if his colleague was gay like him. <br /> <br /> Promising idea being destroyed by an unfinished script (after a promising start) and terribly acting. The whole cast works over and basically WRITE their lines to each other constantly. It becomes irritating and really embarrassing after a while. The saving grace is that it is short, there is a playful cat (likes her falling from the kitty bed) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in his short cut. But nothing of this saves the movie. I can't recommend it at all.
