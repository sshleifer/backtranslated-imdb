Hilarious !! I would have sworn Ed Wood wrote it. Awful. I loved every frame. Bad movie aficionado's, this is your trophy! I'll see it again. Words can't explain how entertaining this movie is. Pare's career should be baptized low, but I really think he's in the Leslie Nielson direction. He was perfect for that. Terrible, just awful !! You'll love it! Get some friends, lots of beer, and you'll have the time of your life. It's a MST3000 party waiting to happen. Enjoy !! This is worth the rent! You like the "Colombo-type" policeman and the comic relief writer. The bad guy will make you laugh on the floor. He's also in another Pare movie, Komodo vs Cobra, and he's just as good there. I don't know what the budget was, but they'll get it back because this film is destined to be the best unintentional comedy of the year.
