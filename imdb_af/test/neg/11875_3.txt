Unlike some of the reviews written here, I didn't hate this movie. It's a movie that could have been much better than it was. Not Oscar material, but much better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot had a good hook and had the line. Granted, this movie is badly written. And terribly targeted and manufactured. I mean, how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? Why were we there? What exactly is the point of opening? It seems as if the producer (s) looked American Beauty a few times and thought "I'll use it in action!" I thought the movie wasn't that bad. Wesley Snipes has done a credible job, he just led a bad direction. And as soon as this movie touches the production room, things just got worse. The main actress, I think, had the same problems. Some of the other actors were suspected, yes, but it was a low-budget movie. Again, I would say it's the director's job to pick it up and fix it. <br /> <br /> As a general recommendation, I agree with the first review I read that this movie is not worth seeing. Or maybe it's worth seeing if you're a film student and want to see what NOT to do. <br /> <br /> 3/10, and it gives it praise.
