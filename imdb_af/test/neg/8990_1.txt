This fantasy was utter garbage. I thought Michael Moore was bothering the market for ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. No wonder critics of the British media complain that it is being driven by tabloid journalism. This movie is a left-wing lion's greatest fantasy that comes to life on the big screen. Anyone who is slightly on the right of such canine Bush bashers should be appalled that they have ever received funding. I'm sure it will do well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. It is hard to believe that in these days of insane Muslims who are launching innocent commuters, there is someone in the UK who thinks Britain should surrender in the war on terror. I think it's no longer the country I admired to stand alone against the Nazis nearly 70 years ago. All hail Neville Chamberlain and the pathetic appeasement policy!
