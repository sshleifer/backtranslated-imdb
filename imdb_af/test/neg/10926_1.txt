One of the commentators on the subject of Lil 'Pimp (Glen Cove's dbborroughs) did so when he / she stated that the movie was really bad, but I take an exception when commenting on the animation. <br /> <br /> The animation wasn't bad because of Macromedia Flash. It was bad animation because it was wrong. Flash is just a tool. In the right hands, an artist can make animation as full and fluid as any Disney movie and in the wrong hands it may look like bad things on the internet, where Lil Pimp originated and has to stay there. . <br /> <br /> Studios such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros. create great animation using Flash (ie Puffy Ami Yumi, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Mucha Lucha, etc.). </ br /> <br /> Lil 'Pimp was a poorly-conceived piece that was bought because Revolution Studios Studios Media Tripp was bought and Lil' Pimp was one of the properties included. Roth and the company thought they wanted to make a quick buck that exploited a tig like Lil 'Pimp, and the sham was continued by his producer, Amy Pell. The reason for this third trimester abortion of an animated film is that none of Revolution Studios' executives had the pragmatic brain to overtake Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap (they really tried their best, but they were right over their heads) and hire real writers, directors and at least a semi-competent producer. They did one thing correctly, but they hired some of the best storyboard players, designers and animators in LA, but as Lil Pimp points out, one can buy the best sports car on the floor, but if you're a moron, you'll wreck it for sure.
