There are good bad movies and bad-bad movies and nice bad movies ... it's not one of them. It's a movie that doesn't realize how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw it at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles on November 14, 2006 as part of the "Grindhouse Cinema" this theater sets up every month. Hopefully Eric Caiden & co. will think twice before author / director Lawrenece Foldes leaves anywhere near them. What a con man. The man got up to speak in front of the movie - you would think he was Orson Welles talking about "Touch of Evil" or another lost classic. Rare. He's nice to take 20 minutes of the audience's time with his incoherent acceleration. <br /> <br /> "Young Warriors" is described as a cross between "Animal House" and "Death Wish", but if you are expecting something in the direction of imitations such as "Revenge of the Nerds" or "The Exterminator "You will be in a sad disappointment. The writing makes sense. The direction is so poor that the actors are embarrassing and what can you say if the best thing about the movie is a car? <br /> <br /> Poor Richard "steals" Roundtree. In this movie he plays a different character with the first name of "John", but it is about the only similarity to his character here with the aforementioned classic. I hope this movie has allowed him to pay the rent for another month. Other actors who seem to want them to be anywhere else include Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George. <br /> <br /> It's a total waste of time. Even the audience doesn't look like that (except for the one spazz boy sitting in the back who shouted "whoa every five minutes" and his girlfriend giggling with a lobotomized talk every time he opened his mouth) . <br /> <br /> For real movies about vigilantes, I suggest the following: <br /> <br /> Death Wish I, II, III, Exterminator I, Vigilante Force, 45, Rolling Thunder, the No-Mercy Man (the last two a few years ago, a few films presented at this theater - probably the same budget as "Young Warriors", but both were a million times better!)
