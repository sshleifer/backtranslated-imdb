This past night I watched for the first time in 40 years. It's bad. Really bad. But it has enough hilariously awful moments, that it is worth looking at. In the first place, was it deliberately to make the boy baby kit quite small? He even says to Costello a la Mae West "you fascinate me!" as Costello takes a double. God only knows what would have happened if the baby sitter were hungry. This child would have seduced him in a heartbeat! Then there is the main male dancer. He is completely improper. Stir with laughter as he jumped and moved with no talent whatsoever over the giant's grave, while he never looked better in his life. The two romantic leads are zeros, waste. Abbott gets one line to sing and has been named by another singer. Geez, I think he can't even carry a song! Costello manages to be charming in his I Fear Nothing number, and I think very little children will love it, but there is not much to recommend. But oh that seductive, slight boy! That aspect only blew me away! Plus the fact that the family has accepted anyone from the street without a child being referred to childcare! Today a small child will be taken away from them!
