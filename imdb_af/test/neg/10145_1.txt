Although it will be easy and accurate to go into why "Reba" at heart indicates many "family-oriented sitcoms" in the way it differs from other better sitcoms, the true truth is that the show is repetitive, full of stereotypes of more beautiful and more pioneering shows, and the main star is completely out of her element. While I'm sure, Mrs. McIntire sings and shoots and sings a fan base that supports it, and the next Lucille Ball is far from reality. <br /> <br /> Reba herself has no presence here to determine that she is thrown as the offender whose entire family is centered. But after a few episodes, there is no real connection with the character. I can care less about her adventures, because her whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no screen presence, and to make a show around her looks very short and indicates most 'family-oriented' programming: a sit-down full of men-stupid / women-doing-all stereotypes that no one but not those who can't afford cable. <br /> <br /> The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that it has at least better production values ​​than your standard PAX ripoff .... only.
