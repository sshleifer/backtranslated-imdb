What movie is it ??? A horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity already reached by the "Bhatt Camp". The film starr EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. The movie has 'No Base'. It's just like this ... Dino and Udita are married and live in a rich mansion. However, Dino doesn't like Udita as he just wants her wealth. He loves someone else (Tara Sharma). So he bumped Emrana to have a relationship with Udita so he could catch them and eventually split it with Udita. How BORN! However, embryo falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Lastly, when Udita gets a prison sentence to kill Emran, Dino is trying to save her who shows her false love to her. Udita on the other hand does not understand it and feels that he really loved her. So she lends all her wealth to Dino. At last Dino comes from the police station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What a fraud! The songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie. Now the individual ratings: (From 5) Emran: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 Overall acting: * 1/2 Direction: * * Story: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final rating: * 1/2 Poor performances and poor casting ....... Music: Good ... I rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Don't waste your time!)
