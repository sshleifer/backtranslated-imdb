I found it difficult to worry about these characters, who were either annoying or indifferent, all living their fabulous hilariously urban lives. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was sometimes excited and at other times the story was difficult to follow - Was it me or was all scenes removed? <br /> <br /> It felt like a poor sitcom had somehow changed into a movie. The stereotypes and jokes about "men's groups" might have been funny in the early 90s. As it is, it's where much of the movie's humor comes from - and boy, quickly becomes fast. <br /> <br /> Apart from the handsome Irish man, this movie was a dud. And not even in such a "bad way". The last 20 minutes were particularly painful. Maybe if you've never met gay people or never thought about homosexuality, then this movie might say something meaningful. Otherwise, dearest, you'll be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing.
