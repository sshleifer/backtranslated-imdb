... But it certainly only earns 4/10 stars and no more. A moronic stupid boy's father is a fighter pilot shot by some Arab countries. They never call the country in the movie, it is really ridiculous, they only refer vaguely to an Arab nation. This movie is so ignorant. But Lamar of revenge from the north is here, he is friends with the main character Doug Meesters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives on an air force base, his father is an air force pilot, but he fails to get into the air force academy, grasping a plot (with the help of his delayed friends) to get two jets. steal and go save his father. Yes, exactly - this is one of the biggest movies ever made !!! Louis Gossett Jr. is fantastic in his role. You can say he basically wanted to shoot the hell out of Doug Masters the whole movie. Well anyway, you can probably guess how the plot ends, I can't believe they made 3 wallpapers for this movie.
