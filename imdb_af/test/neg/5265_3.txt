"Usually decent crime" is sad because it obviously tries to be successful and of course it doesn't have a chance in hell to apparently be due to the absence of a clear sense of purpose. An improper drop in drop. Irish comedy with Spacey as a thief who fails the police and his competition in his own mind becomes a kind of folklore. It seems to be difficult to be funny, slightly less than boring when it is interesting to be interesting, and forget sentimental or offensive or engaging, although it also takes shots on those features. "Straightforward Straight Criminals" has a clumsy script, na√Øve direction, travel performance, thin story, poorly-casting, mediocre play, and eventually get lost in themselves and sink into an ant of hopeless mediocrity. Pass on this one. (D)
