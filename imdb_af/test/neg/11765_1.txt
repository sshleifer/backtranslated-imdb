This movie is essentially a "how-to" about how to be a well-connected pedophile. I am surprised that so many people - especially other gay men - have seen this movie and have read the book and no one has brought the fact that if Weber was not an influential photographer, he would be child abuse. Poor Peter Johnson. Weber found this poor, naive (though incredibly attractive) teenager he found at a high school warrior training camp in the Middle East, to live in his home and take thousands of homosexual pictures of him, many of them full frontal nudes all by Johnson's teens. It's not art. This is child abuse. And what's worse, Weber made a lot of money for it, and poor Johnson is going to have serious problems for the rest of his life. Weber's cowardly love of the boy is completely stupid, as are his concerns about well-known (and not so well-known) people he knows, trying to complete Johnson's "education". Creepy, and then just boring. The only redeeming thing I can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self-deception. But I can't help but wonder why nobody ever considered the effect of "Chop Suey" (Weber's nickname for Johnson) himself.
