SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> This movie will spoil your afternoon or "wee little hour of the morning" viewing spot. <br /> <br /> I like Marc Singer. He portrayed good characters in the roles I saw. To this movie. <br /> <br /> What starts out as a promising movie soon disappears with the disastrous cgi'd background and the closest to the person who dies ... <br /> <br /> Then it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. <br /> <br /> To describe it as hammy acting, piglets will insult. This movie goes to the bottom of the hammock and scraps the scene from there. <br /> <br /> In addition to Marc Singer's over-cooked hammock, Mike Dopud and plods bump into the landscape and see if he is afraid he may fall on the rocks and his wide-eyed 'manic' bad guy just lets him looks moron. He is not threatened at all. <br /> <br /> George Stults looks like a deer caught in the headlights. He claims he was threatened by the other two, but his character would be threatened by a cashier who offered him "paper or plastic". <br /> <br /> It's really a vehicle for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman who gets her. live back, despite the wrong kind of man ... She was unbeatable. <br /> <br /> It's not a remake, but it's remarkable like "Cliffhanger" - seasoned guide, losing someone in the fall, conscience stubborn to help someone else, a missing treasure that bothered It is worth earning money and a gang that does not use the guide. Except Cliffhanger was a good vehicle for Stallone and Lithgow. I must admit, Lithgow stole the show. <br /> <br /> Even the unintentional comedy was poor. There were times when I wasn't sure if they had used a rubber-face model as a built-in singer, because he tried in vain to storm the weather station. Pushing his face to the doorpost and his clumsy way in general, did nothing to help his character. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something else more constructive like watching paint dry or grass growing. Or close your eyes and examine the back of your eyelids for 90 minutes ...
