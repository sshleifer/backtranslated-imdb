It must be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the Sci-Fi channel. Here's how the movie starts. Women are the only people on this planet due to the fact that in the not-distant future chemical warfare A is OK as long as it targets only soldiers (If you're wondering, men). But the virus fires back (great shock) and all the men on earth are slowly dying. Then all males are condemned to die when the mrs. President shot by a man and killed. Now we are about 60 to 70 years old. Two female scientists are working on the cloning of a female baby and one of them says "Hey, why don't we bring men back?" The other one says no, the world is not ready for it, but immediately ignores her and so a man goes the Eath again. <br /> <br /> First, this movie shows that all men who are not genetically altered are blood thirsty. Secondly, the author forgets to mention that contemporary soldiers are a good mix of male and female officials, so there is no real reason to have such a virus. This is the biggest time you can find. This movie has not only hampered my mind by the bad story, but by the lifetime style that has acted. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 out of 10, but just because I can't go lower.
