Call me old-fashioned, but I like movies with plots. I thought "stoner comedy" was just a way to describe more specifically a comedy in which many weeds were smoked and the people who saw it were more likely to enjoy it. "Grandma's son," however, decided it was a full-scale niche and that stoners represented a piece of the comedy cake that had to be reached. Apparently, Allen Covert (star and producer) and the Happy Madison gang were right, but it didn't make "Grandma's Son" less boring. They may be completely stoned, but the characters are mostly half-baked. <br /> <br /> Alex (Covert, a long-standing support player for Adam Sandler, first-time star) is a professional 30-year-old professional video game player whose roommate got them. He could look for a new apartment, but we didn't have a movie. After trying some friends, he ended up with good old grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of "Everybody Loves Raymond"). She wakes him up for 6 hours and lets him go and soon he'll fall asleep and so the new video game sequel might not be done on deadline. <br /> <br /> Like most people, Alex deals with his frustration and bored boredom by playing either video games or becoming tall or both. His friends / associates all do the same thing. Most of them are virgins who live at home, except to love video games. They are all uncomfortable and everyone, with the exception of Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (just at times), their characters are not funny. Funny when you're blown ... sure, I suppose, but I can't tell from experience. Perhaps everything we lose is high, playing video games and stimulating women with specific problems. attention to their breasts, but it should not be the driving force of a whole movie. Also, old women should not accidentally get high (see the one coming) or the chosen sex jokes - but that's what happens if a movie isn't about anything. No conflict takes place until the last 20 minutes out of the little trouble of being out of the pot, but Alex tries to get the hot girl (Linda Cardellini) and scrambling the guys to complete their levels for the game period. <Br /> <br /> Characters can be the saving grace for this winding stoner movie, but apart from a beloved Doris Roberts, the aforementioned Swardson as the virgin friend living with his parents and calling them roommate and Joel Moore to make robot sounds. , there is little character ingenuity. Covert is a starring character without comic dimensions, his dealer friend Dante is an inactive actor and wasting time and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon have been written in the periphery so far. It does not matter. br /> <br /> If you like movies about nothing and look at it in a state of mind and body that improves that stuff, Granny's son will probably just be what you're looking for. Those who need a little more talent to board a comedy will remain untouched. Most of what I can say to Grandma's son is that it is unimaginable despite its futility. It won't feel like a total waste of time, but you'll wish you did drugs so you could use at least most of the hour and a half. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> Visit my website at www.moviemusereviews.com
