Okay, awarded, I'm a fan of low-budget horror, who comes with it occasionally a piece of garbage that even the most stubborn fan of campy flicks can't uncover to give evidence ... TRENDS 6, targeted by DEMONICUS's Jay Woelfel. <br /> <br /> First, the TRANCERS series, which began in the mid-80's by Charlie Band and its Empire Pictures, is basically the franchise it is due to Tim Thomerson and his excellent portrayal. by Trancer hunter Jack Deth. Well, low and low, due to the sinking budgets of Full Moon features (which, despite what people have said, actually brought very high quality features such as HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thomerson did not return for the sixth installment . <br /> <br /> Full Moon writer Courtney Joyner returns and delivers another below-average script containing Jack Deth (played by Thomerson ... in flashbacks, which is extremely poorly inserted ... he has a different hair style every time he is shown, and some shemp on a table goes into the line of his daughter's body. Well, from here you have 'Jo Deth' acting like Jack ... but it's a pity she didn't really give the same screen presence as Jack Deth did. <br /> <br /> The film, shot at 16mm, is simply put, an embarrassment to the TRANCERS name ... not to anyone at Young Wolf Productions. I mean, I respect you guys to actually jump out and do a TRANCERS movie without Tim, but with a little more time (despite being filmed since December 2001), it could have been better. <br /> <br /> Watch Full Moon's DVD of it, which is a dual feature of the original TRANCERS, and features trailers for the last 10 plus Full Moon features. Overall, I would probably have the feature more if it didn't have the name of the TRANCERS, but like anything, you can judge it by someone's opinion and you should investigate it yourself!
