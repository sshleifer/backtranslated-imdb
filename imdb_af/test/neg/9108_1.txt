It's so bad, it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I go to. From the start it is clear that Steve Gutenburg has taken this role seriously. The other principles went through their lines. I think they've gotten a bit of how much it has set on fire early and they have been going through the motions for their salary bills. Sean Bean responded as usual, but was spared to share space on the screen with any of the principles of the final scene where it was like a high school actor, how to describe the contrast. Some actors don't look good. Some actors should not make up for a portion bulk. The two statements apply to "Police Academy" Steve. His spectacular display translates bosom and indigent and his build-up makes him look like potato lumpy, not buff. Connect it to one of the worst written dialogues in Hollywood history and you have a BAD movie. I can only guess that all the principles really need the money for redevelopment, or something or their agents have signed them before the writing is written by the monkeys that have to print it out. I would like to know the background of this disaster.
