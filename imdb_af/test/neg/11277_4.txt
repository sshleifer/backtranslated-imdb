A former IMDb judge said 'Rafter Romance' is a 'rip-off' (that is the other reviewer's term) of a German musician called 'Me By Day, You By Night'. Apparently, the reviewer is unaware that * both * of these films borrowed their point of departure from 'Box and Cox', an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This play deals with two artisans who share the same room of an unscrupulous innkeeper. rent, everyone believes himself the only tenant. Because the two men have different work schedules, the ruse is not immediately discovered. This play was once so popular in Britain that 'Box and Cox' has become a common term for an arrangement in which two people voluntarily share shared accommodation for only one person. <br /> <br /> The innovation of Rafter Romance (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman who inevitably develop a romance. As usual in these cornball movies, the guy and the gall fall to each other until they fall into each other's arms. Hi boy. <br /> <br /> The landlord in this movie is played by George Sidney, a character player who specialized in playing Jewish stereotypes designed to be sympathetic. George Sidney has never been as annoying as Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit), but Sidney's portrayals of Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The most notable thing about 'Rafter Romance' is that, to my knowledge, it is the earliest Hollywood movie that refers to Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At one point in this movie, Mr Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers his teenager, Julius, who was involved in walls on beads swastikas. Eckbaum and his son are clearly meant to be Jewish. True, nobody in Hollywood in 1933 had a real idea of ​​what Hitler wanted in Europe to plan for the Jews. It's surprising to see a movie depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks swastikas are joking. His father is very angry at this performance of the Nazi symbol. <br /> <br /> A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all the major Hollywood studios are still doing business with the Third Reich as late as 1939. Hollywood's premier ladies are medically documented as "Aryan" 'so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood's premier men are documented as "Aryan and uncircumcised". Except for Darryl Zanuck at the twentieth century Fox, all CEOs of Hollywood studios working in this policy were Jewish ... but clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler. I am surprised that 'Rafter Romance' contains a scene that depicts swastikas unfavorably, as this series would deliver the film Battalions in Germany and Austria. (Perhaps the scene has been cut out for the German release: it is not essential for the movie's plot.) In addition, the movie does not contain anything striking. Robert Benchley does his usual, unfunny populated characterization: I never understood this man's appeal. I will rate Rafter Romance 4 out of 10.
