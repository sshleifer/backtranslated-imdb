It is absolutely nothing like the WWF and the WWF Attitude Era. I have always been a dedicated WWF fan and never had a look at his competition. Now I get the day I wanted WWF to take control. In any case, the WCW will be trying new and radically all the time instead of stopping as a mask of the real intentions of the show, and that also applies to ECW. The WWF has always been about Hulk Hogan, Andr√© The Giant, and other old wrestlers like this, and the 'Attitude Era' just happened with the radical ideas of the competition. The WWE is the same trash as it was before the Attitude era just immersed and demoralized. The wrestlers are horrible, the brand distribution is mindful, and the story lines and terms do not exist. The WWE is so bad that it ceases to be even a former shell of itself by suddenly pushing characters and wrestlers in the main event and retaining creativity channels. Certainly, the show shakes the brain of sweet, innocent and easily brain-spoken children and slim, mean, pariah, stupid people of the internet wrestling community that the company actually sees well. Anyone who even shakes and rests on the idea that this show and product is good can go straight to hell.
