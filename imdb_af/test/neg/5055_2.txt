I heard this movie is bad? They even warned me that it was terrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I still watched it come on national television. Watch Kevin Williamson movies mean torture! His scenarios are not funny, certainly not scary and not least creative. Teach Mrs. Tingle breathes the same annoying atmosphere as his brainless series "Dawson's Creek" and is probably also the same target group. Before the credits even started, 5 people wanted to hug, and they said an unfortunate "I love you" sentence. It doesn't get any better because the soundtrack is full of annoying pop / rock and the storyline is ultra-thin. Three students who are about to attend the graduation ceremony are being deceived by the evil teacher in the school. Every high school has such a teacher, you know ?? In order to save their skin, they tried to get married. Tingle convinced that it was not their intention to cheat, but this effort is going to be very wrong. The typical high school humor is completely lost on me, the overdose of sentiment is pathetic and the acting (with the exception of Helen Mirren) is horrible. I'm sure Katie Holmes can act? This is a fact proven by her role in the gift? but she must urgently stop accepting fresh girl roles. As mentioned before, the only positive comment goes to Helen Mirren's brilliant decisive play. It's like Kathleen Turner in 'Serial Mom'! The roll suits her perfectly and you can't think anyone else is playing her. Other than that, it is avoidable teen nonsense.
