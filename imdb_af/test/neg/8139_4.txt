Throwing and crewing this cheap horror pot boiler is more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself; We have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of camera and writer-director Curt Siodmak, filmmaker Charles Van Enger, editorial supervisor Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind Dit. The bad Payton turns the head of virtually every male. She comes deep into the African jungle in contact with her husband, Cavanaugh's plantation. Doctor Conway longed for her secret while the forehand Burr's approach was literally more hands-on. On the other hand, Chaney is (surprisingly) the relaxed, yet knowing authoritarian figure and Strode is a native police officer. The plot is very simple but frankly doesn't make much sense: after a particularly turbulent thunderstorm dinner, Burr and Cavanaugh (life after life later) come to the garden for their love for Payton and, conveniently for Burr, there's just a big snake close to where Cavanaugh hits the ground! Due to the event behind the bushes, Payton's enigmatic girl (a native witch, no less), for an inexplicable reason, a curse on Burr (who is now loyal to Payton) curses him regularly. a gorilla changes from its very wedding day (when its hand is briefly hirsute)! As a result, Burr takes himself into the jungle for days? even though the apostasy itself is scarce in the film. It should be said, however, that the version I watched ran for only 56 minutes if the "official" length was given elsewhere than 66, 70 or 76 !! That's why the movie feels mentally hurried and untouched if it's never less than pleasant, as it results in the gorilla's suppression of Payton in the jungle. The former army is being pursued by Chaney and Conway himself. To return to the movie's tragic blonde leading lady for a moment: after a promising start in movies next to such Hollywood legends such as James Cagney and Gary Cooper ?? in, respectively, KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS (both 1950) ?? Her career soon turned into B (and lesser) territory thanks to her own 'colorful' off-screen antics: her most notorious offense was the cause of a well-known bar-room noise between divorcee Franchot Tone and brutish former lover, Tom Neal, who ended up with the coma in a coma and left Payton for the latter shortly afterwards !! But it was not all: Nymphomaniac Payton also praised Woody as being in her convictions (a controversial issue at that time); short-lived man Tone, who caught Payton's infidelity on camera, spread the damning photographic evidence around Hollywood and it almost meant ending her days as a star? Her last movie show is Edgar G. Ulmer's MURDER IS MY BEAT (1955) which I have in my "Unwatched Movies" stack. The last twelve years of her turbulent life has been spent on Skid Row in the rush of liquor, drugs, prostitution, abuse, arrests and even stabbing? before she finally died in 1967 in her parents' home at the age of 39!
