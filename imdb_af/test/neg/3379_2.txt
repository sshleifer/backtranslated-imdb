This episode had potential. The basic premise of a woman staying next door to an empty apartment (but a constantly lazy phone) is somewhat interesting. And when she investigates the noise, there is real tension and fear. But silly writing ruins any promise the episode has. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the woman easily recognizes things that most of us would send in the other direction (eg "It is funny that the door has shut down although there is no wind "This door has serious damage to what was not a minute ago here." "The door itself opened without touching it", etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, would she not take precautions before entering? Perhaps she could investigate the day time. Or maybe she can investigate the apartment with someone else. Or maybe she can turn on the lights! Also, while living in the haunted house, she decides to make numerous calls to the operator and gets an argument about who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then discusses the details of the suicide. ONLY THE PHONE! The telephone company doesn't have to be involved. Walk to the phone and unplug it. Case closed. <br /> <br /> Finally, showing the phone on the floor as it was, was just comical. If the director wanted the woman to be wriggled through the calling card, he could have done it in a way that didn't look cartoon. Brave Little Toaster Someone?
