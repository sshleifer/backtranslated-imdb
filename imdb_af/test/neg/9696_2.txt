I will get rid of the obvious overview of factual inaccuracies. They are too much to mention. A much shorter list would be what they did. 1. Dude called Noah. 2. Ark with animals on it. <br /> <br /> If you want a much more accurate depiction of Noah's Ark and the destruction of Sodom, hire "The Bible" (1966). It depicts the creation story by trying to sacrifice Abraham his son Isaac. It's a much better movie, and it may be that the abomination, called "Noah's Ark" (1999), drove you to search for such a movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I really couldn't watch the whole movie. From reading other comments, I can see that even the atheists found it very inaccurate. As a Christian, it was unbearable to me. Perhaps the worst movie ever made. No real point for this movie, except perhaps to display their sub-par computer animation. <br /> <br /> Was it a complete waste? Maybe not. God can use evil to work well. <br /> <br /> Rooms. 8:28 says, [28] And we know that all things work well for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose. <br /> <br /> Genesis 50 says: [20] But you have thought evil against me; but God meant it well to reach as it is today, to save many people alive. <br /> <br /> In the second example, Joseph's brothers intended to kill him, but God turned their evil into a very good good. He might have done the same thing with this movie. <br /> <br /> People were so surprised at the lack of Biblical foundations that they probably broke out the dusty old Bible and read the story for themselves. To find out about Lot and Sodom, they must go completely to Genesis 19 before God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. By that time they had read almost half of Genesis, so they might want to end. The next book is Exodus, on which the film "The Ten Commandments" was based (and much more accurate). If they saw that movie, Exodus is an easy read. So now they have read at least two whole books of the Bible, just because they watched a pathetic movie about Noah's Ark. I'm sure it happened to someone there. <br /> <br /> God works in mysterious ways. .
