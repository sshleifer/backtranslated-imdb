Lame B horror who seriously condemns herself to discuss his subject relates to an aging old lady who changed at night by a lodge who rented a room from her. When the housekeeper is killed, Mommy has to leave alone, and it causes some family tension and also attention from the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that this film had brought DIE FUNNY. It failed to do that, although it had some soft gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the B movie crowd happy. I've seen worse, but I won't give this one a rest - 4.5 / 10.
