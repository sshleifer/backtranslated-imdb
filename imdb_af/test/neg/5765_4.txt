It is an embarrassment for the repetition of the same plot in the nine bunch of idiots-young-adult-in-danger-because-they-are-idiotic slasher movie of the early millennium: this time we get the story of " a crazy miner coming back from the dead to recover his gold from the hands of the usurpers. We have almost no excitement, almost no bare flesh (even though the girls are very hot, only one of them will show her bare ass for a few seconds), the usual cluster of sunset boulevard horror stars in cameo roles (this Turn off Karen Black, Richard Lynch, John Philip Law, Jeff Conaway), lots of fake blood, just the crazy miner that is raised as a zombie, is cool enough to hold you - not exactly - to the screen until at the end. Don't waste your time if you're not a complete one.
