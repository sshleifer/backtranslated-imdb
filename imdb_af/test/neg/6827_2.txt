I couldn't believe how terrible and boring this Hollywood remake was. It's so scary. It easily places a place in my top 10 worst movies of 1998. About the only thing that matters is Bruce Willis, who has to hold action movies, as a completely emotional killer who kills his own mother for the right price. But if I rather listen to Robbie Coltraine, I speak American for a week, but listen to Richard Gere's nicer Irish accent. But this film is also indisputable, unconvincing, uneven, unspeakable, inexorable, and landed Sidney Poiter in a garbage roll to return a possible career. One for film roll-footie purposes altogether.
