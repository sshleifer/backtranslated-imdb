This movie is such an incredible crap. First let me talk about the benefits: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story, which is almost very bad. We said computer programmer Angela Bennett (whose online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY! I bet the directors incited one for an hour) who basically check out other company's software for glitches. So we start with her ordering of pizza on the internet and then put a fireplace on her screen (EXTREME computer skills shown so far). This is after finding some viruses on a Macintosh application that crashes the entire system after the escape key is hit. This is apparently a big problem, but the virus created to do so can be done in about a minute with a simple bundle file. <br /> <br /> Any event, we continue. She gets this call from another block (working at the same company) and saying this fool to go click on this symbol that apparently opens a secret internet port for a lot of unprotected 'top secret' data woohoo! Angela saves this shit on a disk and now the people who created this gap are out to get her. Of course, this is only after she has just caught up with one of the bad guys before trying to kill her before she jumps out of the boat. BEFORE she winds up in a random hospital. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: You can't create a gap on the internet to access a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where does hell come from? Since then, a group of hackers can control the basic flow of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem # 2: Angela will need proper identification before a hospital or clinic will release her. She can't just pack her and go. <br /> <br /> Then these "hackers" or whatever Angela's ID changes so they can't get anyone, and all the facilities are enough. All her IDs are gone. So she came home and a cat and mouse hunt went on and on and on. <br /> <br /> Apparently, all police and FBI people are foolish and don't believe her. So then she has to use a lot of tactics to enter the building where she works (where the person she is completing) and return to her old computer. She starts talking to another random look and finds out who there is a little BS IP address the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe. <br /> <br /> Then she walks to a center to post all this information to the FBI. She apparently needed a main frame to send things to the FBI. But then, the same fool who tried to kill her before throwing her into the water, caught her in the FBI. But remember that cool virus? Well, somehow, she gets it and although the virus only worked on software, it now works on the whole system as well. It brings down the whole main frame containing all the false information because the main frame has just been put in the middle of a convention ... WHAT THE WHOLE IS THIS CRAFT! Anyway, the now-uber virus works and Angela (the real one now) goes away and later kills the evil man with a fire extinguisher. Of course he has a gun, runs to her so he is like 2 feet away and then decides to strive. CLASSIC Hollywood. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone who doesn't know much about computers will be very deceived to think that this crap is possible, but not one thing is accurate about computers or the net. And I honestly doubt I see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (* cough LMAO *).
