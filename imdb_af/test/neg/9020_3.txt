Oh, there are much worse Wayne movies. This movie is badly edited, but it has a camping element that makes it enjoyable. The villain is an Anglo actor who sports sporty Mexican sports and an exaggerated Mexican accent that is hilarious. The girl is dressed like a Jean Harlow wannabe, it is 1934. At least the location shoots are beautiful and pleasant. <br /> <br /> Watch it and laugh. Don't expect a serious western, but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting, but sometimes a flash of camp humor. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and handsome and he sees his acting ability years after this unhappy business.
