When I first saw this DVD for three dollars in a bargain, I really couldn't believe my luck: a Christmas movie with Tori Spelling, William Shatner and Gary Coleman ??? Needless to say, I immediately found it and considered it an investment. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was just as bad as any movie you would expect to combine Christmas and the three "celebrities" mentioned. The dialogue was void, the characters were one dimensional, and Carol's character bow was totally incredible. The movie itself was a lifeless piece of boredom that refused to end and made me feel like a person used when the end finally came. <br /> <br /> My advice: Don't see this movie unless you have to and then only under the influence of some serious holiday trips.
