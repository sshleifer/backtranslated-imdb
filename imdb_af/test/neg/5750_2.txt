Well, now all the directors / production companies' friends and relationships have posted their shill reviews after seeing it at various festivals, it's time to show that the reviews were written by people who actually paid $ 10 to see it . <br /> <Like the director's "Dear Jesse" (the only other one of his films I saw), "Loggerheads" suffer from a lack of focus and too many ideas packed into an indie budget . I swear, this guy might have better luck with miniseries. I have been waiting for the different plot wires to come together, but they only intercepted on points that were blatantly advanced in a way that is obvious to anyone other than the most dense viewer. It was like watching a season of Life-made-for-TV movies in one of the old, Carol Burnett shows, in one long. Perhaps an enterprising male prosecutor can take his girlfriend to see it and then exclaim "Hey ... remember all the chick flames we went to last year ... the one about the adoptive mother ... the one about the gay man. The one about the Christian housewife. We went to THREE Chick last year. Flicks went, so now we need to see Terminator 4! "I think you should do anything to throw a well-known actor to get funding, but what is Bonnie Hunt doing in this movie? She is not exactly known as a dramatic actress, and this attempt at "performance" will not come to mind. Send Oscar to her door. I mean (talking about lifetime original movies), wasn't Valerie Bertinelli or Farah Fawcett available? Mrs. Hunt always came to me so cold, maybe she should've played the other mother? I wish I would have chosen "Capote" to fill my weekly Gay-themed Indie Allowance. Well, maybe next week. I think there's a good reason why Capote plays in tons of theaters across the NYC and this one only plays on one. let the distributors trust in this movie to run in the opposite direction if you don't trust this review!
