There are a number of movies about which my high school friends and I wondered. They are mostly the champions of the fifties that appeared on television on the late program. It was one of our favorites. The soul of a fallen native is brought to life in a tree trunk with a shoe on his face. Now my friends have claimed that if you look carefully, you can see the thing has shoes. I never saw it. What is most striking is that the native white men with black fat were on their faces; Some looked Italian. They also spoke to the strangest timbre who didn't fit their situation. Like the mummy movies, the mobility of the thing didn't seem to be much of a threat. In a confrontation you just have to walk fast; I think this is the old surprise element. If you see it, don't take it seriously. Be happy that we have a battery of old horror movies that gave us so much joy.
