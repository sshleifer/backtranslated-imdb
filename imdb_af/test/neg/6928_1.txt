I absolutely reject this movie. I wanted to have it - I really wanted it. But man, oh man, they were so with Sarah. And the father was cheesy. It's straight out of the Shirley Temple movie. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend the book. It is wonderful. In the book, Sara is honorable and decent and she does the right thing ... because it's right. She didn't have a spit bone in her body. <br /> <br /> In the movie she is temperate and excited. She does little things to come back to Miss Minchin. In the book, Sarah is above such things. She's standing for me. Minchin. She tells the truth and is not kneaded by her. But she doesn't do the stupid, indifferent things Sara does in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's really alarming to me that so many people here say they love the book and they love the movie. I can't help but wonder ... did we read the same book? The whole point of the book was personal responsibility, carried with honor and integrity, ALWAYS telling the truth and struggle with calm and integrity. <br /> <br /> Sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father, but the partnership with his partner who's looking for her. In the book she is taken by this new father figure who loves her and Becky. And Miss Minchin is NOT a chimney cattle - that part of the movie was really stupid. <br /> <br /> Seeing all this praise for this miserable movie is upsetting to me. We praise a film that glorifies spicy, indifferent behavior with some hints of the hat to friendliness? Sara in the book was well on her feet and full of integrity. I don't even recognize her in the movie ... she's not in it. <br /> <br /> Good thing Mrs Burnett does not live to see this terrible thing. Wearing the title of her book is horrible and indifferent.
