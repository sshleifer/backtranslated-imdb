Once they have tampered with the old man, they do not take well after their arrival as they approach their car and threaten to leave. After asking some local dummies who can't speak or just don't want to answer, they find the cabin. After settling in, strange things happen to the visitors, including the crazy ones on their car. The man who heads the journey is an idiot who thinks the family dog ​​was a killer at the door and a series of deaths later in the end. Adding a church group didn't make the story better.
