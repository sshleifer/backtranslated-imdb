RKO tried to strengthen its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse strong enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL). It is recommended to walk away from responsibilities in this small programmer. TCM broadcast it as a rock in Joan Fontaine's career. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is serious and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is okay than her love interest. But it's obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the looks and sly manners of a young James Garner) is the actor who had to share top billing with Fontaine. What also happened to this attractive actor? Why didn't RKO, along with Fontaine, promote it? He showed skill as a light comedian. <br /> <br /> These are the kind of thoughts that have gone through my mind as I watched this light dramatic drama that never fully complied with the hard promise of its title. The story itself is rather tiring, and sometimes comes to life occasionally because of Fontaine's enthusiastic heroine. <br /> <br /> She photographs beautifully like the nurse and skillfully carries her expressions and suggests that more should be placed in the future. date. Beal never went on a good career and his show shows why. Strictly slim. <br /> <br /> But everything happened to Philip Huston? Evidence here is that he had a valuable film career. <br /> <br /> Trivia Note: Watch Dwight Frye (from "Dracula") as the out-of-control patient on board the aircraft.
