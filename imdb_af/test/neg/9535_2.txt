THE OTHER is a suspected horror movie made during the 1970s. This should not be confused with the similar title THE OTHER, which Nicole Kidman encountered. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandchildren something just referred to as the game ". One of these twin boys - Niles - is supposed to be" good " The other one - Holland - is supposed to be angry. <br /> <br /> The idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie is adapted from a novel, I can only hope the novel was interesting since the movie was incredibly boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Performing this movie is much like a TV movie of the kind of British people who can see on Channel 5. In fact, this movie looks As it was made to be the daytime movie for this TV channel, a slight cut to one or two scenes and it would be a U-rated movie of the Disney product type, but even the youngest of children are more inclined to be bored as scared of each other. <br /> <br /> You don't have to see the director's resume to realize horror King is not his fort. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mulligan is strongly on the characters to manage the story. This is obvious from the beginning. I didn't see any of his other movies, but killing a MOCKINGBIRD is a well-known crime movie on this site. Unfortunately in the OTHER, the characters are getting too little to do and the plodding script ensures that the movie never really decreases as you would expect. <br /> <br /> The direction is as fleshy as you can find. Almost every scene takes place in the day! Think about it - a scene shot in the open landscape of rural America during the day with the large-scale camera focusing. Does it sound scary or atmospheric? Believe me, this is not. It is more related to an episode of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE as a horror movie. And yes, both of the aforementioned TV series and the other were shot in California. <br /> <br /> There is a noticeable absence of danger or evil that makes the whole exercise useless. <br /> <br /> The end was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and possibly influenced by another movie from this period. I won't reveal which movie, but I'll give 2 clues - a young boy was a main character and the movie is well known. And I would add that the concept was used in much greater effect in the latter film. <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty good and is the only reason I have awarded 2 stars. The actors who play the twin boys, along with the actress playing the grandmother, all try hard with the poor material they are given. <br /> <br /> Diana Muldaur is totally wasted in an ungrateful role as the mother of twin boys. Don't be fooled by her high bill on the list. She gets very little screen time and her presence just seems to be a breeze to pay on her long-established TV career to help attract TV viewers. <br /> <br /> I got the blurb on the back of the DVD cover (from the 2-region version in the UK). Comparisons were made to the exorcist, which I thought was a complete insult to that movie. There is no comparison. The exorcist has everything that this film should contain, but not - tension, tension, tongue-in-cheek humor, highly disturbing content, great acting, excellent characterization and viewer involvement. Ironically, the EXPORTER was made only a year later, but in terms of style and performance it looks like decades before the dull drama known as the OTHER. THE OTHER comes across as a job that was nice in the 1970s, let alone the 1970s! <br /> <br /> The 1970s was a wonderful era for horror movies with classic such as the exorcist, the omen, the Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, SALEM'S LOT to name just a few that are produced. For this reason, the OTHER proves even greater disappointment. <br /> <br /> If anyone finds the summary of THE OTHER interesting, they may want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book is about. I'll advise everyone to skip the movie.
