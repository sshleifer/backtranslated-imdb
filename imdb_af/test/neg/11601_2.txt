I voted only 2/10, mainly because Hitchcock agreed to do so. He certainly had a run-off with predictable plot lines, stupid childish characters who are desperately trying to be funny. There were "two" hieroglyphic, purified, emaciated "sex" scenes at a time when the Hollywood production code was in full force. Dear male characters in the "soap" movie movie, never do a stroke for which they are paid. It always makes me annoyed when food is usually never eaten by actors (one exception was in the eating scene in "Tom Jones" (1963), although large amounts of liquor are consumed - actors have to release their mouths for the next line! Carole Lombard has Hitchcock's "cool blonde" idealized image of a heroine, but who had ever taken possession of this worthless, unobstructed manuscript, had to hold onto his winners, certainly not behaving well over the past 69 years. I couldn't wait because it gradually made me feel annoyed.
