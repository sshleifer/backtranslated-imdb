Jim Brown stars and delivers a story in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. The story captured the Japanese and captured several divers, which they used to get the gold that MacArthur threw into Manila Bay. <br /> <br /> It's a messy movie aimed at explaining war and racism (The movie uses Edwin McCain's War in a not-so-subtle fitting). The performances are at best just enough. Jim Brown is okay, but he doesn't really show a sort of show in a show that just left him there, and it looks angry. The sets are useful but look cheap. The movie is from the beginning due to a large amount of stock, including many of the best-known shots of the Japanese attack in Tora! Tora! Tora! Using such a large budget sequence makes the rest of the film look anemic positively; It also reminds one that there are better movies there that one can watch. For me, the movie looks like half a real plot, the silver recycling and a half plot just to fill the time. Not one of them is particularly exciting, even with the explosive final. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I will succeed.
