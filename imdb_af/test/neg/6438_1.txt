This soap is worse than bad: it is toxic. Of the many television programs that have had corrosive influence on British society over the past twenty years, Eastenders is the first example. For two decades, this show celebrated the grandfather, the crook, the wide-ranging boy, the tart, the hobby, the violent, the sexually incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the inexorable ... <br /> <br /> How many times has anyone noticed that Eastenders "reflects life"? Life on which planet, exactly? <br /> <br /> It's written about "working class" characters, as suggested by middle class people who took a course in creative writing. Eager to show off to their middle-class counterparts, how familiar they are with the "working class", they dream of the clump that is the citizenship of Eastenders. <br /> <br /> It has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population who accept the attitudes and attitudes of the Walford residents. <br /> <br /> So Eastenders reflects life; but only after life in the mirroring Eastenders was in the mirror image, other sails followed. They followed in EE's footsteps, filled with their stinking gunwings with ugly, potato-faced, chopped, chopped characters, and constantly threatening. It is the proletariat as observed by the writers who produce this trash. The authors will be rich in the proceeds of such output, and will continue to enjoy the finer things of life in their selected enclaves. Meanwhile, the emerging number of new TV-induced drones will go inexorably to cultural bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> There you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century. Many of these are due to the immeasurable power of those illuminated box dancing pixels in the corner of your living room. It's your fault, gentle reader: that's what you've chosen as the only window through which you look out of your jail.
