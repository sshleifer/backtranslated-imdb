It's a very mediocre movie in the year of "Buckaroo Banzai." The movie is like Mad Max wannabes, and they seem to share a joke they don't want to share with the audience. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of the shameful pleasures you are looking to stumble upon in movies, but she is not worth the price of rental. Space Got starts an electric fire and burns a voice of 4.
