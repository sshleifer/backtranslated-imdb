OK ... it can contain Spoilers ... but who really cares? Don't, if you appreciate the seconds in your life, waste your time on this pile of garbage. There is not one reason for quality in this movie ... and I say this as a complete fan of the Vacation Series of movies. I loved the cousin Eddie's character from the other holiday movies ... but he just works well as a supportive character. Do I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie? Not at all. I think he's a good actor ... but this movie has no cohesion ... the pacing is off ... it's just plain unfunny. And the actor playing the "Third" ... Jake Thomas ... was just awful, more than likely due to a real lack of direction. I don't know why ... but his whole character provoked me. <br /> <br /> Some say it's a horrible movie because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo aren't in it. It has nothing to do with it. The writing, directing, acting ... special effects ... everything is a train wreck. With orphans. And kittens. Oh yes ... and the train also ran over old people. <br /> <br /> Please, whatever you do, stay away from this filth! I call it dirty because it ignores the name of the Holiday franchise.
