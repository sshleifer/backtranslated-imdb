Cultural Vandalism Is the new Hallmark production of Gulliver's Travels an act of cultural vandalism? Not literally. After all, a single copy of the book is not burned. But if it's the only Gulliver people, is it exposed to and for many it will be? Those people will get nothing like Jonathan Swift meant. If Jonathan Swift was alive, Hallmark could be sued for moral rights violations and would lose them. This is a great way to think before you start a project with someone's ideas. <br /> <br /> Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. Through his hero, Gulliver, does he travel to places that make him feel big, small, darling and? man. The small people in Lilleput are small in every way. Smaller and stupid, their fight, the big and small ends, the relentless wars of extinction over which side of their soft-boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table. Sounds a little like us. <br /> <br /> I forget most of the rest: it was years since I read it. The TV show reminded me of a few things, and on the bright side it made me read. <br /> <br /> This gift to mankind is on display like Gulligan among the branches under the vulgar yahoo, and Danson, Steenbergen and especially two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, must be thoroughly ashamed. Some "Creative Person" had the brilliant idea to focus on "the star". Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose play is just bad. He portrays Gulliver as mad. All his travels were made up. Weeeeel. Yeeeaaah! Of course Swift Gulliver finishes! Of course, the countries he visited were imaginary: it is called fiction. His purpose was to talk about mankind and us, often terrible relationships with each other. The journey of his imaginary character to imaginary countries is his method. But these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that Hallmark could not change into one of his anode cards is presumably. <br /> <br /> I can see why Hallmark would produce this crap. It's so bad that O'Toole, always deep, looks as little as his Lilliputic character. Of course, he is, of course, simultaneously responding to the character, so much, if not all great actors. Informing the character sheds light on it. Our light completes the character. It becomes three-dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. Most actors do it very subtly, like Hopkins in "The Remains of the Day." Others, such as Nicholson, have, over the past twenty years, mostly played the two parts quite wide apart. Nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us too: with him it's all the cat's cradle and he keeps away, keeps all the strings. Great fun, like O'Toole. But something here is missing. He shouts in a megaphone (as big as ever) and all one senses is a hollow shell standing beneath him. <br /> <br /> That's because it's. Look at "anodyne" and there should be the word "Hallmark" as a synonym. Harmless, leaf, unofficial: Hallmark is the doll that cannot pee because she has no gender: it is the norm, the average, the person of no distinction. Hallmark's feature is to have no feature. I never suspect that such people despise those who have imagination so little. Suddenly, Pound's "Disney vs. Meta-Physical" comes in bold type. Whether Einstein's "men of genius will always oppose violence by mediocre thoughts." Indeed, anyone with this mediocre type who has an answer to a question other than "a" or "b" is presumably. Who is more characteristic than that man who travels to the dark places of the human soul and shines his light flashlight to illuminate what can be found there? Hence the act of vandalism. The Taliban destroyed the Buddha in Afghanistan, the Palestinians, the oldest synagogue in the world in Jericho, the barbarians, the great statue of the Classical era and these things are, of course, vandalism. Hallmark seeks to protect us from foreign enemies by undermining our own culture; The one who feeds and maintains them. And us. <br /> <br /> Please purchase a copy of Gulliver's Travels where you live. Or order it online. I like to use ABE Books.
