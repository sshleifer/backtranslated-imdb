Yes, I've made it all the way to the end. However, it was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if there was even a director on set. The acting ... well, I don't even know what to say. I thought Emily's girl was trying her best with the boring, sometimes mischievous and sometimes predictable dialogue. <br /> <br /> I know it was a low budget, but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look like a 100-minute audition band. <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to talk about the end ... <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie was the music. <br /> <br /> It is said, I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who don't have a lot of movies to watch in general, it's not a waste of time to waste your time. If you're looking for a sad lesbian theme movie, check out The Children's Hour, Lost and Delirious or High Art. It will all leave you depressed and gloomy, but you will not have to undergo the role of the film in the process.
