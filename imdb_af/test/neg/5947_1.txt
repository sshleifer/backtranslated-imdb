Tom Selleck plays an absent son to Don Ameche and courageous wife. Anne Jackson to senile. He made his cuts (one presupposition) and took them in after Ameche burned his mobile home. Meanwhile, Selleck's work is skipped by the V.B.I. His assets are frozen, his wife and children leave him and his passing sister and her brats have come to stay. The brightly-painted comedy-of-sick is as much in the eye of the reality as Ameche's killing old boyfriend. Perhaps a serious first draft (with plays such as Ameche running with two toddlers in traffic) recorded in a vagrant second or third version (with Selleck being bumped, knocked, prodded and eventually lost a tone and a testicle !). Anyway, it's a painful experience, and Selleck's sudden dedication to his father makes little sense; He stumbles around and cries in pain, but keeps his heart from the mess. This movie is. * of ****
