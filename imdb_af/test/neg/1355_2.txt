As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a fanatic movie lover, I made a terrible mistake. I went to see "The Women". The remake of one of my favorites. I've seen the original many times, in fact I own it. My haste to see the remake was based on Diane English, the woman responsible for "Murphy Brown". But I was: how bad can it be? She must know what she is doing. Well, I don't know what to say. I don't understand what happened. The Botoxed women are a very depressing matter. Meg Ryan or who played Maria - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan. Another actress, who may wear a Meg Ryan mask, does not carry the character of Norma Shearer in 1939. The new one is a tired, unconvincing prototype of what a farce has become in a farce. Friends, Annette Bening, Debra Messing, Jada Pinket Smith, are cut off as anything I've ever seen, and if that wasn't enough: Eva Mendes as Crystal, the character Joan Crawford created in one of her best and Funniest performances. . Eva Mendes's casting is really the poster sign for how wrong, how sick it is, this commercial effort turned up. I didn't give it a 1 out of respect for Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman
