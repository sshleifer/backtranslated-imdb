I only saw this movie for the first time after I bought it on DVD. <br /> <br /> It seems like a cheap attempt to cash in on the two Conan movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not seem to have the same budget as the Conan movies and therefore some of the sets and effects are not as flashy and some scenes look quick. <br /> <br /> Nielsen is ready to watch, but unfortunately she can't act if a gun is placed on her head. <br /> <br /> Arnie's supporting role seemed to be a favor to the director Fleischer, who also directed Conan the Destroyer. Perhaps Arnie was not confident that he was having photo shoots like Predator, Total Recall, T2, etc. Wouldn't have. <br /> <br /> Some of the female guardians of the talisman early in the film looked as if they were struggling to lift their swords and the look on their faces suggested they had a lot of fun making this movie. I couldn't be so jovial if I was fighting for my life. <br /> <br /> All this aside, this movie requires very little concentration to watch and was generously entertaining. I saw a lot worse. Two stars.
