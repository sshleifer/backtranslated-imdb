Well, there's not much to say about this movie. this is simply trash. very poor acting, weak writing and lame story. Well, the actress (I don't know her name yet) who played the lead (not the blonde one, but Latina one) was good, but the blonde one who plays the main character friend ,,, her acting is just like high school play, like most other role players in the movie. Also, zombies ,,,, very bad acting too. and ,, the story itself really has no point. Well, if you really get bored and really have nothing to do, but want to kill the time somehow, maybe you might want to watch this movie, but there are still millions of better B movies than this crap. its total waste of money and time.
