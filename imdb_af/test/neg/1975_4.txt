This show lasted for most of the eighties, and had moments, but plots were usually dish water and often painfully unfunny. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this sitcom, they both got better, but it does offer some good memories and I found myself on some repeated scenes. June Whitfield's talent for comedy is allowed to shine on occasion (when she's not a terry foil) and she's really smart. <br /> <br /> The 1980s have been the last decade of this middle class, middle-aged comedy, and many people remember it, but I prefer to remember the decade of alternative comedy and the biting satire of Spitting Image.
