This is not the true story. This is the darkest possible fiction that comes from the events. It subscribes to suicide, moral obsession with death, a totally free coastal rock in organized religion in general (and especially the Anglican Church), and generally gives a nihilistic, useless worldview from which filmmakers intend to walk away. richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessness. <br /> <br /> Extremely trash, yet beautifully done by a competent role. However, that anyone would suggest it to be a true version is very false advertising. You want the real story? Rent 'Fairy Tale'. This is the true story. See if you can find any correspondence between the facts presented in both cases. I just found one: the girls who made the original pictures were preoccupied.
