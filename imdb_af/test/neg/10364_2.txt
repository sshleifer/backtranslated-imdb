Every time I see a movie like this, I get sick of my stomach. When I watch a movie, I like to see what I see in everyday life. As I go through my day, I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos etc. ... How do you roll a movie and don't even think about the possibility that other ethnic groups will pass you by? I'm sure they didn't do it intentionally, but beware. I don't care if it happens in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was one sign black. It was typical in the 80's. Hey! It's 2007, with all the rappers, singers and athletes working as actors. Thomas Haden Church could have given more attention to his role. Don't actors be more liberal?
