I can't believe this movie gets the rating that it's here on IMDb. Of course, I came to the conclusion that IMDb is somewhat worthless to find out if a movie is good or not, as 99% of films are rated from 6 to 7. This is the conclusion and failure of crowd acquisition on the Internet. For this purpose an average of most people is taken, and unfortunately most people are simply entertained. But I deviated. The movie. I really don't want to waste my time writing about it. Let's just say I made it suitable for seemingly two groups of people, young teens, at the age of violent action flies of any kind just hit the spot, and goths just like choking any Gothic vampire fantasy they can raise their hands. If you are not in one of the categories, you will find this movie absurd. I enjoyed the first Underworld. It was fresh at the moment and had some kind of edgy quality. The second was a bit in plot, but I sometimes enjoyed the direction and cinematography. But this whole movie felt like a sci-fi channel production or even a TV series. I found the actors over-emphasized. Their body language stiffened to unnatural idealistic positions that seemed. Lines have been flushed out as young actors have spurted traces of Shakespeare, spitting their own selfish glory to play such a role, but the role becomes cruel. The plot was dry and predictable from the beginning. I found myself just having to "move" because it was so easy to tell what's going to happen. I first tried to care, but my brain had to be forced. By the end of the climax I caught myself, fell asleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and didn't make sense, it's not even worth listing them all. If you're faced with a pimple or a chronic goth, be sure. For the rest of us, forget about it, as I'm going to do now.
