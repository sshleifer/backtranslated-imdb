*** Can contain spoils <br /> <br /> I had very high expectations for this movie, based on the trailer. I knew a little bit of real Ed Gein, so I thought it was a medium-budget Hollywood version of the real event. The man was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the author apparently came from an eight-degree that barely knew anything of Ed's history and cut it off in about 20 minutes. The movie is all about Ed's most interesting facets and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the real police found in his home) and decides to focus mainly on the young deputy who looks like he's just on the set it up. Similarly, all the male characters seem to ad libbing their dialogue throughout the movie. I'm not exaggerating. <br /> <br /> Don't start with the historic whistles in this movie first. Seriously, who corrected it? This film should take place around 1957, but the police are carrying modern craft bats. Some of the stuff in the hardware store seems to come at Lowes and when the police call a phone, he dials 9-1-1 (has not yet existed). Also, Ed was a little guy, scared like Anthony Perkins's character in Psycho (which was supposedly based on the real Ed), not this brave man who ultimately looks too much like the bad man in Men in Black. /> <br /> Another thing that really bothered me was the appearance that the creators of this movie shot the whole thing in a deserted, 3-building. Because of the "clever" camera angles, you never see a real town, and the inside of the sets looks like old, abandoned huts. Pop a cash register on a saw horse and bam! - Kitswinkel. <br /> <br /> I'm usually pretty forgiving of low-budget horror movies, but this one just asks for it. All you have to do is include most of the real-life events (even decorate them!), Pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones, and for Pete's sake, take 5 minutes and think once about it. period. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you'll be much more entertained.
