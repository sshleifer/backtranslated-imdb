An in-name only sequel to John Carpenter's Vampires, this movie takes place in Thailand and involves a sect of bad vampires, who like to kill people and a sect of good vampires who don't. Although it is an interesting idea to set up a vampire movie in Thailand, it seems as if the authors don't do much with the exotic region. This movie can just as easily be put in Los Angeles. This brings me to my next point, which means it looks much like Blade Lite. We have the sound soundtrack, the martial art battle scenes, a dance club blood loss and of course many sharp objects going through vampires. What we do not have is budget and talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial artist, too bad his play is not so good, and there is a lot of decent work, and tons of recycled battle order, maybe too much. The problem is that they just don't have the same impact as those in any of the Blade movies. Maybe it's just that the movie felt a "seen there". <br /> <br /> But to me, the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between the two, played by the dull and blind Colin Egglesfield, and his girlfriend. At the beginning of the flick, she was ripped off after a little exchange with her boyfriend. At this stage we have no interest in her well-being and no reason to believe her boyfriend will be willing to risk his neck to save her. Now it's a big drawback if it's the main print of the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end, you can do worse than wasting 85 minutes of your time, but I can think of much better things about Doing with your time, like renting any of the Blade movies.
