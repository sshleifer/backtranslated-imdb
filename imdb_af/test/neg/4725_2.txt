The next "review" is one of the wrong side of the cuts, which means two things: You will hear nothing, but praise comes from me and is not deceived by my rating. I can also tell you that this review does not contain spoilers, but technically ... it's a lie. <br /> <br /> Well, ... Screw the review. I'm just going to run a little. It was a while because I had so much fun with such a bad movie. And if you can't enjoy this piece of bravery, then you simply have no sense of humor. First of all, this movie was meant to be taken seriously, and that is the most important aspect of the fun. The story? A doctor's son is terminally ill. Dad doctor decides that a heart transplant is the only way to save his son. So, in true mad-doctor style, he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick. Of course, the gorilla heart is "too strong for a man", so sunny son transforms into this horrible monkey man who immediately breaks and goes on a murder and rape (because that is simply what any hearing animal would do, isn't it?). The makeup of our Monkey Man is hilarious. There is simply no other way to set it up: The guys face looks like a maze! I'm talking here with human feces, the solid brown kinds! Pretty! The gore in this movie is also wonderful: Besides the real image of an open heart surgery, we also have an amazing fake (but very nasty) that indicates blood and gore effects: a dapitation, an eye wash, ' a throat grip, the screaming of someone's skull ... It's hilarious, and it's actually incomprehensible why the BLOOD APES ever made the infamous British Video Nasties list, because all the nasty things featured in this movie are is just too ridiculous to be. taken seriously, and there was only one bloody monkey running through it. So, it is unnecessary to say that LA HORRIPILANTE BESTIA HUMANA is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and compelling science story that went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> When we're not trying to shock poorly educated acts of bloody violence or arbitrary depictions of female nudity, this movie manages very entertainingly with ingredients such as careless dialogues, inexpensive cartons, plot folly, and incredibly bad acting . Just a few random examples, maybe? About the sets: One can clearly see that the set designers used the same and the same walls, doors, windows, and so on to build various different sets (eg one side of the hospital room - the window side - where the unconscious wrestling girl lies, looks suspiciously similar to the left side of the cellar laboratory from which the monkey man escapes, the set designers also took one of the side windows of the lab, made it a little bigger and fairer in the conference room of the hospital, all the walls in any building is the same gray, then there is the setting of the park, clearly shot in a studio, you can see (on several occasions) that the grass is loose, every time a few struggles / fights / rapes, just move the grass and move and you can see the gray concrete of the studio beneath it. <br /> <br /> Just a few random lines that the actors come up with - a mouth: <br /> <br /> - In the conference room where all the d octers debate the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl (a disappearance that obviously means bad publicity for the hospital) "We find ourselves in a difficult situation." <br /> <br /> - During the same debate, a fellow doctor says smart on: a sleepwalker! Any sleepwalker stands up. "This gives me a good excuse for the disappearance of Unconscious Wrestling Girl. After the investigative detective, he went through the incredible process of his own logical deduction, and told his superiors that the killer should be half a man / half animal, his superior answer that it was absurd, and added the line : "It is more likely that from late, more And more, you watch a lot of the photos of terror on your television ..." Actually, one of the best rules of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other sources of lag: <br /> <br /> - The two scenes were Daddy's Doctor and his Igor-like assistant kidnapped the gorilla of the zoo and Unconscious Wrestling Girl out of hospital. These well-penetrating acts of kidnapping are like getting a baby candy. <br /> <br /> - Daddy talks well with God, right? <br /> <br /> - Sonny-boy calls Daddy-Doctor "Dad" at more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> - An old lady shouting "Aaargh !!! A dead man! A dead man! A dead man !! A DEAD MAN !!!". <br /> <br /> - The plot often stops wrestling with women's plays, just to get back on and do nothing with it. Certainly, Daddy-Doctor replaces Sonny-Seuntjie's gorilla heart a second time with that of Unconscious Wrestling Girl, but do you think something spectacular is happening next to it? Like Monkey-Turd-Man who breaks breasts or something, their men are trying to rape this time? Our leading live wrestling beauty (Norma Lazareno) is not even in a climate match against Ape-Turd-Man near the movie's final. But Monkey-Turd-Man is almost the end of the maternal love ... almost (and I say "almost") in real KING KONG style (ie the top of a building and people on the ground show and shout). <br /> <br /> Well, I think that's enough now. I cut more than two cents here. Vomitron's rational rating for this messy piece of hilarious drink: 2/10. Vomitron's rating From the wrong side of the tracks: 8/10. Look at this movie, people. Well worth it!
