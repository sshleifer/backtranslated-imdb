Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he's trying to do with this movie. If it was to make my good day feel in a night of disturbing memories I think he did. <br /> <br /> I know there have been big questions in this movie, like what we really are, what are we here for, there really is a god. All the big questions, but I really don't think it's funny if you have the questions next to this tragedy. I'm all for the real life that is portrayed, but come on. It is never funny when a woman is raped, someone kills themselves (and family and friends find the body) and people die for inexplicable and unnecessary reasons. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was the place it was filmed. There are many beautiful places. <br /> <br /> I'm not a film student or know everything about the subject, but I know this when I play the theater with a Disgust feeling, then it wasn't a movie I would give anyone not recommended.
