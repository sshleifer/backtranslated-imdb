If you didn't see "The War at Home", let me tell you what you lacked. It's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could only be edgy and funny in the 1960s. Where America has grown in the acceptance of race, sexual preference, religion, etc. ... This representation seems to argue with that progress. It's a decline in America's evolution. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the persistent jokes of the show is that the WHITE daughter is dating a BLACK child from school. Of course, it's hilarious to see how you can't see that kind of relationship at any mall in America. I lived in both small towns and big cities, so don't give me a kind of red state, blue state excuse. Not only is this the joke, but the father, who is supposedly not racist, finds it disturbing and asks his daughter to break her boyfriend repeatedly. He is opposed to his "he may sound like a racist, but he's just silly" character. <br /> <br /> If that's not enough, a second running joke is that one of the boys, and soon metro-sexual, is ambiguous in his sexual orientation. The audience learns over and over that he is not gay, but the father is not convinced, therefore he constantly avoids his son, perhaps fearing that his son will hit him, since all gay men are nymphomaniac wild men who "control do not want The father always visits his son once, but usually goes on with him in the next episode. <br /> <br /> The only way this show can cure him in my eyes is as the continuous exposure to these "unnatural events in life", open the father's eyes a little, but it can much to ask - and besides, with jokes like this, I'm sure we will be in the episodes to come - Episode 13, "Father Votes Against Women Voters", and Episode 14, "My Muslim Neighbor is a terrorist ". <br /> <br /> Please leave this display, FOX. We live in a different world from the one who raised your executives.
