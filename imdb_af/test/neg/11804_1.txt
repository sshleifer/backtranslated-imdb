The characters are annoying, immature, and shaky .... Madison is the most annoying of all. OOH ... a cold place! Such a serious threat! Any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! To make a long story short, this movie is boring. Seeing a chair flying over a room can be creepy, but it's about as intriguing as it gets. I watched it once when one of my kids wanted to see it again. I was tempted to take a baseball bat on the TV rather than to see this garbage again. If you want a good horror movie or even a sensible comedy, this is not so! The only good part of the whole thing was the "roach scene" and by the end of the movie you felt sorry for the dress!
