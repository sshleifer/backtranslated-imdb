I thought this movie is a poor effort by the British film board - has become flat because hey, come on, Tim Robbins is an old man and here is this beautiful young woman who also falls straight for him. As lost in translation, it is very difficult to suspend unbelief in this context. It's a good movie but doesn't have a punch. When Tim Robbins pretends to be psychic, he seems to have a small migraine. He looks uncomfortable and life less. The part where he investigates suspicious employees at Sphinx is laughing. If an investigator came to my factory, the last thing I would do was tell him my fetish talk. Of course this is over-intellectual. Inept. The city is as it is, a convenient backdrop. Of course, they chose the futuristic city they could use (Shanghai) as a backdrop, but the city never really comes out and for example, carries the characters in a leaflet, where the characters of the city often cross the story. slow as a wet week. No chemistry, true dramatic high points, so plot.
