A family (a teenager, his mother and a stepfather), sick of city life, decide to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a new start. However, their idyll is broken by three brothers and their dominant father, who is not newcomer to newcomer. While objects thrown through their window and threatened in the street are just the beginning, the youth decides to make things worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio's sister. With the law unwilling to do anything about it and speed up the violence quickly, the boy decides to take matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> Be totally between hilarious and nastiness, this is one of the strangest exploits ever. Initially you can give some of the hammy acting and ridiculous dialogue to the characters, especially the exaggerated bad guys. But then you get totally unnecessary scenes as a mother is raped while her son is forced to watch, or the villain's sister is relaxed by her brothers and sisters because they can't dare to go with our young hero. In fact, the whole view of women in the movie, which seems to be pathetic creatures that scream a lot and can't defend themselves, is pretty despicable. But of course there is the compulsory nude scene, which this time involves a young lady in a swimming pool with a little less diving under a very thin T-shirt. Who cares for plot consistency if you have some willing young stars ready to shed her moves. Right ?! <br /> <br /> The climax centers on the teenager, who have not been able to jump without a hitch, suddenly morph into a Rambo clone and blow his attackers left, right and middle to save his stepfather by the gang hostage held. It is quite indisputable, but hey, so everything else in this movie. So you can't at least blame it for not being consistent. So, rather than trying to find logic in a place where the word doesn't exist, look at the IMDb pages for Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie. Etc. Their careers all ended. Why? Sit down and everything will become clear. Remember children, if you want to continue in this business, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scripts they offer you. Please .. 3/10
