Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved in this horrible movie. The acting, directing and screenplay are all third appreciation - with the entire movie being an excuse for writer / director / star Larry Bishop to be laid. The only reason it was made is probably due to its commitment to QT. The plot of the movie is pretty thin and basically tries to survive on non-dark references to older B movies and some comos of guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each one is listless in their performance, especially Hopper who is currently in full-time payroll. The saving grace, if any, is that the writing is so bad that it can be entertaining. Bishop tries so hard to get that trademark Tarentino banter and just fails, which can sometimes be quite humorous and can stir others. I just want to see this one if you love bad movies ... or if you're really into biker movies.
