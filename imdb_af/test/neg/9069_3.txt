The 70's were without a doubt the golden age of "made-for-TV" horror. This is one of those that probably came out as an ABC movie of the week. This is the old story of a house and / or ghost that owns one of the new owners. The film has promise, but it is never realized. Everything is rushed too much. Tension and tension need time to build and grow. And there's nothing new. We've seen it before and one better. <br /> <br /> One last thought: I don't understand why Robert Wagner's character would fall for the long dead movie star if he married Kate Jackson by the name of Good! !!
