The success of the original French Emmanuelle series (I just watched the first one, which wasn't too bad) led to a flurry of imitations; The Italian counterpart, who even changed the heroine of his heroine, was clearly less polished and more exploitative - increasingly in vulgarity when the series went along. Amazingly, there were 16 "Black Emanuelle" movies in total, with the heroine even changing the spelling of her name to prevent copyright issues !! Still, Laura Gemser - the titular object of desire - has become almost as much of an icon as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (although she is personally too slim for my taste)! Here she is even billed as 'Emanuelle', rather than with her real name - with the director, also 'Albert Thomas'! <br /> <br /> In itself, the film offers little interest: indeed, it will do best to call it a travel book, with a decent footage of African wildlife. Regarding the sex scene, I don't know how complete the version I watched, but while there was a lot of nudity, it wasn't very explicit - or even titillating (the scene that came closest was perhaps when Gemser - what as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turns the camera on, of course, clothes are in the middle of the jungle! The movie also features an artist like Salvador Dali, but maybe his screens won't take much of the running time. Nico Fidenco's score is typically barely 70's and really nothing to write home about.
