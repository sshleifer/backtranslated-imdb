Someone pointed out that Charlie Sheen's character should be courted to do what he wants. You may be right, but that's how SEAL really is. I served for a few months with a SEAL team from Norfolk, VA. Actually, I have to say they used our ship to deploy themselves in Europe for a few months. I was the job clerk on board and every day these guys are trying to get their jobs. Since only one person could retrieve the post every day, we issued one pass to one person. Every day another SEAL will emerge as if someone else is. Well, after the third time I said no to them until I had proof who they were. They have NUTS !!! I thought they were going to brush through my cage, gag me and then steal the post. Fortunately, I had not only the president of my side (the navy), but the federal government (US Mail). It was the only time I saw the SEALs stop having everything they wanted. They allowed unlimited land leave, where we had to be back on the ship at some point. They murdered and tortured a woman in France and the two SEALs first had a week's detention on the ship, while a Seamen was arrested for stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine shop and he had a court martial got. Is it a wonder why the SEAL's retention rate is over 85%? As a SEAL you are God. So this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a SEAL acts and thinks ... unfortunately it is so unbelievable for ordinary people to fall down as if it were falling.
