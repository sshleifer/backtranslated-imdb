I'm a big fan of the first four Ju-on projects. I own them and watch them every few months. I lend them to co-workers and friends just so they can get a good fright from quality Japanese filmmaking. I think Takashi Shimizu has created a wonderful story and it is very effective in these four installments. <br /> <br /> I was somewhat excited about The Grudge 2 opening in theaters. I saw the first American resentment before I looked at the four originals. The resentment was actually pretty good. Of course, the original is better, but I have a good Halloween scare from the American American resentment. <br /> <br /> The grudge 2 started badly and went down from there. I waited to make it better, to make sense, to show Shimizu's talent - nothing like that happened. The thing that is wonderful about Shimizu's Ju-on work is the story. True, it is usually told in an unprecedented style that you should consider linking its components, but it is still a wonderful story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of fun-filled deaths that you never had time to even care about. <br /> <br /> Editing was horrible. Disjointed (as in the Japanese original) is one thing, but the complete randomness of the scene was exhausting. I just thought, "It's so stupid," and, "No, he didn't really sell that much?" It caused me to get out of the theater, go home and see the original work, just to make sure that Shimizu didn't always make these dumbed-down, generic, boring, non-sensual, thrown trips. /> <br /> If you really set your heart to watch this movie, I suggest you wait 2 months to rent it. Really. Two of the five people in the theater walked with me about 45 minutes away. I debated whether to do it myself. Going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend my time at that time. <br /> <br /> I'm really shocked at how bad this movie was. Let's pray Sam Raimi doesn't make money anymore to make The Grudge 3. It's just not worth it anymore. Sigh.
