Princess Warrior is a science fiction action movie with a pretty thin plot-essentially on the death of their queen mother's two sisters, one evil and one good, fighting for the control of the throne. The good sister is beaten so she escapes to Earth, where she looks naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet t-shirt competition. The rest of the movie is basically one long-hunting scene, as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister. But the younger sister is helped by Bob, a good DJ, and everything is complicated by police involvement and the good sister's ignorance of Earth's customs and culture. The older sister comes to her younger brother a few times, but the latter can escape and get going again. In all of this action, there is a cult of women on the home planner who has a kind of age family to bring back the good sister. Unfortunately, it seems to be a good part of the movie, a bit of boring car hunting while driving around Los Angeles (and what was the sound effect of the police car crashing?). The film ends in another physical battle between the sisters with a predictable ending. <br /> <br /> The elements of Star Wars (the light sabers and the appearance of the girls' home planet in the opening and subsequent scenes) seem to be boring, Dr. Who (the telephone box like transport) and some of the costumes (of the cult on the home planet) could be taken from Star Trek episodes. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Dana Fredsti (the evil sister in the movie) in another user's commentary called "the endless (and dull) wet T-shirt game, which is seriously the longest wet T-shirt game in the history of cinema. And the only one true the participants were wearing industrial power cotton polyester shirts that defended all attempts to get them wet and transparent. "I couldn't call it better. The only thing I want to add is that the music in this scene is just annoying. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is pretty much the top, but it seems to fit the whole style of the movie. The actors playing Vinnie and Vito were just too much for me. I just found them irritating. Mrs. Fredsti (Curette) was self-evident and did not take the whole thing seriously, unlike Sharon Lee Jones who really did, but it seems to be more serious. All the police are portrayed as turbulent idiots, who are likely to add comic relief, which is a bit unnecessary, as the whole movie is pretty comical. <br /> <br /> From a rating perspective, this film had a lot. dirty language; some topless women and others barely dressed in pliers but not enough skin to satisfy those seeking nudity; a sex scene portrayed in a non-graphic, dreamlike way; and little violence - while there were threats throughout, the scenes of both sword camps and brawling were exaggerated and campaigning to be "offensive", but the actors seemed to have had lots of fun. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder who came to the character names? Ovule (a small egg), Curette (a surgical instrument used for scraping and cleaning), Exzema (suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by scalpel and pruritus), Bulemia (an eating disorder with bending and purification) and Rickettsia (another disease)? <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a bad, low budget, champion, sci-fi stock movie, but it entertained me, though I might need a few drinks before I watch it again.
