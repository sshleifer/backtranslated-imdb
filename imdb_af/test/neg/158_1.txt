I tried to look at this adjustment, but it was just as terrible that I couldn't torture it. The performances were quite sub-par, with the exception of Ariel. Fonda was beyond the top in a role that had to be dealt with with some subtlety. I studied Shakespeare and saw many adjustments, and that is by far the worst I have ever seen. I have to wonder why on earth someone made this movie. Shakespeare can, and in many cases, be beautifully adapted. This is not one of them. If you have to watch this movie, can I suggest a drink game? Drink each time they leave the original idea and drink two every time Fonda overwork. You should be very drunk.
