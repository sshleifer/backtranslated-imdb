I saw it on a small canal late at night and I expected it on a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comedian and I thought he might be a good stand-up comedian / actor in the style of Richard Pryor. <br /> <br /> I couldn't be wrong anymore. This concert was terrible. It was full of racist remarks aimed at white people, Muslims and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same in Lawrence's close mind) and the sounding cowardly philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, cannot resist The urge to to preach when giving a platform Do we really need a lecture on Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights struggle during a riot comedy? Then there was his fawning comment designed to charm him with women, it crawled my skin to listen to him. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the show was simply not funny and I found it boring. I turned halfway and returned to find him whether he was still preaching or going on and on and on and about the birth of his child (there was no humor in the story of his child's birth and it was obviously off his side To spoil us with the details, he obviously didn't have much to say if he'd cut this part of the show.) <br /> <br /> This show was rubbish: Runteldat!
