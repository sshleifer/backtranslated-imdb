Movies about U.F.O's are always a nice way to kill time, so on a rainy Sunday night I picked up this movie, expecting a direct-to-DVD U.F.O. mystery. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong! Almost halfway into the movie it becomes very clear that the U.F.O. theme is just a misleading way to attract unsuspecting viewers for this Christian propaganda. And it's not just a Christian movie of an average Christian. No, it is Christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind. The terrifying kind. <br /> <br /> At the end of this movie, the non-believing lead is deceived by their colleagues using a practical joke to think that the Rapture has begun (believed by Christians to happen in the end of time when true believers go to heaven and leave non-believers behind. <br /> <br /> When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer, "only if we have Christians right. "Now it's an ugly excuse to ever become a Christian if you ask me! <br /> <br /> This movie is still trying to transform non-believers into frightening tactics. "Believe in God or you go to hell!" is the message here. Simple but very offensive, really. Especially because this movie is sold as something completely different. <br /> <br /> Let's assume you are a Christian fundamentalist and you will probably not be insulted by the themes in this movie. Is this a good movie? I'm afraid it's not. No, I'm actually lying: I'm glad it's not! The play is terrible, the pacing is terrible, the plot is terrible, especially the end is laughing badly. As soon as the movie starts, you immediately feel it will be worse than you expected, and you'll be right. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour, it seems like you're at least trying to set up a sensible UFO mystery, but then suddenly they bring this Count Dracula look like the devil. Initially you think this man is just a crazy mania, but as it turns out, he actually represents the right views of the makers of this movie. Once you realize it, you know how it will end. But actually it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
