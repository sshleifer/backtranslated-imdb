There is nothing wrong with softcore, but this one is very clinical - a lot of nudity, but it's all fake (of course, it's always counterfeit - it's a movie, but you know what I mean). There is no sexuality or eroticism, it's all random nudity and poor "lust" and sex with each other. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of it is your personal preference. These women clearly have body issues with their piercings, tattoos and silicon - not to mention that it looks too plastic and leathery if it is your thing. It's good to see it all. <br /> <br /> I don't think I don't think anyone's expectations are very high when you look at a movie title like this, but for many people, it would actually be looking at cyborg fembots ... they almost look but they are really creepy.
