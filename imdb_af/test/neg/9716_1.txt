This movie was Flippin Awful .... I wanted to have those hours of my life back. For God's sake, you must be far away from this horrible crumb movie. It's not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit movie like this. And where do I start? The dumb A ** children in the movie ..... The null graph or story? ... the garden variety college / frat son-esquire scenes of towel slapping? Or the very bad action, teen anxiety innuendo? $$$ # @% @! My God, it never ended! ..... I remember having rather kissed the movie of the movie, and then sat down again through this one. <br /> <br /> But what do you expect? Most people with the brain power to look for reviews will not be the target audience - so you'll see Pirites 2 again, or the Jet Lee one. If you talk to yourself. Look, this movie will only cost you your soul, your money, your energy and your brain cells. KEEP THE WARNING.
