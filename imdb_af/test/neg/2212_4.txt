Yes, it may not be for adults, and some adults may find it stupid, but if you don't think about it, it's really not that bad. <br /> <br /> The story has Alvin and his gang, world, looking for jewels for a bad person, and the misadventures with which they come into contact. <br /> <br /> So the animation is good, and the story is cute, and the songs are forgotten, but it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 6 out of 10 or *** out of 4 stars.
