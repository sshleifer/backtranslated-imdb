There is really no reasoning about this show. To put it simply, it's just awful. Absolutely terrible. It's just a terrible "reality" show. Not only that, it's terrible fiction. <br /> <br /> Imagine: A lot of excessive imaginative teens come and go one night "Hey! Let's make a paranormal show just like" Ghost Hunters "and what not!" So they grab a camera, lure locals and movie random landscapes behind a painfully "try-to-dramatic but non-failed" monologue. This show is basically a lot of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a very bad horror documentary. The only difference is that this show actually has a budget and writers. A wasted budget and horrible writers. <br /> <br /> Oh, the problems, how do I count you? Well, first, let's talk it from a personal level. I'm not totally skeptical when it comes to paranormal. I'm willing to believe in what paranormal and what not, and I'm sure there are many people who feel the same. So, if you are going to do a show on the paranormal, you have to convince the viewer that what they see is paranormal or not, because the viewer can easily believe otherwise. I hate to compare, but I don't see why not at this point. Take "Ghost Hunters" for example. In "Ghost Hunters" you can see that the cast is similar to the audience. They are not quite skeptical, but they are still prepared to keep in mind the possibility of any paranormal disorders. They have to look at something and be prepared to say "it's possible it's just nothing." And with that in mind, they tried to try to prove themselves wrong. They use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal, with the fact that what they monitor can be nothing in mind. Not only are they trying to convince themselves what is real and what is not, in the process they try to convince you. That element of doubt is not present in the "Paranormal State". Strike one. <br /> <br /> In the "Paranormal State" the cast simply says, "There is this haunting place, and it's HAUNTED, so we're going to find some SPIRIT!" And immediately you know and say to yourself, "Oh, convince me differently." The cast is not professional in their interviews. In fact, sometimes they seem to be harming local residents of these so-called "ghost" areas. They have no real evidence to build their claims, except assumptions and theories, and the best they can be is someone who "claims" to contact the dead. There is no one who ever knows who this person is and how valid they really are. . They could easily have picked a random person out of the street and said, "pretend to be able to contact spirits for our performance" and have gone along. It just happens in the "Mothman" episode. Without any convincing evidence at the end of the performance, they bring out this kind of individual where he is a random, painfully written passage from a supposed part of how something "ghosts" is to convince his audience. Very, very poor attempt. I feel that one of the biggest problems with the show is that it is written. During one of the episodes, the roll is sometimes attacked by one of these "paranormal disorders" in an attempt to be dramatic. These kind of dramatic sequences will make any skeptical laugh and even those on the fence realize what they're watching is just a bunch of the tabloid-esquire trash. If the purpose of the show was to convince their audience that these "paranormal" events were real, they did a devastatingly poor job doing it. Stop two. <br /> <br /> However, there is always a counter. Just one last view to see if the show is really worth something. What if the show doesn't try to convince you that these paranormal events are real and just try to entertain you with good fiction? It even misses that level. If the author's creators are trying to make fiction to entertain his audience, the writing is too poor and even on a fictional level, it fails to hear its members truly experiencing the unknown in all its full glory. The writing is simply not compelling and even dare I say, boring. Strike three. <br /> <br /> So what remnants of this show are just a lot of teenagers who are too willing or too faithful to believe in the paranormal, simply because it is much more surprising than the reality with a camera exhibited. , a bad writing and bad actors generally making only a very bad horror documentary. That's all the show is at this point. There is no reason to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there is no need to care about it. To be blunt, its lame. There is absolutely no reasoning about this performance.
