From the portrayal of Andy Warhol in the movies I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the type of movie I predict Andy Warhol can make - air, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The movie's (almost non-existent) plot, which is sometimes incredibly incredible, is set off by the movie's rough, real cinematography. The movie has a way of being unreal, but reality dictates the viewer. The only valuable part of the movie is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly and every thing that has to be regarded as a characterization device. There are a few comic scenes I admit are funny, but Trash is just about a character study of the disconnection of people who are generously pleasant if you don't care about nudity and i.v. drug use.
