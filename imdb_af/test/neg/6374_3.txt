Of course I'm disappointed, so I'll be short and won't waste your time. First, the plot was uninspired ... at least. The animation was even worse, we were in God for 2008 and it looks like a cleaner version of G.I.Joe. I will not even harm the character of the actors' performance and the dialogues. Or maybe I will because I just saw that in order to comment here, you need 10 lines (?! ??!?!). Where were we? Oh yes, the show, well, it was completely flat, without passion and talent when I was excused. Now, as for the dialogues, like the acting, no memorable quotes, nothing that anyone would expect. Let's just hope the movie will be decent ... at least.
