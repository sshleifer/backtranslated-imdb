First Off Acting is so horrible except for the actor who plays Spencer. Mirinda Cosgrove does not deserve her own show. She must have Stick with Drake and Josh. The only person I want except Spencer Is Nebula Hes Super Bad @ $$ He Kicks Carlys Crews @ $$ And I Enjoyed It <br /> <br /> The Episode I Hate Many Is Imybysstfan I Hate That A Young Icaly Fan She Killed Me Myself Fake Is A Good Word To Describe It Shouldn't Look Nothing On TV Is Going Good With Classic Like Family Relationships Good Show Ban Icarly Let's All Go Back To Doug Nick Version Please Please Don't Watch I Hate Icarly Oh Also Nathan Kress Is A Wannabee Fredie Highmore
