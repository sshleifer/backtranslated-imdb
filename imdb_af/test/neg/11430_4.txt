Irvine Welsh's follow-up to Trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories in Edinburgh, all with a few Welsh brands, drug culture, depression, the working class and the Hibernic football club. Unfortunately, looking at places, it's no less than very well written, 2 of the stories have a dark comical twist on them, while the 2nd story is a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot. Will not appeal to most, including myself to a point, but will undoubtedly follow a cult.
