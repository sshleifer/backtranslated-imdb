Minnesota's feelings aren't really a road movie, but it's still the best categorization I can generate. A road movie does not depend mainly on a big story, and since the plot of this movie is really pathetic, it fulfills the description. To be so interesting, such a movie must rely entirely on moving and intriguing characters, and on the chemistry between them. Unfortunately, Feeling Minnesota's staff fail to create this excitement. <br /> <br /> The initial presentation of the characters is unsatisfactory and confusing; For example, I cannot find out whether Jjaks (Keanu Reeves) grew up in the house of his mother and brother or not. It is said by his mother (Tuesday Weld) that he must stay with his father, but nothing in the film indicates that it ever happens. The same goes for the rest of the characters - I never know them. They look irrational, and it doesn't really explain why they do it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I leave the movie without any feelings for the characters except dull and perhaps a small shock of attraction to the cute Cameron Diaz.
