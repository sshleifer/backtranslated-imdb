To start with, I really love Lucy. Her TV show still makes me laugh. She was one of the greatest comedians ever to live with Chaplin and Keaton. But her performance in this movie is disappointing. She was too old, and the mesh filters on the lens made her look like a London mistress. She couldn't sing, and her voice was so froggy that she'd crossed every song. Her dance days were long in the past. Just because you're a Lucy fan, don't be glamorous about this wrong, sad performance and sing it praise. I prefer to remember Lucy in her wonderful TV series (I Love Lucy) and draw the curtain of charity about the terrible mess of a movie called "Mame".
