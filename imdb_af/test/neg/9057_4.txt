I didn't hate this one. I just couldn't adjust to the story. it didn't really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director, but I have to disagree with his methods in this. I'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. Some of the projects he participated in are pretty junk, but his play is brilliant. my favorite Daniel Day Lewis movies are there will be blood and gangs of New York. <br /> <br /> There was one thing I loved and that was the musical score, it gave the movie a lot of atmosphere. That's all I liked about it. This movie also has a high voice that is a bit random. I can see that a few people will like this, but not enough to make the overall assessment. 7.8. <br /> <br /> I would miss this movie if I were you, but there are very high voices for this so I think you should see it and make your own views on what you think. I didn't really like it ... 4/10 ............. j.d Seaton
