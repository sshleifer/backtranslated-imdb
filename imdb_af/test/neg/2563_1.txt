Steven Seagal played in many action movies. Most of them were bad but not bad as the patriot. This one is a low-budget Z series movie. After the operation Delta Force, Deed of War, Replacement 2, Plato's Run, Base, Drive, Sabotage, etc., the Patriot comes. Steven Seagal is now considered a bad actor such as Mark Dacascos, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Treat Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The scenario was full of holes and the characters were not realistic (perhaps because of the very bad actors) and the $ 4.25 you spend by renting The Patriot is called Lost Money !!! I give it 0 and a half (for the laugh) out of 5.
