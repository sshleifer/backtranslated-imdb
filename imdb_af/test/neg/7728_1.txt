I didn't have the chance to see the previous movie, but from what I read on other posts, it was worse than that, although I doubt it is possible. I am a huge fan of the "Zombie" genre, and I am fascinated by the psychological aspects of the view of beings, which are for all purposes human, as a horror thing that is just worth shooting in the head . It says, HOTD 2 takes the "Zombie" movie to a whole new layer. <br /> <br /> Without giving any big spoilers (which I really should do just that, you won't bother to waste your time watching this movie.) I want to express my utmost contempt for the way in which the authors of this film portray our countries with special powers. Gomer Pile could probably have survived longer than the "Spes Ops" soldiers in this movie. To cry out loud, they had to call them the Special Education Forces instead. If you write a script in which you send an elite team to handle an outbreak of zombies, the soldiers should at least be smarter than the running bodies. I understand you have to kill some or most of the team, but you can find better ways to do this than to put their machine guns down and walk around a gentle hand on the shoulder of the drunken crazy person to rock. and back in the corner of the dark, spectacular cellar. <br /> <br /> The writers are actually trying to take the whole zombie thing to a more high-tech level by making it a virus they are looking for, and that idea has merit, it did not catch in the middle of such a ridiculous performance of brave movie filming. I mean come on, zombie films aren't really 'high art', and the viewer expects a little cheesiness in the cheek with the gore and excitement, but HOTD 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel into horror. and awe of the mere stupidity of the characters. If you are a zombie movie fan like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.
