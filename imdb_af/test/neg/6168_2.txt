Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ..... Not a bad role in my opinion, but they were totally messed up in this movie. <br /> <br /> There was no right direction, there was no unusual twist, in fact, the whole movie was very predictable from the very end of the game. Mickey Rourke had a very annoying sidekick that didn't do anything, but irritated you from the start. Rosario Dawson was completely wasted and there was almost no point in even her character in the film. <br /> <br /> I really believe it is one of those straightforward DVD movies that everyone will forget very quickly which is a shame because the movie could have been so much better.
