This is my opinion of this movie, expressed in his dialogues. <br /> <br /> To be more serious, I can't say this movie is a bad moment, but I didn't enjoy it either. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was simply indifferent and I couldn't find my mind in the monkey world. Although the makeup is very realistic, the constant scream was irritating. May the movie have changed monkeys for cats and this is a cult movie in relation to my love of the latter. <br /> <br /> The second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of the newcomers (Macdowell & Lambert), but I felt alienated: the whole story is located in a large British mansion: no matter how luxurious it is, it was like a jail to me. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this can be a good thing. Adjusting the Burroughs' story of Tarzan? I don't know, I've never read the book (or seen the Disney): <br /> <br /> Finally, I have no good moments to remember, so one look will be enough for me. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I had to guess my boredom after the endless freezing "Overture". What is the meaning? Only the director knows this.
