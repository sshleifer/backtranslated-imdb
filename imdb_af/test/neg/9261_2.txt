A few years ago I bought this movie for 99 cents at K-mart (along with "Hawken's Breed") anything with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is worth so much. It wasn't. "Dark Obsession" (the title I bought it) was a slight cut above Hawken's Broad (IMBD rated on 2.4), but not enough to allow me to even keep it in the house. I threw both movies in the trash. <br /> <br /> This thing fails at so many levels, it's hard to cut it off, but let's say it's soft, incredible, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even 100 minutes, too long. <br /> <br /> I like Byrne as an actor, but this shock really looks bad on his CV.
