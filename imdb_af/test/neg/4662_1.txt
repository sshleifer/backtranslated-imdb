This movie is one of the worst action flashes ever produced, and it is incredibly impossible in every way. It is a relentless, non-stop-over-the-explosive melodrama. The pace is constantly feverish, and all the action and actors are gripped by total hysteria. It is just as irreconcilable, and a spot - nay, a stain - on the careers of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself, leading to a movie where you just go "Come on!" all the time. The institution and events are impossible to even take seriously. I can only rate this horror 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good asteroid movie, see Deep Impact, which is intense, sensitive and thorough. Everything is Armageddon.
