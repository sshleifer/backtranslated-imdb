It may well be the worst movie made by everyone, who actually took himself seriously. And not because of the acting, because I'm an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best, just to have escaped electric cramp after the principle of photography was applied. To be one of the 57 people who saw this movie in release, I have to say that I have never before experienced a movie where the movie ended, rolled credits, entered the house lights and nobody moved from their seats. About five minutes to the house the lights came up, and they started coming out of their comas to look around, and I think most of us thought, okay we got it, it was a joke, right? They are going to show the right movie now. Eventually, after the wehers came out and swore an oath of secrecy to never admit that we were there, we felt safe to leave and pray that we would not be seen. I saw pretty nice movies in my day (I have Cinemax for the sake of goodness), but I'm still bitter that I could never visit the two or so hours of my life I lost.
