If I think Bollywood. I think lite feels good musical dance numbers, with beautiful outfits on the men and women. And catchy songs. Horror, Thrillers, Mystery and Suspense, however, do not occur. And this, to my Western eyes, is like an abstract comedy. <br /> <br /> I think it would be a better movie, shorter, even if the author and the director made a definite choice. Whether it's entirely for Thriller-Horror, Comedy-Mystery, Supernatural-Suspense or Musical-Romance, instead of an awkward mix of them all. <br /> <br /> I should say more than once that I thought the director should have seen, "I know what you did last summer" and try to give it a Bollywood spin. My first movie was Bride & Bias. What I thought was good. <br /> <br /> A Western audience seemed to be considering a straight to video cheese party. <br /> <br /> The play was on top, sometimes it felt like they were deliberately trying to try parody of Western thrillers, but when you saw them, trying to spray the dramatic cry, scream or fear, it didn't feel. <br /> <br /> The viewer wondered how one of the actors would cut the camera. More than a few times when the audience was indignant, we could just make an absurdity. <br /> <br /> I watch many foreign films, and although I don't know Hindi, I have to say they did a bad job endorsing the movie. Sometimes it was difficult to read the white letters against the shiny background. <br /> <br /> The villain was especially amusing, at least for me, because he came with his own mood music. The supposedly surprising twist actually felt like a policeman. <br /> <br /> The main couples were attractive / nice enough, and the musical numbers were worth my rental. I propose this to someone as a musical comedy, but I will tell them to just progress the rest of the movie, because it wasn't worth reading. If you're determined to read a whole subtitled Hindi movie, look at the superior Romantic Drama 'Namasteay, London'. <br /> <br /> But I wasn't afraid. That's really what they think is terrible in India. 1 out of 10 for which it is named. 6 out of 10 because it is unintentional speed and the ability to laugh illegally, and that is musical / dance numbers. Enjoy :)
