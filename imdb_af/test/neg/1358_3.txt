Every once in a while comes an indie along with an incredible cast and a story that looks very interesting and can't miss, but sucks the movie. Some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are "Levity" and "The Safety of Objects", and now here is the United States of Leland. <br /> <br /> Together with awesome cast include Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald, the teenage son of a well-known author (Spacey) who commits a disturbing and unforgiving crime (killing a delayed child), but doesn't remember it and doesn't seem to have a motive. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle plays a youth room teacher who is trying to understand Leland (and also exploits him by writing a book about him), and Jena Malone is his former friend. We see their deteriorating relationship (as a result of her heroic addiction) springing back. Sounds like a wonderful little drama, huh? I also thought so. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie is bad, badly written. The dialogue and narration is painfully pretentious and fraught with annoying platitudes about "life", the characters are all two-dimensional indie clich√©s. And while it makes Leland sympathetic in some ways, it shines on its crime. <br /> <br /> For the most part, there is no problem with the acting. Gosling (who was the Oscar-worthy in "The Believer") is an incredibly talented young actor, but the way they are written is not one of these characters (at least of Leland) even as real people, so there is not much he can do. do but mourn its ridiculous lines and look sad. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is the most memorable. She has one of the most expressive faces I have ever seen. Even if an underlined character plays in a bad movie like this, she can break your heart with one look. When she has good material to work with (such as "Donnie Darko" or "The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys"), she's really great. <br /> <br /> But that's not good material. Perhaps after a massive rewriting, it could have been worth something, but as it is, the United States of Leland is extremely, inert and for a movie that seems to fall in love with how deep it is, it's very shallow.
