Personally, I have no problem with the acting or the writing. I have a problem with the giant bird. It was simply AWFUL. Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> One of the first impulses is the role of laughing when you see it. What did they think? Budget is condemned. The monster bird was a monstrous joke. <br /> <br /> Of course, in my opinion, as producer actors such as Ankrum, Corday and Morrow could get, they would have the special effect, people are getting much better. animal. Oh good. What is done is done. It will be the eternal joke that was unintentional.
