Like anyone who bought it, I was immersed in the 20 pieces of extreme gore and banned in 20 countries or whatever it says in the box. I have to admit I'm a big gore fan and I'm always surprised if movies can put it on thick and convincing. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are the best in the business. The revolutionary makeup effects in the 80's. Today you do not need them, as everything is done on the computer. But computers can't compare to the visual wizard that these three men could stand up. But I'm going out. <br /> <br /> If you watch fantastic movies such as Fulci's Gates to Hell, or even Savini's crown performance, Friday 13th Final Chapter, you can really appreciate making a fantastic movie. You can't tell the difference between reality and magic. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox, but the gore seemingly omnipotent in this movie. If this is why you are looking for this movie, you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers have noticed, most of the gore are a wake-up call. You don't see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see what it looks like next. <br /> <br /> The gore? Well, it's here, but not as much as you can expect. A man is castrated and a woman is hanged by her breasts, but other than those two scenes, and one that involves a scandal; there is nothing really more about this movie. The screens of gore even mentioned in these three are quite fairly compared to what you had hoped for. Maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre, but I expected a little more. Call me sick or turned, but isn't that the only reason people watch this movie in the first place? Cannibal Ferox is just another movie trying to capitalize on a craze of a superior movie. While the Cannibal Holocaust isn't exactly a good movie, it's much better than these trips. If you get out of the way to buy it for $ 20.00, you will feel cheated. <br /> <br /> 3/10
