The filmmakers went well to find ONLY the following demographics: Palestinians who have the appearance of peace-loving, resolving-seeking will, Palestinians (especially older women and families with children) who are particularly weakened by security fences and Israelis who are not in the security fence do not believe, sympathize with the alleged effect on Palestinians and consider it unnecessary division and / or waste of money. Oh yes, they sit in one member of the Israeli government that supports the fence, but they do what they can to put him as inhuman and unpleasant. Ask him many leading questions that are really statements (eg "The wall is bad for the environment ... it destroys everything"). <br /> <br /> I have presented no problem with any (good, most) of this in the movie. However, I can be very different with the people they support, their opinion is valid enough for a documentary. However, there are at least two sides in the case of Israel's security fence. And despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of Israelis (and many others) support the construction of the fence and believe that it has an overall positive impact, this "documentary" does not offer the opinion of even ONE such person no. They even go as far as questioning an Israeli Jew who claims "all Israelis support the fence" and are so insane and refuse to even support one of the "crazy" Israelites. Oh, and to put it all down, they set the tone for the film by supporting some young Israeli children (really exceptions to the rule - I was there) laughing at their Arab neighbors all over the fence. <br /> <br /> A "documentary" is a film that explores a problem and provides a full range of facts, opinions and perspectives. Unfortunately, this is not a documentary. It's an unlimited PROPAGANDA FILM that clearly offers a battery of support for just one side of a heavily disputed, emotionally and politically charged issue. It's no longer a documentary than, say, Fahrenheit 9/11.
