Laughable would be a good term to describe this movie. But since this movie deserves nothing good, I will use the term godly instead. <br /> <br /> Center around the adventures of a bunch of eco-warriors investigating the deadly act of the army. A semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget is becoming clear. Michael Pare (a real actor! But just in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) led a bunch of fools through a series of monster-and-gobble-uncomfortable victims. There are some vague pseudo-scientific attempts to explain the presence of the giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer as well as the acting. <br /> <br /> As if it doesn't insult the viewer, The movie also contains what I call "Guns of never-ending ammunition". I never saw Mickey Parrot or his female sidekick change clips once during the whole movie, but I can positively report them at least 40 laps each in any scene where they have to fire their weapon. Forty rounds may not look that much, but we are talking standard handguns here. I find 15 round clip tops. And remember, they never change cuts, and even seem to have no extra ammunition. <br /> <br /> It's stupid like these that send movies to the eternal fires of celluloid hell, and rightly so. The third-class CGI does little to help, and the acting is the best laugh, otherwise you will start crying. Why SciFi Channel repeatedly crawls this kiss is anyone's guess. <br /> <br /> My advice .... give this one a wide cab ... a very wide cabin!
