It was one of the shows I wanted to follow. But, I couldn't bring myself on my show. To have a show that focuses on the subject of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to get the mood of the show, such as the "West Wing" or "Commander-in-Chief". improve. Rob Lowe was OK, but actors like Kyle Chandler just couldn't act (he was terrible in the "Early Edition"). It was a pain to sit down through this show. With its lack of tension, urgency and characters that can actually act, I just had to give up on this show and I'm glad it was canceled so I wouldn't miss any more. <br /> <br /> Grade D-
