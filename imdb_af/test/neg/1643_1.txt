Yes, this movie is obviously trying to be a Conan the Barbarian, and what astonishment is that it is a successor (the people asked another?). The first part of the movie is a look back that shows the original. From what I saw, it doesn't seem worth checking out (and apparently Ator always kills a big puppet in his movies). Well, Ator stays at the end of the earth with his stupid sidekick Thong. A girl seeks his help because this evil man has her father in his custody. Let me just say this bad man is extremely patient, as the old man constantly insults the villian and just speaks endlessly. The bad man waits until the end of the movie and finally the old man beats you to wonder: "What has taken him so long to grasp?" Meanwhile, Ator and his sidekick and the gal are going through one adventure to another. They fight cave dwellers, invisible soldiers (don't ask), hire a boyfriend and people who worship snakes. Ator also struggles with a giant snake doll and hang glide (again, don't ask). All the time you will think that Conan Ator's buttocks would kick.
