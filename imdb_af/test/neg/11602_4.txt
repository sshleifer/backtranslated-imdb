It was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it seems he would still be in a pattern of consistency, changing the faithful adaptation of Rebecca's classic novel, spying on foreign correspondent spy and now this romantic comedy in shape of the "screwball" photos of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, has so far been consistent in something, so much so that it couldn't (or at least reluctantly) deviate from it. It was then unwise that he would walk outside his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. In Rebecca, it was really great to see Hitchcock limited by his manufacturer and the source text. He forced his technique to turn into a heavy gothic drama, but for Mr and Mrs Smith there is a big difference between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was not an Ernst Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> First, look at the romantic corner. The best love scenes in Hitchcock movies were wild, passionate and slightly dangerous ?? the "ever fell in love with someone you didn't have to?" situation, and he was great at portraying it. It's something a lot of earlier film, Rich and Strange, makes one of the few Hitchcock non-thrillers really working. However, Hitch is not so good, but when it comes to a more soft and familiar love story. A light, soft touch is needed and Hitch doesn't. <br /> <br /> Second, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock movies can be funny ?? The Lady Vanishes is probably the best example? but only when the jokes are sprinkled by the story. The master of tension is simply not enough of a comedy director to create a funny-legged movie. He cuts screens as he would in a thriller would snappy opposing corners of people talking, including close-ups of hands and feet, point-of-view shots? but don't cater for comic timing or focus on gags. For example, the business with Carole Lombard's seemingly dress is shown to us with some close-ups, but it's more time to reveal an important plot point and have no comic impact. Sometimes Hitchcock's style is like the comedy? for example, the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club, where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look like he is at the handsome, sophisticated woman at the next table? but such moments are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Even the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith is not standard. I'm not sure it was Robert Montgomery's power, and he's boring here. Of course, this was exactly where Carole Lombard's power lies, and although she is clearly acting well, the screens are simply not aimed at recording performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be hilarious if he was really allowed to go in front of the camera, failed to solve things at all. Of course, none of these fine comedy actors are helped by the script, which doesn't even burst at first, even though the basic story is a pretty good starting point. <br /> <br /> The only full-on comedy Hitchcock made after it was trouble with Harry, and worked that kind because it played on his familiar tensions. But it was only when the story could exist independently of humor, when the basic framework was tension? as it is in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot ?? that Hitchcock was able to do comedy well.
