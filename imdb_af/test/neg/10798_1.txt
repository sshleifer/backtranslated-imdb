In fact, if the direction was better and cast as better actors, it could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> But with all these problems, "Soultaker" fails to even sort of passionate as a horror movie, plus the pacing is just awful. <br /> <br /> The MST crew had fun with this one, but it was certainly not one of their better efforts. 5 for that, nothing for the original.
