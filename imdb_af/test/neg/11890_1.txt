I was forced to watch this movie for my World Reigonal Geography class. This film is what is wrong with America today, instead of finding the best out of difficult times or situations, we would rather complain about how it is someone's fault. This movie goes through the downfall of Flint, Michigan and blames it 100% on General Motors. Moore is in the process of doing this to make General Motors' rogues just because they do their job in a capitalist society. Moore rolls several evictions throughout the film and does not even ask the person to be evicted as a result of a GM dismissal. In addition, he never maintains the landlords of the tenants filmed. Moore is largely about to distort historical events to fit his political agenda into this pure propaganda film.
