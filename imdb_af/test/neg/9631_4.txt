By 1971, it was increasingly clear that Hammer was filming movie studios. HANDS OF THE RIPPER is a case in point where even the idea of ​​despair hits - The spirit of Jack The Ripper has his own daughter! Yes, okay, no one expected a documentary, but this plot looks like the bottom of the bar has been scrapped for stupid rules and you find yourself questioning why producers Jack The Ripper brought on stage. Was it to give the movie a funny title? <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are unimportant and cinematography gives the whole movie a cheap TVM feel, but you know you're not going to see a classic Hammer horror as the title starts because the music is laughing . inappropriate. I think the composer tried to make the theme, haunting and touching, but the music looks like something from a smooth romantic movie. I will give some credit because they take their roles seriously which is far from serious film. <br /> <br /> I didn't really enjoy this movie and it immediately reminded me of The Two Ronnies Phantom Raspberry Blower Of London Town which I laughed in the weeks before I saw it
