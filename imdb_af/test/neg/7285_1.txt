I'm sorry to say that, but I didn't enjoy this movie at all. It was just too boring. So boring that I couldn't see the rest of it. It's not as interesting as the Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate these stupid days because these days are just not what they used to be. The movies that Disney recently released are really sucking! I miss the old days when they use good movies like Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, The Aristocats, and Robin Hood. This movie is really awful. I really tried my best to be interested in this movie, but I couldn't. I don't think I can recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the one I just mentioned above.
