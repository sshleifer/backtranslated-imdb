I love Wes Studi and especially Adam Beach, but who is this movie a little pretentious. Ponderously slow. Too cryptic to the point of eclipse, not because the plot justifies it, but because there is virtually no plot. Even less in the way of characterization. It's almost like one of those creaking old Charlie Chan mysteries (the cheaper Monogram studio versions) with many red herring and oddball characters (like the old ex-senator with the many past who are now a refuge) and many are killed. about objets d'art you wouldn't see twice in the mall. Great scenery, though. There are also beautiful hairs on the redhead, although I never found out what she was doing in this. My wife couldn't. Sheesh, at least the old B movies, had the decency short.
