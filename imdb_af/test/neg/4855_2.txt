Although this film had much praise, I found it personally boring. There are some good Brazilian sunsets and the characters are credible, but the story of how they hold each other, even though it is very unusual according to our standards, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie for so long. The central woman takes one man to another in a close way and places the interests of her children first. As the tolerance of the different men extends, we see their characters develop. The story unfolds with dignity and is supported by excellent acting. It's a rare sight in the Brazilian interior, far from the city, but almost exciting enough to keep your eyes open.
