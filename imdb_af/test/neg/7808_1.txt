This film made me so angry because of his stupidity that I needed to create an account on IMDb to share my opinion with you. I like Ashton Kutcher in "Lots of Love" and therefore I still wanted to see this movie, despite the current 4.2 rating. It is highly overrated. I trusted that an actor (any of them) would judge the writing and would not agree to participate in such a low / now quality production. It is very disappointing. Home theme is much better used in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo". Things that didn't make sense here: fist of everyone, the home owner leaves his precious pet with someone who knows nothing about taking care of it. Secondly, the rule is to leave no one in the house, but the housewife fails to follow this simple rule. The door is not locked? And so on ..
