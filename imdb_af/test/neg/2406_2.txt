This movie is worse than Cat People, which I saw in the same week. It has all the 80's style. MTV punk rockers, the real people who are anti-social, not today's PC commercial type, frat boys, and a bad man called Splater. I really like Splater, and the movie feels that 80's blue lighting, but the rest looks like a low budget Canadian budget. I saw so much of this while living in this big country and realizing that these types of movies were made because of tax breaks. Avoid at all costs.
