Everyone knows that late night movies are not Oscar contenders. Fine. I mean, I will admit that I have some tips and bored and figured out, I want to get some skin-a-max. It's pretty bad when the information on the TV guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. It even gave it half a star. To be fair, I threw the whole thing, because man was soooooooooo bad. I couldn't stop laughing. I mean the words that come from these people's mouths and how they try to be serious. Most of the time I think the people on the screen are trying hard to laugh. In fact, I think in one scene they laughed. Anyway, the movie didn't make sense. It was like the one Sopranos episode with the fat gay man. Only the Sopranos is a good show. But it was terrible, I mean, no nudity, just sex scenes from the 90's. You know the kind that uses shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh. I gave it a two reason because this movie makes for a good movie. I mean with all the cheese, it helps to get the wine out. If it's late at night, and everything on TV, and this Tony Little man and his exercise bike, I suggest Tony Little.
