I absolutely cannot believe my fellow IMDb reviewers. All the praise for how "original" this movie is is that they have never seen "Ring" or the million imitations that came out in the 10 years since that movie. And some of them claim to be horror movie buffs! I do not think so! "Shutter" is okay. On average, I would say. I give it 5 out of 10, but there's just no way to say it was original and great and "the most scary thing I've ever seen" as one reviewer said. Puh-leeeze, people. This one is clear. This is predictable. <br /> <br /> I swear if I see another ghost film where the hero tracks the hidden tracks to find out why she is so crazy and to them I will scream. br /> <br /> "Original"? Give me a chance. Your people must get more out. Or at least stop calling yourself horror movie fans.
