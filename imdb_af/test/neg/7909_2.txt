I totally agree with Greg in Ontario. I saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theater manager and told him "It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen." I saw quite a few movies with this person, and he's pretty forgiving, so I was really shocked. (The driver gave him a free pass!) <br /> <br /> I was insulted by lots of humor in the movie (yes, the baked potato scene was at the top of the list!). My friend and I are white and have seen the movie with a mainly black audience. For a while I thought, maybe I'll just get this movie because I'm white. Then I realized that no one was laughing. The writing was bad; the direction was bad; the timing was almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> There were a few funny moments, there was just WAY too much time between them. Even plane Two was harder than that, and it says a lot. <br /> <br /> I was so excited by Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (as Huggy Bear) that I felt I was sure to enjoy this movie. No. <br /> <br /> DL Hughley was funny as usual, but his role was rather small. Tom Arnold had a few funny moments as the "white man", but most other attempts at humor fell short of the point. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I couldn't rate this movie with negative stars.
