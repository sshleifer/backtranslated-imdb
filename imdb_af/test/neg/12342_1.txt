It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Unless you are in masochism, you should never see it. It was an indifferent long, senseless, eye-catching, depressing movie and will forever list my bad movies. Whoever wrote this movie is a sadistic one. I almost cried, that's how bad it was. I want to give it zero stars, but since it is not an option, I give it one.
