There may be some SPOILERS, but I doubt it. I have no idea how the script for this one made it past the shredder. It's awful. Completely unfit. I hung there for 45 minutes (about half of the run) and couldn't stand it anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fan in the 90's (see "The War") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's bubbly shifts to enjoy this year seriously (see "Chasing Liberty" which is surprisingly entertaining). I saw pieces of "Run Lola Run". So with three leads I was good. It wasn't. Nobody made a good performance. Wood's Jones was flat. For an aspiring writer, he had no imagination (his violent fantasies seemed to be ripped off a Christmas story and his lusts were - a cross between boring and disturbing). Potatoes are absolutely unlikely from the first second and I just want to know that she was supposed to be the "girl" by reading the box. Speaking of the synopsis - everyone who hired them made the movie sound, funny, romantic, and very enjoyable. Whoever was that person, he or she had to have employed this rewrite. At half the point, I didn't care about any of the characters. Moore's Lisa is an aspiring actress who is bumpy and a little conniving (for no apparent reason), but her ridiculous period play (which is supposed to be funny in presentation) is on the same scale as the rest of the script . There is supposedly a happy, romantic comedy that ends on this turkey - given the character material they had to work with, I just can't see it. Save your money. Warn your friends. Don't watch this movie.
