This movie is not quite funny to me, and I can imagine it being offensive to Jewish people. (and I'm not Jewish) Why? First, the whole movie depicts starring Zucker as a lousy / deceptive running business and, while his son is gay, his daughter is lesbian, and his cousin is a slut. Then there is the turbulent relationship that happens in the family, first his daughter with his Joshua and Jana, and then his son with his cousin. Two family-related blood relationships. I'm surprised they didn't add the plot of a mentally handicapped family to the family. Now it would really complete the Nazi ideal submens! (gay, lesbian, jew ...) <br /> <br /> Completely disgusting movie. I am surprised this movie gets no answer from any Jewish community.
