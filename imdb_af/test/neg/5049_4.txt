A cowardly thriller in which a group of students abducted their bad and neurotic teacher (Mirren) to prevent her actions against them. An interesting starting point can be a good movie, but this one is just lame and far-fetched. Drilling with a finite embarrassment, just to say the least. Mrs. Mirren tries to give this warning some dignity, but even she - a good actress, without a doubt - can save this garbage. I give it a 4 (four).
