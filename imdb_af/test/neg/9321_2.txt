First let me start by saying that I predicted this movie's release for a while. After getting the chance to see it last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine that a movie that can make last season's "Exorcist: The Beginning" looks good, but "Dominion" just does it. No wait ... it makes it like a BIG movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I was too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the decline. The idea that Warner Bros. two versions of what actually release the same movie within six months, was an exciting attraction. I'm also a big fan of Stellan Skarsgard, and in the right way he gives a good performance, despite the often ridiculous content of the movie. On the other hand, the supporting film in this movie is uncomfortable. Clara Bellar just seems to be one expression - white, staring, and delivers all her lines with the same monotonous tone, while Gabrielle Mann's father Frances is not ridiculous. The effect in this film is at best ridiculous and its mere fake is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This movie got more bruised than anything else, and with the exception of a real cold shot that lasted about three seconds and my friend covered her eyes and throat, it didn't do anything in the fright. I can go in more detail and possibly give a treat, but frankly I am too tired to think about how bad this movie was to write everything I wanted to say. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the movie tried to give ... a story about a priest who lost his faith and that then recovered after arriving with his troubled past ... has great potential, especially with Skarsgard as leading man. Unfortunately, that potential is wasted. Just look at this movie if you're really curious about how the Harlin version differs, but don't expect to see a good movie, or you'll regret your money and two hours of life. Otherwise, be satisfied with the version that was first released and continue.
