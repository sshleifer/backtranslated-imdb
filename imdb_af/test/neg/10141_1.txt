it's really an "okay" series. Everyone in it is pretty good. but I just can't take Reba. she's trying to be funny, but she's just not and then she had a stupid accent !! if they took her out of the show, I'd love to see it every day. <br /> <br /> I watched the show in ten minutes and, as I have already said, Reba destroyed the show. but the 20 year old man (does not know his name), but he is so funny, and he really saves it. <br /> <br /> So here's the recipe to get a good show. kicks Reba off and puts the 20-year-old star in the lead. <br /> <br /> I really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks (like me) that they should kick Reba from the show and starring someone else
