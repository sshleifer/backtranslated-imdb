Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, in his homeland at least, for his Japanese gang films, a series with which this movie shares a number of features. Violence and political intrigues are themes in both Shogun's Samurai and Battles without Honor and People, and both have a main character who has challenged his loyalty by treason. Both movies also contain a large number of characters who have little purpose, but to die, and as little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they come. This movie also has other errors. The makeup, costumes and sound design are distractingly poor, and the battle scenes were also substandard, inferior to other Samurai films of previous years (Seven Samurai appear). <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba plays the Sonny Chiba character in Shogun's Samurai, the no-nonsense master swordsman stretching through the film, frightening. What a man; he even gets an eye spot. If you expected to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you might be disappointed; its appearance is slightly more than a cameo, and only when it appears that its character can do something interesting, it disappears for good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the strengths of the film are his story, which is infinitely more understandable than the gangster movies, and the challenges posed by traditional concepts of good and evil. Two brothers were challenged for the throne of their recently departed father, who might have had relief on his way out. Early on, we seem to be confronted with a few characters who can't be more clearly and well-behaved; In fact, the older brother stems and has a birthplace, the sure sign of a villain. Eventually, however, it becomes clear that in a winner-all-struggle for power, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.
