I love documentaries. They are one of my favorite genres of film. Before I saw this movie, I didn't see one I didn't like. <br /> <br /> The premise for this movie is a wonderful one. The performance is well done. There were a few times early when I laughed and smiled. Still, the movie has become more annoying and annoying. It could have been something special if the subject wasn't such an artificial, childish, unclear pitz. I appreciate his passion for the movie, but quit your whining. If you are short on funds, you may not have so many children, or spend so much money on alcohol. Maybe you should have gone to the film school, or at least graduated from high school. Maybe you should have lived life and got perspective and experiences that can add your vision. <br /> <br /> There are so many people out there with stories that are interesting, funny and funny. To see this man who's chosen for any of them is nothing less than crass. If you want to do a documentary on a movie maker, why not do someone on China or Iran, a movie maker with REAL problems? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: <br /> <br /> Who takes a kid to see Apocalypse now? <br /> <br /> How many times did this man say "man"?
