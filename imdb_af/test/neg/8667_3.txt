For a teen who has never read Austen, this adjustment can be good. But just for them. This is a diverse "Cliff Notes" version of Mansfield Park, and if you haven't seen another version or have read the books, parts of it will be scramble. <br /> <br /> Why was it so difficult to make a good adjustment to this book? The one in the 1990s had so many freedoms that it was hardly the same book - the mindset was completely modern and prurient. <br /> <br /> Here's our Billie Piper that looks like a beautiful landmark. She has a beautiful personality that develops nicely - but she has blonde hair with black eyebrows and - by much of the cock - dark brown roots. So much for pristine cousin. It is incredibly distracting, and the rest of the role is in the greasy hair, crumpled genre that shows a real lack of respect for the accuracy of the era. <br /> <br /> One thing is good here - Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford of all versions. She is perfect, flirtatious, without being modern or suggestive, flippant and completely without any moral or ethical compass. Henry here is really good enough to be a little temptation for our heroine. <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in the story and actually drives her boring to her last scene. meaningful. This is just a production that really missed the point, a real layer for Austen fans. <br /> <br /> The only usable version is the one with odd duck (perfect for the role) Sylvestra La Touzel (despite the very gay Henry Crawford - he's just laughable).
