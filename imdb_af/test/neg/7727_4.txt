Granted, HOTD 2 is better than the first Bold crapfest, but it's like saying drowning is better than being hooked alive. OK OK, I'm a little difficult with this one, it's just that the Video Game adjustments of Zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth. Resident Evil was good, but his successors are pure junk. The first HOTD was more than anything else to entertain crap. Your Boll saw it. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The entertainment value was there, the hot chicks were there, the gore was there, but ... this is it? The writing, although subpar, was better than the first one. But in the writing, horrible written characters, stupid action sequences, cliches, and an end that move up and down instantly, make a level of ridicule that makes the Bollmeister very, very proud. But, could it have been worse? <br /> <br /> HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as a mad doctor seeking a cure for death. As you may guess, everything goes to sh * t. A nearby College Campus seems to be the hub of the Zombie (or Hypersapin?) Epidemic, and as you might expect, a group of Commandos and two Zombie scientists are trying to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. Their main purpose? No, it doesn't blow. Instead, they have to get a monster of zombie blood so they can be a cure for the deadly virus. Between these and mere character interactions, an insatiable amount of cliches (but hey, at least the black man is not the first to be killed), and decent-looking zombies. <br /> <br /> The play is acceptable. Who would have thought Sticky Fingaz was a wise actor? Not me. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine somewhat like the lead. And the supportive role was also wise. It was all wise. <br /> <br /> The makeup effects on the Zombies were good, it could have been worse like the first HOTD: just guys are walking around in dusty mummy suits. The gore was also right. Cheap scares and even cheaper tensions are almost non-existent in this movie, which is a good thing. The action ranges were dumb as f * ck, but there were no sword-fighting zombies anyway or the ridiculous slow motion bullet effect. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will only appeal to Zombie enthusiasts, fans of arcade games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap Horror movie for the weekend. Apparently, there is a third one being thought of at the end, but I won't count on it. Unless you decide to do so. A 4.
