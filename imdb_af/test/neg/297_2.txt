I watched the first 15 minutes and I can say that there was no consultation with any military type staff. Judith Light's charactor (an officer) has her hair off her shoulders! One of the first officials to greet her when she goes to the medical facility she is working on is so overweight that she shorts her pants! No - there was no military advice to them on this movie. Even a former military officer could have helped.
