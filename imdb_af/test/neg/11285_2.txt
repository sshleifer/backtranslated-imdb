As someone who loves baseball history, especially the early 20th century in which Cobb was a lead figure, along with a bunch of colorful characters, I look forward to seeing this baseball movie. Well, it wasn't a baseball movie, which was disappointing. No, it was just a sports writer's report that he was with Cobb in the ballplayer's later years, while the two worked on a book. Even with this, it could have been a more enjoyable movie than they did. <br /> <br /> Permitted Cobb was everything but a good guy, an extremely talented player, but cruel because he would do something to beat you. ... and he was dirty, intimidating and had many demons to fight. He was so hated that his own team-mates were trying to prevent his chances of winning a batting title for one year. Nonetheless, this is an over-the-top depiction of the man. It almost makes him almost cartoonish. <br /> <br /> Watching and listening to an old man for two hours is ominous and profane. No, it's not. One day I would like to see a true biography of Cobb who shows him in his ballplay days, and if they want to portray him as an evil man, it is, but the way they did it here with just " a bitter, godly old man who makes an ass of himself in front of a reporter is not nice to look at.
