In most parts, a deadly dull venture, Naach, is about this dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali) who sees herself as a kind of author, besides the small commercial compromises that people around her, including her actor-boss (Abhishek Bachchan) , building their careers. . Nice idea, but it turns out she has the most turbulent concepts about costumes and dance movements, things that are bad enough to make even the powers behind these ultra-cheap South Indian potboilers are being seriously embarrassed. <br /> <br /> The story follows a progressively predictable pattern. Dancer and beau meet and have a relationship (yes, sex included). Beau is successful, but she tears her efforts to help her. Beau throws attitude and they run out of each other ... dancer meets a most unlikely director who wants her to do what she wants ... unceasing effort bags, even more turbulent popularity. Beau's efforts to reach out are held back to a climax where he exploits how he can't live without her ... D-uh end. <br /> <br /> Actually, I didn't really expect this movie to be very good. So why did I watch it? Because I have an Antara Mali fetish. She is an actress with IMO enough talent to reach great heights, provided she has the opportunity. Unfortunately, her role in the film looks much better on paper than in real life, ironic for a film that is about a compromising character. To give her credit, she puts in a game attempt that shines well in the few scenes that actually matter to her as an actress. I just wish the movie was more worthy of her. Abhishek Bachchan also throws in some good bumps, the last scene a bit saved by a gushing turn that reminds you of his dad. <br /> <br /> Only recommended if you can sit through chicken heaps for returning some grains of good moments with thanks to the lead actors.
