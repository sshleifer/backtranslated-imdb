One or another award must be given to `Hellraiser: Bloodline '. It's actually full moon full moon. It bears all the points of, for example, your 'Demonic Toys' or 'Puppet Master' series, without their dopey, uh, charms? Full Moon can get away with stupid product because they know it's stupid. These Hellraiser things, man, take them seriously. This increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as I got it) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish. Now it's just ish.
