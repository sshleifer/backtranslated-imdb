Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his early thirties, is seriously injured in a road accident. End of the story. <br /> <br /> "End of the story", that is, in the sense of "ending any physical action". Not in the sense of the end of the movie. Ken's life was saved, but he was paralyzed by the neck. When he discovers that he is unlikely to regain the use of his limbs, he decides he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment that keeps him alive. The rest of the film is essentially one long debate on the rights and injustices of euthanasia and the right to die. <br /> <br /> Ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor, Michael Emerson. Although the case of euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, it is presented in purely secular objects. If Dr Emerson has any deep religious beliefs, it is never expressed in the film. However, he believes passionately that death is an enemy whose duty it is to fight as a physician; To effectively enable a patient to take his own life will represent a surrender to that enemy and a deviation from that duty. Ken therefore finds himself in a "Catch-22" situation. He must prove that he is healthy and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. However, Emerson believes that a desire to die in itself is evidence of madness and irrationality. Ken's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr Emerson have skillfully and sincerely expressed their respective views, but this cannot be the fact that "whose life is that anyway?" simply doesn't work as a movie. At one time, filmed versions of plays were similarly done to theater productions, but in the seventies and eighties it was often considered unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media. When plays were filmed, the general tendency was to "open" them by filming on the venue as well as studio sets, taking freedoms with the playwright's text, often making meaningful changes to the plot and even extra characters introduce. <br /> <br /> I have never seen Brian Clarke's play, but I suspect it is a story that will work better in the theater than in the theater. There is very little physical action; Most of the action consists of long talks around a hospital bed in which the main character is paralyzed. Such a plot does not lend itself to the "opening" device, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by talking at the expense of action. Although well written and there is a good thing, I am surprised that a film has ever been made of such an immaterial subject. 10/04
