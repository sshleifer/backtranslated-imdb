"RVAM's reputation preceded it. I first heard it in one of the Medved-style movie books," The 50 Worst Movies Ever "or" The Golden Turkey Awards ", or something. This movie was so bad that it made you see your eyes to see it.When I finally surrounded the film society, I expected the kind of cathartic experience that just a real movie stinker could offer. <br /> < But, "Robot" wasn't really that bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's definitely a "Z" movie through and through. Some of the voice dubbing (as usual for K. Gordon Murray imports are terribly cheesy, and the film itself seems to be something of Frankenstein's structure, as a large part of it is the footage of a previous "Aztec Mummy" movie, with a voice over by the leading man. Giving a Dead Away: Each time the question "What then happened?" Was asked more than twice in the dialogue, looking at reassembled footage compiled d with little regard for plot coherence or momentum. In RVAM, "What happened?" or "What happened then?" is issued at least four times in the 1st hour. <br /> <br /> Even without the structural problems, the plot and dialogue doesn't translate well to an older American audience. For example, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the story. He commented on Dr. Krupp, a doctor who suddenly became an evil criminal, and began his quest for the treasure of the Aztec mummies. No background, no explanation, he just became "suddenly angry". It was clear that it was aimed at a beautiful, non-discriminatory audience. <br /> <br /> However, the clincher is the "Robot", the supposed "showcase" of this movie. This robot is the worst robot special effect since "Undersea Kingdom" or even "Santa Claus vs The Martians". Compared to this rumble force, the Tin Man looks like the "Wizard Of Oz" like the Terminator chassis Linda Connor has been driving through the T2 foundry. The Aztec Mummy itself is well designed and executed; He is recognizable malignant, well-known to look like a mummy, yet distinguished from the "Boris Karloff" bandages known to most American audiences. But whoever designed the robot in this succession had no idea of ​​the concept ... or no budget. At least they could have given him some knees. <br /> <br /> In addition, the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I played games on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing.) Then the movie basically stops. It seems to be ripe, taking into account the amount of time the movie uses to build up to the battle itself. <br /> <br /> Despite all these problems, the movie wasn't horrible or incompetent like a Coleman Francis movie or a Larry Buchanan movie. Compared to "Monster A-Go-Go" or "Attack of The Eye Creatures", "RVTAM" is like a Coppola movie. It's just so boring and boring. The actors are skilled (on a modified B-movie) and fairly photo-gene; Dr Krupp, in particular, seems to have a wonderful time while learning in his hood and Phantom Of the Opera suit and making plots and hoods. I often found myself, despite the fact that he was the villain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw a lot, much worse. Put it with "Samson Vs The Vampire Women", under "interesting Mexican youthful characteristics".
