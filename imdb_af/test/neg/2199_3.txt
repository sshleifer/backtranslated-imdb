Rating: * 1/2 off **** <br /> <br /> "The Net" is one of those movies that won't stay in your mind for the next one hour. Well ... Just if you think how bad it is. It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughing and predictable piece of garbage. One of those adjectives I used above is why I contributed my 1/2 to the one I would have given. So is it a case of 'so bad is it good'? No. It's a case of "so bad it is laughable". <br /> <br /> Bullock in a (surprise!) very bad performance, Angela Bennett, a computer expert at home all the time. His work at home has no friends and her neighbors don't know her. Suddenly she sees herself in dangerous situations after her colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to her. Her identity, bank accounts, etc., etc., are all erased, and she is now Ruth Marx. The conspiracy even involves government and ... Wait! Haven't we seen it yet? Yes, thousands of times. "The Net" is trying to be modern, the portrait of the 90's, showing the computer as a villain. Great story! It's a movie about nothing, just an excuse to show ridiculous action scenes. Take the scene of the boat accident. I just laughed as the camera slowly started ... <br /> <br /> What makes it worse, here is Sandra Bullock. How awful she is! Has she made a decent movie? A time to kill, okay. But she's still a bad actress, and repeating her robotic face in each of her photos. <br /> <br /> The vantages and disadvantages of the computer have been shown in 2001: a Space Odyssey, the best, the most intelligent and most complex movie ever made. It is not necessary to compare the Net with it, is it ...? <br /> <br /> The only reason to see the Net is to laugh, as I have said, and to see what it is trying to be. The results are a pity. <br /> <br /> Break this movie out of your mind!
