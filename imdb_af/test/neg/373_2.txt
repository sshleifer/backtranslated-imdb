I just finished Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few disqualifications. The acting wasn't bad and the plot wasn't bad. BUT, as said, the devil was in the details. <br /> <br /> Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) The bleeding on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) connection showed that coming from the back of his hand while his knuckles were bleeding. <br /> <br /> 2) Would a detective of his many victim get rid of his murder victim? It was very stupid for me. <br /> <br /> I'm not unusually picky about a movie, but in my humble opinion, this one is definitely NOT recommended by me.
