I had another experience with this movie - it never became charming or fun or funny to me. one big idea that it was not your typical movie was that the label did not indicate the language (s) spoken in the film. Another was the lack of subtitle choices. <br /> <br /> I found the lack of dialogue annoying, especially when associated with exaggerated facial expressions as it was almost always. The careless development of the poor plot was mysterious. Were there characters, or just vague gestures? was there even a plot? <br /> <br /> On a separate issue, I am asked to correct the spelling of "dialogue" with the proposed "dialogue" replacement. Perhaps this movie as a whole, including the IMDb section, is designed to puzzle or surprise, but I'm more irritated than amused.
