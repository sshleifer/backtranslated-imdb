This movie was okay, but like most TV shows it would have been better if it was made for television only. The best and beloved characters only had five minutes, while the three mediocre characters were already in the movie. <br /> <br /> Unlike most British television series films, this movie kicks off and looks like it's a winner, but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters in the real world are and wait to catch the three comedians. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't go completely when Hillary in a room with the trapped Steve, Lipp masquerading as Steve, and Geoff writes himself in the Middle Ages. What made me think? How does he not need a key to enter the world, other than the Royston Vasey characters? The medieval scene was okay, but Monty Python made it much better and of course better, with comedy from Peter Kay and Simon Pegg, both said nothing funny, Kay had a line and Pegg just watched and bored on the wall touched. br /> What also excited me was that they apparently forgot what happened in previous episodes, as Hillary escaped to the Caribbean in series 2, but in the film he escaped from prison and Lipp is also a pedophile vampire not mentioned in the movie at all. It was also quite disturbing when he left alone to look at the children. <br /> <br /> There were many plot holes and unexplained situations like how did Geoff and the Dark One escape from the Middle Ages back into Royston Vasey? Like series 3, it started out well, but as the film progressed, it slowed down and had a very poor predictable end. <br /> <br /> They would be better off doing what Monty Python did and making their best and classic sketches of series 1-3 and the Christmas special, and made it into a movie that the characters wanted to re-enter a whole new audience, which could not be asked to watch the series or buy the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Best advice is to save your money and wait until it's on TV ..... Where it belongs.
