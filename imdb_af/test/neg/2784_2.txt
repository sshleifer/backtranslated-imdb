Straight to video and for good reason. It's like the neighborhood kids who play a play in the backyard, but worse. A young man (Don Digiulio) inherits a farm in West Virginia, which has been dormant for generations. He decides to take some friends to check the property. This farmland also produced good maize crops, even during the Great Depression. The secret was that the owner killed people and watered the fields with their blood. Then keep their bodies out like scarecrows. The special effects are pretty crippled and the terrible dialogue is full of indecent one-liners and the scarecrow is so ridiculous that the sound can be switched off better. Cheap gore and a shock of a horrible movie. Together with Digiulio in the movie: Jeanie Cheek, B.W. York, Booty Chewning and Jessica Dunphy.
