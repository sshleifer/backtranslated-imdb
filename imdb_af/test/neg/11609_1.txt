After I put this god-horrible 82-minute excuse for a movie and wanted to throw my eyes out earlier after calling to another James Toback-directed mess, called "When Will I Love", I conclude come that He has the best agent in the world. How else can this terribly written, painfully-scraped scrap be made in the first place. <br /> <br /> I love Robert Downey Jr., but maybe in this movie, he drove to drug abuse. <Br /> <br /> Heather Graham should be ashamed of her zombified performance. Half the time the camera is on her just looks foolish. <br /> <br /> Such a crappy script. Prepare yourself for Hollywood's name loss. (Example: Five-minute winding discussions on Denzel Washington's acting .... etc.) <br /> <br /> There is a great character in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 called Dunbar. He spends most of the time in the shooting art he estimates. When asked why he shoots the skeet all the time if he so much hates it, he replies that it is time for CREEP and he will have a longer life. Well .... if you really want time to crawl, watch this movie! I swear ... the 82 minutes will feel longer than a 4 hour David Lean epic. It goes on and off and on and on ... <br /> <br /> I hope I will never see another James Toback movie again. If I couldn't give it to STERRES, I would.
