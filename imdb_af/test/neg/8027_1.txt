S l o w, l g, d l l l. . . <br /> <br /> Oh my god, boring. <br /> <br /> Characters so annoying - you will shrink every time you see Jimy Smits, or the guy playing from now on. They never have to repeat or revise the movie that is in progress. Mel Gibson was absolutely wood. <br /> <br /> It may not be the worst movie ever made, but it went almost straight to the video, saying it's darn close. <br /> <br />
