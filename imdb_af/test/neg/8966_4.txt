**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young <br /> <br /> Mountain Hillbilly Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious forester. "Go on 18", start pulling his male attention, and react by throwing rocks. The arrival of a dam-construction construction crew triggers dreams of romance in Ms Hepburn. She quickly draws the attention of southern engineer Robert Young (like John Stafford), who hides his marital status. Supervisory engineer Ralph Bellamy (like George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for various reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, who worships Hepburn. <br /> <br /> After Hepburn used the power of prayer to heal a child, neighborhood residents suspected she was a witch. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't that serious, "Spitfire" might be more amusing; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star, which is thoroughly unconvincing. From the lead, Mr. Bellamy performs the best. However, the best characterization was set up by Sarah Haden (as Etta Dawson), who appeared in George Cukor's stage version, along with Louis Mason (like Bill Grayson). Will Geer (as West Fry), "Oupa Walton" in the 1970s, has a small role. An unexpected end helps.
