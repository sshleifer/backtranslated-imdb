This movie claims a middle-class family's attempt to find out what is going to "run out" in the US from the late 1960s. Their journey to a rock festival is as far as their refurbished old bus gets. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes. <br /> <br /> If you want to know which established Hollywood actors were desperate for a salary in those days, just look at the credits. Will Mineo, I just forgot how bad his career hit the skids! Thanks, his career came back before his untimely death. <br /> <br /> The writers on this television turkey were insignificant. Outside of weeds, their insights were laughing at the "hippie movement".
