Okay, I just had to sound on this one ... Like a tremendous spiritual gimp, I just put through this movie overall. <br /> <br /> You will notice that the trivia section of IMDB points out that portions of the elevation of the 747 airport were "borrowed" by 1977. It doesn't really scrape the surface. Nearly all the outside of the plane that overshadows the ocean, inland, sinks, and even the -rest shots are borrowed from Airport'77. All the "boost" shots are drawn from '77, including most interior fluid clamps, with the exception of Dennis Weaver's drowning. I can't help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland can swing any moment, or maybe a "dead" Tom Sullivan. Another eye-roll: Dennis Weaver's name in this movie is Stevens, who compensates for the fact that the Airport '77 aircraft is owned by the Stevens Corporation (led by Jimmie Stewart of course). <br /> <br /> This is a real caliber of actors who do not work much or at least have not worked, possibly the first idea to be a real stinker. <br /> <br /> I This movie is a 2 - It is quite worthy of a '1', but if this movie doesn't offer any other redeeming quality, someone has at least Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert helped and Dennis Weaver made their car payments. month!
