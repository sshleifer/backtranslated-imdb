This movie actually starts to be extremely interesting, but for my taste it becomes too fast in a dull and predictable melodrama. None of the shows is particularly interesting and the work of the camera is just standard TV movies, so there is really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they are so big of a Jeff Bridges fan like I think. <br /> <br /> Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man announcing a family picnic on the road to go. His parents believe he "just works out" and talks about how he "doesn't have a plan". He assures them that he has a plan and that he must discover his true self and his place in the world. So much so that he invites them to go with him and buy an antique bus to travel in, which he and his father recover in the real TV movie's father-bondage fashion. Up to this point in the film I was somewhat interested in the plot and characters and I wanted to see his stuffed mother (Vera Miles) on the road reacting to life. There is a funny scene early where the father and son have to convince her to travel with them. They show her the inside of the bus and she is gradually becoming more and more interested, eventually ending up in a huff with a sort of talk about curtains versus blinds on the windows. Bridges marvels to his father (Carl Betz, equipped with radio presenter voice) that she changed her mind. Dad assures him "electric oven ... works every time!". <br /> <br /> But the movie is almost as fast as they hit the road. It seems that Mike's only "plan" is to introduce them to some "friends" of those who are random people who meet at a hippie rock festival. As soon as I saw the rock festival, I was a little disappointed ... especially since it became clear that the rest of the film was going to the festival campsite and not actually on the road. But I thought there might be a decent bond, as if they couldn't afford Hendrix or the Stones, they would have at least a Canned Heat or Little Feat, or something. No dice - apparently the only music at this festival is a terrible chorus with orchestra that sounded like a poor imitation of the Fifth Dimension, along with an annoying announcer supposed to be humorous. <br /> <br /> We are also introduced to a set of hippie festival goers and their various medical melodramas. Kathy (Renne Jarrett) is a beautiful blonde girl with existentialism and nature in her mind, falling in love with Mike before revealing that she needs kidney dialysis to live and walk to the festival to die. And 2 other campers are determined to have a baby in their canopy, with the battle between modern medicine and hippie ignorance (or something like that). All in all, the longer it gets more painful, the movie becomes for everyone who hopes for any surprises or real drama. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is a waste of time, although it will entertain anyone who is really in the late 60's, early 70's and the movies of that time. I will be as happy as I never see it again.
