I can't help thinking that it is Franco's 'hamage' for the Marquis de Sade's "One Thousand Days of Sodom". People (in this case women) kidnapped to serve as a slave to a privileged elite? Cheque. Kinky sex? Cheque. Torture including swing? Cheque. Victims chosen to be killed at random? Cheque. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Franco did not go all over and has theater audiences at the delicacies of coprology (and indeed coprophagy), another perversion that appears repeatedly in the Sade's boring long and disgusting saga. <br /> <br /> I was hoping this movie would fall into the 'bad it's good' category. But even the field of bare flesh and numerous sexual encounters didn't make up for the dishonest dialogue, terribly acting, elusive plot, and just to put on the tin hat - double and English subtitles from women's costumes). The Alsation, however, had a very professional performance. <br /> <br /> Of course I might be wrong about the de Sade corner. After all, I didn't realize that the actor playing the "jail" was a trans-sexual. I need to pay more attention to the size of people's hands in the future. <br /> <br /> According to another reviewer, the film was banned in the UK. Well, this is obviously no longer the case, though I feel the nipple-needle scene has been cut to satisfy the sensors. On the DVD I watched, it was only clearly visible on the Spanish trailer (which, if you wonder, I watched it compare to the English). <br /> <br /> The DVD also contains an interview with Jess Franco, although you need better Spanish than mine to understand. Unless I'm very wrong, it's not called or subtitled. And it indicates that the person who played the character is Franco, Ajita Wilson is disguised with a mustache. Kind of ironic, as he / she removed the necessary attachment surgically.
