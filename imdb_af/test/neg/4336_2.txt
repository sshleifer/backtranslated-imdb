Talk about a drill string. This 3rd-clean biker movie made me sleep as soon as the opening credits got on the screen. The shame is that the film included very good actors, including George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe. <br /> <br /> A discount from the Western classic, High Noon, is basically the story of a former US Army green beard (Henriksen) trying to help someone help him find a one-of-a-kind village. gang escaping cyclists. <br /> <br /> Everybody tries, but the writing is at grade school level. Sad to see that academy awarded Kennedy the winner in such a comedown of his outstanding performance in Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you struggle to sleep at night, it will be a perfect movie rental to .......... you go to sleep!
