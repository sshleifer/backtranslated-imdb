THE RAP, the book on which this movie was based, was one of the most difficult books I've ever read. Yet I couldn't lay it down. Raunchy, rude, dirty, malicious ... you call it, it had it. It also has some of the best characterizations of any novel I've ever read. <br /> <br /> Well, as for the movie ... it was regrettable. I mean, Tim Mcintire as Wasco? Wasco was the worst courage ... talking about WASCO ... Mcintire as Wasco is like Tim Conway as Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> What happened to the main character in the book? Little Heritage. He doesn't even exist in the movie. Quick Step was NOT the chief in the book. Why even call this thing with THE RAP? None of the book's spirit, atmosphere, nastiness or drama has been captured in this movie. <br /> <br /> For me it wasn't just a disappointment, but a total waste of time and celluloid.
