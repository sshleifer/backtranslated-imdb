I saw it this morning on a boring Sunday morning. Well, I was drawn to the fact that it is an outdoor movie. I was hoping to find some nice scenery, but this is the only view. They just go back and forth in the same place. I hate it when they use these so-called hi-tech stuff like this this Motorola blue-tooth headset they use to turn off the use of a walkie talkie. It was just as funny. They look like amateurs. And those who want to advertise for the badly designed Alien wares. Laptops that can connect to a satellite to find people. I couldn't say more about this TV movie. The end was bad that they seem to eliminate it shortly using rescue helicopters and so on. * / **********
