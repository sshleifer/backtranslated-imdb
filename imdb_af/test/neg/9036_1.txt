I love the beach boys and their music. So, being a filmmaker, I thought, wow, a Beach Boys Movie sounds good. Well, wrong! Actually, I just turned off HDNET, the channel the movie was playing, because it was so bad. Someone mentioned above about editing ... well, at least they had to watch the monitors while they were filming. I don't know if anyone else caught the mustache from the face of one of the guys after kissing his wife, and then he smoothed it with his hands again. Ever heard of a scene repeat! Acting was terrible. Direction was terrible. Make-up was TERRIBLE !!! Perhaps the worst makeup work I've ever seen. Brian Wilson's "fat" cheek looked like pl-ado. <br /> <br /> It's honestly the first time I've ever commented on IMDb, and I know it doesn't really make a difference ... but come on what hell was the producers think ?! ! !?
