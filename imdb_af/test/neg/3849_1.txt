I was unhappy enough to see this movie at a friend's house. What a total waste of time. What a complete and complete piece of crap this movie is! Absolutely nothing is funny about it, from the landfill to the abusive and humiliating depiction of Germans. There is no plot, the acting made me gag and in the end I wanted to personally beat John Leguizamo with a stick. I thought John Woo movies were bad ..... this movie is officially the worst movie I've ever seen.
