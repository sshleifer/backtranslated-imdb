First, this movie has the dumbest plot of any movie I've ever seen, and unfortunately I had to see this one. One day I had tossed through channels and stumbled upon this turbulent excuse for a movie, confirming what I had said a long time ago. Carrot Top is not an actor, and is not funny in the slightest sense. He acts as if he is a great comedian and thinks he recommends the audience's attention. Honestly, he has the acting ability of a 10-year-old classroom. Scared that less than a 10-year-old's ability to compare it with Carrot Top would be a serious insult to their good name. This movie is trying to be funny with dull one linen all raised from the 50 paintings. By the end I would have done anything to wipe out my memory of this movie, but unfortunately the memories remain with me. The only thing I can do is warn others to never watch this movie. But it proves the rumors where Carrot Top cannot be worth it.
