I watched this movie (movie?) By chance and I have never stopped watching, because it is ridiculous that any dog ​​can play this act and be better than the actors (actors?) Of this bad remake of the fatal attraction, there is no direction, no play, just an unfortunate copy of the Adrian Lyne movie if you have doubts about suicide, and you can choose ... for 'yes' <br /> <br /> I can't people suggest what after cinema to see this garbage; maybe someone who had an empty afternoon and choose the first home cinema to stay with some others for 2 hours to forget about problems, but it's hard to go back home relax
