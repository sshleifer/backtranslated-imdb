Most serious attempt to succeed in adapting the classic Odyssey story to a 30-year nostalgic era. The adventurers this time are escaped prisoners, who are struggling with the depression. The greatest power of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack, which is not just the era it puts in, but the spiritual references that run in the movie. Except for its value for the movie, the music is just great to listen to. <br /> <br /> What the movie is impeding is that the characters aren't really that nice. In a comedy you need that element to have fun with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, temperate, nobody who doesn't have positive points at all. They are not enough to make you hate, so it is hard to relate to them at all. They are presented as clowns, but like people who make clown makeup and act in parades, they are just not funny. <br /> <br /> Like the story it inspired, the movie takes those guys on an "Odyssey", which experiences a variety of symbolic (some even mystical) characters. Everyone is bumped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word is "stupid". People are ruled right and left, and as a result, no one is left interesting or attractive. The movie doesn't like its own characters, nor does it leave you. <br /> <br /> Riverside baptism, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fist battles, radio preachers, people beaten with sticks; Everyone is thrown to you in a diverse way. Some call some laughs, others confuse or bring you. I laughed when a nerdy man hit the snot out of a particularly turbulent main character. But there were far more useless free scenes; An example: A 30-year-old Dillinger-type man makes cows with a thumb rifle. Comedy? Symbolism? no; just insane violence, which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story deals with. <br /> <br /> Other adjustments to the Odyssey are much better. Unless you are a George Clooney fan, rent something else. But buy the soundtrack CD; the music is wonderful.
