Classic author C.S. Lewis once wrote an essay stating that no children's story is reading, reading, etc., if it can only be enjoyed by children. I want to say this movie is an easy one to defend as a defense of its argument. <br /> <br /> At the age of five or six, I loved it, found it only three or four years later and found that it was written wet, poorly animated, dully and confusing, and with terrifying repetitions and horrible songs (I'm looking for you, hi-cockalorum), which shows a production of joyful cowardice and clumsy pursuit, but with an ugly, two, frustrating mess. <br /> <br /> Show in all respects to your baby, but I would highly recommend that you do not recommend a copy or attempt on the show. If you want something in the same era, but with a real charm and white, go to 'Oliver Twist' or the BBC's brilliant adaptation of 'The Box of Delights'.
