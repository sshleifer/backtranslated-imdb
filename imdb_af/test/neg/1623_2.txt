This movie's one-handed quality (except Ator's scarce payroll) is the hilarious action of the bad guy, Zor. This wonderful survivor has a certain ... oh, Shakespeare presence that made this movie bearable (hence the 2). I just giggled every time he pirouetted, lifted an amazing eyebrow to the henchman or hero. A true example of someone who is not paid enough. (And that!) <br /> <br /> Now, really, what was with the 12-minute hang-glider scene? Really, really, very bad. I can not emphasize it enough. <br /> <br /> So, seriously, if you want to see this movie, look at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. With those dear silhouettes many terrible films are endured.
