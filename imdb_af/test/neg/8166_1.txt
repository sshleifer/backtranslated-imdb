Well, I just caught the back of this movie on HBO, just the last 10 minutes or so, but I have to say that it probably contains the most laughable portrayal of distant EVER on film! I am a serious distance runner and a devoted fan of the sport, and I have previously been featured in many painful demonstrations. But nothing could ever have prepared me on the screen shown in the last 10 minutes of this movie, but it literally convinces! The portrayal of the runners is even ironic, as African runners dominate the sport and are elegant and graceful. The female protagonist moves together like an overweight pregnant woman, and her "highly trained" male supporters are no better. Admittedly, in the race, this alleged world-class runner is surrounded by spicy, overweight people, many of whom walk! I find it interesting that the director has decided to lead her to the female competition, but near the end she is shown that people who seem to pass two broken legs pass by! Do we have to believe that this incredible star athlete has just taken a lame at the end of the race? Perhaps the director thinks that female runners can't run faster than 12 minutes, and he has never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> Even if you are not a runner You will be amazed by the inaccurate depiction of running, and this movie is only visible as unintentional comedy. Here's a note to the director: The next time you decide to make a movie about a sport, it might be worthwhile to hire at least one person who actually saw that sport.
