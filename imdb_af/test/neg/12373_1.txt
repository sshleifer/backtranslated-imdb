This is a really sci-fi / horror movie from 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr.and, his horrible movies becoming very public, this turkey is as bad as Wood's worst. Now the play is a bit better than you find in the Wood Epics (such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects have fared worse than Wood's! However, bad movie coaches will be glad to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent performance. Like a Wood movie, it's great to watch this fiction and laugh with your friends. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a scientist who is about to test his plane. From nowhere, a UFO is coming and his report on this radio is panicking by the Air Force. But later they realized that the UFO didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! But as soon as these planes disappear completely, they realize there must be something for his observation. <br /> <br /> So far, the movie isn't good, but it's viewable. However, by the time the terrible flying monster appears, you know you're watching a turkey. Firstly, by the terrible use of stock film and crappy models, planes continue to change mid-flight. Some may not be bothered by this, but with airplane lovers like me, as an F-80 that changes into an F-86 to an F-102 fighter plane, I became mad - especially as the aircraft look like each other no. Secondly, through "smart" cinematography, everything you really see from the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the movie! It's frustrating and you hope that when it's finally seen, it will be the wait. Well, not so lucky !! The "monster" looks less realistic or frightening than Groucho's duck "You Bet Your Life" TV show !! In fact, it's far less realistic than any of the giant Japanese monsters! In fact, Big Bird from "Sesame Street" is even a bit scarier and realistic !!! It's just god-fearing in every way and may just be the stupid movie monster in history - about as bad (or worse) than the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM OUTSIDE SPACE !!! The bottom line is that it is an absolutely horrible movie that healthy people won't like. Bad movie fans like me (which is a crazy forest) will probably love it! Everyone else ... be scared .... be VERY scared !! <br /> <br /> FYI - You might find some cuts in this movie from other sci-fi movies !! I'm positively stealing the Washington scene that was cracked from EARTH US. THE FLYING SAWS, but I also saw some other scenes I swear from other movies. What a hack job!
