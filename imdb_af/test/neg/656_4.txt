A very uneven movie where the big problem is the awkward mix of comedy and thriller. For me, the unusual point of departure is clearly a comic one, and they had to go for an all-out comedy. For example, Rock has some funny lines, but sometimes it's too unlikely for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband scratches is too nasty for what a less violent comedy had to be. Another better example is the Hollywood leftist writer who earlier preached by Freeman's character about the state of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They had to give Freeman something funny to say in that segment, but of course it's much harder than just writing a boring PC speech. <br /> <br /> There's even more New Age PC ness in the form of the end: the girl not only gets the boy - she doesn't get a son; In fact, the message is that the girl doesn't need a boy at all! A bit of a feminist statement there. The first half hour is poor, but the film becomes ironic - as soon as Zellweger arrives at Kinnear. I say "ironically" because I'm not much of a Kinnear's fan, though he is solid here. Zellweger is very cute, as usual; she has the kind of american cute that should dress almost every man, and i have to wonder why more of such women are not represented these days, instead of the dogs that have become inexplicable stars, like Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez, or Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is sometimes very serious, I have no choice but to criticize Freeman's character as the gangster's equivalent of the movie's hooker with the heart of gold. There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to even imagine their father and son.
