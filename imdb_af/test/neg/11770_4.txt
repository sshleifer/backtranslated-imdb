I think my biggest mistake was to look back on this '95 'Piranha remake with Joe Dante's '78 original. Last week I did the same with "The Omen". Strangely, look at the remake just after the '76 original, I greatly appreciated the 2006 version for various reasons. <br /> <br /> But this approach is again on the '95 Piranha version. This has improved the fact that it is really a smaller picture. Actually, the 95th version is more or less the same movie, as it tells the same story and follows it virtually scene-by-scene (only Barabara Steele's character and military intervention were written out). But the movies were not so good. The acting was also worse. Especially Alexandra Paul (playing Heather Menzies's character) showed me again what a horrible actress she is. Bradford Dillman (of the '78 version) embarked on his Charlton Heston way of acting, which was amusing, while William Katt was a good job in the '95 release to be William Katt. So I didn't really think about him. But the whole role is very inferior and the only worthy event was James Karen ("Return of the Living Dead", parts 1 and 2) in a cameo. John Carl Buechler's makeup effects aren't as neat as Rob Bottin's. The musical score had a little on it, but Pino Donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original. So all these shortcomings really shone by just looking at the original as part of this double account. <br /> <br /> Since Scott P. Levy's remake followed Dante's original, I think it's enough to go through enough, though it didn't have the white Dante's original. But what really didn't make me like Levy's version is the fact that quite a few stock footage of the first movie was used again during the Piranha attacks. I never like it if filmmakers do it (and I'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons). I mean, if you don't have the budget (or imagination) to find new material, don't Pete, do a freakin 'remake. But Roger Corman produced this (cheaper) remake, so I think I shouldn't all be surprised at the reuse of footage. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch "Piranha", make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original. You can enjoy this remake a little more. And oh, that cool, small stop-motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this movie, as expected. But what's worse, there's not a female nudity in this one either (the original really had some titty shots for it, and that blonde girl from the opening scene has even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit too far when they were removed her jeans!). Figures like this '95 version for TV are made.
