El Padrino: The Latin Godfather - while it seems to be a straightforward to a DVD / video-type movie - my full-frame copy has obviously cut - so maybe this movie had a limited theater scene. And the title character looks more like a Gringo than Moi (I'm half Honduran). Robert Wagner (drug lawyer), Kathleen Quinlan (crusade judge), Tiny Lister (gangster), Gary Busey (child rapist), Brad Dourif (white-force jailbird), Stacey Keach (robbed governor), Joann Pacula (robbed Milf), Faye Dunaway (Crusader) and Galo Make Canote as an unreasonable party lover. This movie is pretty lame. I just watched it kill earlier. The Skins game - the only thing that saved it was Jennifer Tilly as a crazy Latina drug trafficking assassin - she was super-sexy. It was nice to watch her scene. Not worth renting or looking for. D +
