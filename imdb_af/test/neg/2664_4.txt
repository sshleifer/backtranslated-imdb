James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed "Patsy"!), A former gangster who now oversees the surly boys' supervisors as the new superintendent of a state reform school. Tepid genre entry in which Cagney is the whole show; He dominates the picture, but only because there is not much other interest. Jimmy just gives what is expected of his hard-boiled persona, which can be satisfactory if you want a quick fix. The direction (by Archie Mayo, although Michael Curtiz said, helped) is straightforward without being particularly gripping, though the second half story slips and the film sharply concludes (with even Cagney's Patsy in the shuffle ). Remade in 1938 as "Crime School" and again in 1939 as "Hell's Kitchen". ** of ****
