The message of the hero is very clear: the idea of ​​greater China is more important than the death and suffering of millions. At a time when China is strangling its war products over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this exaggerated, government-sponsored, dogmatic waste. Especially surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein or Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed. This implicitly legitimized his reactionary political message. The only critic (I know) seen through the glow of the film was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who spoke of the film's "sacred traditionalism" and his "glorification of relentless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of the national greatness. "I sign my name under Hoberman's final statement: Hero is nothing more than" fascinating fascism ".
