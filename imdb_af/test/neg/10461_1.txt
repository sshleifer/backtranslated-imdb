I agree with all the comments posted so far: This movie was a waste of time and energy, for viewers as well as for those who made it. Terrible CGI, horrible writing, dumb plot and hey, the neighborhood is Alabama, but it looks like California. But the worst thing should be the native American corner, which in every stereotype you can think of, the head surrounded by smoke, the fierce warrior, talking people without using contractions ("Don't Do This!") . ), Native American pipes play in the air, etc. It just shows a lack of respect and understanding that I break my hair. A native American with a gram of self-respect would have thrown their TV out of the window at the trash. So in the end, I'd say this movie is pretty much a violation for everyone.
