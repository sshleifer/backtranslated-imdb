While the assumption of the film sounding as unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the movie, I could have stopped there and continue with my life. She gets interesting comments and responses from her subjects, but not really enough to add to the validity of the movie. <br /> <br /> I also felt she had gone overboard with many things. If a man made a dirty comment, grabbed her, or made a disgusting gesture for her, I would say it's going, bring him down, he's a pig. What bothers me is that she will walk around revealing clothes and being surprised when guys will look at her and give them hell. <br /> <br /> I think somehow she forgot that it is attracted to other people, is part of human sexuality and much of who we are all. Children will look at beautiful women, especially when they are attractively dressed, just as women will look at men when wearing a tight tank or no shirt. <br /> <br /> Some women may hate me about this, but I hope not. I have a lot of respect for women. I was raised by one. I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother was the center of my family for years, but I don't really feel that it has done everything to help women's rights and some of the filmmaker's offense has even been offended by her project.
