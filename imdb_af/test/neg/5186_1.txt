After watching this movie, I was surprised that someone liked it !!!! I think it's the worst comedy I've ever seen .... ever !! If you think you've already seen the worst comedy, wait for this shit! Not at all funny (OK maybe one or two laughs ....... but you have to be really tall), the play is terrible and the story doesn't exist. Even if you like snowboarding (and I really do), you will hate this movie. OK, OK, you can see some pretty babies, some nice snowboarder and some beautiful mountains, but that's all !!! Rather look at a porn set in the mountains because the play and story line can be better !!!!! Sometimes in IMDb I read bad reviews about some movies and in the end they are not so terrible. But this one believes me is pure trash !!!! Don't waste your time and money in this one.
