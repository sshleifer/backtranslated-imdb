One night on an independent channel known for showing off-the-wall movies, this monstrosity was broadcast. Although we requested to switch it off, we looked at it in the bitter end and hoped to see some redeeming value. Oh there was no one. Absolutely nothing. The film quality was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the editing was ridiculous. Then there was again precious bit to save. After a few minutes of Cameron Mitchell's doctor character telling his patient, the viewer is tortured by no plot, pathetic writing, abysmal horrible acting, and a complete lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotting cherry on top of these pests was the most terrible "special effects" and "make-up" to ever scan the screen, even for television. The main character stumbles through his role in a dimest rubber mask and some dish gloves that look like dipped in glue and thrown into beads. Perhaps the poor lighting and gracious film quality tried to cover how bad-to-tenth power was the make-up. One can only hope that at least one deliberate decision has been made during this hopelessly amateur video. Seriously, a handful of three-year-old children could have produced a better project. In the end, poor Mr. Mitchell back (how desperate he must have been for money!) And drunk a little nonsense that should link this chicken coop with the AIDS epidemic. Please save yourself and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty to put through this. It was so bad, even Mystery Science Theater 3000 couldn't have saved it.
