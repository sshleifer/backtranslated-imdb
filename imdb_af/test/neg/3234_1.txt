Dean Koontz's book Watchers is one of the best books I've read. Unfortunately, the film is a sad caricature of the book. The disillusioned middle-aged hero and the lonely spider with whom he finds a meaning for his life are transformed into a few foolish teenagers in the film. The stoic security agent and the conscience officer are combined into a devastating villain. You get the picture. ? The filmmakers have taken a moving story of love, horror and adventure and turned it into a Z-grade horror movie aimed at - very poorly - at the teenage market. <br /> <br /> Buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading - it will be far, far more rewarding than watching the movie. <br /> <br />
