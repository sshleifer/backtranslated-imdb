Two things have changed since then. First of all, I'm no longer a kid, and second most of the new Seagal movies are just awful. In my opinion, this is the worst movie ever made with Derailed, played by Jean Claude Van Damme. There is no plot in this movie, the plot is just an excuse to make terrifying action scenes that are painful to watch. I love action movies, but it's not an action movie .... It's not a movie ... it's a group of annoying scenes that are annoyingly bound to love the viewers for the action movies . I'm sorry, but I have no respect for anyone who likes this movie. He has a serious intelligence problem. I hope Seagal will make good new movies in the future. Congratulations to him!
