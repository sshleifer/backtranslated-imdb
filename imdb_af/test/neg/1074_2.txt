I caught 2:37 at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles. This is a very well shot first film (although the DV format starts out in outdoor scenes), and I'm sure it has good intentions to show us the "dark side" of high school - in other words, every side of the high school. But the filmmaker does not have the talent to write or focus on the premise's promise. There are several characters, but none of them is more than the plot requires. There is no depth to this caricature, except the allegations of "I'm upset teen X, I have a Y problem." The observed roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesome. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the men. You have the stoner kid who is gay, the jock that is also gay, the son raping his sister, and mr. Peepants. As the stereotype requires, all gay men must be sexually incomplete and violent towards women and themselves. Of course (or unnaturally like the stereotype), the two gay male characters have defeated women, Peepants and themselves. I will be perfect with this characterization if the stereotypes are turned on their heads or if the characters have surpassed them somehow. Yet it has not happened, and that is all about the stories of these characters. <br /> <br /> Next, the ladies. One young woman wants a bulimic housewife, the other is the pregnant rapee of the sister rape brother, and there is the girl who kills herself (I'll come later). Again, I do not think there is a requirement for political correctness for filmmakers (I would be out of work if that were the case), but I think that is justified if there is more to that character or story. If the archetype is used to reveal something else about character than "I'm a teenager and suck life," I would be happy as a clam. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is subdivided, or altered or sublimated. <br /> <br /> Finally, the girl who kills herself. It is blunt and VERY messy storytelling. We are supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl killing herself who has seen us through the entire 30 seconds? We've followed all the other stories for an hour and a half, and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character that's not part of the story? It's cheap, exploitation and messy. In spite of the millions of crappy movies in the past, you have to earn something. You can't just buy it on credit. So this suicide happens, we get wrap-ups of the characters that are going nowhere, and the movie ends. What did I learn? I already knew high school sucked - there it was. I've already known that people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. I have already known that children with disabilities are mocked. <br /> <br /> What else is there? Smoke, mirrors, and some very nice views of leaves. Oh, and the nastiest deus ex machina I've seen for a while.
