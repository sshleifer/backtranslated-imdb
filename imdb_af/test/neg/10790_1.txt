This movie, though well shot and performed excellently, was terrible. I felt like I was watching a car accident - sure I was watching, but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot left something to be desired, was extremely unfounded, and the end was uncomfortable. Although it is the scene of the movie, I was hoping for something to improve this movie. I still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child at the beginning of the movie get at the fox. Fifteen minute plot that didn't really do much. It is really sad to see a movie with fine actors and wasted a beautiful set on such a terrible, terrible story. There is not much more to say about this movie. Save yourself the time and watch c-team. It will be more uplifting.
