It's so bad I don't know where to start. <br /> <br /> The lead role is a good starting point. It is a supreme Mary Sue character who has little in common with the original from the book, which was (somewhat) more credible. No, this one is invincible, infallible, inevitable and indifferent, even beyond the over-filled standards that these "chicks with swords" age to flush our media out. She is a top model of twenty, thin as a rich yet, already a leader in her academic field, a kung-fu master, a natural sniper, and had enough authority for obviously someone officially being an FBI agent, trump. She is God. <br /> <br /> To balance it, she is supposed to be socially uncomfortable (due to her typical hard education that has transformed her into a "Spock") that offers us some wonderful moments where She wonders what is "Star Wars" or "American Idol", yet, when it is very important, she can easily reveal herself as top negotiator and diplomat because she is so superior. To overcome this, she is played by a wooden actress. <br /> <br /> The more talented Boreanaz serves as a faire-valor token for this construction, acting as a clumsy comic relief and house "Watson". In fact, everything there is is a puppetry of better works like Sherlock Holmes, CSI and X-Files, from which it tries to emulate the sexual tension between main characters. However, it is cheaper, as it delivers with all the subtle of an elbow pot in the ribs, but a million million poor factory girls will undoubtedly buy in, hence the qualified rating this turkey gets. <br /> <br /> In fact, the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy, leading to sexual details of the legions sidekicks aimed at acting as daring and trendy, while showing the overall tone of the display a clear neo-conservative look at things. <br /> <br /> Rather, there is not much to celebrate here, because crimes (which always start with some gruesome remnants) are solved using non-existent technology while squints, love but so wrong (the women less than the guys) are about different theories, all of them are useless because the main character has it all from the beginning. And as soon as it's fixed, she goes out and sticks the guy, usually a really tough jumper, with a swivel head here and a sleeper there. The end.
