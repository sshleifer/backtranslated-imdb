I wrote an essay in 1981, this year I graduated high school, called the "last American virgin". I also had a friend named Nancy who was the prostitute in this movie. apparently her daughter had an essay of my essay when she slept over my house. A year later I wake up one morning and see the ad for this movie. I was 18 years old and grounded on life experiences. the movie is a little different from my essay but definitely taken it out. I had no proof of this matter except my English teacher Mr. Versace. He gave me an A setup. I let it go and did nothing about it. I figured out what's coming around, going around. I won't have any action against anyone involved in this movie yet. I just needed to get it out of my chest, as I never really told anyone, except my closest friend and they agreed to keep it a secret. In the same year I came out, I saw nancy in a market, she actually had the nerve to ask me if I had good stories or scripts to watch. I think that's what Hollywood is all about, getting stories from wherever you go. It was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Ghost writer!
