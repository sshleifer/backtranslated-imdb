High school female track star dies from a blood clot after winning a race with the community in a riot against coach George Michaels (Christopher George plays him as a big head kick that demands a lot from the athletes under his watch). He will be taken to school and can give the movie with his motive as a possible killer. Some twisted psychopaths in sweat (much the same as Michael's often seen), with a stopwatch to stop his persecution, killing the members of the job team who were part of the dead female runner. Soon disturbed parents call Prince Guglione (Michael Pataki) to wonder why their children are not coming home after a prom party. Inspector Halliday (Carmen Argenziano) is starting around the campus on the parents' request to be concerned. Immediately, a polite Michaels became a major suspect after the body of a gymnast was found in a locker room. Ensign Anne (Patch Mackenzie) returned from her base in Guam to receive her deadly sister's diploma and soon confront the killer herself in the climate season. Kevin Badger (E Danny Murphy) is the tired guy of the lost track bull. <br /> <br /> Quite relaxed slasher spreads the death order a bit to blend in and fail. Low quality kill ranges only increase the laughter like a sword thrown into a soccer ball in a soccer player's stomach, or some garden scissors used to exploit a lean soul. Linnea Quigley has an amusing role as horny student Dolores who sleeps for a higher grade at her music teacher and always studies for a male (the recipient of the garden shears before he can have Dolores outside the prom party). Vanna White has an early role here as a blonde that discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker room. Virgil Frye has a stupid role as an unknown officer.
