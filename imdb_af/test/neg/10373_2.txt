Being a gay man who lived in the time explored in this boring documentary, I was eager to see how the subject was handled. Unfortunately, the filmmakers have wasted what could have been an energetic and informative opportunity to shed light on our collective gay history. This film is just about New York, and ignores the rest of the country. While spending a lot of time in NYC at that time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside of Manhattan! The men surveyed here are the same "A-list" queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the 70's, and here they are again nostalgic and still minded. The film should at least try to cover larger topics, such as race, age, the emerging gay caste system, based on wealth, body image and the rise of clones, discrimination of subgroups within the community, and the ability to develop mustache (which was very important in the 70's!). Unfortunately, we did not offer any of these, and the memories of the interrogators are no different from my own memories. If you were there in that decade, you'll enjoy the archery photos and grainhouse movies of the bars and discos we haunt. If you weren't there, this movie will undoubtedly be boring. It should have been so much more, but unfortunately it is not. Two stars to jog my memory ... I'm still missing out on the Anvil!
