To start, I am easily satisfied. I am by no means a true critic, and movies that may find real critics, friends, relatives and newspapers may even look good to me. <br /> <br /> Not this one. <br /> <br /> I got it because it was the latest Wesley snipe movie in my DVD store. I like snipes, but it was a downward thing. <br /> <br /> Bad story, bad actors, continuity glitches, crappy sound, depressing places, a pseudo-cool sniff, I had to force myself to end the movie. <br /> <br /> They even left a few marks in the shots where a car was supposed to stop. <br /> <br /> And I'm not talking about "small production company / young director / low budget" kind of bad, where you might ignore some mistakes because you feel sympathetic. <br /> <br /> A wild-block blockbuster action movie that deviates in a long time like no other.
