I am very much into Waverly Hills and watched the Death Tunnel The Movie. I couldn't have been much worse. Then I heard that the documentary came out and got excited, as it was a documentary, it would be more serious and not having the terrible special effects. While the same guys did the documentary and destroyed it with effects instead of being too raw a documentary. Where Hills doesn't need help with goofy effects, it's fine just as it is. Tours are $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 for 8 hour overnight check per person minimum group of 10 for overnight check. Tours must be pre-arranged. Awesome place for the Ghost Hunter!
