Rutger Hauer helps with a movie that can basically be summed up in the young person who finds themselves, and of course, so it needs a lot of help. <br /> <br /> The beginning holds much more promise of a movie that can turn into Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's too bad because I really got hurt in the beginning. Then, like the opening soundtrack, it went from big and intriguing to basically nowhere. <br /> <br /> It's fun enough with lots of curiosity and interesting characters. I'm sure it will be enough for many people. The problem is that it all feels common and empty, which is ironically supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self-realization. Not the movie itself (it's not a self-conscious movie), but the character is supposed to recognize his own life, is confronted and empty.
