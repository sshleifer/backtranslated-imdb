This is the most stupid movie ever made. The story is laughing. His wife and child think he's crazy. Then they don't. Then it seems that he is and I think they have known it for a long time. There is a dog named Ned who causes problems and I think it's all his fault ... so does Jim Carey. God just knows why Virginia Madsen took this role ... it's a career slower. I think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 year olds. And it adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for 8 and 10 year olds who also add up to 23. Or maybe it's for many stupid 23 year olds. Or maybe many stupid 32-year-olds because it's 23 in reverse. Or maybe 46-year-olds will enjoy it because half is 23. I think things on the internet looking for number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie, unless you wanted to see a comedy.
