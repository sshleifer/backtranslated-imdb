I bought this movie from a market stall three years ago. I have to give it to you when I sit and watch. I thought "OK!" It's going to be another great action B movie. "It was clear that I was wrong. While watching this movie, I began to realize that this movie took me to another planet. Full cr * p! <br /> <br /> I started getting bored and educating this movie. Although I wanted to see it, it would eventually happen. I really felt that it really came to my nerves. <br /> <br /> The people behind the film may have brought famous celebrity actors to this project. But what do they think? Even these actors couldn't save this movie. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie. I felt it was a waste of money. Just buy this low life penny of movie for a small amount of money. A few months later I sent the bond to charity. I didn't want to see it again. <br /> <br /> Sorry! But if you think of watching a movie and then sleeping out, I highly recommend it. Me? I'd rather go Pro-Plus and look something decent. <br /> <br /> Disappointing 1 out of 10!
