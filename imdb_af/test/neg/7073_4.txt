Teen Tamara (Jenna Dewan) has it rough. She is mocked by all the popular "kids" because she is shy, rude, frumpy and because of her interest in witchcraft. All the soccer players and cheerleaders are especially angry with her for writing an article on steroid abuse for the school document. In addition, her father is drunk, her mother is not there and she is secretly in love with her supportive English teacher (Matthew Marsden). The popular children have made a vicious effort to humiliate her, kill her accidentally during a fight, bury the body and make a pact to keep quiet. To their shock, the next day Tamara goes back to the classroom and looks seductively and dressed to kill. Yes, back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against everyone involved. She also takes time to let her sexually abusive pop eat and make a beer bottle and try to trick her English teacher away from his wife (Claudette Mink), a counselor at the school. <br /> <br /> Working and writing is strictly mediocre. You can also tell the people who are responsible for these movies, such as CARRIE (1976), HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987) and THE CRAFT (1996) because it lends wholesalers to all three of the best films. There are a few gore (a guy who cuts his ear and tongue and then bumps his eyeball, probably the best), a nasty vomit scene and a few camps / witty one-liners. Not a terrible movie, but not much originality succeeded.
