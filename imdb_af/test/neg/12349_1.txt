All the pro comments on this movie claim that the film is balanced. It's their main reason to give the movie a high rate. But a movie is not balanced when the main offender analyzes the last world given in each subject. The director recognized herself here at the first San Francisco film festival. She justified it by saying she couldn't have the chance to have access to Fujimori. This may be true, but by showing so much about Fujimori's actions on issues, the movie is clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced. I dare any of the other commentators to prove it wrong. Tips 1: To argue that Harvard agrees with professors, intellectuals and Latin American diplomats does not help you (use logic). Tip 2: Disagreement with the director also doesn't help your argument (The director says she thinks Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and so she portrayed him so)
