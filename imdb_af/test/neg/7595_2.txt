This movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost stories and voltage amplifier conventions. None of them fully realized and everyone is rather annoying. The writing was perfunctory. The acting, ditto. The frightening FX was mostly laughable, except for a beautiful seat moment that scared me, although I saw it. Now explain to me somebody why you should talk, and black magic, and arcane ritual objects, and count Crapula CG boogeymen, and psychic investigators, AND family curses, AND Irish superstitions, and bowls of milk left out for the supernatural beings, And own dolls, all in the same movie? With all that you would expect to be more than one good moment of horror, but this movie is lamb, lamb, lamb.
