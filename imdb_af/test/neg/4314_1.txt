Opie, Tom Gilson, was my brother, so I went to see the movie and I never watched it all over the years. Sorry! it was bad. I said I had to write 10 lines so I would put a little trivia. Tom and Tuesday Weld had to be "imported" into this picture and Tom said he would have to take the premiere on Tuesday, but Tom said he was not joining Joan Collins and he did and because he only did Tuesday was Weld established. I found it very funny and still do. The movie, while the concept was a funny one, and the actors in it was impressive, but a few how it just didn't matter. The continuity was abstract, at best, it was as if I were watching two different movies at once, each running in the other. Sorry, Bob Gilson
