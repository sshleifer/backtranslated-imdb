Gordon Scott with his well-chilled hair, hourglass figure and strange pidgin English should be the worst of all the Tarzans. As for the other actors in this mess, they are on an equal footing with any 4-class primary school drama class. I've seen used car dealers in TV ads that can perform better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the dull Eva Brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencil in the jungle? I realize it's made for kids, but Wow! The plot line was OK, but the director had expected more of his actors. I realize even the Weissmuller movies have some flaws, but this one was such a low budget.
