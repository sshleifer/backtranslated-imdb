I was expecting a documentary covering the 1950s to 1965s of Sci-Fi and received a huge ol commercial laced with left-wing political insinuation by James Cameron and filmmaker baby boomer's own works. 'Watch the Skies' has in the past referred to the movie 'Giant Bug' and 'Space Exploration' from the 1950s, including such favorites as 'Earth vs the Flying Saucers', 'Thing from Another World' and 'Forbidden Planet' like "Them", "Deadly Mantis" and "Tarantula". There are lower budget examples that are rarely mentioned such as "Space Monster", "12 to the Moon" and "Cosmic Man". <br /> <br /> This would have been a much better documentary if some of the remaining actors, directors, stuntmen and collectors plus the non-Hollywood boomeras of the era were maintained. I just wish there was a "0" rating available as a "1" was a lot to generous.
