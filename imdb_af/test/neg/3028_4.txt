I watched this movie over and over since it first came out. I was fifteen and even then I knew it was cheesy. It had such a great potential and I constantly write the script in my head. The Capoeira ruined what could be a good drama. I loved the fact that it was shot in place. Too bad the characters are underdeveloped. It's as if they've written a first draft of a script and made the movie right away. By fifteen I could have written a better script! Some scenes and dialogue seemed to come from nowhere and you left many unanswered questions. And was it just me, or did it look like Lobo was sexually his cousin? "Elena has grown into a kind of woman!" And the way he always touches her. Would turn an interesting plot, Elena works for her drug trading cousin who is also a perv. Too bad they missed the point on this one.
