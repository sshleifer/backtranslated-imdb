There were only two reasoning features about this movie; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they portrayed the transformation of human form into wolf form. Forget about the plot or storyline of the book - they are completely absent from this movie. In fact, the only things that are conveyed from the book are the names of the main players. Even then you will hardly recognize the characteristics. If the filmmakers made a good movie, I wouldn't have been so disappointed, even though it wasn't linked to the book. Unfortunately, they didn't. The plot and storyline are typical of low budget horror flicks, the acting is wood, and the direct effort commonplace. Oh, the way the loup bends to their leader is pure whore. I suppose a node of recognition is owed to the animal handlers. The wolves were beautiful animals and well-managed in their roles.
