Rob Lowe must have tackled the entire budget, but I can't blame him for running the money. Even he would have to agree, there was nothing good about this movie. Filming, editing, direction, dialogue, sets, makeup, writing, decisive (especially the young girl and psychological psychologist), and the story were all just the worst. I have never seen such a horrible movie. Check out this one for any other rental selection, or find yourself scruffy on the TV. Dead Silent must be silenced forever.
