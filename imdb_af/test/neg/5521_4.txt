HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when it was broadcast in 1974. But the critics were quick to show their ignorance, combined with a complete lack of sense of humor by hitting this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to pay cash. The success of the American GRAFFITTI. <br /> <br /> There were some similarities between US GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Both opened with Bill Haley and the Comets with "Rock Around the Clock". Both took place in a passing era and both considered Ron Howard one of the leading roles. But there were also big differences. While the American GRAFFITTI took place in California in 1962 and went around a group of newly graduated high school students to take that big step in adulthood, HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee, Wisconson and centered around a group of high school teens, who are enjoying the joys. and afflictions of adolescence. <br /> <br /> HAPPY DAYS were originally opened with the jukebox playing the original version of Bill Haley and the Comets ROCK Around the Clock. But then the oldies became hot, thanks to the success of the American GRAFFITTI, and the original 1954 version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK, the Billboard Hot 100 entered and became a hit in 1974. Payments for royalties went through the roof. Such a "remake" of the song (the right term is now "new stereo recording") is quickly replaced. <br /> <br /> The current theme song for HAPPY DAYS was then launched for the second season as memory serves me right. <br /> <br /> Vans and enemies agree that this show is escaping. Freedom is taken and details overlooked, making this performance less than completely authentic. <br /> <br /> It's perfect. HAPPY DAYS are supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. But sometimes the authors sometimes pulled out their necks by hitting controversial topics. One episode centered around the Cunninghams building a fall from shelter. Another episode was about a divorced woman moving to the area with a dream to start a new life. The subject of prejudice was addressed when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old army mate who became black only (in an era when prejudice and discrimination were unfortunately an acceptable part of the American way of life). The issue of the concept even appeared on a later episode! <br /> <br /> The show was originally in 1955. One problem treated wisely was with the cast. Most of them were teenagers and, as each year passed, it was clear that they were getting older, so the series played with the role moved the series from the safe waters of the Eisenhower years to Camelot's age. completely with JFK and then in the turbulent late half of the 1960s. This, along with the writers who run ideas, and later, members such as Ron Howard, who left the series, cleverly stopped while they were leaving, leaving me all doing the right thing by pulling the plug on this show. and stop. while they lie ahead. This, along with the audience of the idol-worshiping studio who could not control themselves every time the Great Fonzie entered the scene, began to wear very quickly. <br /> <br /> This show originally portrayed the Fabulous Fifties as our LIKE to remember that era. Time heals wounds, you know. Everything has its place and although I prefer to hear the "original hit versions" about the "new stereo recordings", the "new stereo recordings" worked very well on HAPPY DAYS. And that's where I regret buying the DVD! Unlike the full first season DVD, the original music was replaced with different music throughout the second season. Although it is wonderful that the original episodes have been digitally restored to digital perfection, the removal of the original music has destroyed what made this show so much fun!
