Hercules fell into the same category as very promising television productions that could have been a very good classic, just to become a sad joke. I really like Kevin Sorbo and his supporting role, but I didn't. It doesn't care about the direction the show has taken since their movie equivalents. I believe the show would have had a much more successful run if they kept the same format they did for the movies. <br /> <br /> In the beginning I watched and lost interest along the way. I then encountered the strange episode, but my attention span was happy to make it a commercial break.
