There I sit at home in the mornings, suddenly my brother flashes what is apparently the stupid movie I've ever seen. Considering it was the 70's and special effects weren't too sharp, this movie was about the same as the definition of crap. The stupid monsters, the stupid storyline and the dumb environment made it the worst movie I've ever seen. So bad, I didn't even do it, I made it to some point and then went on for how long I could go without hanging a rope around my neck and hanging myself. (I'm just joking haha) AWFUL MOVIE
