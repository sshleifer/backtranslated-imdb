This movie was filmed in my hometown and I met many of the "actors" in small roles. Most of them were students at the local karate school and even when it was filmed, we all knew what a stinker was. However, it was interesting to see that it was made. Most of the places where it is filmed no longer exist, such as the nightclub, the pizza shop, etc. The "world prize" was held at the Akron Civic Theater and we all laughed hysterically about how foolish it was. Personally, I believe it's the worst movie ever made, but it brings back great memories to me. Look at this movie with a word of advice ... enjoy it for what it is .. a very low budget, poorly made, karate flick.
