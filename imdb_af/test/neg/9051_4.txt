I love Umberto Lenzi's police films - ROMAN TO THE TEETH is my favorite - and his DESERT COMMANDOS really legitimized the Italian Euro-war phenomenon by actually managing to be a good movie. Give him guns, machines, some guys running to talk loud and it's hard to miss him. <br /> <br /> What a shame it then comes across its EATEN LIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could really have been by anyone, and one looks at them under the contract, said what kind of movies to make, a cast & crew and a budget, deadline and writing. Lenzi then went out and performed his films in the same way that a man at McDonald's had fixed a bunch of French Fries. Of the two, EATEN ALIVE is the original - which is great, as it contains extensive imagery cut from three other cannibal movies - and easier to enjoy than CANNIBAL FEROX, but not much. <br /> <br /> I will allow others to sketch the plot: What fascinated me about the movie is how it all looks and how a somewhat notorious reputation has this movie as some kind of attack on good taste . It's not, though the movie is a bad taste exercise, complete with a title-earning scene where two of the pretty supportive women are literally cut and eaten alive by cannibals that are the highlight of the movie. The problem is that Lenzi can make us a good, long look at the cannibal festival scene and it has the convincing ring of a 3rd season STAR TREK episode, finished with a fake jungle set for real gory close-ups. And I don't know of anyone else, but if anyone cuts off pieces of my person and eats them, I'll not just be there to worry. <br /> <br /> My problem with the movie could be I have a lot of respect for Lenzi as a movie maker, and again it could be directed by someone. All of your cannibal movie conventions are touched, but they never feel like they are being filmed with any real conviction, except to pool Ruggero Deodato from the sandbox. The two directors had to know each other surely and either had some kind of youthful rivalry or a real dislike for each other's work and a conscious need to prevent them. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with MAN FROM DEEP RIVER, Deodato fired it with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi with EATEN ALIVE, swept away Deodato (and all) with the superior CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and Lenzi has a last farewell salvo with CANNIBAL FEROX, which is about as realistic as Krazy Glu is commercially where the man lifts his hardhat to a girder and hangs in midair. <br /> <br /> This movie is less desperate and a little more reluctant to push viewers to the abyss with everything sacred than FEROX, which remains as a kind of deceived attempt to get CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. This one is more of a mish-mash, with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a Jim Jones like suicide cult - the cannibals seem to be added as an afterthought rather than the reason for making the movie. I think fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of Lenzi's films looking for something new by the formidable director. It's not as entertaining as SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD, adventurous as its own man of the Deep River and definitely has the wall of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Combine the considerations with the recycled footage, gastric ravages of animal violence, misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and trauma, wood methodology of movie recordings and ultimately you become an OK jungle thriller with two or three outings, and Umberto Lenzi is so much more in state. <br /> <br /> 4/10; However, gore freaks will go nuts.
