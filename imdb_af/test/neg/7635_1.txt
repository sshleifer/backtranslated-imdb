It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a thrill with a rather ridiculous ending. I watched this movie and hope for the best and found something really bad. The film had two actors I love, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Certainly they have decent chemistry together, but for what? The movie's performance was bad to start with and the performance only made it worse. <br /> <br /> Miss. DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor, a psychologist who tries to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense is related to various personality disorders. It will pretty much give you a hint of where the movie goes and the identity of the killer. Early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father. It was made in the 1990s when the bad dad was the thing in Hollywood, another clue to the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Banderas plays a mystery man named Tony Ramirez, who comes to Sarah's life. The whole first meeting and first meeting between Tony and Sarah was done so badly and so unconvincingly it wondered how it was even shot. And there is a sequence where the two of them are supposed to know each other so juicy that it doesn't appear here. One thing I would admit was that there was a sex scene that was very hot. Anyway, scary things start to happen after he comes, comes strange packages, things that fall off the wall that Sarah can kill, that say things are no longer normal. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was pregnant, the editing sometimes looked nice and the conclusion was laughing. Another thing that hampered me about this movie was the whole orchestral music playing in the background. A more subtle musical score would have been better. I have to say it, no matter how bad the end was, Miss. DeMornay was very good in that order. It's sad that she never got first-class material in her career. She is that rare combination of talent and beauty.
