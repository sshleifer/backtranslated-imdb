Where do I start, this is one of the most frustrating movies I've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point, but it comes out as serious silly. A movie about a ghostly bed ?? The first 2 minutes of the movie show a black and white flashback of a strange fat fat, dominatrix on a Fabienne of the Pulp Fiction lookalike game winner and strangled her with his tie. It's supposed to set up how the bed works in the story. Still, if you want an opening to make people interested or get away early, it's hard to do that. Early in the morning, a married couple in a flat with a friendly landlord are starting to pack things, so far everything is normal. Then they are one night while doing the hippie dipping on a single mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things get fish, why didn't they bring or buy a g * d damn bed frame before they arrived? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes occurred does not open, but as soon as the couple realizes that they need a door frame, open the door. They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it down and their love days are saved ... or so they thought. The rest of the movie centers around the two of them played by the frame. The female is an artist, so she starts setting up the ghoulish images she dreams of and the male is a photographer so he starts acting on his models as if tortured or bound. (One has gray hair and appears over 50 years old, yuck) The woman is increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in. It was once a haven for serial killings and murders that resulted in the end of the movie. They find the friendly landlord murdered (it doesn't make sense as spirits have to kill a human form to kill) and decide to get the hell out of dodge. While packing, the man goes moronically onto the attic where he is owned by the mad fat man and the woman takes in his skull before the police arrive and takes her to a mental ward where she kills a man trying her beat. <br /> <br /> Well if you have read so far, you have to think one thing ....... WHY THE HELL DOESN'T HAVE THE FRAME THE WINDOW? Seriously, they never said anything about the real house being played, just the bed .... so why not get rid of the damn thing and go ahead? That's why the movie is so frustrating because it's actually a good plot and the actors follow it, but there are more holes than Sonny Corleone at a toll stand. The couple tried to leave town as opposed to any other movie that "oh let this place give a chance honey" scheme, so props for this. Still, me and my friend who watched the movie said every 5 minutes. Why didn't they just throw the bed out? Especially after learning that it was ghost, it would have been a good time to set it on fire or something. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a nearby movie with lots of porn beds and a credible plot (to some extent), but the solution is so simple you scratch your head at the end of the movie and wonder how stupid the married couple can be? The highlight of the movie is when the guy tells the 50-year-old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him he can't shoot like that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (low budget porn The Man Show would like to have)
