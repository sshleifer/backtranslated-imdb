This movie as the 1st CSA movie should be active for their people and show the good thing to them. Otherwise we see it as Rotana's cast wants to show religion's people in Saudi Arabia as terrorists and they are not stupid, they are very peaceful and smart. About the director is not even less good. The grandfather in the movie is much younger than the father, everyone calls it. And the girls who are not Saudi Arabic show us girls as places that look to man to satisfy their needs. Hasham was just another part of the furniture he did nothing to think about just when he told his lover that I love you and shouted to his friend, don't talk to strange girls >>>> >>> Really funny or really stupid /> <br /> The father didn't move that way, but only they sat and he looked at this movie as not one of the casts and only one word he said, "A5zo Al Shai6an ". The strange thing about this movie is when the girls are in the family's family. There is the voice of the young man with his girls, "kiss me" many times. >>>>> Is this happening in Saudi Arabia when the girls and boys grow well and Muslem is not bitches and adulterers. Any Saudi people have patriot in his heart will not allow this dumb movie to be seen
