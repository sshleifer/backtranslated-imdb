Yes, it's a Friday the 13th rip, but I have no problem with that. It's a good effort, the murders aren't that bad, but the play of one girl carries the movie, which is a queens, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie, the effects are well done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it's done. Some people have trouble using the camera, I can't see what's wrong with it. It's so strange that so many people don't like this movie, I really enjoyed it. Of course, the screenplay is not original, but I give one what I mean, so many slashers have been made in the bush. Maybe it's all predictable, but it's worth it, I've seen a lot of teaser, I can tell you
