For a while I saw such a silly, stupid movie. It has absolutely no logic, no horror, doesn't frighten you, no tension, no excitement. I mean, I didn't even get part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know what they thought when they made the movie. You look at the whole movie to find out that there is a plant that can walk around, drag human bodies and eat human flesh. Not only that, but it can also speak like mimicking sounds, such as a cell phone that is ringing or talking to people. That is so, the plant makes the sound of a phone ring, so they go to the phone and find a plant of it. How intelligent of the plant to set up an ambush. <br /> <br /> Obviously the level of creativity of a primary school child ... Bad !!!
