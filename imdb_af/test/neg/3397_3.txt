I read a lot of the comments here on how this movie joins the book. I don't think any of them actually read it. Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African jungle and monkeys who were murderers and hunters. We know otherwise now and this film portrays Apes in a more modern view. I've never seen a Tarzan movie that even comes close to Edgar's vision. Maybe someday Hollywood with trusted talented and respected authors to tell the story. So, if you've never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy view of wildlife, maybe a good cry, watch the movie. I hope John Carter or Mars gets more respect than Tarzan has. We miss you, Edgar!
