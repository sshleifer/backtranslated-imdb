Violent follow-up of RoboCop is by Irvin Kershner (never said, never again, the Empire Strikes Back) will never be as good as the original, as it is almost humorous and it is extremely common and had to be valued NC-17, as a result of scenes with babies involved in gunfights, people threaten to brutally kill many young babies with REAL automatic weapons, and even scenes with a 12-year-old who uses very explicit curses, give drugs to many random people, shoot and shoot graphically and kill police officers and SWAT officers, burn victims on police officers when very young and young children are present, and a whole group of kids who use strong fraud and store the shop owner (who is a very old man) from an electronic store and steal and destroy many items there. This movie gives new meaning to the term "terribly mean", but the effects and action ranges are extremely incredible. Overall, an OK movie.
