It may have been for an audience in 1946, but the movie is a bit boring now. I had the whole thing difficult and it was very predictable. I mean, we know from the beginning the movie that Welles is the Nazi war criminal and I will give you one advice if he is caught and eventually punished appropriately. <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. It is sad that Welles first made three films in his long career: Kane, Ambersons and A Touch of Evil.
