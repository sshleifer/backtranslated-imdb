I saw this movement when I was a kid, but now I'm older, I can see how absurd the plot is. If you didn't read the previous reviews, it's about a teenager and an air force colonel stealing two full-fledged F-16s to save the teen's dad. <br /> <br /> It does have some good air stumps, even if the dialogue is accompanied by it, it's basically not bullied. <br /> <br /> Some unintentional humor in the TV version. When the hero's father is held by Iran, I mean an unnamed land, and his prisoners ask him for a confession (with regard to why he is kept, don't worry about exactly why or what he wants him to confuse he said: "Tell him he can take my confession and push it into his throat." But his lips and, indeed, his gesture make it clear what movement and part of the anatomy he really thinks of.
