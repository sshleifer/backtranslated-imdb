I only gave this movie a chance because it had very good reviews. After I saw the trailer, I thought - what an unpredictable movie full of clich√©s. But I decided to give it a shot because trailers often do not portray the picture very well. What a waste of time ... The movie is worse than the trailer, and after waiting 2 hours for it, I couldn't recall a single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies, but it's also beautiful. I couldn't relate to one of the characters and didn't hope they would be together, because I got them totally stupid. The plot is highly predictable and unconvincing. Inexorable comedy for people who are still high school or feel spiritual.
