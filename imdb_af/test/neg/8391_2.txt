This movie is terrible, I can't even be bothered to write a review about this garbage! All I will say is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And the play is very bad. The boy who plays the main character really makes me irritate, he has the same expression on his face through the film. I just want to hit him! Actually, 80% of the movie is shot aboard skateboarders, strange music, and a full shot. <br /> <br /> Apparently, I have to write at least 10 lines of text to submit this comment. I'll use a few more lines by saying the main character has one of those faces you just want to hit! <br /> <br /> Meh, I give up .. THE FILM SUCK !!!!
