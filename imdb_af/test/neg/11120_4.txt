Apparently, early in 2005, the SciFi channel threatened to release John Rhys-Davies's incriminating photos, saying: "We need you to die in another SciFi Original." The scary thing is, he's really pretty damn good in this movie. It really says something, because it is a silly scifi creature feature; You need to have some feelings about acting well. Unfortunately, no one else does. This is your stereotypical "must-run amok" movie on a ship. The Cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, the Navy seals believe they have everything under control, but they do not know what they are about and they all end up dead, a girl jumps into the movie sex pot roll as Rhys-Davies daughter and creature measure about 100 or so razor bars. What this movie is about, it's very fast and alive; You're never bored or waiting for another kill. Other than that, it does nothing to distinguish itself, and it is stupid that this thing crawls over the ceilings and cannot be injured by Navy SEAL machine guns, but karate can be kicked by Rhys-Davies's daughter. Kinda went back and forth to give this bad boy a 5, but for the above folly I give it a 4.
