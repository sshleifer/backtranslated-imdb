I watched this last night at Sundance. Altman must be the most hit or Mrs director of the note. This show is completely non-compelling despite its "star power" and its political insights - which I, as a proud liberal, are by no means indifferent - are shallow and bunchy and seem to have torn apart from the US news today. The fact is that it comes from someone's mouth, which is regarded as Mario Cuomo. The drama, as such, is not very dramatic, and the comedy is not funny. The only aspects of interest really see how New Yorkers lead their lives and the loyalty of a cast and crew to a show that continues, has a few cults that follow in 1988. Sometimes it seems that Altman's only contribution to cinema is. The art of talking to all your actors at the same time is the one that feels depressed as if they were a stranger at a wedding.
