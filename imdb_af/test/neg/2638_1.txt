This movie was so weak that it couldn't even come up with good cliches. I love horror movies and will see almost anything, but if I had to do it again, I would have completely skipped this one. You may think I'm exaggerating, but I challenge anyone to find something that is even satisfactorily or interestingly about this piece of garbage. Not scary, not funny, not curious, not worth it.
