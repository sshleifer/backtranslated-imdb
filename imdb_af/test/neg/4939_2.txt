Hello, today I watched this movie because of the medium (5.6) IMDb rating. I thought it would be worth watching. Also, the comments here were silent, but after I watched this movie I soon realized that this movie was not near a 5.6 anyway! It's just boring. You can also describe the movie with some words, but just the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes. I don't know why people still like those movies or why they vote better for such movies as a 1-3 in IMDb. Just a few examples <br /> <br /> A lot of people arriving somewhere or driving anywhere. They meet somehow on their journey, strange people, but hey, maybe they're just nice, so hang out with them. Then a very important scene for every horror movie. "Oh my cell phone doesn't work. Oh me too. Is it strange, but we don't need them, so enjoy our ride." "Uhhhhh, our strange person is a strange psychopath better we all sit back and scream for a while until he starts cutting some of us or killing some of us. After a while the bunch of victims get a weapon or chances that they never think of running away or even killing the psychopath if they get the chance to just talk about what to do until the psychopath returns his weapon with any handful of standard tricks that they got into those movies and all the way back as usual ... screams ... even more to kill ... oh and in the end it gets really excited sometimes, the bad guy sometimes wins, some of the victim wow escapes good movies ... okay if i have never seen such a movie i would say this is a movie that can be watched but if anyone ever saw a movie of its kind, it should just be a tedious waste of time, because almost everything in the movie you know before you even watched it, because it runs every times like the standard horror movie schematically. .... mmm maybe there is a Windows program out there? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? You can just pull a few adjustment buttons and get the new Shuttle, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers type movie.
