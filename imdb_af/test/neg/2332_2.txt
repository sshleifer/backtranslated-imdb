There is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a movie like this. I remember feeling the same after I disapproved of Dogma. If you don't find a movie that is strange and controversial like Mulholland Dr, you are seen as "not to get it." Of course, for those who have already seen this movie, you know the whole point doesn't get it anyway. <br /> <br /> I heard from several different sources that the unique and enjoyable aspect of this movie has a dream-like quality. In other words, the plot is not structured like other movies. With Mulholland Dr.'s case, it seems more than an unconfigured collage made by a third-grade boy who has been postponed to the end of his art project. It doesn't make sense, it's not supposed to, but I know it was a TV series first. Lynch seems to have a stack of unused film and decides to interfere with a lot of new stuff. You will see that the nudity, sex and dirty language are increasing at the end. All the things he didn't film for television. <br /> <br /> For a better movie not told in a traditional, linear way, The Thin Red Line is renting from 1998. It was a good movie, it's not. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 10
