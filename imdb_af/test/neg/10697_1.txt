This piece of Crap is actually the BOMB, as in the lower part of the barrel. I can't figure out what's the worst; Norris's dull portrayal of anonymity (not a good feature in an action film) or Christopher Neame's hysterical persecution. This movie does not deliver on any level ever. The action ranges are soft, the plot is paper thin, and the screens that are supposed to be horrible look like a clich√© from the fifties. You can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and expect the audience to scream in fright. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie doesn't make anything for me. It actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn movie and a Miami Vice rip-off with a little sprinkling of the hell-calf. No wait. It must have gone hell.
