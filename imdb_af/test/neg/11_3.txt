Julie Andrews produces satirically her own good-two-footed image in this overproduction musical comedy drama, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she is alone with it. Blake Edwards's film about a woman who is both a music hall entertainer and a German spy during WWI, does not know what to aim for, and Rock Hudson has the ungrateful task of playing romantic second violin. Musicals grew in favor of 1970, and elephant productions such as "Star!" And this movie healed Andrews' reputation and left many dead spaces in her catalog until "The Tamarind Seed" came. I always thought Julie Andrews would have made a big villain or shady woman; Her strong voice could really pay attention, and she beat some low notes that can be intrusive or seductive. Owner / director Edwards seems to realize this, but he or Julie can't get much energy in this scenario. Writer author William Peter Blatty is not a good partner for Edwards, nor does he have his heart in this material. Beatty's script offers Andrews just one fantastic sequence - a striptease. * 1/2 of ****
