David Bryce's comments in the neighborhood are exceptionally well written and informative, as almost everything I feel about DARLING LILI says. This massive musical is so peculiar and overblown, over produced and had to be ruptured in Paramount in 1970. It costs $ 22 million! This is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI had to have been from a board meeting that said, "Hi, we got the Pink Panther man and the Sound Of Music gal ... can also get it" and handed an empty check. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some MGM 40's songs and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) As hopelessly old-fashioned as musical porridge, and MATA HARI drama. The production is colossal, sumptuous, breathtaking to watch, but the rest: the ridiculous romance, July looking out, Hudson already dead, the moderate comedy and the amazingly boring songs condemn this spectacular film annoyingly. LILI is like a two 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to give it up. STAR! released the year before unfortunately crashed and now is finally appreciated for the excellent film is real ... and Andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half ... ..... but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I believe really killed the mega musical binge of the 60's ..... and makes Andrews look like Poppins again ... what I do not believe was Edwards intention. Paramount has to collapse together when they saw it: and with another $ 20m in CATCH 22 and $ 12m in ON A CLEAR DAY and $ 25m in PAINT YOUR WAGON .... they have a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA relationships had $ 77 million tied up in 4 movies with a lot of uncertain future. Maybe they should see how Daisy Gamble asked on a clear day. LILI was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran into the 70mm theater for months, but failed once in the subs and sticks. followed by one night on a clear day as a Sunday night double. Thanks God Paramount made their simple $ 1 million (yes, ONE MILLION DOLLAR) movie LOVE STORY and the $ 4 million dollar gangster pic. The GODFATHER is also ready to recover all the $ 77 million in just the next two years. For only $ 5 million. ... incredible!
