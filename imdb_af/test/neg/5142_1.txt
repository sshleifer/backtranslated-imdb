OK ... so ... I really like Kris Kristofferson and his usual easy delivery of lines in his movies. Age helped him with his soft-spoken low energy style and he would steal a scene effortlessly. But, disappearance is his mistake. Holy Moly, it was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I have to give kudos to cinematography and the actors, including Kris, to try their darndest to make sense of this goofy, confusing story! None of it made sense and Kris probably didn't understand it and he just went through the moves and hoped someone would come to him and tell him what it was all about! <br /> <br /> I don't care that everyone on this movie was loving the project, or so nonsense ... I saw low budget films that had a plot for the sake of good ! It had nothing, zilcho, nada, zippo, empty of reason ... a complete waste of good talent, scenery and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I rented this piece of garbage for a buck and I want my money back! I want to have me back 2 hours, I invested on this Grade F waste of my time! Don't watch this movie, or waste 1 minute of your valuable time as you go through a room where it plays or even opens the case that holds the DVD! Believe me, thank you for the advice!
