Geet Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) looking for her lost sister. Uitwys her sister went to a sect that disappeared in the Borneo jungles. With the Vietnam veteran Mark on her side, she goes off her sister. <br /> <br /> As usual, the play is not of the highest quality, but you get a cannibal flick poster girl. Ms Ms Lai spends most of The time on the screen with her breast bare, female head Janet Agren covered with gold paint and abused with a dildo that was dipped in snake flower. Now it has to count for something! <br /> <br /> But I have to say I find it hard to recommend this title. If you are a fan of the genre, you will probably recognize every gore scene in the movie bar a few selections. And I mean it literally. Many of the gore scenes are straight from other cannibal movies, such as MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There are probably more movies there. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it's one for the hard fans to watch their list. If you haven't seen any Italian jungle movies, you'd better look at CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and if you're a keen fan, you've seen most of the gore scenes in other movies.
