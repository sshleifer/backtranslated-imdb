Unfortunately, with so many good movies released in 1995 (especially Mortal Kombat and Seven), there were bombs, and this film indeed falls into the latter category with a boring, predictable plot and a common ending. It seems that Antonio Banderas couldn't find a decent script since Desperado, the only remarkable film he did. Anyone with an eighth of a brain can tell who DeMornay's stalker was from the beginning. Her flashbacks of her mother's death made nothing but a paper-thin story. Sorry that Dennis Miller was wasted in this movie; this part looks at his eerily similar role in "The Net." <br /> <br /> The complicated end shook my head, as I did pretty much the whole movie. Plus, any movie depicting animal cruelty in any form or form, no matter how fake it looks, automatically gets my thumb off. <br /> <br /> To make a long story short, if you want a good thriller, avoid it at all costs. Never talk to strangers, especially those who recommend this movie. 10/02
