Not a terrible movie. But there are monster scenes where you're going to roll on the floor, not a good thing for an action / thriller. The acting is generally pretty decent for a sci-fi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips once again gives us a decent military / police / sheriff / agent / marshal figure. The special effects are good, "special" - for example, the external train tracks are of course a model train. <br /> <br /> Goofs: A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames, but doesn't open an inch. After the impact, the meteorite is inserted into the top of the car's hood - impossible from the low angle where the meteor came. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> A good part of the movie's events is predictable, from the helicopter accident ("Pull up, pull on!") to the the annoying people finally get it, after the classic blowbridge over a 1000 foot gorge waiting for the train, at the end of the successor. <br /> <br /> The scenes that attack the aliens are hilarious. They are nasty cute puppets and move at speed - remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene, four people shooting at a clip cannot hit a single creature, as they move at lightning speed. Later in the movie, Todd Bridges directs a mini-bat which he uses to send a number of creatures close by. Lou Diamond Phillips can easily grab several times with his bare hands.
