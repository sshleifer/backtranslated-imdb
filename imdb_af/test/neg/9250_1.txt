As bad as good - not only the writing is obvious, but the acting is not only poor but pathetic. The worst of all is the definition of the characters: unrealistic ingenuity, affected reactions, forcing camera to see superficial aspects, which are represented as keys to the plot. <br /> <br /> Can't stop laughing when end, main character says something like "your daughter doesn't play football and doesn't know how to cook". Such a violation of female intelligence defines the level of this film. <br /> <br /> Is the film about the psychological behavior of the second character ?, About its impact on the main character? Or just a series of events that are in Heat for the obvious end? <br /> <br /> Pls, make more of it - I had a good time guessing what would go wrong ...
