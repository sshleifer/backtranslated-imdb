It's hard to believe that a bad movie can actually be released. The dialogue was unnatural. Especially poor was portraying the relationship between the boy and his future stepfather. I think you could say they managed to create uncomfortable dialogue, but what was said was false and artificial. The tension was just not there. The music was about as bad as it gets. The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and was curious about which places would appear on the screen. Fortunately, the movie was on TV and so I didn't waste any money to rent this sorry excuse for a movie! I honestly believe most amateurs can compose a more fascinating plot than is offered here. It's too bad that the time of a whole movie crew is wasted on such a trash! I think the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good.
