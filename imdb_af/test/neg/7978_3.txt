Spirit, I never thought I would write the above four words. But actually she's the highlight of this little movie. <br /> <br /> Since the movie was packed when I rented it, it's supposedly a comedy about a kid kidnapped but not having her medication. keep her stable. It sounded like a cute concept. All we've ever seen of Spelling has been like Donna Martin for 90210 for years and an endless parade of dull, lifeless TV movies. It sounded like a chance that she could stretch a little, and given that she had no financial reason to do this movie with her television success and her rich daddy. I thought she took the part because it was a low budget gem. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> Instead, Spelling's part is small, and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnapping victim is just one of several story lines. If she's not on the screen, the movie crawls so badly, I could swear it was longer than the 85 minutes on the tape. It would have been so much better if Spelling's storyline dominated, and it turned into a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the least annoying kidnapper.
