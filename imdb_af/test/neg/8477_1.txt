Son of the Mask is a terrible movie. I don't like the baby and I don't like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple, but it can't be redeemed by putting this garbage on. Even in just 88 minutes (or so, say it), the movie can't end up soon enough for me. The only real laugh comes at the beginning with a short look by Ben Stain. That's it. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. Actually, it's just an insult to rehashes. Why was this follow-up made? This movie costs millions of dollars to make. Why would I sit through a movie with a baby and a dog deliberately trying to fool the dad? Jamie Kennedy is talented, but he has nothing to do with this movie. I'm not bothered to be this movie. 10/01
