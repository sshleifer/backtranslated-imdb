This movie is a perfect example that a movie can not only be won with a high budget. Obviously there is a lot of time and effort dedicated to it: the animation is fluid, detailed and fantastic. The soundtrack is not too memorable, except for the finite song by Celine Dion (at least I think it was her). The musical score is powerful full band material. Kudos to the animators and music composers! 9/10. However, the story and characters fall flat. It feels very "there, done," predictably and simply uninteresting. The characters have clear personalities, but nothing is too nice. They didn't bother me at all. I tried very hard to do that, but I didn't care about the story - it was cliché action-adventure plot. There were 'jokes' that weren't funny. It was a prime predictable from start to finish. The dialogue was cliché and terrible - especially the last line "It's not ... that gives you wings, it's love!" Whatever it was, I remember sinking. I wanted it to hurry and finish. I wasn't the only one - the people I went to thought it was boring. Please check out the Asterix and Obelix Cleopatra movie if you are going to watch any. It was a waste of time.
