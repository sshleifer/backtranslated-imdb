Stanley Kubrick, a director who I love the best of his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc.) has left the film out of line, and it is only through the hardcore found. fans and finalists. After I saw the movie for myself, I could see why. At the age of 24, Kubrick already put his craft of still photography for LOOK magazine and did some brief documentaries. Like many first-class filmmakers who came in the decades after, his ambition for Fear and Desire was to make a movie that was cheaper to see if he could do it. At that level he was successful. But the movie itself is definitely not. <br /> <br /> I can't really say the movie is a failure because there was something I liked about it. Even if the film's story was on the side, and the actors (who had no idea how to regulate Kubrick, not a theater man), his sons were getting the production and capturing of good images. in this movie. . Sometimes there are shots of close-ups and rapid shots in striking / action scenes. Unfortunately, this is all I can really say about the movie. Although there are a few "name" actors in the film (Frank Slivera, also featured in Killer's Kiss and Paul Mazursky, a director in his own right), the performances are generally dull and very routine. <br /> In fact, this is the movie's main downfall to me; If I see a Kubrick movie, even his early movie men Killer's Kiss and the Killing, I can tell who made it, since his style became clear at that time, which would continue as he developed as an artist. It wasn't an art, as I might have printed (as usual with first time directors such as Scorsese and Spielberg), but it didn't just feel like Kubrick, but it did feel a lot. of the time I watched a bit of B (or even C) movie by a director who forgot that time - not quite 'Ed Wood' but close. The music is as far as it can be, the fade is pedestrian, and the plot doesn't really look that much. <br /> <br /> In short, as others have said and I can agree, it is a "doodle path" of a future breaker that shows a few shots and some modifications that get attention (the best scene is complete when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend, except those like myself, who eventually see everything by Kubrick (or perhaps every ultra-low budget war movie ever made), even if it is just out of curiosity.
