I'm a sucker for mob / gangland movies, so I rented this movie. This movie is a complete train wreck. With all the big names actors in this movie, I can't believe how bad it was. It was so bad that I started laughing hysterically at the end of the film. The actor, better known as Zues or the great man of the Ice Cube movie "Friday", makes an incredible overwork throughout the film. The first thing I told Blockbuster when I returned the movie was to remove this garbage from their shelves. Don't rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life. If they come out with a successor, I wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first. I'll be more careful when renting the so-called "mob / gangland" movies.
