I was a big fan of the original crew of the Enterprise since I was eight years old. I watched all the movies and appreciated everyone for what they kept from the old series and for the further development of the characters (and the Star Trek universe in general). Even in "The Undiscovered Country" I thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release. However, it said, "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" is easily the worst of the series with the original crew. I agree with many that the companionship of Kirk, Spock and McCoy is well treated, but the overall writing, the direction - by William Shatner - and the special effects is nothing more than a television episode worthy of. It's a "girl movie" and sometimes almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. The action sequences are not sustained and thus build little or no tension. The dialogue is poor, although it allows for a few laughs, both intended and not intended. The Klingon looks like a memory. The whole Sha-Ka-Ree concept is just stupid and Laurence Luckinbill, a good actor in everything I've ever seen him. The scene where Sybok shoots images of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain breaks the image of the characters as we know them. Spock will never be so stupid and McCoy, who is trying to save his father, is full of indifferent, excess dialogue and completely destroys DeForest Kelley's acting abilities. The whole scene is wasted and shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters. I understand that Shatner didn't have the luxury of working with ILM for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight, but it didn't allow such a bad story. In some ways, I think this story fits into the old series, but the movies, including Star Trek: The Motion Picture, are much better than that. It is a pity that most other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of these movies. The focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice but over used. The old crew really looks like character. I love the old Klingon General and the sultry Romulan in the bar. I had the humor and the idea that Spock has a half-brother, but it's about it. If it were a TV episode, I could accept many of the errors. As a movie, it's just bad, uninspired movie entertainment. It's also a shame because I want this movie to be good. Even if it was the level of Star Trek III, I would be happy, but this movie makes all the other movies in this series like Shakespeare's works.
