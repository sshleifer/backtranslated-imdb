This movie hurt my face. I don't understand ... things just happened, inexplicable, and they usually led to someone bursting into a song and dance number. I don't understand how people can praise this movie with praise. There are B-movies, and then there is B-musical, and then there is Rockula. <br /> <br /> The songs left me in a wall. The only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions seems to be a musical video, which relieves the pain, but still does not justify why it was necessary to exist. The terrifying part of the movie is Toni Basil's crawling dance that accompanies her strange song. But on the bright side she can find the notes she's looking for, unlike pop music sensations Rockula (aka Rapula) and Mona ... wow, we can say deaf. So if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, see this movie. If you hate your life, buy it.
