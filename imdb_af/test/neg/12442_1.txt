I can make a better movie. It's a waste of time and money. It makes me sick that movies like this are actually made and the people they make think they are good. I like teenage comedies like when it's done well. However, this movie takes this genre to new layers. With movies like this, people think it's really good to make this filth and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to put it through. It's sadism.
