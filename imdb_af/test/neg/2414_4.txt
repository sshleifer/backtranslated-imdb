It starts with some disgusting sex comedy gags, but soon reveals its true colors: it wants to be a "Death Wish" clone. I say "want" because the script is becoming so ridiculous in the moment it finally looks like an absurd "Death Wish" spoof! From a love scene in a room that is inexplicably full of candles, to "heroes" dressed as commandos and blowing their machine guns, because they don't want to draw attention to themselves (!), To bad guys driving the city around A black one long after being recognized as their vehicle, this movie has too many ridiculous points to fit into a list. The other big problem is that you can't tell the most characters; Of course, you know who Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten are, but all the other roles can be played by different actors in different scenes, and you won't know the difference.
