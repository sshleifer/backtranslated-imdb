Hired (free rental thank you) it is supposedly filmed in CT where I live .... could have been filmed in a tunnel for everything that matters! Dark ninety percent of the time, and just a terrible attempt at a low budget slip, which could be good if done right. In a nutshell, a bunch of young adults who are witnesses to the meteor, and then prey to strangers on a lighthouse island, assisted by the custodian and wife. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - Observing = terrible <br /> <br /> - writing = oninspired <br /> <br /> - story = has a million times before with different settings <br /> <br /> - production values ​​= budget for lighting <br /> <br /> - effects (creature, digital, other) DIFFERENT, VERY GOOD VIEWS <br /> <br /> So you get the essence this. To add insult to injury, end credits have bloomers of filming - really now ... who cares! Distributed under a Universal Company, shocked that they will even do so after they have been watched. <br /> <br /> Finally, as an alternative, try "CREEP". Low budget but well written, well done, and pretty good, creepy!
