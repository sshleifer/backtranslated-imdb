If you find the hopelessly amateur play, the uninteresting story, the false blood and all the inexorable shootings can be portable, then you can actually have a pretty good time watching this trashy, low-rent movie. You might also want to see a nice, good-looking kitten sequence, although it's not good enough to appreciate the rest of the movie. (**)
