a moral story about a high school child who is almost the now stereotypical nerd. He is smart, but has no friends, no social skills, and a lazy lover of a father who borrows money from HIM. A beautiful girl hits him (he had to know she wanted something - he should be smart, right?). She manipulates the poor desperate fool to write her term magazine on Shakespeare, which the teacher immediately knows she can't write. He lost the girl (not that he ever really had her) the confidence of his teacher and his college scholarship, all in one. <br /> <br /> Marv is so stupid and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin traders who run the stuff through the warehouse he works for. Then maybe the trashy little slut is impressed and wants to marry him. Sad, very sad. Marv is such a pathetic dope (and pretty brainless, for a so-called smart guy. I mean, try to rob drug dealers? Did this kid loose a screw?) That you stop feeling sorry for him and get the terrible urge to kick him in the butt instead. <br /> <br /> Of course, the girl tells her boyfriend about the robbery, Marv, who boasts her and talks to him and his girlfriends to steal the money from Marv and the company. They try to do so and succeed in shooting several people. Police appear at the same time, and the idiot Marv is dragged away, a total shame forever. I know this thing is aimed at teenagers by showing them the effects of bad behavior, but everything really illustrated is the result of stupid behavior. Of course, what is the premature end of your film career? Goodbye, Marv, we never really knew you. And thank you for that.
