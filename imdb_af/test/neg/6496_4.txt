Most critics wrote devastatingly about that Michalkov movie, but I wanted it to see me. And unfortunately it is right. The film has had the biggest budget ever in Russian film history, two international stars, colorful mass spectators, apparently barely shot near the Kremlin - but eventually it looks like it's a nice, sweet nothing. You won't believe this director made masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun before. The characters in the storyline are not convincing, not Jane or McCracken or Andrej. Only general Radlov was mentioned. It stays on the surface all the time. Politically, this is a glorification of the army, and especially the Russian one with values ​​such as honor and duty. And, after living in Siberia for at least half a year, my Russia is much more than the one portrayed in Michalkov's movie. Regarding "Burned By The Sun" by the same director as a 10-point movie, it's one of the best I've ever seen in my life. I was totally disappointed with that one. Sorry. Nevertheless, Michalkov's unique talent in delivering incredibly beautiful photos is still there.
