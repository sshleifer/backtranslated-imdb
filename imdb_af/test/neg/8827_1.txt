In all the episodes I never saw a real action or drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is so repetitive. <br /> <br /> **** Someone gets something old and then someone else tells them a bit about it and how much it is worth, and who made it and where it came from and how much it can sell, and if there was any work done on it. <br /> <br /> I watched 30 of these I realized ... there is no drama .... no one ever loses a limb or lives or is divorced or hit by a car or airplane . <br /> <br /> There are no motor hunters or explosions - not even a horse race with old wagons. <br /> <br /> All the guns and swords and no one is going on a violent death buoy ... who gives? No pshycos, no ax murders, non-armed old English men in weak suits ... just yap yap yap ... you have an old tea set and it comes from the country of Germany back in 1602 - blah blah blah. .. <br /> <br /> I'm still waiting for someone with a time machine to go on the screen and ask about it, but no ... it never comes and the only thing that happens is that some stuffy Englishman or woman serves a bit of shit about something sold in Boston or China during the Ming dynasty. Great EFFIN agreement. <br /> <br /> Can anyone ever kidnap one of the leaders and keep them from ransom? Is there no alien spacecraft that will erase the entire floor? Who writes these things as a series and expects us to stay awake? There is no sex, there is no comedy or romance, no action, no tension, no action, no drama, no secret or martial arts. <br /> <br /> This show sucks! What has ever happened to supermodels carrying spit carriers and spatial lasers of a futuristic weapon? Antiques Roadshow - Grab more like a blanket and pillow and go to bed ...
