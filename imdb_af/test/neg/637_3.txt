It is fairly typical of the Sci-Fi channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects. We have a few alien dolls on a train, and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best to see how little he has been given to perform. And save that day. Everyone else in this is absolutely dispensable; The ex-wife who goes through the clich√© of the time, of Lou's first dislike, comes to an end, of course, to love him. The offensive state senator who was cut earlier, and a lot of dull security guards running. Then there is an eco-terrorist in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever, except giving us 3% more. He spent the whole middle part of the movie in a box. <br /> <br /> The special effects really earn their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite flying through the air, leaving flames there, about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie, atmospheric friction due to the imposed speed limit in your car may burst the flames. Then it lands on the car's hood, which comes in horizontally. Like a cardiac ball landing on a Velcro floor, I think. It doesn't really damage the car much, just bend it up a little. Later, Lou arrives in a helicopter and drives to the train. Although the train only started two minutes, it took a good half hour to catch it. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks as big as the hills it is flying around. Then it flies in the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen as believed. They seemed to have taken a pot of petrol and threw it against a wall, then followed the flame effect over the helicopter. About 10 times too large. No wonder the helicopter could not go up in time, it carried five tons of nitroglycerine. Then the eco-terrorist finally blows himself up, but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions, he explodes upwards like a cannon directed at the air. Then there is the whole act of not stopping the train because it will allow the little strangers to go down, but it seems that the strangers can actually fly faster than the train is driving, so why would it be on the train love. has no idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you have a few hours that absolutely need to kill, and it's on this movie or repetitions on the Food Network, come to think, some of those chefs are cute . Usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; Maybe there's a sexy girl, a few T&A, or a character who actually has some personality, or some tension or, well, something. I really didn't see it.
