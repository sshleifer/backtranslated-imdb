There are actually some good reasons why one should run the risk of going completely crazy by watching this show. The breasts are nice, although some of them are not so real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place to make it easy and not to worry about being eaten by a rubber shark. It is always good to remember that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god. It's not so much about his acting skills as there is nothing, but his hair is talking a lot. There is also no KITT in this series, which is good, as Mr Hasselhoff said in an interview that he always thought KITT was gay. Of course, it can make him look like an idiot, but given the other statements he has made lately, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it's the kind of show that's totally harmless to people. It gives us a lot to look at and lots to laugh at. This is something that intentionally humorous shows really do not give us. I have to say, it's no wonder that Borat fell in love with Pamela Anderson. I enjoy watching the show. No, it's not a good show, actually it's pretty awful, but I enjoy watching it. It's basically like a B movie stretched for a decade.
