I hired this idea, but it would be pretty good just at the cover of the movie bag. Judge and Jury started out good old killer pursuing the man who killed his wife on a bicycle with a cool rifle, but this movie was gradually thinner than it was going on. David Keith is a wonderful actor, especially if he plays such a role, the movie is a bit crazy, it really wasted his talent. Judge and jury were very stupid, I gave it 3 had it given a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.
