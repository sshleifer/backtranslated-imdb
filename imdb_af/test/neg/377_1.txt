Actually shabby script, and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer because I agreed to be in it. <br /> <br /> I actually walked out of the theater for 15-20 minutes and asked for my money back. I just walked out of a movie 3 times in my life (43 years old) and that is the only one that made me angry to claim my ticket price back. If I could, I'd also get a refund on the popcorn. It was a really bad movie, and there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> For one thing, how does someone who is educated as a pre-tech barbarian learn to drive a car? IN California !!! (Driving a car is a little tricky skill, and in California, even tricker ... I have to know, I live there.)
