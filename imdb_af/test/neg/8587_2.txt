This noisy, dodgy soccer movie by director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the role. Well, all but William H. Macy, the role of Mr. Stone, the team doctor or the "fruit tray" who played grain addressed. . If you are a fan of the dirty mouth, there are some big, profanity-laden knock-downs, excerpts, prints that you can try on two-sided friends and look-away lovers. The movie is sometimes good as a lively background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours. <br /> <br /> ** Any Given Sunday (12/16/99) Oliver Stone ~ Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid
