Tim Taylor is an abusive acoustic drug addict. He is a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or a person. The only movie with him in it, which is enjoyable, is "Galaxy Quest" and it's just as close to real life for him, just because his character - an excited actor of a former hit show washed out. The rest of the cast is just as bad. I hate the mother and the actress who played her Patricia Richardson, she sucks! There is always cliché, the stupid woman who is fat and loves opera and just cares for her children, while in real life she preaches family values ​​and is divorced after having twins. And the child actors were about as interesting as a root canal.
