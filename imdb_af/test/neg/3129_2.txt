Scenarist Frederick Fox's sometimes unforgettable dialogue and a study of ancient predictors cannot save this lukewarm-western cross-pinned white in the desert by a bloodthirsty Cheyenne Indians. Apart from his occasional eye-catching dialogue, you won't find surprises in Fox's screenplay about this walk-in between whites and Indians. The characters in "Dakota Incident" only generate little interest, probably not enough to put them as much as some of Fox's choice dialogue. Unfortunately, good dialogue is Fox's only contribution, as this conventional bit of sagebrusher disappears with a slick end that is in conflict with his previous 80 minutes. The end is so confronted as they come and lack credibility. Most characters are sympathetic, but some are simply not healthy. <br /> <br /> Dale Robertson is quite tough and leathery. John Banner, one of the three bank robbers who deals with his low-down, no-account partners. Veteran west actor John Doucette (Rick Largo) wins the best of the bad, while Skip Homeier wastes in an inconspicuous role as Banner's brother Frank Banner dies later of an Indian arrow. Doucette first tries to move the Banner into action, but our left-handed armed hero expires his own death, later traces Largo and strikes learning with him in a town called Christian Flats. Of course, Largo bites the fabric this time around, but Banner makes an interesting discovery. One of the passengers at a stage coach from Christian Flats to Laramie reveals that no one is other than the bank of which he stole the money. Not only is John Carter (John Lund) himself looking for a banner, but he also wants to delete his own good name from the bank who wanted to have posters issued for his arrest. Apparently, the authorities mistook and enlarged Carter's role in the robbery. Carter is willing to take Banner to Laramie and change him to the law, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner's ideas change when he crosses roads with Amy Clarke (former Twentieth Century Fox beauty Linda Darnell) wearing a bright red dress and still wearing a chest. As all the others mentioned here in their reviews, Republic Studio's Truecolor brings the RED in everything, from Darnell's outfit to the blood rinsed on the ground. The problem with director Lewis Foster's handling of these overnight ears is that everything falls apart after the stagecoach has lost a wheel and our heroes have been stunned to defend themselves against the Cheyenne. The good guys and the Cheyenne eventually run out of ammunition, but "Dakota Incident" never runs out of clich√©s. Ward Bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the way of the rooibos. By the time this 88 minute dust barrier comes to a conclusion, you will feel as if you are trapped in a swallow and threatened by mocking Cheyenne herself.
