That this movie has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising. In our post-Enron era, do we really need more memories of America's obsession with the creed? The subject has been so politically charged that many viewers will not only be entertained by such films, but will react with scarcely hidden anger. This was all I could do to keep quiet through this corporate corruption movie memo without taking out the DVD and hitting it in a thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> What is really annoying with these types of movies, including "Target" is their pretext that behind the glitter, there is a sensible message that makes the movie worthwhile. In "Doel" I did not find such a meaningful message. What I found was a story that rejected the materialistic bumps of capitalist power and wealth. The two main characters, who confuse in their glibness, do very little real work. Instead, their party, they play golf, they shove their cool, they sound "hip" with a dialogue straight from MTV culture talk: "rock my world" and "Now come back to festival, that's a order ". John is self-sufficient, self-sufficient, level, and many. Robert, wearing fuzzy glasses, is even worse. <br /> <br /> The movie features two youthful garage geeks, which look and sound like they're out of the movie Antitrust (2001). Stereotypes are played for everything they are worth. In this movie there are also chic computer equipment and Barbie pop chicks on hand for the occasions when our future billionaires need to be relaxed to the heavy party. And with the time-bound images and dialogue that requires such a story, imagine how dated this movie will be in fifteen years. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say it has some good San Francisco airways. The movie would have been much nicer, much more entertaining, if they hit those awesome characters and that offensive story and just flew our viewers into that little plane for the duration of the movie.
