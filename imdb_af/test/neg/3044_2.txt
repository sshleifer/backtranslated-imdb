It's almost all I can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the Carol Kane vehicle in 1979. Camilla Belle isn't much of an actress, and she doesn't bring energy and vitality to Jill Johnson's role. The babysitter is harassed by an anonymous phone caller. <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie offers more inspiration than anything you'll see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spent nearly 90 minutes walking through the home of the rich doctor and wife, for whom she offers her services, seeking the origins of strange noises and stunts. As she looks around the corridors, we get a beautiful master bathroom with his and her basins that look like Roman baths, a large kitchen with amazingly light glass boards and the de resistance, a self-contained adult and a sturdy pond self-watering system. <br /> <br /> Because the movie is not compelling enough to get us into Jill's fear, we are distracted by the grandeur of the house, which is not something you should do if you look excited. Even if Jill is pursued by the faceless maniac, we get hurt because she breaks valuable items and blows out the sturdy dam, not because she's going to get murder. <br /> <br /> The movie plods as predictably as most teenage movies, and the end is anything but original. By the time it was over, I just wanted to find out where the house was and if it really was. Remember Jill and the kids she was. <br /> <br /> 2 stars - both for the home.
