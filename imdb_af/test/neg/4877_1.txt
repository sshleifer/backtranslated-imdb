Where do I start Let's call the good things about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Mikael Persbrandt is wonderful as the Gangster Thomas. It's the only character you'll actually care about, and he's a bad guy! (Allthogh never does anything bad, and is generally a nice man.) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always good. He's a little toned here, but he's pretty funny. 3. The movie looks good through Swedish standards, good use of depth of field and lights. <br /> <br /> Now the bad. It is by far the worst writing ever to make in the big screen. The actions of everyone were pretty bad and top. The direction was terrible. A completely meaningless story, totally unrealistic characters and events and 1.5 hours long. During emotional scenes, everyone laughed in the theater. People just started walking during the show. <br /> <br /> There is no way to summarize the story on something coherent, so I won't even try. Every clich√© ever discovered is there and in all the wrong places. I'm sorry to say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Watch it for a good laugh, but try not to pay money for it;) <br /> <br /> .R
