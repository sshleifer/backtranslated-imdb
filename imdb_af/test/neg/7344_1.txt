Was the cast and crew on drugs before they started filming it? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could have filled it up. From the first scene when the co-star is too late for dinner, was there any doubt where he was and what he just did? The tension was from there. Now it's going to take another 85 minutes to solve the puzzle. I have to admit that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours, wondering how foolish the scriptwriter, director, Chrisian Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rea could at least explain how our killer, who was not a lawyer not whether a policeman can go into a prison in a prison, kill his second victim and tie him off a nose to make him look like suicide ??? I wondered if I had fallen asleep from sheer boredom and had missed out on what happened. If anyone can explain it to me, please ... and then, why, for God's sake, did he kill the third victim? Nothing made sense ... and yet someone thought this movie was worthy to be an official choice at a film festival. Maybe it was a comedy and I didn't laugh.
