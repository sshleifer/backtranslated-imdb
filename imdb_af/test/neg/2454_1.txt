Thursday June 9 18:45 Broadway Performance Hall and Saturday June 11 13:45 Broadway Performance Hall <br /> <br /> Bless the independent filmmaker. Without them we would see nothing but Spielberg's Farrelly brothers and movies, based on old sitcoms. They are the risk takers. They reap the benefits of success and suffer the failures. Max and Grace are definitely a failure. Credit is earned by Michael Parness to get there and his first feature he allegedly made him bankrupt. He could be better off at the stage if this film is any indication of what can be expected in the future. Although everybody warned me, I was going to see Max and Grace anyway, hoping to find something they didn't do. It starts off well enough, a party for Max shot in his parental home in warm muted light, floating the camera in interesting corners. As soon as we see Max hanging himself, a clear farewell to Harold and Maude, the whole thing goes right into the tank. How can he do this unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party? For the case, how can two mentally ill and dedicated psychiatric patients decide to marry and deal with the blessings of all those involved? In the Q&A after the film, David Krumholtz suggested that the whole story was the surreal dream of his character Max. This story was written so badly that the comment sounded more than an excuse. The movie doesn't seem to be made on a screen, all the more reason to be so disappointed with the results. What is meant by is funny, but instead offensive is bad. The continuity is messy. The lighting is terrible and the effects seem cheap and forced. BPH seats under three hundred and were surprisingly full, but I saw at least thirty or forty runs in the first half hour. At one point, Grace, played by Natasha Lyonne, regrets her inability to die. I thought myself the same thing since I never run out of credits. If Krumholtz really thinks it's "one of the best scripts" he ever read, it sounds like he has to catch up on his reading. A terrible waste of talent and resources, it's the worst independent I've seen since Bubba-Ho's tea.
