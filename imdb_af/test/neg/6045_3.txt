I saw this movie just days before Halloween in 2004. I saw it about lunch and it was an interesting description in my menu so I decided to see it. Just a movie that is just suitable for late night TV ... you know, after Conan, but before the infomercials sorta deal. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has very little to do with webs, it has a lot to do with spiders, refer to my heading if you need a refurbishment. <br /> <br /> I found the idea behind the story quite fascinating. A hidden core generator, a scientist and a credible portal ... Would be a good fantasy, but then it goes down after 15-20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The roll cage is poor, with no memorable performances, poor quality queen that strengthened her breasts ... consider spiders not wearing breasts. As well as poor sound effects. An independent low budget movie, although the roleplay tried. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> 4 electricians bump into a hidden core generator while at work. They fall with the buttons and open a portal. 2 workers fall into the portal and it closes ... stir to find out what's going on, the party still in our world is looking for help while the other party is watching their environment. <br /> <br /> Help doesn't come before they open the portal and follow the encounter in a parallel dimension. They have a variety of human spiders confronted by the soldiers. After a death and chase, they are saved by survivors. <br /> <br /> Now it's getting boring ... they hide, talk a little, try to build another portal and then attack the hive. After losing 2 more electricians, they open the portal and escape them back to our world. About 200 million years ago. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting, huh?
