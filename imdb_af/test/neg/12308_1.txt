Spend your time any other way, even homework is better than this movie. The jokes are not funny, the fun rhymes that Dr. Soul is not there. A very ugly way to waste an evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a bit, the boys got bored and Barbies left and the parent left to play PS2 and navigate the net. My wife got lost and made dishes. So I finished it. These were the worst "kids" movies I saw. If you want to see a fun kid movie watching Shrek 2, the movie is fun for kids and their parents. Avoid this movie. It's not funny, isn't cute, the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see it on the disk label.
