It turns out to be one of Noel Coward's lesser-known films, and it's easy to understand why. It's not a bad movie, but it's not good either. Nothing ever happens during the film, it's just the story of Chris and Leonora's bad relationship, and Barbara's response to it. The only thing that makes the movie interesting is the fact that we already know it is going to be bad for some reason due to the first scene. Strangely, there are many perfect opportunities in the story for conflict, yet none of them are used. For example, it would have been much more interesting and credible if Barbara fell out with Leonora, but the two stayed in the movie properly. The thought that Barbara was betrayed by her friend was not explored at all - in fact, she had not even betrayed her husband; She even encourages him to go on holiday with Leonora. Similarly, Chris's two secretaries at his practice, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, who are also relatives of Chris and Barbara, are never forced to take his sides. In fact, Tim is scared of conflict by telling Chris he loves him and Barbara. Despite the strange lack of conflict, the biggest mistake in the movie is the fact that we don't mind Chris landing with Leonora or Barbara. The two women's personalities are in any case indistinguishable, so we don't know which of the two is better suited to be with Chris. Apart from that, Barbara's permissiveness gives the impression that she cares hardly anyway. Furthermore, I found Chris and Leonora's relationship slightly convincing. I can overlook the ridiculous short timeframe in which they fall apart, as it is so common in films of this era, but even the relationship seems level. Coward's character was too harsh and cynical to be the object of Leonora's love. He reminds me of the socially unreliable genius Sir Earnest Pease from the movie "Very Important Person" - I'm sure the two would have gone well. Chris's coldness and sobriety made his love for Leonora look. I think Coward should have handed this one out and given his share to a younger man - as it was, I was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a sombre, mostly emotional, barren, middle-aged man. In spite of all my criticism, the movie still manages to be interesting - just not terribly compelling. The fact that none of the characters are particularly well developed gives them a mysterious nature, which is somewhat interesting. The Astonished Heart is probably worth watching, but it is a defective piece of cinema.
