Imagine if you want: four teenage students have a mission to spend the night in a haunted house in St Francisville, Louisiana, to check for the existence of the paranormal. Watching it in the dark and late at night, you might rise the hair on your neck a few times. Otherwise, this mock documentary is a very lazy frost of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What dialogue should be, is very lame and the actors are happy enough to watch, but apparently does not have a real personality. It seems to take forever before something really Greek happens. This movie is great for 'sleeping overnight', if you have both eyes barely open and everyone is yakin 'and snackin'.
