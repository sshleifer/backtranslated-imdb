Even those of us who love cute cartoons --- and I abhor them --- will be hard pressed to find any merit in this abysmally bad filming film. Perhaps inspired by "101 Dalmatians" with his clever and loyal dogs, his stupid and boring people and his absurd "happy" and predictable end, the alternative title "101 Turkeys" is being considered. This will cover just about everyone involved in the unfortunate production. I fired it as a native Hollywood perversion of British customs before I learned to be horrified that it was actually a Canadian film done in Victoria BC. It was a British British amusement park in a town, sucking tax money from Ottawa ON. equally ominous of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count the ways it is bad. The most daring plot? The asinine script? The dishonest acts and sophomorical direction? The cloyingly clever animals? The endless clich√©s and predictable slapstick? At the second thought, those on the IMDb and I didn't have time for a complete catalog of its failures. Yet, I was describing his merit, this space would remain empty. Trust me, it's bad; a signal monument in the great pantheon of truly terrible (Canadian) cinema. If you've seen it, my compassion. If you don't, stay away from it as you would like SARS or bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Don't even let your kids see, so their little thoughts are not distorted by the even-tighter thoughts of those who have financed and filmed this terrible folly. Maybe tonight, when I retire, I will have a nightmare with ferocious prisoners jumping out of the bedside table while fleeing in flight. I hope so. It will be a much better thing if I look at this animal banal boogie. But then I dream I had to see it a second time and the sheer horror and cold sweat that left me wanting to move all night and shaking the possibility of seeing it again as a bad dream. I can even find something worth looking at in his place. Perhaps "Godzilla" or "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" Perhaps the instruction video for my built-in vacuum cleaner.
