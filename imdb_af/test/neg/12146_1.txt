It's a joke, right? It can't be a real movie? It's not even a real video? Give any Harvey Milk High School kid a video camera and they can make a better movie than this. The movie maker can't be serious ... right? Is this satire? Comedy? Drama went terribly wrong? The script is about as single minded and sowing as imaginable. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop can come up with a better script. The dialogue is not clichéd. Clichéd's dialogue can elevate this holiday village to something about camping - but it's not and it's not. Worst of the worst - a gardener wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment with a frying pan bathrobe, such as a "Honeymooners" section. Whaaa ??? I saw better because of middle school drama clubs. One of the leads is an attractive lunk, the other is not. Both can't even manage a convincing coast. So much for romance. The supporting players are over the jaw. <br /> <br /> Everything is underlined by a smoother soundtrack and the sound seems to be recorded in a back room toilet. Most of the dialogue is (unexpectedly) incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This old film fruit tray is not even worth the next ROCKY HORROR or a gay vacation payment from MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. It's just bad. In every way. VISION OF SUGGESTIONS won't dance in your head - they'll slow you down every expectation. Keep an eggshell and stare wisely at the neighbor's holiday homes - it will be better spent time.
