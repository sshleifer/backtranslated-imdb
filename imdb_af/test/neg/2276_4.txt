This four-hour mini production is about two hours longer than needed, mainly because the filmmakers don't have a clear idea of ​​how to customize a novel on the screen. They looked as if they didn't know what to keep and what could be left out safely. The film opens with Sir Walter who is read from the Peerage book, which is his primary comfort in his problems. It introduces the family - all in the next four hours we are learning - but just serve a different purpose. Similarly, the screens where the Musgroves complain "poor Richard" serve no purpose, but to drag the story down. Some of Austen's real dialogue is assigned to different characters, and some of her stories are regained as dialogue that is uncomfortable with the characters' scenes. There is also some fill-in dialogue, and it is uniformly scary. The scene where Charles Hayter Henrietta is boring with his concern for Dr. To get Shirley's curacy was just scarcely interesting as a story in the book; As a scene in this production, it strikes the scene on the Cobb, when Louisa falls and is "lifeless!", Is completely without urgency, and I wondered if Wentworth's line "Is there anyone to help me?" could have been to the authors as well as the other actors. <br /> <br /> This production looks and feels like a play that was filmed, rather than a real movie, and it is most evident in acting, which is the opposite of subtle: rendering lines, exaggerated gestures, and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet or faces when they don't speak their lines. Charles Musgrove stands in his hall, feet shoulder width apart and looks to the balcony (if there is one), when he speaks to the other people in the room with him. Louisa Musgrove's face, when not actively simmering or giggling, seems to be confused. Louisa is a greedy, giggly, ditzy creature, and I didn't believe for a moment that Wentworth was interested in her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are a mixed forest, but mostly horrible, and Anne Elliot's green tartan dress is probably the most terribly alleged costume ever designed. We give the dates at the start of the show - it's the late 1790s or maybe early in the 1800s - yet many of the costumes look like Victorian design, and therefore about 60 years too early! The hair is just as bad that I won't even call it. Besides saying I won't call it. :-) <br /> <br /> This production does do something. Mrs. Smith gets her proper interest, and her history with Mr. Elliot, his dissipation and his plot were fully addressed. I was also pleased to see the end of the reconciliation context with Anne and Frederick at the end, which is precious to the reader but left in the 1995 production. <br /> <br /> If you like the book Persuasion, and even vague as the 1995 movie, don't waste a moment (or a penny) on this production; you will find it difficult.
