Back in 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld made a movie that came out of many critics by the time the year's repetitions were printed in entertainment publications. The movie was Get Shorty and it gave chieftain John Travolta his second big hit in so many years after Pulp Fiction held him back in front of the paparazzi's lenses. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on wise man Chile Palmer (Travolta) and his efforts to break into the film business. I was totally caught by one of the different characters and sharp dialogue of the original. So much so, when I heard that there would be a successor, I saw my usual tremor that happened when a studio tried to rebuild a good idea ten years later. The sequel, which is also based on a novel by Leonard, is this time by F. Gary Gray, who was Italian Job in 2003, one of the highest gross films in the years. Couple including Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn and James Woods, and you have all the potential for a great continuation in the exploitation of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990s. . This time we are picked up because Chile (Travolta) leaves the movie business after being disappointed in himself and the industry for participating in the follow-up to his successful first film. Thank you to his friend, Tommy Athens (Woods) and the accident of his death, Chile decides to investigate the lucrative and dangerous music industry. This first leads to the well-known Viper club where Chile meets the singing sensation Linda Moon (Christina Milian) who, as lead of a start-up trio, can roll out like Whitney Houston (that's the Whitney before Bobby Brown's small packets of sugar). Linda is under contract with Raji (Vaughn) who is planning with his excessive gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock) to ensure that Linda has fulfilled her contract for the last five years, even if it means Chile is on ice. So with Linda's future in balance, Chile weighs an interesting web that includes a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer (Cedric), Russian crowd, police, Aerosmith's lead singer Steven Tyler and a very angry gun. include. show. Woo-weee! It sounds exciting. So why wasn't it? Be cool trying too hard to be good. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, has no heart and no soul. Be Cool feels instead of being directed by a Saturday Night Live producer, as there are individual scenes or sketches that do not converge over a whole movie. For example, take the scene where Travolta and Thurman merged for the first time since Pulpfiks, as Black Eyed Peas is playing in the background alive. The scene is forced and must end up on the cutter floor. Instead, it is connected between two other unnecessary chapters that do nothing to push the story forward with any real pressure. The Aerosmith Concert, and The Rock's Journey to a Boot Store, are also excellent examples of individual moments that don't make much of a movie when compiled. But this is not the only issue with the successor. It can probably be renamed a product placement with the amount of 2 ways and diet pepsis that seem to be more intense than Chile's severe appearance. The story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing. Whether it's the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle man who has a movie of Sylvester Stallone's rhinestone on the wall. There are no characters above that we have seen many times before and in much better movies. With the magic, everything but away from the first movie, we end up with an inferior product that has been the second movie over the past six months (Ocean's 13 is the other) which is just a bunch of stars on a movie that has no actor to a open audition. Be cool was a big disappointment. So I wanted it to be the Get Shorty of the new millennium and I finally ended up with a movie where the outings had to be gas, but experience left me with a stinker.
