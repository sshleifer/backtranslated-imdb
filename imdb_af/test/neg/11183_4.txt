Fred Astaire is one year after Rita Hayworth's return for Columbia, "You'll Never Get Rich". It was the movie that Hayworth posted on the Hollywood card, but her performance in this romantic musical music hardly gives a suggestion why she was so popular. On the way to Buenos Aires, a tyrannical hotel owner demands that she marry four daughters in order of age; One might think that film takes place in the 18th century, but no, it is contemporary in 1942. Astaire is an ex-hoofer-turning gambler who goes back to dance to earn money, to mix up in a letter writer to Hayworth's Coal Society Beauty. Fred looks at Rita with a brotherly smile, but she is so male-like (lips-sync to her songs like a wide-eyed doll) that spits all the romantic sparks quickly. However, they dance very comfortably, and the Jerome Kern score is unmistakable, but not bad. ** of ****
