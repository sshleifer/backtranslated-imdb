I went in this movie with very little in terms of expectations. I went with my girlfriend and two friends, and no one could explain to me the story of the grudge 1. Well, if the first one couldn't give an impression on them to explain the plot, I doubted that this one would be better. <br /> <br /> Let me summarize what the trailers tell you: The Asian lady is back and so is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Luckily for her, she wasn't very long. The decision can save her career. <br /> <br /> The movie has three story lines and none of them makes sense. And even worse, none of them developed. You almost understand, and then someone dies and the story is left behind. Well, people who kill can be frightening, but I was more confused about the attempted plot development than I was afraid of. They jump back and forth between all three story lines, which are not related ... OR are they?!?! * SOUND EFFECTTT * ~~~ The timing of the three stories has been relocated, and you can quite understand that the movie will have a turn at the end. PREPARED. No wait. Sorry, it's not a Fight Club or Vertigo quality spin, you can see this one coming from miles away. And probably suggested a much better turn in your head ... they had hired me. Instead of the girl who made her "SORPRISING" look, could it have been Michael Jackson instead? The part of Scary Movie 4 chased the shit out of me. <br /> <br /> The murder sequence was done terribly. Unlike past horror movies, where a killer appears out of nowhere, a cupboard or behind a door, and everyone jumps into the theater (and then the fat man falls behind your popcorn in your neck) - it doesn't. had a scary pop ups. They zoomed in where the random Asian woman or child would appear, and you knew exactly what was there. Instead of getting the music really hard, then quiet, then trying to psyche, the music really gave you time for the scary scene. If I know it's coming, it won't scare me. <br /> <br /> The movie began to explain what the "Grudge" is; When a person comes alive during a rage, a curse is placed at the place where she was killed. So why did the Asian woman who was cursed by her mother have any meaning for the story? And why do the grudges move now? This movie was absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> All that did was trick my friends into letting me go. We had seen one of those animated Pixar movies. It would have been scarcer.
