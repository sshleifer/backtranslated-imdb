Don't rent this movie. I finally bought the "previously watched" band of this for $ 4.00. It was close to the price of a rental, so thought, I might as well buy. I throw it out after completing this review. The movie starring Lowe is a music video with some rules of dialogue, slow moving shots and poorly done editing. I thought I'd see an incessant action movie, what I wanted to see, I didn't even get it. This movie is an exercise in slow moving shots, no writing, close-ups, terribly edited, and a poorly developed plot. I can't believe it actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. By the end of the movie, we don't even know who they are. Believe the hype, stay away.
