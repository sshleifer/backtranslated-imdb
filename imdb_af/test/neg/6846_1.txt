The most hardcore bad movie buff will be amazed at the overall patience of this grade-z "movie". Mary Woronov, a smart actress best known for her roles like Mary Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar in Rock 'n' Roll High School, is by far the best thing about these trips. This movie is almost too bad, even for MST3K - honestly!
