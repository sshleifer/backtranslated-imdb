May 2: somebody clicked 11's and then 15 more on my previous 15 comments: almost as funny as this turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1: <br /> <br /> As I write this, I'm still very impressed by what the funniest thriller I've ever seen. I have a big giggles issue, but I'll try to calm down. (It's hard to write when your nose flushes and the mouth protrudes sporadically on the keyboard.) <br /> <br /> A few young women who have just returned from a holiday are traveling on a shuttle bus. A few young guys come to them. But the bus is not really a taxi service: it is a kid. (Don't sob!) The driver was part of an organized "white slavery" gang that wakes up young women from airports and they've been doing this for FIVE years. (Don't laugh.) Five years at the same airport, without the police or even the FBI ever getting any wind from it. (No giggling, please.) Apparently, there are dozens of women's years and years missing in the same place - but no one sees a tendency. Is the FBI incompetent? The world of "Shuttle" seems to consist of three kinds of people: easy receptive blush, stupid / comatose / invisible FBI agents, and almighty psychotic gangsters (who are sexy blondes with tattooed hair). <br /> <br /> The driver was barely alive on this one mission, yet he did it for - I repeat - FIVE years without killing or losing one of his limbs. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention that the driver is immortal? Should I Call It? We all know movie sigos have immortal DNA. You can stab them, bump them repeatedly against the walls of a bus, stroke them gently with a hammer, put nine thumbs nails into their ears ... Hell, you can put a hand grenade in the mouth of the Hollywood psycho mouth sticks and he will still escape with only small scrapes. No, the driver is not Satan or even a minor demon, but just an ordinary Hollywood psyche with better survival ability than the largest, most significant sewage lacquer. <br /> <br /> The basic plot explanation: A guy loses all the fingers on one side in a stupid scene. (A magical bus that reads and obeys thoughts!) The passengers are trying to escape. They failed. They are hurt. They struggle. They argue. They are trying to escape. They failed. They are injured. They argue. They are trying to escape. They failed. They are injured. They are trying to escape. They failed. They are trying to escape. The kidnappers hit the gun from the driver! Oh, they don't kill him because the Golden Hollywood rule of Gandhi-like Pacificism forbids them to do so. (No giggling.) One of the other passengers seems to be part of the gang! (Stop laughing.) He is played by an actor who studied in the Rob Zombie / John Travolta School of Excessive and Silly Mugging. He threatens rape. Later, one of the gals hit him with a crow over the head, about a dozen times ... very hard. Only seconds later, he regains consciousness. Yes, he survives. (Immortal, remember?) He was killed a little later. (No idea how, but! He's not supposed to kill.) The kidnappers argue. They are trying to escape. One of them escapes! Unfortunately, the psychos is just too God-like in their power not to resume their prey. The game starts again: the passengers try to escape. They failed. They struggle. They stare at the void. They are hurt. They are trying to escape. They failed. They get hurt ... <br /> <br /> You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I believe a stunned, heavily disoriented, unashamed snail has escaped the ninchomongle learners with ease. There were so many opportunities. At one point, this bumbling sends psychos (remember: FIVE years!) Even one of the kidnappers to a grocery store! She gives a message to the police. But yes ... you guessed it: this fictional fairy-tale city has no police. <br /> <br /> And just as you thought, the movie couldn't be thinner - not even Luc Besson and Brian. De Palma has forged forces to borrow a hand - it does. The girls are kidnapped to be sent to a remote island (?), And it is achieved by transporting them as a cargo. Apparently, these fictitious America has no FBI, no police - and no boundaries either. However, it has immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners. One blonde had her billionth chance to kill the driver, and yet she failed. How is it that the victims in these dumb thrillers NEVER try to end their immortal adversaries once they have been injured and injured on the floor? I think I answered myself: they are immortal! So why is it trying hard to try, should she have thought ... So why was one blonde beaten and the other one sowed alive (with a kitty-litter box and the funniest photo since Demi Moore's primary school photos)? Could it be the tattoo? I think they killed the nicer one, but it's just me. Was her tattoo so ugly? <br /> <br /> Could it be that I don't care? Why should I search for logic in a movie made by imbeciles (for imbeciles)? Besides, how can I even think right if I laugh so hard, half the time? <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a 21st-century horror / thriller, the phone doesn't work ... Maybe this invincible gang isn't just the FBI, the police and the customs, but also satellites in the space. <br /> <br /> Should I spell it out? There are many easier ways to kidnap people. And much more intelligent people who have to make movies. Give an idiot a camera and he'll lay an egg every time ... The kind of answers is the eternal mystery that came first: the egg or the bird-based director.
