I never thought I'd be caught saying this: But I think "Dog the Bounty Hunter" is more entertaining than the 90-year-old cop drama. Walker is very melodramatic and sets a standard of the genre of "High Octane" performance programs such as CSI, CSI: Miami, and so on. I'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they're not good either. I like the karate action that Walker spreads on the enemies of justice and the diverse role players as much as the science technology of the CSI series. But there are some elements I hate in a show like this. Stereotypes / Countertypes! That's right, Stereotypes / Countertypes! Unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of Red States America who refuse to share with the old bias of yours, especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode in which a child with psychic powers in Dallas ventured to meet a group of children in Goth / Punk clothes and they began to get him upset. Now on! This is exactly what Central America sees as the Goth / Punk culture. I mean come on, how often people who dress, rob and steal so often from people who are just thinking about their own business. When there are blacks and latinos in the plot, it's always about gangs in some poverty. Okay! Not everyone who is a minority is a desperate recruitment of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. Again, this is what the Central Red America sees America from these people. Finally, why is the Trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal donor?
