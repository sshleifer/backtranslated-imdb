To start, I love Steven Seagal, the man is a genius. But recent movies make me wonder, is he trying more? His latest movies show virtually no effort on Seagal's part. Out of reach, it's too obvious that its lines are being overwritten. . What Seagal does in this movie is not just a slap on his face for his fans, but even more for Jean-Claude Van Damme and his supporters. In the 2nd scene or so, when he prepares penthouse to steal the jewelry and money in the drug dealers, he shows that he is setting up the gun and hooking it on a neon board. Your might tell yourself, "Yah, so, what does that have to do with Van Damme?". Well, the scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called the Order. Rent both, look both, compare both and you will lose respect for Seagal. Not only was you dying today, but it was, I dare say, an insult. Seagal's Aikido movements are still good, but why doesn't he do good movies like Market for Death or Above the Law, he still has the moves and the attitude, I just left and wonder why "Why Seagal, Why? . There are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline, and such idiotic story lines as well. I hope the upcoming Black Dawn movie will be another devastation or out of justice, because this latest chain of movies he made, especially Today You Die, really wondered if he was good at getting more good action movies like Double Team to make. . Please do not look at this movie unless you hate Seagal. If you love his movies, don't watch it, it will question your future in the action movie genre.
