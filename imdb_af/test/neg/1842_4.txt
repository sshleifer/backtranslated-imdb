The worst ever Korean movie! The plot is ridiculously complex, incredible, and the movie doesn't create a single shock. It builds up enough tension and makes you agitated and does not offer any shock or speed. When there is a cold moment, you are not bothered, because you are still trying to figure out who is who and what is going on! It goes as follows: a modeling company recruits 4 people for a modeling career. but the owners are not what they look like, they have model dolls for everyone and a strange girl is seen walking over the place and the owners have no recognition of a girl. It seems that everyone is there for a reason and it's as much as I could understand. The end is a mix of murders and you don't know who a doll is and who is dead! I do not recommend it to fans of Korean / Asian horror movies.
