It's a rare sensation to come across a film that's so embarrassing that you feel the urge to turn off the screen. But if you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked, copulating couples, it's just what you want to do. Add Peter O'Toole as the syphilis-ridden Emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell, holding his finger on a male victim's anus. And you start to appreciate that Caligula is only important for sick / outrageous addicts. <br /> <br /> The film outlines the life of the notorious Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, decapitations, betrayals, murders, turbulent relationships and lesbian sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Although Caligula was quite angry in real life, and probably admit to his basic instincts more often, the film is still inexcusable filth. The sex in the movie is not used as one aspect in a polyhedron - the generation IS the story. After a while, all the nudity, thrust and nipple get annoyed by the repeated repetition. The performances are completely undisciplined, especially McDowell, who gently throws the wind and gives a show all in the field. O'Toole seems to treat the script with the contempt it deserves (surely he is pure for the money?!). Rumors are abundant that additional pornographic scenes have been added without the director's consent during post-production, but in truth there is not a single minute in Caligula that has been made worthy or good. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will ever be thrown back to a porn movie. In that sense, Caligula is a one-of-a-kind experience. On the other hand, it is so monumentally awful that perhaps the fact that it is "one-of-a-kind" is a blessing in disguise.
