I respect Mike Hodges, and love getting Carter great because it's dark prospects, but The Croupier looks like a particularly dull ITV drama. <br /> <br /> The reserved cold acting is not just the main character keeper. , it's spread to the whole cast, which means there's nothing to contrast Owen's character. <br /> <br /> None of the characters call any kind of feelings except boredom. The end of the film is also at best sloppy. <br /> <br /> The camera works etc. is pretty good, but if you want to see how Hodges look the best, visit Carter, don't break through with this uninteresting, unattractive trawl.
