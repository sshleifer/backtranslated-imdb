I look forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating. It was a great disappointment. It does not hold a candle to contemporary zombie flashes such as Shaun of the Dead, day of death, land of death, etc. Horror flames sometimes take a while to go, you have to build up the characters as soon as they sniff it. , you feel a bit of empathy, but still there is a full 45 minutes to go through, even before you sniff a corpse, until then, as if looking at a bad soap, nothing of interest or relevance does not happen and if you look at it for the first time, you can honestly look at 45 minutes, you will not miss anything suddenly. When things go, it's all very sub-par things. Some of the death and make-up are well done, others are very poorly done, consistency exists here and there are some very shocking continuity errors and some of the most woodworkers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It can all be sensible if you really believed it all happened on a plane, but with rifles being fired, firearms being released, no pilots in the cabin in a violent storm , the plane stays in the air. Let's go It's not all simplicity. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it really takes a whole minute for a fighter's missile to hit a plane a few hundred yards away. I know this is a zombie movie and you have to stretch things, but this movie along with the other major deviations listed above has no credibility. One to miss.
