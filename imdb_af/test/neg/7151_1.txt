Help, I finally ended up in the biosphere! What a totally silly movie it is. Actually, nothing is good about it. <br /> <br /> Let's spit it out: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is incredibly fast: a terrorist group against the EU is chasing a lot of guys driving around in Western Europe . delivery of transparent bags full of xtc pills. And the worst thing is: they are serious about it! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of acting must be very shy on all faces concerned. <br /> <br /> 3) Some valid guys have decided to let everybody speak English so that the international market can start. Oddest ad ever! The French and Dutch mother tongue speaks cleverly everything makes sense and the result is laughing. <br /> <br /> 4) The soundtrack is completely wrong and selected incorrectly. <br /> <br /> 5) The camera edit and effects work is supposed to be of some post noir road movie type style, but is almost worthless and not meant to accompany this story (read: anti -storie). <br /> <br /> 6) Hidde Maas. Wildschut's hero never fails to convince. A true actor. Usually I give an extra point just for him to be. But no, sorry, not this time, I won't just forgive myself ...
