The Man (Gaston Modot) and the Young Girl (Lya List) go through the film that is consumed by passion for each other. They want to be together, but their moments are constantly interrupted. The movie is covered with images and comes to an hour quiet ......... find the loved ones happiness ....? <br /> <br /> But the movie is starting to look interesting with footage of scorpions, but you soon realize it's all a pretentious piece of nonsense. It is made as a silent movie with occasional dialogue and it has a non-stop soundtrack that is so annoying at one point that you turn off the sound and watch it as a silent movie. The continuous drum roles have made the theater audiences crazy. There are a few funny moments, for example when the man kicks a dog and when he knocks over a blind man. Unfortunately, this humor is performed in the name of art, so it is just pseudo-nonsense. The movie is crap.
