This movie should be one of the most boring and stupid movies Perrugorria did. <br /> <br /> It looks like a commercial from start to finish. The 'director' spends all the time on a tripod, it doesn't have a pace, rhythm. It is illogical. what a mess. You can tell what's going to happen since the first 15 minutes, and the end ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler ------- <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ, how did hell shoot Perrugorria? Are you serious? The worst scene of someone ever shot! <br /> <br /> ------ end of spoiler ----- <br /> <br /> Bad direction, bad writing, bad play ... Actually bad overall. I would not recommend this movie at all. It's a waste of money and time.
