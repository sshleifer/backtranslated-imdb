This movie is actually so poor in its desperate efforts to "feel good" and coincidentally, it really made me embarrassed to see it. I can't imagine how the inner circle of Norwegian celebs and press had to pretend to hold it on the star packaging premiere. His great media reviews are a sickly example of how ridiculously small and innate the Norwegian media scene is. If a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen, it would have received the rains of rotten tomatoes that deserve it. <br /> <br /> The combination of literally amateur actors, homemade style visual effects, awkward dialogue, painfully ruthless work-class humor efforts and the exaggerated and meaningless plot make it truly a movie of rock. Stay away.
