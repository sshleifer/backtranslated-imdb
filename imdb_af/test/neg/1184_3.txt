I just get these reviews! I can't help thinking they are written by the kind of LOG fan that will worship something they ever do without questioning whether it's actually good. <br /> <br /> I'm a massive fan of the program, but thought this movie was a useless project. I could forgive the ridiculous plot when I came out of the theater and laughed more than twice. At one point I thought it might just be me before I realized that there was little laughter from the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from a plot (very few TV comedies stand out over 90 minutes), but thought the weird piece of the classic LOG dialogue or visual joke (as The beginning of each program would carry a movie. After 5 minutes of the 17th century plot, I begged to end it (little did I know it would continue for the rest of the movie). It just wasn't funny. <br /> <br /> I was just greatly disappointed and can't see how history is too friendly, even if some die-back fans write enthusiastic reviews.
