Now I remember what the 'indie' filmmakers were doing before Pulp Fiction. This was David Lynch, right? <br /> <br /> I was chasing this thing to see Kyle Secor. What a waste of a perfectly good Bayliss. It was so painful to see him, as when someone you love is terribly ill and there is nothing you can do. <br /> <br /> Almost every click in the book: the desert, the psycho, the peculiar mob boss, the cyclist, Tracy Walker (who was fortunately only in one scene, but I expected him to appear again and something Strange and deeply saying, "If a man wants to know where he is going, he must look where he is." or some constructed garbage. I have a theory as to why so many Indians are in the desert shortly. I think that's because they can save money on lighting. <br /> <br /> If you like pain, find this movie and give it a viewing. If you're a fan of Kyle Secor, check out Homicide on Court TV. If you want a good, exciting road thriller, watch Wild At Heart. <br /> <br /> There is a reason no one has heard of Delusion! My God, what a waste of good title.
