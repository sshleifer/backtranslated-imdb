It's a typical college comedy and its very average. The story is OK, but not very entertaining. It's about an unhappy man named Reno who loses his job, makes his car flee and then dies his uncle in a strip bar. He does have a girlfriend (a good one. :-). Anyway, this uncle gives him his home in LA and mercedes as heritage and soon Reno and his girlfriend are moved to LA to this new home. The problem is that they need a few households to pay the high rent for this house and so the movie unfolds ... <br /> <br /> The movie starts well and has some funny jokes here and there , but suddenly the movie goes straight to hell. The end is BAD. Really bad. It destroys everything about the movie. You'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
