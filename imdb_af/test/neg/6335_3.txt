Another cookie cutter film about a hardened adult that meets a beautiful street quarter (Cop and 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And again, it's not funny or interesting, because anyone should look - children or adults. I'm sure some people can find this movie amusing, but I have no earthly idea why. Once again, I feel sorry for the poor children who were forced to work in this movie so that everyone and their parents could make a few dollars at the price of a cheese-like cheese film.
