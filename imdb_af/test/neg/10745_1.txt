Dear Sir Dante, <br /> <br /> Dude, serious ... the title of the show is "Masters of Horror". And if that is possible, it is supposed to be an opportunity to showcase your horror cupboards, to show the world why you deserve to be called a 'master' of the genre. Of course you misunderstood the exercise. Of course, you thought it was your opportunity (or worse, your duty) to educate the American public about your political beliefs. And your effort comes down as disgusting, tolerant, and especially preaching. <br /> <br /> The only reason someone showed you your short as a high score is because their political views fit yours and they are the kind of people who don't let that kind of politics in their throat. down. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, don't give a damn you believe, they believe I believe ... I just want such obvious (not subtle) and unfunny (not satire) messages from my horror. And while there were definitely other "Masters of Horror" that were great disappointment or over which I was generally confused, that director (william malone?) Be considered a genre "master" ... yours fails past the rest just miss the whole point of the series. <br /> <br /> So next time ... please just keep your prick politics for yourself?
