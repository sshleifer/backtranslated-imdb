I thought "Born to Kill" to be an exciting, high-voltage film noir. Instead, he has two good action pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and a wonderful atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a "glamor" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the movie is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psychic kick, but it is a rigorous on-the-number performance, which mechanically determines what the audience expected of him to "Dillinger" (an over-rated movie but at least better than that). Claire Trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to appeal any audience, and the action (as it is) remains so resolute in that damn house in San Francisco. The film becomes claustrophobic rather than truly exciting. It is one of those movies in which supporting players - especially Elisha Cook, Jr. (Whose character is gay-exaggerated for Tierney's, is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious writing) and Isabel Jewell - leads the leaders. It also doesn't help nearly half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins reviewed the screenplay of psycho-screeners in "Psycho". Tierney's is so coarse and obvious that he may also have tattooed "PSYCHO" on his forehead. There is also no indication in the film, as that is why the source list is called "Deadlier than the Male" - but perhaps James Gunn has made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the movie. "Born to Kill" is a real disappointment to Robert Wise, who has already had some quality films under his belt and would continue with a star career.
