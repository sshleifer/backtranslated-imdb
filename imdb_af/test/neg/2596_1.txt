It's so sad that so many people "love" Family Guy, because it's easily one of the worst programs on TV. There are many points to address here. <br /> <br /> The Flashbacks: Now, in Season 1 and 2, which I think was exceptional, the flashbacks were pretty regular, and actually tied in what the plot was and was even funny. Now season 4 and beyond, the flashbacks come even more, and have nothing to do with the plot, are not funny, and very long, boring and meaningless. Family Guy thinks the long haul scene that goes nowhere is funny, if it's really bad. <br /> <br /> Stewie: Wow, a baby that sounds British. How funny can it be? It's not. His character is so unstable, it's incredible. Remember in the early season when Stewie was all about world domination and murdered Lois. Well, he only has scenes that are uncomfortably gay with Brian. Want to be world domination to be gay = bad writing. <br /> <br /> References: How do they keep bad references to 80's TV shows or events? Well, they just use the same old garbage. You know, in 20 years, Family Guy will hopefully be canceled. If they still make jokes about the 80's exhibits, it will be even more irrelevant than before. Because will have forgotten. I still wonder why they can't write good episodes with good jokes. <br /> <br /> Voting: My God, the voices in this show are so poor. Seth McFarlene should just focus on writing his crappy episode and stop voting. All the extras in the already bad Family Guy episodes all sound the same. The Simpsons get 6 or 7 people to do ALL the voices. A few of them vote about 15-20 characters ... everything sounds very different. But why can't Family Guy do it? Oh, right, this is a crappy show. <br /> <br /> The Stuttering: Usually done by Peter, Stewie, Brian and any extras, when they talk or offend, they must emit their sentence just to try and get a cheap laugh. I can't believe Family Guy can't even talk normally to make people laugh at their "jokes". <br /> <br /> Conviction: OK, short and simple, Family Guy tries to break the barrier and be cutting edge, but they actually get flat every time. Go see South Park ... <br /> <br /> Terrible Plots: The plots and story lines are just quite trash. The Simpsons started their 20th seasons, but have even better plotted as Family Guy. In total, 8 or 9 minutes are flashbacks and dragons that are not relevant. <br /> <br /> Popularity Many little kids have Stewie shirts and think he's so funny when they really don't even get the horribly written sex jokes. They just say, "Oh, ha ha, stew!" when they don't even get it. Family Guy has been canceled twice, and brought back by the DVD sales, how sad it is. They canceled for the first time after the 2nd or 3rd season, and I honestly believe it had to be. those episodes were then excellent, they had to leave on a high note. <br /> <br /> Drag Scenes and Falling There are scenes that go too long. One who had just sent out last Sunday, went to Peter for an executive bathroom, after which the intro to the Jurassic Park was implemented about 2 minutes. The episode's plot is also stolen from a Seinfeld episode. Also a scene when Chris works at a store and speaks to the employee about 5 minutes about a movie, which also includes the stuttering. The chicken plains are so blunt, 3 of them, each longer than the last. Useless, unfunny writing, thinks people enjoy long scenes of revival, between a chicken, and a chicken. Now, every time someone falls, and NO FAMILY GUY FAN, THINK THAT, every time they fall, it's under a secondary second and they ALWAYS count with their arm over their back to make them look funny . Guess it was used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Herman Oh yeah, everyone thinks the old pedophile is so funny if it's just a very bad run. they even went to give his screens (which are very poor) and to base all episodes around him, they did the same thing with other characters, like the doctor I know had an episode around him. > <br /> The Simpsons Well, not much explanation needed here. There is so much evidence from family guy who steals Simpson's jokes. How family man is just a poor men Simpsons. So I'm sure I've forgotten some important points somewhere, but I'm sure it's enough to prove that the older man is really a terrible, scary writing TV program. Everyone seems to love when they really have to look at Simpson's, Seinfeld and Frasier.
