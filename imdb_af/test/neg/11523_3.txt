I really had to learn more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those movies where you keep watching what it looks like, it should get better. Then, when it ends, you feel stupid because you have wasted precious time in your life that you can never return. Ice-T did his bad thing and it was the highlight of the evening. The photos of the shuttle seem to have been done with a small toy in a box and the space-walking scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space packs. The writing was missing and the car hunt scene with the man who was bleeding and unconscious was amazing because he had better management than I could have on one of my best days. All in all, I got worse, but it's probably not one I would recommend or want to remember.
