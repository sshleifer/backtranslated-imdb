The best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many cliches it is. Strange Chinese gangsters. A woman vice president. A ventilator that is big enough to fit a big Caucasian man. Shoot through the wall to kill the bad guy. A situation where you have to sniff innocent people to prevent Armageddon. Independence day scenes where you sniff some memorable landmarks into a fireball. The vice-president in a nicely well-lit room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese prime minister shines almost alone in a dark room with just a little light, shining like the smart gangsters. A once-off hero left alone in a ship (building, airplane, whatever) causes havoc on bad guys with huge automatic weapons. Even so. <br /> <br /> The second best way is to count how many you have to put in the decimals to accurately measure the likelihood of the movie situation. I counted up to 45. A president agreed for a meeting aboard a private vessel. The impossible non-transferable command from the nuke box. The part where the Chinese decided to play shot them up. Etc. Etc. Man is more likely to fall into the sun than this movie to happen. <br /> <br /> I admit that the movie was interesting to the point that the evil Taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president. Then the boredom kicked. Suspension of disbelief stopped, and I began to think the fun that I tortured this movie ...
