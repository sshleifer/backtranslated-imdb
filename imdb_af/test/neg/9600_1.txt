I am a fan of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and "Boa vs Python" and is building my collection to such big titles as "Troll 2" and "What's up Superdoc?" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it on the list of amazing horrible movies. It's just lame. The man who said he had a better dialogue with his potted plants was right. Everything about this movie is stupid. When the robot man walks in the car, he almost seems to know it is going to blow up, there was no reason he'd ever run in that direction. "Judge, Jury and Chief Executive Officer," "The perfect cop ... but they went too far," I mean, come on now, why do people save these movies? R.O.T.O.R. make it because it is hysterically terrible, but Storm Trooper is just a waste of theater because it's not even bad enough to be so bad, it's worth watching. It belongs to someone's home movie collection, something they may be proud of, but that's all. I thought it was on a high school channel (with only one star, so I watched it) because it wasn't there. Even if you love bad movies, don't see this movie. It's shameful.
