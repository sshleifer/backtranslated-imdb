This movie, which I just discovered at the video store, apparently sat for a few years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two friends living in New York looking for their high school couple, now residing under the Coney Island boardwalk. It seems to be a very good movie, but ultimately it is deviated from the story focusing on Stan and Daniel. , rather than their homeless friend Richie. Cooked is, as usual, very good and the film has a spectacular sight, with the haunting images of Coney Island. Author Cryer and director Richard Schenkman, however, are too busy handling the rather uninteresting life of Stan and Daniel, rather than focusing on Richie. One flash in a music store where Richie put an employee to the test, stood up and showed the viewer where the movie was over. But in the end, not much. Two very elusive scenes of annoyance, as inside the Skeeball building. RATING 4 out of 10.
