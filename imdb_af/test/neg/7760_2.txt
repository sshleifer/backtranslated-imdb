Yes, I couldn't stop throwing, and neither did my friend. Incredibly boring - 90 minutes seems to stretch for at least 3 hours - and I'm not even a fan of action movies, but it just falls asleep - unless you're wearing a 70's polo neck sweater! <br /> <br /> ** ANY SPOILERS FOLLOW. ** If you expected something to happen, don't hold your breath - don't! <br /> <br /> However, it is quite a failure to convince or engage the viewer. It is like a long, boring and rather drained dream. Frederic drives through it, can leave work whenever he wants, and with attractive secretaries, tea and messages are continually bringing. Of course not real life! And an office with almost no paper or files - just a huge calendar to let you know that the movie really takes 6 months to watch. <br /> <br /> Frederick never touched any true emotion, and his wife and children didn't act like patches of flesh - in stark contrast to any real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong views, never gives the appearance of something to feel. The only 3 seconds of any real feeling occurs between a couple being catered for in a cafe and having nothing to do with the plot. <br /> <br /> Well, so maybe there are moral considerations, but if it's entertained, or even good movies you're looking for, I think this movie is incredibly over rated by most other viewers.
