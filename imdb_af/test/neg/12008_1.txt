What a horrible movie. Full of cliches, confusing scenes, very bad acting, and an atrotious script. It is difficult to believe the same guys what The People vs. Larry Flint wrote and Man on the Moon wrote this garbage. Man, this makes my list of Top 10 worst movies of all time. Did this man, this director, if you could call him, realize that the first Problem Child was bad enough? Leave it a sequel for it !! ?? Amazingly that piece of garbage films like this can be shown that children are still released! 1 out of 10 * s
