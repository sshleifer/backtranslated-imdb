It's the worst movie I've ever seen, as well as the worst I will ever see. I don't need to catch up on what the others have said before. Just be warned. <br /> <br /> It's NOT one of the bad movies you think you want to watch, because you want to make it. BATH BAD BATH BATH BATH BATH BATH BATH BATH BATH. <br /> <br /> This movie is the equivalent of a "pet rock" as your friend. You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, it never happens. At least with a pet stone you knew what you were doing. Lion's Gate totally deceives this bombing ... No ... it's a disaster. After watching this movie, you would swear that George W Bush had already made his hands on making this movie ... yes this is idiotic. Stay away, unless of course you just want to look at the worst movie of all time. It's probably how the Lions gate figured out, it would make some money out of this piece.
