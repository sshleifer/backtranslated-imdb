This is 'realism'? If Rivette wanted to give us a ground-level study of a woman at some point and time and how she could influence (and influence) the world around him, he failed. Most prominent because we never get an idea why thousands of men would follow her in the battle. There is certainly not enough explanation of the cultural / historical context to define the country's need for such a savior and, God knows, there is nothing particularly charismatic about Joan as she is presented here. Unless Bonnaire's timber layouts and platinum readings are supposed to indicate transcendent faith and determination. The use of landscape is particularly uninspired - we never lose the feeling that we are watching twentieth-century actors wandering in a so-called medieval landscape. And as far as the arguments are concerned (which, unlike some commentators, claim to take a good 15% of the scenes), they look like some of the local clubs of your local high school who have repaired a medieval siege. No doubt more passion in it. However, I will give Rivette credit to portray a side of Joan that is released by other movies: that of a petulant, naive and narcissistic adolescent (who has been played twice by a woman, at least twice the Of course, the age of the character she is supposed to portray is unable to understand her place within the movement she helps to create or the world beyond her own passions. Joan's outrage at her own soldiers who swear and amaze the lack of respect and obedience to the enemy is spontaneous and credible (you suddenly realize that such moments have naturally occurred) in an otherwise unfinished historical "performance". Unfortunately, they also serve exactly what is not addressed on the screen - what has Joan SPECIAL made? I also have to say that I am also surprised and frustrated by some foreign film lovers who seemed tedium and that there is no dramatic involvement in "artwork" and "seriousness". Does this film increase our understanding or involvement in the subject? Or with something for that matter? 10/04.
