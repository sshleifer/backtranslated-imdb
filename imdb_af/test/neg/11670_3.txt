Intelligent summary, isn't it? <br /> <br /> If Mad Max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special, but nothing wrong, they made it up with the sequel, The Road Warrior. So, in theory, with a third big movie, it would have been a good trilogy ... now it's not! <br /> <br /> Such a great disappointment was Beyond Thunderdome! The main prospect is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but it's not done with too much conviction. Add the unpleasant Tina Turner and the no good storyline of the people waiting on a plane and it's just one big stinker. Maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 (although that one is probably just a big budget blast kind of thing), because it's just not right. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
