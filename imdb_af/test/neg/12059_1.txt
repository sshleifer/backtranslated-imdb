Camp Blood is an absolutely horrible slasher movie. We mix the Friday with the Blair Gate project and add a killer in a clown mask. <br /> <br /> The budget for this film had to be very low, some of the actors played several. parts and the camera used have a picture similar to the colored version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, which if anyone watched it, it looked poor. <br /> <br /> This movie was just as bad. There is nothing in the movie that is even worth watching. The fact that I watched it all the time amazed me. Just take my advice and don't buy or rent this movie. It's terrible.
