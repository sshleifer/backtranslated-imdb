Hungary can't make good movies. Fact. This is a good example of this. <br /> <br /> First of all the term "plot" does not exist in this movie. It's bad. Even if many people argue with me about it. Sure, it's about a taboo, but it's about it. There are endless possibilities, which could have been very good, if used, but they almost skipped everything. I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures, which is the only decent thing in this whole hope of horror. <br /> <br /> The acting is just scary. There aren't many lines, so you'll think the actors have good facial expressions or mimicking abilities, but no. In fact, 86% of the time, they suck. And that's when they say nothing. If they even say a single word, you will start to tilt your head and say, "It's unrealistic." But again, this is partly the fault of writing. There is also no emotion in most dialogues. <br /> <br /> Editing is sometimes OK, but most of the time is illogical and worsens the whole picture. It could have given an emotional touch, but the editing looks like cuts to one another. <br /> <br /> Someone explains to me why critics say this movie is a masterpiece. Calling it an art will not make it any better. Sorry Mundruczo, but you failed. Live with it Even you will probably not care about me or any other guys' opinion that violates your "child".
