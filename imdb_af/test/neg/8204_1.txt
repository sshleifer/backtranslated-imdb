That distinction must go to the DUNGEON OR HARROW. At least Ed Wood's deceived attempt to make a quality science fiction film has the dubious "star" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OR HARROW doesn't have a redeeming feature at all. What could be an interesting and exciting plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERY ISLAND, is turned away by heavy dialogue and mono tonal acting amateurs whose lines sink like weights into a sea of ​​stupidity. The "special effects" that took place in someone's bathtub further reduce this film to the mishap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy cannot be contracted in his last stages of an individual suffers from the plot line that Aristocrat Fallon and his wife Cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original inhabitants of the Castle De Sade, doomed to madness and inhuman cruelty. . It is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another movie. No wonder, talent explores talent; Lack of talent becomes oblivion, and that is where this film has to find its most dubious end.
