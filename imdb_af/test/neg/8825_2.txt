Othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this movie. The bad portrayal of Shakespeare's characters and the terrible display of the love that Desi and John had, made this movie the terrible filth. Verreweg, Othello, led by Jeffery Saks, is over medium and horrible. <br /> <br /> The movie Othello is a pitiful drama about the love between John and Desi. Their faithfulness will be tested by the man's friend. In the beginning of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparable. Moments later, Ben Jago, John's friend appears in the screen that scares the viewers and immediately shows them how much of a liar and a power-hungry person he is. <br /> <br /> By far, this movie was much more terrible than the Shakespeare novel itself. Having said that, it has a minimal amount of good parts. For example, the love shown between John and Desi was very well portrayed and the couple seemed to be inseparable; just as explained in the book. Although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still didn't show jealousy that Othello had between Cass and Desi. <br /> <br /> Love, jealous, deceptive, this movie is based on all three main topics in the Shakespeare novel. However, the novel really explains how it all got together much better than the movie could. For example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. Much more detail is also included in the novel. Therefore, this film is such a disappointment, trust me, those who read it will also find it disappointing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film was by far the most horrifying representation of a novel ever poured out on humanity. By avoiding seeing this movie, viewers will not only save an hour two of their lives, but will also save an eye or two of Ben Jago's insatiable face as they look.
