Anatomy is not very unique in horror genre, in fact it is not even scary. It reminds me of his American cousins, abusers. It's just a copy of any other abuser and as a German movie it's just too American, with nothing to add to it. <br /> <br /> Actually, Anatomy is too predictable and boring, its plot is not intact and consistent. It has dumb screens that don't even fit in a horror movie genre. Amusing sex scenes with pop music and topless women in lingerie. Why should they have it all in just one movie? Rather, they had to make a cheap German adult movie. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone because it's just too boring.
