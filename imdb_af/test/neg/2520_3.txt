I first heard of this movie when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his CDs "Werewolves and Lollipops". He said it was a lost classic that was completely ridiculous. As a lover of a terrible theater, I knew I was a surprise. <br /> <br /> This film is, hands off, one of the strangest things I've ever seen. Certainly one of the strangest feature films. Actually, a devil has taken one's form for a woman years ago, the woman died or something, the devil cried blood, the blood fell on the bed, the bed is now occupied and it now eats. Along with fruits, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. The people can vary between horny teens, mayors, gang members, servants or professional orgy throwers. There is also a sick guy who ate the bed but put his soul behind a picture in the room. <br /> <br /> Most movies let you plot the plot by exciting action. Deathbed takes another path: it basically tells you through narration exactly what happens while slow, dull murder scenes occur. Also, I have to say everyone who is eaten by the bed is surprisingly quiet. I would think if a bed was eating through the ways of a fifth degree scientific experiment, it would be a bit stingy. I think the nerve ends were not invented until 1981 or so. <br /> <br /> The story is funny, the direction is slow and beautiful, the sets are sparse, the scene is pretty painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors I've ever seen. It will probably make a big party movie if alcohol and smart asses are involved. Surely one you should not miss.
