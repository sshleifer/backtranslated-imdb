I rarely give one or ten stars to any movie, but it was so terrible, I had to make an exception. <br /> <br /> I'm a science fan and have seen some comedies go on sci-fi, which I really like. There was nothing here to love. <br /> <br /> I realize it's been starting with a very small budget by a film student. But even if considered, sets and effects are bad. The cinematography is mediocre, but can be the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. A sad condition when the female voice-over for the computer is the best actor. The dialogue is bad. The writing is very poor and the plot is incoherent and almost inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The humor is not only subtle and sublime; it is nowhere to be found. As an example, a full 20 minutes of the 80-minute movie is being spent on a 2-point lame combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator. <br /> <br /> It was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50s sci-fi to 2001. What we end up with is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's sci-fi movie. At least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously.
