Well, the movie wasn't terrible, but whoever created the screenplay didn't do a good job of even creating the essence of the younger one. This movie was slightly lower than the average and didn't tell the story correctly to one of the most interesting people ever born. I suggest reading the book "one of a child", the true story story. They left out much of his life. They also sometimes did not understand the true characters he was. The real facts of his life were sometimes out of order. And in the end, they didn't really portray the real personality he had. So don't look at the movie; read the book. By the way, I'm not just a few who feel you should stay 100% for the right story, but they didn't even get close !!!
