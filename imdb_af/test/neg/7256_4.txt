So you're a giant mantis and you've been hanging out in the Arctic jungle for a while, and you're tired of Eskimos hitting snowballs. What is a giant mutant insect to do? Head for the big city, of course! See the sights, maybe a show on Broadway. But wait! Just when you find a nice cozy tunnel to call your own, some awkward people start attacking you! Oh no! Time to Smash! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is one step on most other giant bug movies, as it has pretty decent FX for 1957. But that's about it. Avoid unless you really have to see another big mistake or see another Perry Mason actor in a B-movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
