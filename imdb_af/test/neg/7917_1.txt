I loved that all the dogs went to heaven so much that I could see the successor in the theater, and I can't remember being more disappointed by a movie. The story is worse than an excessive bag miss. I mean, come on! How can Carface possibly suggest that he can get revenge on an animal so much bigger than he, however angry he is. Plus what Satan depicts as a CAT?!?! How clich√© can you get? So much for the story. Is it a wonder that Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Tayback won't hit it with a 10 foot pole? The animation was absolutely miserable. The colors are all washed out, and I can't count how many times I could see through objects that were supposed to be solid. It had to be the worst animation I've ever seen! I usually like animated movies, but not this BOMB!
