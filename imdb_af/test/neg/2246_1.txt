Hooray for Title Error Spellings! After reviewing reviews and considering, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is a whole lot of trash. This movie has lost her as one of those Rare Tarantino fans. I wish it was made on nitrate film, and all the copies were neatly loaded under a Tarantino fanboy chain smoke. The literally unnecessary violence, the plot holes, Tarantino's table-it-sans-drama, and absent character development made it a very painful, glorified montage. <br /> <br /> What play was there? And how many of them were just because I was too busy reading the captions? I looked at my part of the anime-based fans and kudos for the attempted authenticity, but it was redundant for an English film. With the frightening historical inadequacies, the constant reading has killed what has happened. <br /> <br /> Why pay money for a narrator who will have absolutely no bond with any of the characters, plot, themes, institution or anything involved in the movie? When the movie needs this kind of hand explanation, it is predicted the next dirt. <br /> <br /> Historical research - while being mocked by interesting facts, using the right costumes and props for the soldiers, this movie stretched the truth even for historical fiction. Kudos on Mata Hari reference, although used as a shadow, was a bit much. Mata Hari was run by a pan, not choked in a secluded room. It ruins any sentence the reference may have had. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mention more than half a dozen tribute to other artists in the first 15 minutes. In view of the audience, all these and other references were completely lost to many who would bother to see this movie and everyone who would enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I'm confused by his choices of when a scene begins, ends, and what needs to be included. In a movie promoted as an action movie, why did it take nearly 20 minutes to set up any testosterone? <br /> <br /> What I believe to be the message was urgent. The idea of ​​rats and how we act on their primary, and "who is the rat?" was at its best clichéd, but realized the worst. The indication of American camps for the Japanese and German Americans would have added legitimacy to this question to the moral high ground. Literally, every character in the film playing a roll of voice is trapped in their own legend. Is it the world in which Tarantino lives? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one. I'm sorry I didn't bother to see it at all, even with good ministry. There was a rich base of ideas to develop, but no one realized.
