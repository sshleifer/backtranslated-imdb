I'll start shooting the movie first. Remove Abbott and Costello from the cast and you have a hilarious movie, stiff cardboard box, bad sound (especially during the song!) And called annoying dialogue (for example, listen to the line "Mr. Dinklepuss" infinitum). It is clear that some studio hack thought they could enter Disney's CLASSIC "Mickey and the Beanstalk" presentation, but perhaps the audiences were no longer gullible (unlikely) or trapped in a dual function (more likely). Even children should be insulted by showing them this movie. An overall waste of celluloid. Now about Abbott and Costello's acting. Bud Abbott always played the straight man, and through all the accounts the more beautiful person was off the set. On the radio, his character was usually the smooth fast-paced talk, and was especially funny when his speed fled him and was smooth about the mistakes. In the movies, he still plays the straight man, but is more of an artist. Not that he's bad, but Groucho Marx played this character in perfection. The true crossover of the duo on film is Lou Costello. Again, on the radio he was funny. He played a character that was a bit slower than Abbott, but not too slow! He also sharpened the lines and laughed at him when he abdated at Abbott's mistakes. On film I don't know if it's his decision or not, but in the movies his character becomes an indifferent personification of Stan Laurel, who in turn is even more readily done by Jerry Lewis. Why the change? He was funny on the radio when he was a smart - but here he becomes a childish character who looks like he's in every shot for the cameras. This characterization is shown in every movie they do, and just spotted the reputation they had on the radio. What remains of their film career is a poor (very, very poor) copy of Laurel and Hardy. The movies would have been much harder if they played their radio characters instead of the kickback of stock throws.
