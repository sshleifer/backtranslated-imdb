It's movie is rubbish, it looks really funny on the previews, but I didn't even laugh at the whole movie. Do yourself a lot of favor and don't waste your money on it, don't waste someone's money on this stuff. I gave it 1/10 believe me, I would have given it less if I could. I'm a 15 year old man and I thought it was trash if you wanted to watch a good movie, go out and see Jay and Silent Bob hit back.
