Good cinematography, good acting good direction ... cannot justify a story that is not acceptable to any society. Amitabh often used the media to sell this junk by saying it - if such an incident happened ... then what? I want to ask him if something like this happens to your own child or your grandchild (say girl child), what will you do? I think every parent needs to take special care before talking to a 60-year-old neighbor if you have one-jia with you. Such movies should be banned and discouraged, otherwise you will inspire more Nithari cases. Such acts are shameful and villains in films are punished. It must be the moral of the story and not their act or glory.
