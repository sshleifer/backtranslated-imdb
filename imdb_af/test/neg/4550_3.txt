If you want soap series, you might like this movie. I recommend this movie to fans of Dutch soap series such as GTST, Westwind or even American stuff like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you don't like those things, stay away from this movie. It has the same kind of visual style, the same quality of acting, direction and writing. The movie was a big hit at home, but was not sold elsewhere outside Holland and Belgium. A little funny for a commercial movie like this. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's something ...
