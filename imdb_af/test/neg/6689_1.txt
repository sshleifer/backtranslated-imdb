It was horrible, mean, and full of the worst clicks and racial stereotypes I've seen in a long time. Seeing Hayden P trying to act "ghetto" was painful (hello, one pants muscle on your sweat and some braids. It doesn't make you a little bit homosexual). Solange knows many grimaces throughout the movie. Most of the series look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes ... what was the final? And poor Rihanna is simply exploited to let people see her "deed", which she can't. <br /> <br /> Simply, this movie Downs even earns one star. Please put this tired franchise to rest. Or at least make the next one. Bring It On IV: Cheerleaders vs. Freddy & Jason.
