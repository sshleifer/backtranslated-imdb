If she was not married to the producer, Jennifer Jones was not the obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic story of a relationship between an American soldier and an English nurse, against the background of the First World War was not. Her British accent is not perfect, and in the fifties it was unusual for a great romantic leader to go to an actress in her late thirties and even as attractive as me. Jones, especially when she was a few years older than her foremost man. There were quite a few beautiful young British actresses in Hollywood, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons and Joan Collins. Anyone might be more convincing in the role, but Miss Jones has one important feature they all have. missing a marriage certificate with David O. Selznick's name on it. In that case, the movie was such a turkey that they were undoubtedly grateful not to have it on their CVs. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the romance between Frederick, an American volunteer serving at the Italian army as an ambulance driver and Catherine, a nurse with the British Red Cross. After the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, Frederick was wrongly accused of being a German spy and sentenced to death. (The film shows a very hard picture of Italian military justice; it appears that the Italian courts of Martial had the power to pass the death sentence after a trial lasting thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without the defendant is legally represented or to speak in his defense). Frederick manages to escape and cross the border into neutral Switzerland, accompanied by pregnant Katina. <br /> <br /> Hemingway's novels were not always a great success when filmed. Howard Hawks managed to make a good version of "To Have and Have Not", a movie that is significantly better than the book on which it was nominally based, but that is because he largely ignored Hemingway's plot and film in a remake of "Casablanca", in Martinique rather than in France. Like the 1943 version of "For Who The Bell Tolls", "A Farewell to Arms" has survived and it is deadly slow moving. This is also overlooked. Jennifer Jones never made Catherine come to life. Regarding Rock Hudson, his supposed Christian name can unfortunately be appropriate. He can be as solid as a rock, but also as unbearable as one, and in this film, Frederik looks like a personification of the Great Stone Face. Despite the passion and emotion inherent in Hemingway's plot, the emotional temperature is always too cool. The picture has little for it, apart from the attractive picture views of Italian and Swiss scenery. It is not surprising that it was not a success and that his failure to finish his career as a producer ended. 4/10 <br /> <br /> A Goof. Shortly before Caporetto's struggle, an Italian official stated that Russia had already concluded a separate peace with Germany. That battle began in October 1917 when Kerensky's Russia was still fighting with the Allies. The Russian Revolution did not take place until November; it was only the "October Revolution" through the old Julian calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed a ceasefire with Germany in December 1917, but a separate peace was not signed to the Brest-Litovsk Convention in March 1918.
