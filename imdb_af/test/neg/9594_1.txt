******** SPOILER ALERT ************** Waste 85 minutes of my life to watch this "movie". First, we think it is hilarious that the producer came into the movie as the autopsy doctor with a terribly incredible incredible accent - what was it, Romanian anyway? And how is it that in Denmark no one else speaks, except the swamp? (Note, the Scottish camp director ...). ? And who does the shopping for the swamp? Their pants look like they were bought at Banana Republic. Very beautifully dressed for 1200 years. This one was worse than Scarecrow Slayer (we didn't think it was even possible). We basically looked forward 75% of the film forward for any gore / death / scary moments. No found. Don't rent the DVD just to watch the 2 hours "behind the scenes of arc creatures" features. Who are these people? Are they serious? And the filmmakers are like 60 years old. I think it's their holy grail and it's pathetic enough in and of itself. BEST LINE FROM THE MOVIE, hands off: "Not bad for a girl who never went to school ...." My blind grandmother, who has Alzheimer's, can make a better movie.
