(This review will have some very obvious spoilers.) <br /> <br /> A friend made it over, and we made it 45 minutes from the movie before deciding that Fast Forward 8x Speed ​​was the only way. that this movie should be watched. There were points when we watched the movie at normal speed where I was going, preparing part of the lunch and coming back to find out that nothing literally happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. Nothing has happened, no significant gestures have been made, nothing but mental awkward silence. <br /> <br /> It's not how to make a thoughtful movie, especially when the movie's plot follows the same basic Hollywood movie. tropics. When I told you that Disney made a movie about 4 girls who started a band and the singer was a French exchange student, what would you expect to be the "conflict"? <br /> <br /> Should the chief singer be overwhelmed? Someone has an unspoken love? The band is late for their performance, and a silk character has to buy their time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> All this happens in this movie. <Br /> <br /> At no point in this movie do you even have the slightest worry of these girls not achieving their goal. <br /> <br /> * THIS IS THE DIVISION OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Heck, I even know all the bands that are in the record collections and MDs they go to, and I have been co-operating with the friends at karaoke. This is probably the worst movie I ever saw in Japan. Don't be confused. Although the characters will have points in the movie where they do typical Japanese high school things, it is not a "typical day in the life of" movie. It's a day in the life of 4 extremely random, heavy-duty, uncomfortable Japanese students. "<br /> <br /> There are also noticeable problems with the DVD. Viz decides that a big extra will be a producer who reads the Wikipedia entry on the Blue Hearts out loud. What a value! so little about the caption that the name of the group in the subtitles, "Paran Maum", is different from that in the chapter selection menu, "Paran Marum." In the final auditorium scene there is a VERY visible reflection / ghost effect on everything, but it seems to be the fault of the original movie. <br /> <br /> Don't look at whether you're not absolutely uncomfortable.
