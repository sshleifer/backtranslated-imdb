This program will be useful for the training of hardened criminals' basic human emotions. In addition, the show has no more value than filling bandwidth that would otherwise be unused in the electromagnetic spectrum. I feel a greater sense of tension and anticipation to listen to a computerized voice chip that endlessly eliminates the products of a random generator. Fortunately, the useful and regular way of playing for viewers will tell how they are supposed to feel, if they cannot fully internalize the predictable and shallow baseline. I found Amy to be a superficial positive character, as she is a role model for young women who can serve them in traditional male fields. Unfortunately, her completely subjective approach to the law is solely guided by any erratic personal guidelines that Amy prefers to employ, which results in Amy's trials looking closer to appeals to the personal mercy of a despot tribe. a true administration of justice. This display is unpleasant to some extent, although after two episodes it is relieved by the brain's God-given filtering processes, which will fortunately give the viewer the same pressure on the viewer's memory as a television set on a maximum channel volume. .
