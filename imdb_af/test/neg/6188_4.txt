Eric Idle, Robbie Coltraine, Janet Suzman - it was almost impossible to go wrong. Of course it has some funny moments - the scene in the showers when Robbie Coltraine is the Lur Chaney Jr's horrifying werewolf line, "I can't help myself" is hilarious. But finally, the plot, writing and direction are flat like a pancake and as tired as a 90-year-old nun, after 180 "Hail Mary" s. When I was a child, Carry On films filled this niche a little better, which is a very sad film filmed with such a promising movie.
