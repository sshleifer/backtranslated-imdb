I find Herzog's documentary work very uneven. Fata Morgana, a companion of Lessons of Darkness, lacks not only the shocking spectacle, but mostly the wise eye of a writer. This is compared to amateur look, aimless pans left and across the desert. The kind you would expect from a German tourist equipped with a handycam, the camera ran from a car running all sorts of meaningless images, wire fences, abandoned buildings and patches of dirt passing through the lens into chance sequence, with a slope of sand dunes. At one point, Herzog meets a group of starved cattle rotting in the sand, but the image is widely presented like you and I will, perhaps worse, keep the camera apart from one cattle to the next. For a documentary that seeks to be a visual feast, a hypnotic, surrealistic outing in unfamiliar provinces, it is not the visual orchestration and belief of a disciplined writer. It's all over the place, half-hearted and boring, Mayan creations spoken in voice-over, and other text Herzog focused on literature. It's not until near the end that Fata Morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters. First, with a man and woman playing music in a room, the man sings in a twisted voice through a microphone, both of which are apathetic in their task. A man holding a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of holes in the ground. Other than that, it seems like it's very little to offer or to offer visual beauty.
