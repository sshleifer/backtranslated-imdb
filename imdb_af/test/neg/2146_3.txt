After a little over 50 years of diligent movie viewing, I made some simple rules for making good movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Set up your main characters early, probably within the first half hour. 2. Keep your characters to a minimum. Adapting a novel combines features and actions of underage characters <br /> <br /> in one person. 3. Make sure your characters actions are credible; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation. 4. Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it should not be confusing, or 5. Get the best music that can buy money. Usually it matters more than acting, photography, etc. 6. Usually, if a movie is not very good within the first 10 minutes, it doesn't get any better. <br /> <br /> `Cannon for Cordoba 'is a handbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the worst I have ever heard in a modest budget. This is quite surprising considering Bernstein's references ('Man With the Golden Arm', 'The Magnificent Seven', 'The Great Escape', 'sons of Katie Elder'). Paul Wendkos's direction is slim and confusing. Performances range from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the usually reliable George Peppard who falls somewhere in the middle. It should not be surprising, seen the mediocre direction and amateurish writing that breaks lines 1, 2 and 3. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. I give `Cannon for Cordoba 'a` 3'.
