Honestly, regarding the death penalty, I can take it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love party for the killer, with absolutely no sympathy for the family. The performance of Wanda Jean, with its completely one-sided view, strengthens my view that she had to be executed for her crimes. It tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported that view. She was uncomfortable, but it also did her whole family, but that didn't mean they were all delayed. I can completely understand if someone is against the death penalty, but to completely ignore the crime, as if it did not happen, and try to place Wanda on a moral mountaintop is offensive, and that is not the side of The problem I will be associated with.
