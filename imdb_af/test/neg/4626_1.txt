I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel, so I knew it would be bad to start with, but I was surprised at how much worse it was than expected. The CG effects on the dragon were terrible, even for the Sci-Fi channel and the writing was pathetic. I couldn't tell if it would be as stupid as a joke or if it just came out. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it's so horrible that it's almost funny, especially the part where Patrick Swayze's knight character goes to his father Knight, who retired after losing his legs and now for the sole purpose in his armored bedding. to let the audience know he was a knight. The majority of the movie focuses on an enormous dragon egg that hatches into a not-so-big baby dragon with some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. It was just terrible.
