I dropped this vehicle from Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, and especially Murphy, for the first time, but to see it again, I recently saw that it has some very funny pieces. <br /> <br /> It's no way to say it's the best buddy comedy of all time, but really what can you do to the already exhausted subgenre? Which director, Tom Dey, tried to do, made it a satire of the clich√©s of the buddy comedy and the media. Early in the film, CEO of a cable network asks: "How is it different from Cops?" . That was when I saw it in a new light that I hadn't noticed before. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and make a twist on them. De Niro's reluctance to die in the show and to work with Murphy is right of every police you can think of. You can say that De Niro is actually playing and asking, "Why should I do another movie? Chase Renzi is portrayed as a Hollywood fool, but if you look at her opening scene again, she's just doing her job. She somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she does, but she wants to succeed in spite of that. One line says it all, "Who doesn't want to be on TV?" Maybe it reads too much in what is essentially A lightweight film is just to entertain, but it does give it a little spin I haven't noticed yet. <br /> <br /> Like Murphy, you have to estimate him to look ridiculous. Trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he puts in. Murphy was a big star and maybe it hit a nerve that was so fleeting. <br /> <br /> The plot with the gun is of course pretty boring, the action sequences are nothing special, except the end that requires a lot of effort from both the cast and the crew. err is over the villain that he is dressed like a pop star of 80's. George Michael emerges and adds to the entire media spin. <br /> <br /> So, I turned it over for the first time, but what is the slope; if you do, why don't you show how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy made it a great chance.
