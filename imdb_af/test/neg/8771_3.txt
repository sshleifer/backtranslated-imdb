I am a Christian, and I have looked at Christian movies well, but this one is too bad. They are trying to make it good, but it's too difficult for them to think. <br /> <br /> - You can see the movie being dubbed in many places. - You can almost think that the main characters in this movie have left the only behind. I think there will be many more of them. <br /> <br /> - The quality is poor, and the acting could have been better. The story is not that bad, but could have been better. The only plus I give is the story in this movie, but I can't rate it more than 3/10. Instead of "back"!
