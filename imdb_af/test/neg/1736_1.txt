The only people I recommend this movie are blind and deaf, although I'm sure a sadomasochis will get a kick from it. This movie had nothing; no acting, terrible music, terrible writing - just the power to suck any happiness out of your soul. You may now wonder why or even how I managed to put the full half of the brightness, and it is frankly a difficult concept for myself. First, I had to move up and down while the film progressed, because I found it very difficult to get comfortable. Secondly, I just made it without cutting out my own arm to kill something, by calling friends for moral support when the plot became extremely slow. The problem was that it became a matter of pride for me to complete thirty minutes after the opening, and that was a fatal mistake for me. I usually like movies to leave you with something in the end, but all these things are done ..... For the sake of your common sense, don't look at this movie.
