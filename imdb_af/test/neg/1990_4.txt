I'm surprised the hospital has been so well received by the critics and the public. I found it furious, visually ugly and generally meaningless. After the first almost irreconcilable 40 minutes, the film improves (relatively), but it remains to be seen by WAY (not to mention unfunny) to be successful as a satire, and has too little substance to succeed as a drama. The movie's uncertain tone is the biggest mistake that even overshadows Scott's tremendous (as usual) performance.
