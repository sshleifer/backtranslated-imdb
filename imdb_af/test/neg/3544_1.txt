I believe she's a good actress ... Not in the thriller series. <br /> <br /> The filming was trashy, and as I said, the plot stays ... although I watched it, I knew I was automatically in cheese, I have no idea how much worse this movie can get . <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie ... unless cheep is filming and poor writing you are looking for
