I don't usually appreciate light efforts to create humorous stories, which means "Anita no horse el Tren" can't write very high for me. The story is good: a middle-aged but still good woman finds a new love. But the efforts to make this film a romantic comedy have only managed to be somewhat comical. <br /> <br /> Rosa María Sardà has already shown that she can be a serious actress in such productions as "Amic / Amat" (qv), "Todo Sobre mi Madre" (qv), "Las Amargas Lágrimas de Petra von kant "(qv) and" el embrujo de shanghai "(qv). But the forces that have over the years worked out her very trivial things for the theater and for TV. Something similar can be said of José Coronado: perfectly capable of delivering serious performances. María Barranco is safe in this group. <br /> <br /> In the end, I had the feeling that I was really delighted to see a new set of this movie, in a serious tone that would allow actors to show their performance skills. And the strange thing is that it has to be done with exactly the same leading actors. Destroyed talent on a pretty silly movie that could indeed be very promising.
