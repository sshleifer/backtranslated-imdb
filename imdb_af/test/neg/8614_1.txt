The plot is simple: an American couple is on holiday in Thailand. Somehow they are attacked by the "almighty" Chinese vampires, and the girl is kidnapped by the big boss of the vampires. It's OK until now. The girl's partner is about to find her. And now the horror begins. He comes on a strange group of semi-vampires or something (they only drank animal blood). These vampires have been in conflict with the bad guy for about 800 years. But with the help of the "good vampires" the man starts looking for his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Now the battle scenes are starting, which is a karate movie without a fight? Another thing I noticed is that the vampires are very ugly guys. I mean .... A Vampire is an old-fashioned guy (he's been living since ... forever), he has style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie the vampires are .... strange. Like, come on, they ride on a bike, they are all dressed in leather and they destroy everything in their path. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that you can clearly see that this movie is a low budget one. The writing is boring and the actors are not too talented. The music is pretty good, but the effects aren't as good. <br /> <br /> Summing up the movie isn't that good, but if you have a free afternoon, watch it and tell me whether I'm right or not.
