I just bought this movie because I like to donate to Operation Smile, the charity on which the movie is based. But I found the writing of the movie very strange. It does not focus so much on Operation Smile or similar organizations such as The Smile Train and their Herculean efforts to alleviate the suffering of children born with facial distortions in third world countries. No, it focuses on an American teen volunteer, Katie, whose "privileged" life in Malibu, California, includes a mother bringing her to a doctor to get her pills in her before she sleeps with her boyfriend. . What is this birth control that we supposed to do, stimulate the audience? This is 2005. I would be more surprised if, in 2005, a Malibu teen was not on birth control, and even if she was, so what and what cares? Contrasting Katie is the character of Lin in China, a girl with a facial distortion who had the chance to get an operation last year and this year does not want one. No character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify, let alone the motivation of, or girl, also. On the other hand, the actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they dealt with who wrote this ridiculous writing. The best performance was by the gentleman who plays Lin's dad, although much of his dialogue is in Chinese and subtitled. Operation Smile deserves to be honored by a much better movie than this!
