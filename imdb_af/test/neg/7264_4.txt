I've never been a big fan of Almodovar, but in general I've always found something in his films. Unfortunately, I had more trouble finding something in Broken Embraces, then I would normally think I would. <br /> <br /> I find the biggest failure in Broken Embraces the characters and the lack of depth they show. The film is essentially a love story, one that is tragic, and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories. I found this problem from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero" has the director / screenwriter, Mateo, sex with a very attractive young woman he just met. His agent comes in as the woman leaves bashfully. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero" has the director / screenwriter, Mateo, sex with a very attractive young woman he just met. His agent comes in and rolls her eyes as the woman leaves bashfully. Mateo babbles something about the need to enjoy life as the only thing he has left. After being blinded in a tragic car accident, which also killed his 'real' love Lena, played by Penelope Cruz, the viewer could buy into this idea, except that the rest of the movie never really illustrates why Lena loved his life was not deep in his character or any other. <br /> <br /> Cruz plays Lena the mistress of an industrialist named Ernesto Martel. From the beginning, their union is rather pathetic, as Martel links his jealousy to Lena, and Lena avoids being alone by staying with the much older Martel. To move forward, Martel finances a movie for Mateo so he can hold tables on the star of the movie, Lena. Of course, without any back story, Lena and Mateo fall in love. And in Almodovar's world, it's really that simple. Mateo, in the opening scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now Mateo falls in love with Lena, later it is revealed that he had a son with his agent after his love affair. Her son reacted to this information with a laugh and a, "Oh, well." Again, no depth, no understanding of any of these characters, all of this just happens. From the beginning of the movie to the end, I didn't get any emotion from Mateo. He's flat and doesn't play much different from the one scene to the next. <br /> <br /> The one scene I enjoyed was when the film producer, Martel, watches video footage that his son does under the cover of a Mateo documentary. There is a moment when Martel looks obsessively while a lip reading confirms his worst fears. Later, Lena confronts Martel as he watches the footage and talks her part aloud to match the video of her lips as she talks. Some quite brilliant moments. Still confronted, but still really fascinating. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie surprised me, rather bored. I can't care about these characters or their situations, so no measure of cunning on Almodovar's part can be for this lack of depth. I think if you're a fan of his work, you'll enjoy this movie, but if you're like me, you'll miss it.
