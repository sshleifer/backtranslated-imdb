My housemate and I bought the video of 'The Roller Blade Seven' from our local second hand video book hoping to get a bad movie to laugh at. This film isn't even laughable, it's pathetically poor, worse than Jack Frost 2 and it says something. The writing, acting, production, stunts, sound, sets, everything is absolutely terrible. In some parts, the actors did not even learn their lines, and if they were blatantly ad-libbing or in one case, they actually read the lines and simply repeated them. Of course, in the post-apocalyptic Wheel Zone, the film consists of about 45 minutes of film, many of which are badly or repeatedly edited by the various camera angles to lengthen the movie. It gets boring very quickly. The plot makes no sense (it is apparently a merger of two books written by Scott Shaw), there are not even seven of them, most of them are not on blades, they carry roller blades and it seems like I am Most of the time the movie is sold completely because there is about 3 minutes of female half-naked in it. Author and star Scott Shaw obviously looks a bit like a Samurai and performs some very poor stunts throughout the film, making sword-fighting movements that seem massive amateur. In spite of this, his website says that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern filmmaking. My housemate and I were left speechless throughout the ordeal, and in spite of my regular efforts to burn the videotape, she decided it could be a kind of Ring-esquire video curse to be transmitted. If you see the video in stores, take it away from me! Leave neat!
