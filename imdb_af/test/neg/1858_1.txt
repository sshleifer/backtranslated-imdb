Jerry Angell, owner of zombie horror's finest mullet, returns for more vicious action in the sequel to director Todd Sheets's atrocious homemade Gore party Zombie Bloodbath. This time Jerry is playing a sloppy low-life villain, who, with his equally despicable partner-in-crime, some escaped prisoners, a few teenagers and a lot of screaming girls, comes face to face with a horde of gambling , meat-eating bodies. <br /> <br /> Obviously you've learned to improve its vessel in the two years since Zombie Bloodbath. Sheets still deliver a rubbish of a movie that is somehow worse than the original? An accomplishment I thought was almost impossible to achieve. The acting is uniform in common, the effects amateur and inexpensive (most of the gore is nothing more than a variety of lay-offs, waste and blood from the local butcher's shop), the story is incomprehensible (as far as I can understand the zombies from death) stand up because a scarecrow is on !!!) and the direction is frustratingly loaded with cheap looking video effects and totally meaningless cuts to black and white. <br /> <br /> And if it's not enough to convince you of this movie's complete lack of redeeming qualities, the simply sensible moronic end must do the trick: the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently a bumpy carnivorous bacteria on its passenger seat? Just the thing for the dissolution of the dead (but strangely enough, not at all detrimental to life).
