If he just didn't bow to clich√©, Mr. Shiban actually made a good movie of this story. It was just different enough to interest you, so for the same amount of time, energy and money spent on this stinker, we might have been something good instead of eye-roll. <br /> <br /> Production show, it's as good as one could really expect from a handheld camera to get good points there. This is really the screenplay that is being blamed, as the play wasn't too bad either. Consider what the actors had to work on. <br /> <br /> I thought the days had gone a long time when we saw someone, Finding a radio receiver desperately wants to run, turn every knob on the thing from side to end, bash it up to 6 or 7 times, and then expect it to work. This story is ruined by a continuous string of dumb movements through all the characters except the bad man. It is as if we are thought to be too level to understand all the plot devices, so they are all fed our spoon to make sure we get them. <br /> <br /> I don't know about you, but it doesn't work on me. My attention is ultimately practiced by plot holes and overdrafts, not the story. <br /> <br /> So, since I found it not so bad in the technical sense, I think Mr. Shiban should try again, just with a proper script next time; then he can give us something worth watching.
