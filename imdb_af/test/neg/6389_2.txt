This pool of derived drift stole from every Soviet movie and unfortunately failed. I was left with an experience of everything wrong with organized religion in general and the particular deficiencies of the Russian Orthodox Church (think of this comment coming from a religious person). Even the outstanding cinematography left me uninspired. I made his most beautiful moments very aware of the masterpieces that mimic it. I would not recommend seeing this movie unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its monastic traditions, miracles in the face of Communism and Saints of the Seventies. This is a meaningless movie from (and about) a narrow perspective that has done absolutely nothing to me.
