Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Clearly, however, this is not intentional. It takes about half of the movie for the main characters to realize what the great hilly thing in the middle of the city is, spits hot red things, and the other half spends the low flow through the city using trucks. It definitely made me laugh. The play makes Arnie look like an RSC man. It's amazing that movies get this command. A more interesting version would be someone who's going to an active volcano and filming it, and will probably cost about Â£ 20. ($ 40) I can see someone posting the movie to a movie company. "Well, there is this great VOLCANO and it breaks out in a CITY ....................... look at most other movies will look good.
