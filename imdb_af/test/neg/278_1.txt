It was the biggest disappointment of a movie ... :( Sucks, cos I really looked forward to it. <br /> <br /> All the twists were shit. They were ALL flashes !!! <br /> <br /> What makes a good movie is the credibility of the work, yes, it must be surprising that the audience is stunned, but if you walk away and it is bulls #! T ... what's the point? /> <br /> The main lift was a bag anyway! You didn't see the team working, it's full of fraudulent and brilliant potential, and there wasn't even a good sense in this movie! They were all rubbish. including that French idiot's break dance crap to get through the lasers ... it's easy to do when they are put together! Those kinds of things have already been done in at least one other movie and that was stupid then so too ... <br /> <br /> Also, there is no reason to even have half of the 12 or 11 in this movie! What difference does the half of the cast really make to the movie? result of this movie? the scenes don't even have to be there! <br /> <br /> The first one was stylish. It was cheap! And that leaves the whole team losing credibility. Especially Ocean itself to bend the Bennett.
