So I got it from the rental shop where I work before it was released (release is 8/21), I watched it today, and now I'm speechless. They could have had a decent movie here, but they screwed it on painfully obvious. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the parts were funny to John Krasinski and the only reason I was above 3, but they are broken up by bad acting and terrible "serious" reflections on life between the main character (Andrew Keegan) and his girlfriend (the annoying Lacy Chabert). It would have been much better than a straight comedy, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. <br /> <br /> I wanted it, because I think Krasinski is funny and wants to see him do well. The story wasn't bad either, just not very original. But directing (and much of the acting) was terrible. I swear they had trouble keeping people's faces in the lap and just went with it anyway. <br /> <br /> Their indifference is shown when the gun man corrects another character and says a "Dirty Harry" rifle is not a. 357 magnum but a .45 (it was, like everyone knows, a .44 magnum). <br /> <br /> See it if you like 1 - like John Krasinski 2, like watching low budget (and poorly-directed) movies or 3- Having too much time on your hands (that's me! )
