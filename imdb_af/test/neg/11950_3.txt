Go to the video store and get the original. I don't understand why Hollywood needs to take a perfect foreign movie and repeat it. "Mostly Martha" or "Bella Martha" has a much better cast. Start with heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more about the role of job-obsessed perfectionist than the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones, the Italian cook and the cousin suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to join a lady to live. suitable for childcare. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the American version of the movie is a copy of the German original. They just exchanged the actors. However, they also changed the story because it would be difficult and not very credible to materialize a father for the girl in an American context. <br /> <br /> I thought about it. Maybe the father was Puerto Rican, or Cuban, or Mexican. Well, there are so many "gas workers" in America. Choose your choice. But I doubt if any of them would take responsibility as the Italian father did in the original. That's why the American movie leaves that part, but keeps the Italian cook. And with that the whole story is changed. In the original "Martha" is so removed from the reality that she thinks it's okay to send her cousin off with a strange stranger in a foreign country. <br /> <br /> The American "Martha" is softer and therefore the movie is sweeter and does not have the edge that the German movie has. <br /> <br /> In the original, the "Italian" cook is not that beautiful, but much more charm, the girl is more of a brat but much more credible and Martha is more representative of a career woman in today's world as the watered-down version we are offering in the American version. And the whole opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved the Italian songs in the original and bought the CD. <br /> <br /> Hollywood admitted that "Mostly Martha" was a big movie. Perhaps the distribution companies should have put it in more theaters, or it should be shown in English without subtitles. Anyway, the original is so much better. By the way, it reminds me of another remake. "Will we dance" is one of my favorites in the original Japanese version and completely forgotten in the American version.
