The exaggerated production values ​​you usually find in a Merchant / Ivory movie are here, but it's a very boring performance that could be a very lively affair. I agree with an earlier poster that it doesn't make sense to unfold the story through the eyes of an African American family, but their own ancestor, Sally Hemmings, hardly plays a role in the proceedings. There is not much clarity to help the audience understand the motivation of any of these historical figures. And I was very bothered by the accent of a number of characters. Nancy Marchand sounds a lot of Brits for what a French nun is. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi tried different accents in different scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopsy. Her role as Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, was written so that we never deal with who she really is. For a moment she hit a slave, and for a moment she thought of the whole system of slavery. Nick Nolte plays the role well enough, but never really causes Jefferson or any of his races. Very disappointing in everything.
