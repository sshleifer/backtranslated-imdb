Wow. As soon as I saw this movie's cover, I immediately wanted to see it because it looked so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood movies just because they are so bad that they will be entertaining (eg Koi Mil Gaya). This movie had all the elements of a horrible movie: a "gang of boefies" who are completely harmless, a bad motorcycle scene, terrible dialouge ("Happy boy, I'm very proud to be a bad boy ", actors play basketball as if they are good, horrible songs (" I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad, bad boy "), inexplicable plot lines, like why are the Good Boy and Bad Boy friends ??? And why is the hot girl in love with the nerd ?? I have never seen such a poorly constructed story with such a horrible right. Some of the screens actually took 30 seconds like the one where the Good and Bad Boys inexplicably walked over the "gangster's" poker game. Congratulations Ashwini Chaudry, you are a bad director. If you want to watch a good movie, watch Guru, if you want to see a movie so much that it's actually entertaining, then watch Good Boy, Boy.
