Wow, where do I start? After the suffering of this miserable $ 1.00 rental (thanks to a LOT, Family Video) I just had to make a few comments. I didn't bother to write down the names of the 3 actors in the film, but hopefully you'll know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> A monster truck terrorizes the countryside and punishes two colleagues. They get a hot girl with messy clothes. I mean, it just sounds fantastic in theory. I laughed hysterically at the DVD box while I walked it to the girl behind the counter at the video industry. <br /> <br /> Acting: the hot girl, played by Aimee Whatever, visibly laughs at many scenes where she is afraid to be scared. The other two protagonists in the film, the fat booster and the vanilla straight man are both terrible. The fat man thinks he's Jack Black. He's not. The other actor, our hero, over-emotions and misses all his clues and comes across as a generic character you might see in the early 90's in a made-for-Nickelodeon movie about skateboarding. Look: I'm not expecting big performances in movies like this, but at least the actors can struggle to not be annoying. You can be an incompetent actor, but still be happy (ie John Wayne). At least the Aimee gall is attractive. <br /> <br /> Scripture: Holy ****, which thought this dialogue was funny? I won't have the nerve to play it before my graduate drama class, much less than a movie. Relentlessly bad. More about this. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, this is the one place where the movie definitely passes. Production quality is incredibly high. The appearance of the film is very good. Apparently, the only talented person working on the movie is the director of photography. <br /> <br /> OK, here's my biggest gripes: 1) The man driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles per hour. /> <br /> 2) The man driving the car is good in the country before he realizes there is a fat man in a mask in his back seat. He's thoughtful about recording a gas million and keeping his antique car in good condition, but he doesn't see a 300 lb Jack Black mimic in the back? Come on. <br /> <br /> 4) Characters never change their clothes. There are two hotel scenes. Presumably there are showers available for our characters, but over the 3 days this movie is taking place, none of the characters can change their clothes. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. Light-hearted, slapstick comedy doesn't interfere with horror. Period. You can't run our characters away from a sample truck one second and the next second they played orally with a little light / comedic music game. This kind of pacing ruins any tension in the movie. Movies like Evil Dead 2 that mix comedy and horror understand that tension can be loosened, but never completely eliminated with humor. Monster Man doesn't get it. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed that what a VERY funny horror movie could have been ruined by a director who thought he was much smarter than he really was. Oh good.
