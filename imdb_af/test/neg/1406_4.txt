Independent movie viewers know that they will see stories of dysfunctional families once or twice a year, and they expect them to be fresh, but it seems, despite the good throws, that it's fresh. just more of the same. Story is about the Travis family trying to recover from the suicide of Matt (Chicken Pardue) who was a very promising high school swimmer. Ben (Jeff Daniels) is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son Tim (Emile Hirsch) as well as Matt, but he communicates (somehow) to his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) what she stamp off pot and start smoking it. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Sandy also starts flirting with many younger men like the check-out cashier at the grocery store, but when she tries to buy more marijuana, its bust and is thrown to jail. She did not tell anyone what had happened, but she also discovered bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben was absent from work absent. After all, it happens that Sandy gets sick and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger, forcing Ben to realize that he must lose another part of his family. <br /> <br /> This film was written and directed by Dan Harris, who worked with Bryan Singer on "X2" and also the upcoming Superman movie and while his writing allows these characters to have real moments for their pain and expressing confusion, the story (for me) just threw in too many things. The script affects so many different areas that you need to keep a scorecard to watch everything that includes drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experimenting with homosexuality and a life-threatening illness. If all those scenarios were not enough for you, then hit a plot turn at the end that is supposed to summarize and explain most of everyone's feelings to Tim. As I roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times, with the way the script built one thing into the other, I have to admit that I didn't hate this movie and that I should credit the actors for it. Everybody has at least one good scene somewhere in the movie, but I wish the story would concentrate more on Weaver and her character as Hirsch. Weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have played a role that might have led to an Oscar nomination, but instead we get endless scenes from Hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door. Harris shows that he can be a good writer / director, but with this effort he throws so many different things to the audience that the material is only used and confronted.
