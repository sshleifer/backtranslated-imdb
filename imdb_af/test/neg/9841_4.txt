"Stick Around" is one of the short series of films that Bobby Ray has paired with Oliver 'Babe Hardy before Hardy's immortal teamwork with Stan Laurel. Several critics have suggested that Ray and Hardy - the gormless little man and the remaining great man - were a prototype for Laurel and Hardy, but that is simply not true. Ray and Hardy play well, but are not really a team; In each of these films Ray has more footage and it is clear that he must be the hero, while Hardy somehow bumps him, unlike his later "Ollie" character treatment by Stanley. It is very clear that the relationship between little Bobby and Big Babe was inspired by previous Chaplin films, in which the Little Tramp was performed by great Mack Swain or brave Eric Campbell. <br /> <br /> In 'Stick Around', Hardy sports a bowler hat that is identical to his later "Ollie" titfer (though with a fuller mustache), and he and Bobby - after most of this movie as opponents spent - ending up as drunken comrades. <br /> <br /> Bobby is a paper hanger for the firm Matz and Blatz, with Hardy as his boss. When the slow Bobby tries to pretend he immediately showed up, there is a clever physical issue between the two men reminding me of a routine run by Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton in The Garage. A little later, Bobby Ray - whose short-acting career has never developed a shrewd-man, performs an "impossible" gag that would have been inappropriate for Stan Laurel when he made a long walk from a much smaller toolkit pull. /> <br /> The paper hangers will work in a sanatorium, and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness: one resident insists on sitting on a piece of grid because he thinks he is a poached egg! There are also some crying racist (and tastelessly indecent) gags involving a black man who is trying to crack open walnuts on his head. If he sees a lion from an image - not even a photo, he thinks - he'll all laugh as if it were a real wild animal. <br /> <br /> "Stick Around" is pretty bad. Most of the pantomime and acting is much wider than it is necessary to be a slapstick comedy; even Hardy, who is already a very subtle actor by 1925, stares badly at his overworking here. There are several bad examples of lap fit. I was impressed with an unusual camera setup, when a fat pedestrian's face is dirty and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror, rather than his real face. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS COME. During their short couple, Hardy usually played Ray's boss or opponent or both; here they end up as poles. It's a nice ending, but it doesn't matter what really a poor movie is. My rating for this one is only 4 out of 10.
