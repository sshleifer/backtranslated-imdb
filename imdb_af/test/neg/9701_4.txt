Let me start by saying that I love the book and loved the A&E miniseries. I was hoping to love this movie, and I was absolutely willing to allow it a moderate degree of artistic license to interpret and shorten the real story. However, this movie hardly looks like the original book. If only the names were changed to protect the innocent, I might enjoy the movie as an entertaining, inaccurate period piece. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the name "Mr. Darcy" has a character that is emotional and weak, giving the name "Elizabeth Bennett" to a reckless, snippy, often teary-eyed hay that cares nothing for the rules of society, and to make "Bingley" a wide-eyed one that completely destroys is the idea that the director ever read Jane Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful moments in this movie. Perhaps a total of 10 minutes is really excellent. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr Collins' proposal began beautifully. She is 27 years old (quite close to the hopeless spinster age in those times), she becomes a burden on her family, and she is not romantic. She just wants a comfortable home. "However, the beautiful dialogue is ruined when its blubbers say:" Don't judge me, Elizabeth. Don't dare judge me! "And tear down. Later you see Charlotte Kowtow to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who was not in her character as described in the book. <br /> <br /> Another Good The moment is when Darcy catches Elizabeth in his home while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle, which was well done in the A&E series, but the movie version with Keira Knightley made the audience feel sharp as humiliating that had to be Elizabeth's moment. Very nice. <br /> <br /> The ending also illustrated a level of love between Elizabeth and Darcy that wasn't so clearly shown in the miniseries. I really appreciated that scene, merely because I would like to see a happy ending, rather than just knowing that it has happened. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, this movie eliminated the subtlety that is such an integral part of Austen's pride and bias The characters speak in a merging combination of Austen's slide lied verbatim and modern phrases and colloquialisms. Information that is only mentioned or suggested in the original work is blatantly mentioned in this version. Yes, time was a concern. It's just a short movie, yada yada. But making a complex, beautiful book in a superficial love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some argued that they had the moment when Darcy Elisabeth first saw, because it is so clearly a case of "love at first sight." Love at first glance? Huh? One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty, and Darcy comes to love her for her whiteness and liveliness ... he literally "loves her for her mind." <br /> <br /> This version also had a moment (during Darcy's first suggestion) when the two screamed at each other as they leaned closer ... and closer ... and almost kissed .. But they suddenly split apart. Ugh! What a sad clich√©. They are angry and confused with each other, but so dressed that it doesn't matter that they (one day) don't even love each other? Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> The characteristics were so far removed from those described in the book that it was really like another story. Mr. Bennet was dour, Elizabeth usually acted as silly as her younger sisters. Charlotte was emotional, somewhat unwise and desperate for her own home - unlike the intelligent, slightly shady woman with an abundance of common sense portrayed in The novel. Jane and Elizabeth's relationship is merely topical, instead of the deep-rooted love and admiration they have to have for each other. <br /> <br /> All these things I could have accepted as just poor interpretations of the novel, but I refused to accept it, in addition to the very, very historical inaccuracies. Miss. Bingley barely dressed (her dress looked like the others would wear like tight lingerie). Elizabeth walked with her hair to Netherfield and allowed to fly altogether. The family slept about one morning, but the morning was supposed to be reserved (or encouraged in your own home). Elizabeth walked barefoot in her nightdress. And in a very disturbing scene, Bingley entered Jane's bedroom and talked to her (and sounded like an idiot) when she was sick. <br /> <br /> Most people would feel small points, but I just wanted A.) A historically accurate movie, or B.) an accurate representation of the characters in the novel. <br /> <br /> The director / writer / who has provided accuracy, subtlety and a good story for a touch of love at first sight. I can admit that those who did not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the time, can easily be like this movie, and there is nothing wrong with it. I simply couldn't my desire to see a movie that was more than just two pretty faces.
