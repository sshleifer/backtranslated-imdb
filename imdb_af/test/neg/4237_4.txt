The assumption of the movie went a long way, but despite the novelty of models that someone else's furniture sells to live the high life, this movie has nothing to do with it. The characters are cardboard. The dialogue was written so painfully, it's hard to go through, and if there were any jokes in the movie, I missed them. Marilyn Monroe walks in walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses, totally unbelievable and not funny. Grable's stupidity is too ham-fist to be believed. Bacall's gold digs are so forced, it's annoying to listen. Why someone wants to sit here is outside me.
