The production company for this movie calls itself 'Nott Entertainment', and it's a surprisingly suitable name. It's a very 'Nott' entertainment from start to finish, which is a shame because a mixture of zombie movie and western could have been interesting. Every time a low budget zombie movie is released, it will tend to be for fans by fans. I actually consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but too much more like this one and I will re-evaluate my opinion! The movie seems to be a rip-off of the half-decent Aussie zombie flick 'Undead', rather than just having the lead in a cowboy hat; Everyone carries one; but it doesn't make much sense, because the film is apparently in modern times. The credit series at the beginning of the movie make us foolish to believe that we will be in an atmospheric movie, but when the movie starts well; It soon becomes clear what we really are. Of course there is a good amount of gore and it's actually done pretty well, although the good things I have to say about the movie pretty much ends there. There was a turn halfway that might have been interesting as the rest of the movie was. Overall, it's just another zombie movie in a world with far too many zombie movies. I do not recommend it.
