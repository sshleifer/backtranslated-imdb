This movie is one of the worse movies of all time. I'm so upset that this movie is not down 100; it deserves a place at least number 60 or 70 on the list. It's not just a movie I think is bad in a camp-fun kind of MST3K way; it's just bad. This is one of the few movies that I really hate. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category of bad. <br /> <br /> So the story in this one is that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and return to Crawl (Shore) and he tries to learn to be a farmer. Then the boyfriend tries to set up Shore so the girl will leave Crawlen and go back to him. It ends and can leave the remains of the audience. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this movie is that Pauly Shore has to mug the camera and try to be funny; but I will say about 100% of the time he fails. Their terrible inaccurate and outdated views of farms and farms are offensive and there is nothing to see in this movie. If you think you see it, don't do it. The one time I saw the movie, it felt like I was watching it for 5 or 6 hours. If you've seen it already; you have my sympathy.
