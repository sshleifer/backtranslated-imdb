I can't stress how bad this movie is. This director took every cheap little, inextricable shot to make these people look "worried". Why are their clothes so dirty? Why on earth will you know the new clark to play a cracking head? You have to be banned from the movies for the rest of your life, Buddy Giovinazzo. <br /> <br /> I take serious violation of this fool who wants to cast real actors as boefies and lower wingers as a kind of clever joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crack? Why are they shouting so much? Why are everyone so mean? Why are those kids so dirty? No one wants to be so dirty? Not even a creaking head. <br /> <br /> You have to grow up and not make movies again.
