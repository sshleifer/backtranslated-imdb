I found that this movie was mostly a POSIT, low budget, but that's not the problem. The problem is, the movie is just lame.it doesn't really make sense. This explains why things happened, but that's not what I mean. There was no reason for this. The film also moved very slowly. The last ice age was faster than that. Also, I think they've gone overboard in the kills. They didn't have too much, but the killer apparently spent too much time beating his victim or stabbed his victim. Maybe I'm small, but I just didn't like the movie. The whole thing looks like a lower rate version of "When a Stranger Calls" and maybe it was the whole point. But so. Stranger Kills "is a 4/10 *
