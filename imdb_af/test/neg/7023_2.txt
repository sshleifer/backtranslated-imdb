It's a horrible movie, and I'm not even sure why it's so terrible. It's ugly, for one, with the trendy 1970s visual style that may seem like a good idea right now, but which now enables you to recognize a movie from that period as a 70-year-old product. The movie retains the story and songs that made the stage version of the musical such a hit, but the songs sound lifeless on the screen. But mostly, the movie sucks because of Lucille Ball's failure, who you think would be able to make something of this bigger-than-life character than anyone can. She sleeps through the movie like a shocked actress bumping into her opening night and the film sinks with her. Even Bea Arthur, whom I had bet, was hilarious in the best friend role on stage, can't breathe any life in this stinker. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Degree: D
