Without a doubt it is and will probably always be the worst movie I've ever had to see my whole life. Take 5 wood actors thrown out of the acting school because they were so timid that someone was sitting on them thinking they were a bank. <br /> <br /> Add a cheap video camera. You know the old VHS types that cost Â£ 20 on ebay. Add a horrible story line with no effects and yes you have this movie. What a shocker it was. They couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it. She was fat and ugly and was the worst of all. I actually watched it because I couldn't believe this crap was ever funded. <br /> <br /> MISS ALL COSTS
