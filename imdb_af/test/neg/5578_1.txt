Predator Island begins as six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) and Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace). Kim (Iana Baker) and Denise (Melissa Roby) are sometimes invited to Kevin's (Michael Wrann) father's boat in the open sea. What can go wrong with such a super sounding idea? Well, for the first time, a large green meteorite can fall into the sea near your boat and an alien life force can come from it and try to kill you all, and then it's just a ridiculous stupid idea, is not it? <Br /> <br /> Co-edited, written and directed by Steven Castle I thought Predator Island was crap & it's simple and straight forward as it really is. The screenplay is of the worst kind, you know the kind of horror that is full of highly annoying teenage character doing the most stupid things and saying it's full of clich√©s and is completely predictable, it doesn't matter, things are just happening suddenly without any buildup or explanation. It's even boring on just 70 odd minutes and it has virtually no entertainment value at all, not even unintentional laughter. The movie doesn't really have much of what I would call a plot, there is no explanation why or how these strange creatures can take over people's minds or why it may be selective in the sense that one moment the person will be "normal" 'The next, when the story calls for it and without any obvious reason, suddenly they get green glowing eyes and a sudden urge to turn cannibal. There is not enough horror, the so-called action scenes are miserable and I really don't want to waste a second thought on Predator Island, let alone my precious energy spill these words ... <br /> <br /> Director Castle does nothing to see this thing and the 'special effects' are absolutely terrible. This strange creature will not even come in a 50-year-old sci-fi movie. The filmmakers even play a little more copy over the final credits, but it has to be the least funny collection of bugs, I think they can't even fix it if you know what I mean! Forget about a decent gore like there is, there is a little cannibalism and some guts placed on the unfortunate actors can pick up such an unhappy actor and pretend to eat them. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 150,000. I have to admit that the filmmakers work on a very low budget, it is not yet an excuse to make such a poor movie. The whole thing looks very cheap and the acting is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Predator Island is crazy, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. And I just miss to see what someone would get from it. In my humble opinion, it is probably one to avoid.
