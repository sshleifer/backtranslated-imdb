Pretty. <br /> <br /> Beautiful actresses and actors. Pretty bad script. Pretty frequent "let's strip our undertones" scenes. Pretty fair F / X. Proper irrigation decisions (the college dorm room looks like a high hotel room - probably because it was shot at a hotel). Pretty blatant story. Beautiful terrible dialogue. Beautiful places. Nice annoying editing, unless you like the music video cut-cut style. <br /> <br /> This one is not a guilty pleasure - it is more embarrassing. If you have to watch it, choose a good dance / techno album and turn off the sound on the movie. You will see the beautiful people in their pretty black underwear, and probably follow the story well. <br /> <br /> The cast may be able to act - I doubt anyone can look kind with the lines / plot they were dealing with.
