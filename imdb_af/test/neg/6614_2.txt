I watched it with great tension, and my anxiety was well founded, it seems. What did this movie look like? Knight? The season? The players? What? It was everywhere in the place. It didn't have any tension (sorry, we all knew Bobby was going to curse and throw things), but Brian Denehy, a fine actor, came up in the rage and delivered zero tension. Shot cheap, like a MacGiver episode. Contrast this Thanksgiving main course with the work done by HBO on the Don King movie "just in America" ​​to show how to do sports biopics, warts and everyone. Note that ESPN promoted the hell out of it and never showed it again?
