This movie is a desperate attempt to drive the tales of the Star Wars movies. The film uses recycled footage of "Battle Beyond the Sars", which is another Roger Corman Sci-Fi Turd, but at least this one is better than Battle Beyond the Stars. There is no real play in this movie (but it's a Roger Corman movie - what did you expect) again the entire soundtrack on a Keyboard / Synthasizer, the sound effects are recovered from Battlestar Galactica - there are no special effects Because they are recycled / rearranged space screens from another movie, the costume looks like something right from 1981, rescue army rescue. - The little boy in this movie gives one hero performance, and he will rise again to play in the Sylvester Stallone movie "Over the Top". I give this movie 3 stars out of 10
