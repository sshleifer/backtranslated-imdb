As an admitted chess addict, I was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 broadcast between Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. I was hoping to take a deep look at the game and many what Kasparov had to say. Boy was I wrong and misled by a mile. This documentary is much like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash, but no real substance. After watching it, I'm sad to say, I felt I was wasting my time. One of the most annoying aspects of the documentary is that it doesn't stay in one place for a decent time. It has the typical MTV type editing, where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites of people every five seconds. It is very sad that films have been made to the attention of a 10-year-old child. <br /> <br /> I understand it's hard to make a movie about chess, but that doesn't mean one should make it flashy. 'Game Over' did have some interesting ideas. It brought the idea or computers like people to think or not; or computers have progressed to a unique new level. That's what Kasparov thought of the game, but this movie isn't going deep enough with this idea. This film also tries to bring in a bizarre theory. It tries to imply the paranoid that one makes the movements with the help of the computer. Kasparov suspected this, but to date there is no evidence. By the end of the film, it tries to imply the bizarre that perhaps Anatoly Karpov could have been the man who made the move secretly through Deep Blue. Interesting to think about, but I don't know how credible or realistic it is. I still wouldn't recommend this movie, even for chess addicts.
