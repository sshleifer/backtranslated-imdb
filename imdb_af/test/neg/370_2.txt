If you watch the movies, Mad Max, Beyond Thunder Dome, and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you'll have a good idea about the movie. The only problem is that the film also does not have the production values ​​and represents mainly cheap copies of the former two. True, the movie has a lot of action, but asks the viewer to suspend action. No one can shoot a 50 Caliber Machine gun by holding it in his hand - and miss everything to boot, and you can't shoot a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole lot. There is also a problem with poor editing, when the school bus is over, it's easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job. And the lady driving the truck there is superfluous, as she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are just interested in thought and violence, then the movie is easy to watch. But don't expect something on a pair with Thunderdome, or even the somewhat inexpensive and sticky Steel Dawn.
