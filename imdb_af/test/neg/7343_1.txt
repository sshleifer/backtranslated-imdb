Man live, is this game bad or what? The graphics are much less than that, even if it is on a gaming station 1, never make a Gamecube. The game is pathetic and the movements of the camera disoriented. What a worthless game! <br /> <br /> I absolutely love Warner's Batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games this way. Batman: Vengeance could have turned out well if they started well by retaining all the Gothic visual and voting factors, but they stumbled seriously on playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and it's not fun to play at all. I really need to emphasize how bad the graphics are. Don't let the color schemes miss you. I saw better things on a Commodore 64.
