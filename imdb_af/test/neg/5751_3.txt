At the beginning of 'Loggerheads' we are introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters. To make things even more confusing, we (via titles on the screen) are informed that the action takes place in three separate timelines (between 1999 and 2001). It takes a lot of time, but eventually we see how the three pairs are related. Mark Austin, a young man in his 20s, gay and HIV positive, is alienated from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Rev Robert Austin. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a driver and arrives in Kure Beach, North Carolina, a coastal town, where he meets George (sensitively played by Michael Kelly), a gay motel owner and eventually touches involved. . Meanwhile, Mark's birth mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt) came to the end in her life where she decided to find the boy she had given for adoption when she was 17. Likewise, Mark's adoptive mother also decided to trace her estranged son if she missed him (despite the disagreement of her homophobic minister husband). <br /> <br /> 'Loggerheads' that we've told are based on a true story, and this may be their Achilles heel. Director / Author Tim Kirkman is trying too hard to create scenes with dramatic tensions where there is very little to be found. Take Mark and George? They are both sensitive souls that differ little. There is a bit of tension when Grace looks out for an Adoption Agency director who is prohibited by law to give her information about her lost son and a little conflict with her mother who denies her disapproval when she conceived as a teenager. No sparks fly between Elizabeth and Robert, as the good pastor insisted from the beginning that he did not intend to reconcile with his son. <br /> <br /> 'Loggerheads' are similar to 'Brokeback Mountain' because the gay couple are the good guys and the straight men (for example, the Kure Beach police and the first) are the bad things. The biggest decay of the movie is that there is no interaction (and therefore no dramatic conflict) between Mark and one of his "mothers". Mark is already dead before the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him. <br /> <br /> Kirkman's theme is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their warm feelings before it's too late! Kirkman's sentiments are mostly well-intentioned, but they do not make for good drama. Loggerheads move at a snail's pace without providing new revelations (or tensions) on topics such as AIDS, Adoption and Homophobia. Eventually 'Loggerheads' fail because of a lack of originality.
