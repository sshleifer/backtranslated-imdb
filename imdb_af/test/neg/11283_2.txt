Although it is being promoted as one of the most genuine Turkish movies with amateur movies, Ice Scream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity. <br /> <br /> The plot opens with Ali's dream cream salesman in a West Anatolia city, seeing him successful with the same marketing methods of large ice cream companies. He dreams of playing in his product's TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, to dance him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his grim wife, who rejects having sex with him for six years. Is it because he is not successful in his work? Apparently because he says he sold better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies. But that's what he says; we don't really see him so much: he still sells well, travels the neighboring towns while his apprentice is at the store and sells the ice cream to the people in town. Ali blames large companies for using sweeteners and colourants while using real "sahlep" (powdery roots of mountain ingredients). Ali buys a motorcycle with a loan to be a travel provider, and gives ads to a local TV channel that prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. His wife does not love his business, they always argue, and Ali threatens him to do very bad things in a moment of madness. <br /> <br /> In a very successful day, his mean bike is stolen by the abused little boys of the village. Looking for his stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for theft, but of course nobody takes him seriously. Perched by his wife's night, Ali went to a tavern and became drunk. One of his friends at his table, a wannabe socialist in the village, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism and jumps without a proper connection to the subject of global freezing. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takes him to a night wall and advises him on life. According to him, Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink as the world faces global freezing. When he returned home, we suddenly saw that his wife understood his worth, treated him as a hero and praised his masculinity. Meanwhile, the thief boys became ill to eat too much ice cream. They confessed to the doctor that they had stolen Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and there comes the happy ending. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may look promising, it is the storyline that makes this movie truly and cheese. First, the director does not show much of the attempt to visually tell the story; everything is based on dialogues. And the dialogues never stop us from showing that the cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's problems aren't convincing, because we don't see it, we just understand it from his words. The director markets his film as a fair fight by Ali against big ice companies, but there is nothing in the movie about big companies. We don't see their pressure enough. The film challenges Ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. And when his motorcycle is found, it solves every problem: Ali becomes a happy and powerful man. Not a real criticism of globalism. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the movie is cheesy because of the rough humor. Perhaps the people of that part of Turkey are cursed so much and so many vulgar jokes in their daily lives, but vulgar language and rough humor are not enough to make a movie funny. I may have accepted it if they were vulgar and "smart", but they are not smart jokes, they are just cheesy. Perhaps I'm wrong, maybe American people will love Oriental version of American Pie styles. But American Pie never had a claim to be a nominee for the Oscars, or to have a political message! If you think you can laugh by just seeing a man's big erection in his pants (and we had to endure this joke twice!) Or an old village lady who says "f ** k you", you can do this find movie funny.
