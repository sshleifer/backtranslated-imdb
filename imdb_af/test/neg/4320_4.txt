This movie is viewable but nothing special. Four girls on a road trip to Vegas decide foolishly to pick up a hitchhiker (because he is cute). They all end up at a motel in the middle of nowhere, and the hitchhiker's psychotic problems with women become apparent. <br /> <br /> The characters are clich√©s - there is a married, responsible woman; a gruesome party girl; an uncertain bride to be; and a man-hater just baptized. The hitchhiker is really nice until he gets crazy. <br /> <br /> There is not enough gore, and too much rape. I enjoy many of the horror / thrillers, and this one did nothing to me. The end was just as lame as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the actors did a good job of working. The dialogue is not terrible, and overall I was impressed with the cast, never seen or heard of any of them before. And the plot was not out of the scope (although today I really doubt a woman and pick up a crochet, no matter how attractive he is), so I didn't bother that things didn't do sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Hitchhiker" was well behaved and meaningful, but wasn't very interesting. There are much better movies in the same genre I recommend about this one ("Rest Stop", "The Devil's Rejects", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," even "The Hitcher" remake). Do yourself a favor and skip it unless you have no other options.
