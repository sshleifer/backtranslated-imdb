This episode sucks. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years I've been watching all the episodes of "Next Generation" and "Voyager" and now I'm looking at "Enterprise". <br /> <br /> I thoroughly enjoy this series. Until this episode. I went out on the screen with the destruction of character and entertainment. It's more like an attempt to hit. <br /> <br /> It doesn't build the characters, but throws it on a limb - and lets the audience hold on. It makes little to build the series. <br /> <br /> Why it's ever allowed to go to the air surprised me. Was it the writing? Was it directing? Was it the producer? We'll probably never know. <br /> <br /> But one bad apple is not bad, I suppose. I hope this is just one.
