Wow ... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder whose idea it is and what soup kitchen they eat now. To say it is bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love. <br /> <br /> When I saw Guttenberg's name in the TV guide, I thought it would be a spoof ... maybe it should have been. Could have made a better movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the scene where they are in a plane in the middle of the plane with the door open and there is no wind so ever. They could have been at least a fan. <br /> <br /> Search for various Canadian and c-list actors in the movie. This is the kind of movie that throws the b-rate cable stations you never see except on a rainy Sunday.
