I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincente Minnelli, and Gene Kelly, but this movie just left me cold. I expected another American in Paris from Minnelli, so maybe I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> The movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers. I was impressed by the very expressionistic Kelly dance as Mococo on the ship. I was also impressed by the Nicholas Brothers in Be a Clown, too bad the song was so annoying. I also enjoyed that Judy Kelly attacked with bric-a-brac. Look at Lorna Luft's autobiography for interesting information on that scene. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie that has to be Cole Porter's most annoying songs, especially Nina. Also, Judy and Gene constantly shout like screaming children. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin - which is par for the musical course - but not saved by impressive dance songs or memorable songs. I suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutter floor. Please, a few movie repairers, find those bits of film and show us what the movie could be!
