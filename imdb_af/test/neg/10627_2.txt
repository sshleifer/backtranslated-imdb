In what attempts to be a positive story, Dolph Lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks much like paradise, so that the men who hired his team can devour it for ... bird droplets . Actually, the nitrogen gas from this mouse button is the following. <br /> <br /> There was only one good thing about this movie - the island's location in which it was filmed was beautiful. Otherwise, the story itself drowns leaving the actors with nothing to work with. Result: A lot of violence, lots of language, lots of blood, and some shots of women topless. If you want meaningful violence (sorry, the storyline can't even give the violence a try, though it tries). This is the movie for you. Parents: be warned that this movie is full. violence and blood, manage the R rating.
