I actually liked some things about this game. I loved the first person's perspective and wish we had the choice in the first three games. There is nothing like seeing the monsters near you, in your face. The graphics were really not bad, but I would have liked more things to communicate with each other, although it was just a shooter. The music was good. The things I hated were: The form of motion of suck and aim was a total pain. The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing without originality. The inability to save was terrible !!! Some of us have a life and would like to save to complete the game later. I thought the weapons also sucked. This game is fun for a while, but it's nothing like the first three and just fine if you just want to shoot. I would recommend it for the novelty to play in the first person, but it's about it. Play it at your own risk.
