The mission to watch the movie "The Cave" was a dream of a friend of mine after I saw the highly dramatic fan, full of flashes of a creature sneaking into a cave, some young cave divers, and not much otherwise. It's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did. <br /> <br /> The immediate stretch of a movie like this is the creature. Where does he look? Why does he live in a cave? How is this one different from the other creatures we've shown in movies like Alien and Predator and the Relic? The cave "demons" doesn't look far from the skeleton in Alien: Resurrection and even the appearance of Predator. Shame it is a total ripoff ... Well, let's look at the plot: very confusing and jumping to more and more unlikely turns as a team of cave divers are sent to find a cave and its inhabitants. in the Carpathians. The casting was very clear that we wanted young, hip, hard chicks, chewy guys and the brains had to be hot too. We must also have one of each racial background if the audience thinks the filmmakers are biased in some respects. Completely done, and I'm totally tired of it. <br /> <br /> The other biggest problem was the end, as if it was said there could be a prosecution. Farms shoot me if there is one. The tagged on ending made me miserable. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points it received were more or less appreciative of the creators-builders for their high-quality work that was spent on the costumes and designed for the monsters that live inside, even though they seemed to be completely ripped off. And there is an interesting (still edited) documentary on the DVD on underwater cave diving. Just look out if you love new creations of monsters and creatures, but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before, and it was better for the first time.
