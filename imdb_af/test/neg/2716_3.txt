Sounds, but the cheerful 90's soft core comedy features Xena (Sarah Bellemo), Luna (Tamara Landry) and Sola (Nicole Posey) as three outer space teens. Xena's parents went on holiday for a few days. After constant persuasion by her friends, Xena agreed to take her father's spaceship for a ride. The end result? They come out with gas in space and crash on planet Beta 45, AKA Earth. Meanwhile, teenagers Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Steadman) have come to California to stay with Dave's Uncle Bud (Joe Estevez) this summer, a beach man who lives right on the beach. The three of them met us three space girls who walked away from the accident without a scratch. Oom Bud is about to be thrown out of his soon-condemned beach mat thanks to Sally (Linnea Quigley), who lives entirely on the hill and was previously in a relationship with Bud. She is also a bikini magnet and is trying to win a $ 30,000 bikini design match. Exactly what Bud needs to fix, so the girls decide to win the prize for him. And it's about it, people. To know that their paper thin plot was scarcely enough to hold a long film, the filmmakers subjected us to the scene of endless beach parties with scenes extras that gouge their half-naked bodies in the burning sun. Oh, and don't let the generation forget. There are quite a few of them. Before I go further, I have to put this movie into context. It was released in 1993, long before the advent of such soft core labels such as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to this newer, edgier, more explicit movies, the soft core films of the 90s seem to be slightly mild. When Beach Babes From Beyond came out of the Full Moon offshoot Torchlight Entertainment in 1993, it was released as the debut release of a label specialized in "adult audiences" type movies. Needless to say, times have changed. These particular movie genres have gone from a few steamy, but short, sex scenes and fleeting cans of feminine full frontal nudity to extended sex scenes that sometimes threaten to dare in the kingdom of hardcore. Watching Beach Babes Van Beyond again after watching it at the 93 'release, it's safe to say that if this same movie were to be made today, a hell of a lot more emphasis would be on sex scenes and less time spend on plot and dialogue. Regarding sex scenes themselves, they tend to run hot and cold. Our three space girls don't waste time getting comfortable with the boys that night. So every couple gets a soft core scene, complete with annoying slow motion camera work and too dark lighting. They are not that terrible, and are surprisingly graphically graphic in some places, especially the scene between Xena and Jerry, which is in the back of a trailer. But the one sex scene that really makes a lasting impression and causes you to be surprised in its overall intensity comes early in the movie. Sally is a topless photograph shot with three of her models positioned through a pool. All the actresses in this scene are beautifully beautiful, but Nikki Fritz stands out from all the two because of her enormous presence. Remember, this point in her career has not yet reached the kind of popularity that would soon follow. Her nude at a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her plumbing in a bathtub and then again when she walks away from her bath. Walking to the bed to an almost naked pump in the waiting, we get a full-length, complete nude scene with her almost heart-shaped back and perfectly shaped back. It's good that Nikki's back is as muscular as it will be to get a good workout. Nikki spent the next few minutes completely naked with a brave man in a variety of positions in a scene completely different from the three other love shows. No dark lighting or annoying slow motion here ... just two actors in a huge bed sans sheets and covers that seem to be scarce at times. Nikki's ecstasy body just goes to prove that few other actresses are filming sexual scenes as much as she does. It's actually the only time when Beach Babes From Beyond delivers the goods. But even without this spectacular scene, I only recommend this movie based on the fact that it is pretty spectacular and never boring, thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive role, many of which appear in various video feature actions of the decade.
