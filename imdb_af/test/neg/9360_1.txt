I no longer have respect for IMDb ratings. I think a lot of Mormons flooded the site and voted for it. It's not an artistic movie, it's Mormon's propaganda. Nothing wrong with that, but the plot sketch and the way it is described are completely misleading. If you are a Christian or a Mormon Bible, look at this movie, you will love it and think it is truly wonderful. For anyone else, don't bother, the story is so confronted, random things happen that don't really follow in a coherent way. This man is trying to commit suicide because he is sleeping with his neighbor. Do you play? What a pussy! Anyway, it's a horrible movie.
