This movie was a waste of the celluloid it was printed on. It's a disastrous scene, much like a particularly horrifying train wreck. <br /> <br /> To see this is to try to explain the meaning of life. The main point is that the character Steve Guttenberg played is a party that is not supposed to gamble, as it will violate his parole. The children he befriended didn't want to play with him for a while, because he was playing. BUT ... a few minutes later, after winning the championship, a huge amount of money saves their shelter. And where did they get the money? ON DOBBELARY !!! Add to the spectacular scenes at the funeral home (why are there BEDROOMS in a funeral home?) And the useless peripheral character
