Do you ever have one of those kidneys that seems to build up forever? You grab and you bump and you grab the closest paper product in preparation for the world's biggest hooker ... and then physically float it. "Frankenhooker" was the movie-like equivalent of the lost sneeze. Now I'm big on B movies, and I always look the other way if a ghost appears on the screen or an actor speaks his or her lines with all the enthusiasm of Gerald Ford, but this one really dropped me. The cover of the video, for example, IS the tagline of the whole movie. Using parts of murdered New York prostitutes, rebuild Dr. Franken's late fianc√©, just to run her in Amok as a kind of super-prostitute with a bad attitude. After an hour and a half of buildup, this pretty funny ten minutes was a little anti-climax.
