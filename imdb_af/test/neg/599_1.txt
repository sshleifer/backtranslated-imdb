I would have given it a LESS than a 1 rating if possible. The entire film should be left on the closet floor. What a pathetic waste of time, money and effort! Let's see ... assemble the most beautiful role you can find (which, of course, is directly related to the amount of talent they lack) ... throw the thinnest plot you can dig ... and viola! A horrible piece of waste that the director and / or producer is ashamed to set up their name. How many WORSE can the horror genre get? And don't use a low budget as an excuse ... I've seen many BIG low-budget movies .... In fact, some of the best horror classes of all time were low budget. If you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a GOOD horror movie, don't make God a man !!!
