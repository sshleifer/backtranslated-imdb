It should be seen as one of Cinema's biggest debacle. I was walking in Europe at the time and had the misfortune to stumble upon the crew that made this movie in what was then one of the world's idyllic, pristine institutions. I was named an Extra, and what followed was an exhibition of contemporary debauchery. Forget all the accusations you've ever heard from Peter Mayall's invaders on this scarce piece of French life-Geoff Reeve and his cohorts have begun with a vigor in the restaurant at Les Beaux who left the Maitre'd in disbelief. They were simple, terrible, uncultivated and unsatisfactory by French hospitality.
