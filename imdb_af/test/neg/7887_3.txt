SAIMIN <br /> <br /> (USA: The Hypnotist / UK: Hypnosis) <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Dolby Stereo SR <br /> < br /> Following a series of bizarre and apparently unrelated 'suicide', an experienced Tokyo detective (Ken Utsui) is the help of a young psycho-analyst (Goro Inagaki) who believes the victims have a post -hypnotic representation responded. But their subsequent investigations show an even darker power at work, linked to a young girl (Miho Kanno) whose life was wasted by sadistic abuse. <br /> <br /> Based on a novel by Keisuke Matsuoka, this poem (Italian gialli, traditional Japanese ghost stories, etc.), although some of the images in the climatic show show a more immediate influence: the recent commercial success of Hideo Nakata's RING (1998). However, for all his ambition, SAIMIN is a routine pot boiler that stumbles badly on an upward opening (suicide is particularly impressive despite some poor CGI effects), although director Masayuki Ochiai - who wrote the writing with Yasushi Fukuda - compare proceedings for an extended final in which the story's astonishing secrets are finally revealed. Ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of PARASITE EVE (1997), which recently played in the film competition. He also played the leading man, Inagaki (a member of the Japanese pop group SMAP). And while SAIMIN falls the strong visual sense of the movie, it falls short of drama, and most characters are mere ciphers, which undermine the emotional compensation of the storyline. This is a pity, because the last half hour is being galvanized by a series of dynamic chunks - especially a concert hall sequence in which Dvorak's 'New World' symphony is transformed into a murder instrument! - And Ochiai is well served by an excellent production team. However, those who are lured by the promise of gory carnage can be disappointed. The film is long on atmospheric and short on explosion. <br /> <br /> Performances are different due to the limitations of the dissertation, but Kanno (TOMIE) is outstanding. As a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder - assuring the captions on the printed printed insurance we are not recognized as a viable medical condition in Japan! - prey to a sloppy TV hypnotist (Takeshi Masu), a main suspect in the murders. Inagaki is rarely in a one-dimensional role, and he is continually taken up by Utsui, a veteran exporter whose career dates back to the 1950's Soup√¢ Jaiantsu series. <br /> <br /> (Japanese Dialogue)
