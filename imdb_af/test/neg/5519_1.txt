The acting is excellent in this movie, with some good actors. It was nice to see Fred McMurray as a young man. It's not a comedy. It's a drama and the seemingly comical cases are miserable. It's not a comedy. It is a drama and the seemingly comical cases are pitiful, and some of them seem to be forced and confronted.

Love Carole Lombard's My Man Godfrey, because it is a comedy and, while the play is wonderful, the story line and the script itself win the day. Carole Lombard is beautiful and a wonderful actress. I'll try to watch Fred McMurray's features.
