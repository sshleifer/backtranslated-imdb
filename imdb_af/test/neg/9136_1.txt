LET?! If it's about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves, I think I missed his whole point. As I went out, I feel that Reggio relies on cold warfare footage of space exploration, and does NOT have NEW news to add to the fears of technology fears. Trails of 1 and 0, indicating technology and math and science - DONE that. Anyone out there, see The Matrix? And movement studies of people in motion? Ever heard of Edward Muybridge? At least he uses precise cuts of Muybridge's human movement studies photos. <br /> <br /> This movie is derived, and the score is just enough Philip Glass to sound like EVERYTHING he has done over the past 10 years ... Avoid this movie at ALL costs !!
