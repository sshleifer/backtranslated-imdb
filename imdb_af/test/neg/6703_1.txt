Hello guys, this is my first review and I had to choose the worst movie to review. As I watched only 5 minutes, but trust me, you could see this movie went nowhere. The acting was deplorable, the work of the camera and lighting seemed to be shot and packaged 10 years old. No offense to 10 years old. I just couldn't take it anymore, I went out of my couch, took the The House of Adam DVD from the DVD player and threw it into the garbage. Maybe if you're a Colin Farrell fan, this movie might interest you, because the character in the movie, Anthony, is a Colin Farrell looks like. But it is as far as he goes, he will definitely never have the acting capabilities. I gave this movie a score of 1 (terrible) because there were no minuses in the drop-down list.
