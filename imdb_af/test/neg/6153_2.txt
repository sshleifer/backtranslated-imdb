Wow !! I didn't even know about this movie until I wanted to find another Mark Hamill classic (Time Runner). Some things are better, unknown. Mark Hamill's role is quite ... limited. I will compare his appearance in this movie with all the appearances of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in the bad horror b-movies of the 60's and 70's. In those movies, they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the movie. Memorable act by Mark with so many lines as "Don't try to run. You were arrested." Did I mention that he says the EXACT thing more than once. Bill Paxton came to Aliens in a Uzumaki-type spiral of drugs and liquor because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge session. THE HAIR .. THE HAIR !!! .. Priceless Bill. Actually should have been "WANT TO" for Bill .. but somehow .. he had treatment .. and continued to get better ??? movies. This movie is blowing. It's more boring and boring than The Crazies. At least that movie was crazy ... it's just boring. DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE SOER.
