I'd rather have someone cut my eyeballs with a razor blade than look at this movie again. I watched it from start to finish and thought it wasn't worse. BUT THIS. The authors and producers have to be slapped to put this kind of crap on television. The actors are ALL terrible. Come out of Hollywood, you fool and go to work at McDonalds, floating the floors and emptying the trash. Anyone who thinks this movie is even remote must be properly hung. They are an embarrassment to humanity. To think we've put soldiers at risk for anyone who causes this kind of improper garbage. I'm embarrassed to say I'm an American.
