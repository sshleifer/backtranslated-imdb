What a throw ... and what a waste of it. Seriously, when a movie Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone are in it, you'll expect quality. However, the movie is one big mess with an unlikely story that can't seem to stop turning. Yes, I think they thought they were really smart with everything. <br /> <br /> The story is not only messy and unlikely, but it's not really original either. It uses elements of earlier and much better poker games based movies. But for me it really was the very sensible turn and turned into the movie that did it. This made the story so unlikely to look. In addition, the writing is filled with many holes, stupid poker spelling mistakes and things that just don't make a lot of sense. Why would anyone above all want to play things against a card player known as the best cheat in the game. This is what the movie is about and builds on, but never made much sense to me. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the movie has a good role, it still feels as if most actors were in their roles. I don't know what it's about Stuart Townsend. He is a good actor, but in most roles he plays, he always feels out of place. Maybe it's his appearance, I don't know. It was basically the reason why he was replaced in "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring". Also Thandie Newton is not very good and actually very annoying in her "strong" female role. And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in this? Oh, I think I can go over the movie and can even complain about the limited screen time the Jamie Foxx character gets, but I think you're getting my point. <br /> <br /> Damian Nieman is not much of an original writer / director and he also doesn't handle his own stuff very well. Scenes often feel unsuitable, trying to clear too many characters and everything about the movie is level and in some way predictable. In addition, the movie sometimes contains bad editing, which also doesn't help make this movie look like one seamless whole. The film was also one of the big boxing bombs and no wonder Damian Nieman has since made a movie. <br /> <br /> Too great debris to make you enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/04
