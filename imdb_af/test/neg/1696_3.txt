Pat O'Brien portrays Knute Rockne, the All-American Notre Dame football coach. This movie will definitely be much more attractive to those interested in some aspects of Knut Rockne All-American Notre Dame Football. It's probably interesting for serious followers of soccer and / or Notre Dame football. You will see some good documentary style films. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's hard to recommend as a FILM. It's not much more than a historical document. You'll know "the end is near when Gale Page gets a cold - and doesn't shine, or you'll miss Ronald Reagan, of all," Camille "! <br /> <br /> *** Knot Rockne - All- American (1940) Lloyd Bacon ~ Pat O'Brien, Gale Page, Ronald Reagan
