I'm a big fan of the Farcry Game, big fan. It still holds a place in my top 10 game list of all time! The story line was new, fresh ... A true brilliant foundation to base a movie on ... or so I thought ... <br /> <br /> Farcry the Movie is no less than " another director's attempt to pay on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more ...). <br /> <br /> The Video Player starts when the player (Jack Carver) wakes up in a sea cave after being shot off his lap. boat through an unknown soldier RPG. Jack then finds a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) guides him across islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and VOLCANOES to find his (lady friend?) (Valerie Constantine), all the struggling super soldiers and genetically improved animals. <br /> <br /> The movie plays very, very differently: 1: There is an unnecessary 30 minutes (1/3 of the movie) of "backstory" before we get to the boat blowing scene. 2: Jack then walks on the beach, kills some goons, then drives off ... Nothing like the game ... 3: There is no communication with Doyle on the other side ... 4: The " Modified Soldiers' look like albinos with singlets on ... And there were no mutated "monkey-like" creatures jumping out of the bushes. Part of the Farcry game I enjoyed very much ... 5: There are no sun-drenched beach tones, no aircraft carrier, no large-scale communication stations, LITTLE reference to any game content (characters / items / vehicles), in virtually no attempt at follow the story line. 6: The climate-volcano scene from the game is being replaced by an old industrial building. 7: There is an end scene where everyone (except Krieger) ever stays happy ... WHAT THEY! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a Gamer, you will HATE this movie will be your whole soul. This is a movie that is clearly meant for men, so girls, stay away ... So if your husband, 12-29 years old, never played Farcry, and is not disgusting about directors' attempts at books / games sending the theater. ... then it's for you ...
