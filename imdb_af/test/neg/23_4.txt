When people say children are annoying, you think my cousins ​​can be annoying and I told LITTLE. These kids turn 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying kids you will ever experience (in a movie). Let's start with the blonde - Debbie - She's a slut of a girl, I mean come on, she wears mini-skirts, she has a foolish blonde hair and a freckley red bunny like a face. She behaves so innocently. Next we have the second child - the Geek - who thinks he is so cool, with his long range shoot and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and above all his evil dirty smile. The next child is the silence you don't mind, so it's all on him. This film made me angry with the children's intelligence and the only joy I got was from my cousin biting them.
