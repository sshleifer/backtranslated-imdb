MGM tried to get together and get young men with the Divine One to give them exposure and try them out as prominent men. Gable and Garbo had chemistry in SUSAN LENOX, but it was a lousy movie. Here in INSPIRATION there is no chemistry whatsoever between Garbo and Robert Montgomery and the writing is also poor. What do they think? The modern, fast, sensible, funny Montgomery and the slow-haired Garbo? It's a story like CAMILLE. Young student falls for woman of the world and is repelled by learning her past, rejecting her, taking her back, rejecting her .... you get the picture. Garbo is completely credible as a top Parisian artist's model and totally at home, though bored, with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals. Suddenly she was fascinated by this innocent. She eventually gives her life for him and sinks into poverty, just to be saved by him and set up in an own home. Ironically, he intends to marry and keep her aside - so much for his earlier moral ethics. <br /> <br /> The scenes are incredibly boring and boring and nothing happens. Only Marjorie Rambeau and Lulu can inject life into the proceedings with the lines like: "Unfortunately, weak women have strong appetite" and "Odette, where is your sting?" <br /> <br /> Only for Garbo fans.
