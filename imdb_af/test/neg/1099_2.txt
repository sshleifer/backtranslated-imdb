It started in Pennsylvania in 1913. A lot of kids are killed in a mine explosion that is deliberately mine. Cut until 2006. Recently, widow Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and the girl Emma (Chloe Moretz) went to a remote home near the mine. What they do not know are the spirits of the little ones who haunt the bush and kill everyone dead. <br /> <br /> Slow and boring horror movie. The premise is obvious and has already been killed. There are also big gaps in logic in the story. It is never made clear why these children just kill someone or why they eat the bodies (yes - it is shown). They're already dead - why do they need food? And why didn't they get the biggest villain in the story before? He was around the area. Why choose this time to attack him? The characters are also not the least pleasant. Sarah comes across the worst. It has a few savings. The location is beautiful and ominous at the same time, some of the murders were very bloody and brutal and the kids were looking spooky at night. But I was all bored and fighting to stay awake. You can hit this one.
