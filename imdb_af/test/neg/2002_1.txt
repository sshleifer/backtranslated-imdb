Please don't waste your money on this sorry apology for a movie. The only way I can see someone is if they are a stubborn fan of Erika Elaniak, but you'll be better off surfing the internet than watching this piece. I'd rather look at paint than to look at it. <br /> <br /> They lure you with Casper and Erika and lead you to believe it's a Sci-Fi Dracula movie, but it works fast to be a drive over Van Helsing's bulk (you get the point) grandson, here ironically for one last show between himself and Dracula. <br /> <br /> The film also tries to make a political statement, I believe, when it seems that none of the characters in the future know who God is that they have not been taught about him and do not understand When they see a cross. Could have done much more with this idea. It is a pity that this has been avoided.
