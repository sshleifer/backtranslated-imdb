The film uses motifs that can be plotted from "Wait Until Dark" (1967), a much better movie by Terence Young, starring Audrey Hepburn. "Dead Silent" is a light paraphrase. There is nothing new here - the hidden object in the doll, the bad guys who want it, the bad guy who makes a good guy. However, the disability has shifted: Audrey Hepburn couldn't see, the child in DS can't speak. But both stories depend on the disability. Where "Wait Until Dark" built up unbearable tension, "Dead Silent" you can guess the outcome, the story is such a stereotype.
