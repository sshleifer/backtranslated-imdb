This movie has good intentions, at least in the message, "Don't be afraid, no matter how hard it can be. Fear will eventually kill you." This is a good message, but the container is so flawed that the message is cut. through bad behavior, complete lack of credibility in the feelings, dialogue as if read out loud, stereotypes instead of breathing, living people. <br /> <br /> The abuse of effects such as slow motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus a lack of emotional power ... <br /> <br /> Its suicidal reminds me of a low-budget movie from the pre-90s, when lesbians seem to be (at least on celluloid) a total inability of lively good, happy lives and a tendency to be trapped in dramatic dramas that are often divorce, death or prison. <br /> <br /> If focused on life rewards according to how we feel (and not how others think we should live), it would be less dramatic, more inspiring. But it is not, it focuses on pain, on loss and leaves the message only with a theoretical ideal. <br /> <br /> I can't see how this movie can inspire anyone to come out or overcome. fear and rejection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a very good movie that talks about overcoming fear and dare to live what you feel, go back to the beautiful "Desert Hearts" (even better: read the novel !)
