Rich horse farmers in Buenos Aires have a long branding policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan, but what happens when the Latin Boy falls for a certain Crawford with shiny eyes, blonde hair and some beautiful moves on the dance floor? The 20th Century Fox Music Game has a shiny veneer but looks rather tough on the edges. It is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic dance, very thin to the story. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives it a boost, although she is associated with Don Ameche (in brown makeup and smooth hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as Betty's spicy aunt, a limousine driver who constantly falls asleep, and Carmen Miranda plays herself (who else?). Argentina's shots have obscured the Fox-backed action, and some of the supporting appearances are quite awful. By the time of the big horserace final, most viewers will have had enough. * 1/2 of ****
