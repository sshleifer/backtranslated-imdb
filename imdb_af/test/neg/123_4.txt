First, let me say: If you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since blood, you probably won't like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors, but I enjoy these movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies that other action guys (Segal and Dolph) thought to come out over the past few years. Van Damme is good in the movie. The movie is just worth watching for Van Damme fans. It's not as good as Wake of Death (which I strongly recommend to anyone who loves Dams) or in hell, but in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same kind of feel to it as nowhere to run. Good fun stuff!
