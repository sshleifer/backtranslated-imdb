Who is responsible for this horrible shortage of one of my favorite books? It's just awful. terrible acting, horrible writing. The story is not even close to its old self - and what do they think? Robin Williams for Gosh's sake! It really damages description. Don't see it. Seriously, don't do it. Not even laughing. Especially if you are a fan of the book. This may just be the worst movie adaptation. Everything is incompatible and moving. The characters that are important to understanding the sequence of events are severely marginalized, and every possible place of interest in the book has changed (for example: Vienna - New York). For those who have not read the book, it is basically a fiction biography about a writer who grows up, explores his writing and so on. His mother writes an autobiography that (in spite of her protest) is considered a kind of feminist manifesto. The book is well written, tempting and long. The prose is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie is about Robin Williams and tells us to grab the day.
