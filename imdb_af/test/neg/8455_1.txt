This movie was just yesterday on HBO, so I watched it. It was a mistake. I think I sucked in and kept looking, though it was much like a train wreck, terrible, terrible, but somehow you just can't look away. shaudenfraud i think! ; ). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a photo shoot for models on an island in the Caribbean. One by one they are all killed. One is drinking cleaning fluid, one is blowing on a waiter, one is going over a cliff ... so it's not accidents, but for some reason the police are never called and no one thinks they may have to "wrap" the shoot and go home, not only in respect of the dead, but perhaps for fear of their own lives. No. They just keep on shooting because it's most important. Forget about the dead models, we have a magazine to produce! <br /> <br /> One of the subplots is the Evil magazine owner, played by Lee Majors, Rex is his name. He is the most obvious suspect and every time a model is killed, he turns his mustache and says, "Well, I can't say it won't be good for sales." Moo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha. "So absurd. Another subplot is when it is announced that Rex is one of the models that baby is right away. Just as he learned from the baby, he tried to convince the girl. She didn't do it but always upset him to even suggest it. <br /> <br /> They are trying to give you false clues and refer to a guy named Raule, apparently because he is the only one with a is accent and looks spectacular. <br /> <br /> In the end (sorry to spoil, but this movie came out years ago, so if you haven't seen it before ...) is one of Vanessa Angel, forgetting her characters name comes to Rex with a gun, they struggle, the gun fires and now she is dead! While lying on the floor, she tells business partner him that the magazine will be worthy of this bad press ss and it is all his fault, he gets him to sign him over the magazine, as soon as he does voila! e models come back to life and you find the whole thing was a huge rush to come back to Rex. <br /> <br /> Oy! What a ridiculous movie. As someone else said; If you want to see something like that, April Fools Day is much better!
