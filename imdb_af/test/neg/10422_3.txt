It is reassuring to see that other IMDb judges had the good sense of splashing this disappointing movie, at the risk of blasphemy against the great Vadim, Malle and Fellini. <br /> <br /> These directors can be talented and artistic in their own right; but in an attempt to leave this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and 60-year-old chic * in any way * related to Edgar Allen Poe's stories, they have exposed themselves as fraud. Or (A) they didn't bother to read the Poe stories, or (B) they read them but were conveyed by their own egoistic agenda so that they didn't pay Poe any mind. <br /> <br /> Imagine If Metallica plugged in their guitars, amps were cut to 11 and 3 chords choked. This claims Beethoven's 9th symphony. This is the feeling you will get after you put through this movie. If you are a Vadim / Malle / Fellini fan (Metallica), you will dig it. If you're a Beethoven fan (Poe), you'll come out. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... <br /> <br /> Here we start with a bizarre porn version of Poe. OK, "porn" can be a bit haha, but at least you should call it a Barbarella version (including, I doubt, some of Jane's outfits come directly from the set of that scifi hull). Vadim falls into his old clips: the girl lying on a bed is enjoyed by someone while we see the apathy in her eyes from the pillow comb; the general lack and grace of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. Nice things, but "Metzergenstein" is not the place for it. And in addition to the Barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes, Jane Fonda's terrific American accent and unconvincing performance as a European Earl made it the worst decision since Julia Roberts made the ugly version of dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. <br /> <WILLIAM WILSON ... <br /> Here's a great Poe story about the madness that a man incites when he realizes he's no longer unique in the world. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, look at Star Trek episode # 27 "The Alternative Factor". But here, Malle glass over the central theme and rather focus on ... any guess ...? yup, eroticism, sadism and deprivation. Ho hum. Brigitte Bardot's role is a complete production to achieve that goal, and director Judge a classic Poe story in a masturbatorial catharsis of his own unrequited sexual problems. Do it on your own time, Malle. I thought we were here at Poe's dime. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... <br /> <br /> The absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst movie I've seen since "Stay Alive". At least Fellini had a bit of a beat to change the title, but his deviation from the original plot, theme and humor of the story is so great. I wonder if he just picked this line from his own collection of home movies, "Edgar Allen Poe story" on it and submitted it to this collection. I did a lot of effort to find any thread of familiarity with Poe's works, but there was absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> The original Poe story ("Never Bet the Devil Your Head") is a short and hilarious dark fable about a Man who constantly calls out: "I will involve the devil my head ..." On a misty morning, the devil takes his offer. The result is the worst and silly thing you've ever read. It was Poe, the comedian at its best (yes, Poe wrote many comedies. Also see "A Predicament" and "Devil in the Belfry" if you want a taste of his spiritual, satirical works). <br /> This Fellini version? It is vague, insipid and not at all funny (unless you consider it a drunken bump over himself for 45 minutes). Here is Fellini's egoistic rant over an artist struggling with the hypocrisy, pretext and mediocrity of the theater. Most of them are at an award ceremony where Fellini strikes us with sarcasm, cynicism and the classic "acidic grape" attitude we find in all the Fellini cinema films. Watch the sarcastic jabs at "the critics", a recurring theme in Fellini's films. For someone who considered himself above the critics, Fellini certainly spent a lot of time talking about it. Anyway, I feel like Fellini just took a few 8 1/2 trips, split and sold as a Poe story. The worst "adjustment" ever. <br /> <br /> I think I'm taking more trouble typing this review than any of the three directors who make a Poe movie.
