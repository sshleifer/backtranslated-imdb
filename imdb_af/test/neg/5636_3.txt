I didn't know anything about this DVD when I rented it. Take a quick look at the comments, but decide to keep an open mind. Obviously an independent film and low budget, but it didn't bother me. I will watch anything with Derick Jacobi and, as always, he played his part well. What a pity no one did this. I watched 'Reconciliation' with Vanessa Redgrave a few weeks ago and she was sublime. In this she apparently just arrived to read the lines. In my opinion, the biggest mistake was in Vinnie Jones. To be honest, I saw his photo on the DVD cover, but didn't notice that he got the best bill. A sticker is strategically placed over its name! It was vigilant and I liked the Dickens story very much. Perhaps with a more capable actor taking the lead, it could have worked better. Yet it was weak.
