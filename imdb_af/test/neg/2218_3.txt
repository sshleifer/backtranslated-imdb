"On Earth's core" was on television yesterday. I was on my computer at work and then watched and saw what should have been the worst action ever made. I was immediately surprised by the shameful production values ​​of the film, terrifying acting (all included - even Peter Cushing) and horrible, inadvertently hilarious action series and puppet samples. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a Victorian scientist who takes a stereotypical Buff American Hero on a boring journey into the Welsh countryside. Little do they know that a great evil lies in the center of the earth's core. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the title doesn't make sense. (If they were really on the earth's core, they would be about 2700kg / m3 underground and alive in a sea of ​​iron or whatever was below it.) Forget the puppets in the production rival "The Beast" Master "used to be the everyday faxes. No, the true genius of "At the Earth's Core" is his naivety, a gung-ho spectacle without real action and without a real spectacle. It's just a gung-ho movie and a stupid one. People who love MST3K styles will love it - it's incredibly bad, and it's so bad in a strange way almost pleasant.
