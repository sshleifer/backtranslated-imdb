I usually like these movies. Give me a good old B movie any day, but this one was just awful. The acting (?) Was almost almost to the point that I completely shut down the movie. I thought I saw the worst, but this one is right there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! In all honesty - this was the play that this movie did for me. <br /> <br /> I found the actor clumsy and the chief / wife was extremely boring. This movie has done absolutely nothing about it. I can ask a ridiculous question here, but why is the nudity and sex scene? Did the producers think no one would see if they left them out? I think they were probably right! Oh, where is Price and The Tingler when you need it?
