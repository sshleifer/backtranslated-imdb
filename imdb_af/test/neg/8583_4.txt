For a horror movie it is criminally boring. Some unforgettable, gruesome pieces cannot compensate for a very poor writing. Very little coherence is achieved, and the film leaves its basic idea (a killer cat) indifferent until it repeats. And the things are made worse by the constant use of shots from the cat's point of view. (* 1/2)
