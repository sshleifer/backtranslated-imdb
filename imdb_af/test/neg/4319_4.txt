First, the current IMDb plot description seems to be misleading. The movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker, who wants to kill them all. They stop at a small motel where they hold their hostage, but develop an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence occurs. <br /> <br /> I accidentally picked it up and thought it was the other 2007 movie "The Hitcher". Not that The Hitcher is better, and I was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway, but it was almost unbearable. I think I could have thrown on a piece of paper and popped up a better plot. <br /> <br /> I can't even count how many movies I saw with virtually the same story, so it was almost painfully predictable, but what made it really awful was a few scenes that ... let me give an example. At one stage, a door covered (which is of course) blood, and two police officers, on the scene due to a 911 call, watch it from 30 feet, see a man also covered in blood, walk out of the door, agree that it looks suspicious, but decide not to investigate further. <br /> <br /> However, how ridiculous it may be, the movie is never boring, is well-produced, targeted and performed, complete with great special effects, free nudity and violence. I probably wouldn't recommend sitting down for 90 minutes of your life watching this movie, but it was perfect to have while cleaning my basement. Also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies, and would be a great movie to watch with friends when you plan to talk more than to watch.
