This movie really shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What it tries to show you is just ONE side of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and spiritual abuse of Indian children who do not show this movie. <br /> <br /> "Indian Parents" are liable for the following: a. Destroy the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on their parents at an early age. Such children become adults only in physical appearance, but keep children in mind. Since everything was given to them by their great Indian parents, their children do not automatically feel that they need to work hard on something, or to learn the basics of human communication with others, other than their parents. <br /> <br /> B. I can show you so many Indian parents who are trying to prevent their children from making, walking or preventing their children from growing into adults. <br /> <br /> The reason they are doing is the same selfishness. Indian parents "expect" their children to care for them when they grow old. They do not make any savings for themselves and as soon as they are 50 years old ... They cry LOUD ...... We have now grown old and so we are dependent on your children because we have done the GREAT SERVICES to help you bring to this world and take care of you and make your intellectual weak. <br /> <br /> Most of the Indian parents at the age of 50 decayed bodies and health and were financially insecure. Most feel they absolutely do not need to care for themselves, as they "expect" their children to care for them. <br /> <br /> In the west, the opposite happens. People start 20 years of age to plan their retirement and once they retire, they are financially secure. <br /> <br /> Indian parents DO NOT do something like I said they brought the kids around and what better investment at that? <br /> <br /> I'm a victim of my Indian parents (I'm sure there are many other Indian kids like me), who have grown physically, but still struggle with their lives on their own and they remain 50 years old who runs aloud for HELP. <br /> <br /> This movie shows only ONE side of the story ..... UTTER piece JUNK
