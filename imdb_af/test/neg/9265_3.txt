I got this movie a few years ago and are trying to find information about it. I found that even the mighty IMDb didn't list it. It had to be everything I needed to know. <br /> <br /> With friends like this is an anthology that plays like a collection of Twilight Zone Twilight Zone / Outer Limits episodes that are all linked by a bus journey that never really looks like. to include with the rest of the movie. Of the three stories, the only one I entertained, was the second episode in which a man (species) grows out of the bacteria in a guys fridge. This episode wins points for a few spots of humor and it is bizarre premise. In addition, there is an episode with a talk vehicle (bare and directional) and an episode where a girl visits a very unique dating agency (my dog ​​guesses the end of this one.) As already mentioned in other comments, the 18 rating is completely unfounded. There is nothing to offend. If you look at a good horror anthology, watch Asylum or the Creepshow movies instead.
