Review: Since the warrior Queen Gedren raised and slaughtered most of Sonja's family, she trained in the art of sword fighting. Gedren has now taken a very powerful talisman who destroys the world if it is not destroyed, and killed Sonja's sister in the process. Now, Sonja is out of revenge and to save the world. Along the way she meets the very Conan-like (but not Conan!) Kalidor, the child prince Tarn and his bodyguard Falcon. Initially, Sonja refuses all help, but is later forced to accept it, and together they will save the world. <br /> <br /> Comment: If you watch a movie like this and you think it's the story that it's the best element in this movie, the movie is in great trouble. Because 1) a movie like this must draw its power on good sword fighting and effects, and 2) the story is really very bad. It is simple and uncomplicated and really offers nothing in the way of character development or even tension. It is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidor, have no chemistry at all. And the child is just irritating. And most of the scenes have been pulled out for so long that they are sowing. Although the film is not very long, it's not enough to fill its time. And so back to point 1). The battles are slow, inevitable and really bad. It clearly shows that most fighters clearly block the opponents' strokes before the opponent, even starting to strike. In my honest opinion, I believe most children, struggling with sticks, create more exciting battles to play knights than this movie did. All in all, this is a very bad spin-off, it must be avoided by anyone who likes the Conan movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
