I made sure to watch this movie because it's a 1950's sci-fi movie - one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, the strangers in this movie were unfortunately a big disappointment while looking out for either alien strangers or crazy victors! First you see a very short start (and he looks pretty normal) and you also have a little glimpse on a spaceship! Secondly, the alien was not the evil victor or the benevolent friend of man - but a real strange ball. And finally, the plot itself was so stupid, preaching and heavy-hearted that it raised more gift than excitement. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts, five people from five different parts of the world (Germany, Britain, Russia, China and the US) are kidnapped by a stranger. The stranger gives each of them devices with which they can destroy the whole life on the planet if they so choose - because the stranger recognizes that his race of people will inhabit the earth, but they themselves will not kill to get it. Then he returns them all. Although it is 100% obvious that no one wants to use these devices, the alien then announces the identities of the five on TV without saying that the weapons are so strong! So, all the militarists in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work. Many of the rest of the movie consists of a few of the five who hide and one is tortured to show him how the device works - as the Soviet Union wants to use it! This part of the movie is pretty stupid. Certainly the USSR was an evil and corrupt nation (sorry, but it is fact - especially under Stalin), they would never have thought of using it as they did in the movie! Later, one in five (the German scientist) somehow pointed out that the devices could also be used to kill only the EVIL people who hate freedom. So, he uses it to eradicate all the evil Commissions and possibly others who are anti-freedom and the world then become a paradise !! Preachy, stupid and full of plot holes - this movie is just not worth your time, although it is an interesting relic, just for the way it addresses communism - especially the tension between NATO and the Soviet Union.
