The width and height of the scale of this movie overwhelm me. About a week ago, I commented on the 1926 silent epic MACISTE IN HELL, calling it "staggering". Then I got the Pollonia Bros. BLOOD RED PLANET got it. Wow ... <br /> <br /> It's all about the scope of thinking behind it. The Pollonia Bros and colleague John McBride thought so great that the scenes of Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODESSEY were fortunate enough to be released thirty-two years before this sweetheart. In fact, Kubrick had it easily with models, a budget, real actors and great studio support for his little Star Trek ripoff, and all that Arthur C. Clarke had to do was the deadly thing. What is so difficult to muscular about a typewriter? The brothers of Pollonia on the other hand had to think radically, out of the box and quickly. They recruited half a dozen of their friends and colleagues - including a hot lookin chick - bought a bunch of colored light bulbs, raided old office supplies for each keyboard, monitored and got hands-free phone jacks that they could get, all identical. Black turtlenecks, trimmed with every cupcake tin in the country, learned enough 3D modeling and texture descent to create a few spacecraft planes, threatened a few hours to enter a roadmap, which was easily the most terrifying space monster. little monster Jabba the Hut, who had been around with him, was fried R2D2, spent literal days with a VHS camera and an Amiga to shoot and edit their movie. This is the best D.I.Y. direct to the home video fan movie room I've ever seen, and in proportion to the amount of talent and resources available to the movie makers dwarves, even LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (the original series) as a cold look at us future, right down to a newsletter with a broken, bad second hand suit. As a species we are doomed. <br /> <br /> But for a minute it's such a big improvement on such later epics as the DINOSAUR CHRONICALS or PREYALIEN: ALIEN PREDATORS, which is funny because it was previously made. one of those masterpieces. Somewhere the Pollonia started it on its own: it was carried out with a certain belief that made you believe you could breathe in a vacuum with a dust mask and two biker spray bottles. And the scene where the alien animal uses a miniaturized crew member immediately reminded me of what I saw before: GODZILLA USA. THE SEA SAMPLE, where the giant rampage monster crab splashes two canoes and eats them on camera. It made me cry when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> It made me cry as an adult, because here I waste my time being a kind of critic or writer or writer / critic. has all the pleasure, actually a real feature length sci-fi epic with very cool colored lights, a hot chick and a talk slide projector named KAL. One of the flight crews even gets his black space baseball cap back and shines with his goats like those of Metallica. Is it supposed to be a joke? No. It is an epic statement about mankind, of mankind and of mankind that is earned to be seen by anyone who has the ability to take none of it too seriously. Search it on a 2-slice set called GALAXY OF TERROR in your favorite discount seller's cut-out DVD pickups, probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say: "Yes, they have a few box sets of our movies for sale. best buy. "<br /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone who isn't in a sense of humor might want to try SILENT RUNNING or maybe TRON. But one day, an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept a transfer of this movie and decide that we should not really be wasted. Good work, guys !!
