I just can't understand how a fan of someone, or just someone who can find this terribly lazy, poorly written abomination, is even funny at some distance. It is so embarrassing under par that it qualifies as a true tragedy. The potential for this was great, it could have been good. What a shame that all the acting talent, the sets, the props, the goodwill of all involved were so pathetically wasted by a writing that had to be burned. <br /> <br /> There is a clear lack of any strict production and quality control here. Like this hammy Hollywood movie (crazy crazy world, casino royal) where the stars just make time for each other and have a good time, which basically means you have to take a check to do nothing. <br /> <br /> I could have written a better one that sent in my sleep. In fact, I've been awake. I did this at high school in year 10 and did it with a lot of classmates. It was better, I watch it now and the gags are funny. Steven Moffat YOU ARE NO TALENT BUM! What a waste, a wasteful opportunity. Let me cry ...
