This is embarrassing. I had 3 minutes on my way to a job to stop at the video store and it was 2 for 1 night and I was really busy with the half-necked photo of the 'star'. <br /> <br /> I think this movie shows how the New York Film School and Sir's Fortune - taken by the bio of this clown - can do for you and you and you make it go what we have here. and also a photo of the lead actor 'actor' with someone else's body in a still picture that does not happen in the movie. It's strange because it has thrown money in so many ways. It is obviously low on budget money, but from the start when all the extras are in their terrorist drink, it is not good, it might have had some charm if done. for 2 cents! In short order I cut scenes and quickly forwarded to see the picture on the box. That was all I really cared about. odd, why don't I just rent a porn or something? but wow there is a bad play, it's funny, i think and it's bad. It's just bad. Robert Englund is very pathetic with everyone. It doesn't really appreciate the more so straight to the video horror out there. . . blah I wouldn't bother. shoulda look at hellraiser 3 if i wanted to see an 8 pack! I would suggest that horny old gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store will be the tenants principle and they should start a class action pack!
