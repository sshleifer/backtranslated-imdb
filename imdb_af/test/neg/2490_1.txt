I did a screen test in 1988 and read the script for this turkey. It was terrible and worse now - I saw it on VHS at the local HollowWood Video and said, "Oh, what is the hey to do?" You. <br /> <br /> They had to shoot most of them in Mexico after running out of money, some of the "star" whipped bitches because they ran out of some exotic fruit drinkworm. The movie's plot is good, but I know the author is planning to have a nail wire throughout. <br /> <br /> Eventually Dr O became a cartoon character. He still has to move around in the grave in the grave in the Kremlin wall. <br /> <br /> Technical errors were everywhere in the movie, not just with atomic technology, but with uniforms, insignia and military jargon. They were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser of course. Even Mr Newman's August and expert's presence could not have saved this bird for Thanksgiving.
