OK, to start with, this movie wasn't like the book at all. I read the book when I was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. If I'm waiting for another book to come out, it's the book I'm going to fill in the time. I have 3 copies for the sake of God. Anyway, I knew it wasn't going to be the book, but come on! They could have done a little better than that. I mean seriously if I wanted to see the American werewolf in Paris or London as I would watch those movies. They made a perfect story and turned it into a copy of a story that was told over and over and honestly, I'm tired of seeing it. I mean hello the best part of the whole f ***** g (sorry) story she's ending with Gabriel. He does not die. What was it about? And he is old in this movie. Gabriel is supposed to be only 24 or 44 da **. Awww. And Astrid, who came to the idea that Astrid was Vivian's aunt, no no no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwww. Anyway, yes, my little rant was severely discouraged. hope this helped.
