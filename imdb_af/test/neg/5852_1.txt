I don't know if I'm wrong, or anyone who says the movie is good, I just want to give some favor to people who are unsure of seeing it, renting it or even getting worse. Do it really!). <br /> <br /> The trailers and very early previews can somehow be fun, but it's not funny at all, but in a series of you it's supposed to be -Lat-here scenes is to really get bad jokes, bad, very bad plays, tasteless scenes, cheese effects; This movie has everything, everything wrong. <br /> <br /> As a final comment, the movie would be funny because of the basic concept, but believe me is really far from that.
