Despite decades of tax incentives, in terms of international visibility, the Canadian film industry is still lagging behind most central African and Islamic states (surprisingly few Canadian films are released outside their own cushions) and Nouvelle-France aka Battle of the Brave another example of why. More than any other country, commercial Canadian theater seems unable to develop its own identity and puts it in the light of other countries' failures. On paper, this historical drama was vaguely promising. There is definitely a wealth of untapped material in Canada's history, as the French and English have fought and bought and sold the colony, though none of it makes the cut unless you are the odd shining-and-you-miss. - scene counting characters who say "Wolfe is dead" or "Nouvelle-France is no longer" before returning to the soap operation. But while it's not a history lesson, it's not a drama or the epic adventure that the new title also promises: there's no fight in the movie unless you count 10 seconds shooter by half a dozen re-enactors and one collapsed barn. The town square that we all see from Quebec is an obvious, flat-lit studio interior, which gives many scenes an old TV mini-look. Just like the director Jean Beaudin's reluctance to offer very long shots or even outside. What you get for your money is a simple but elaborate Harlequin romance about doomed lovers who are constantly separated by events beyond their control, the biggest surprise being that Fabio does not appear in the movie. This is the kind of movie where every two characters make the cattle with two backs. The camera rinses over to a comfortable fireplace or a waterfall. <br /> <br /> An Anglo-Canadian French co-production that doesn't "At once unite once-war nations like a country with a decent tax break in the stove. This massive boxing camp was clearly planning to be Canada's Titanic. Although someone fails to tell the producers what they meant, not the ship. - But more like the Revolution done on the cheap without the fighting scenes, crowds or the few moments that threaten to work briefly in the face of overwhelming opportunity. The Montreal Mirror described it as "so bad you can't even get the power to mock it." It's quite unfair because the movie looks like an 80-year-old miniseries for most of his running time. The last half hour suddenly becomes very funny, with characters accidentally trapping their legs in legs. They say, "You will never see your lovely lover again, Cuckold's honor! You pay it for both of you!" And our heroine is accused of killing and grabbing! - Witchcraft in a hearing funny enough to be in Demi Moore's version of The Scarlet Letter. Throw out caddish British governors, devastating slaves and Celine Dion and you have something that almost feels like the kind of movie that Timbo Hines was aspiring to (and still miss out on) with his legendary immovable version of World War, though without the staggering technical incompetence. <br /> <br /> The front man, David La Haye's versatility, seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like in the course of the movie: he begins like Andy Garcia, briefly takes the Al Pacino revolution. look, flicker with the cleaned Tch√©ky Karyo style before changing into a younger Ted Danson as his character age. While his opening scene responding to the news of his father's death with an expression that looks as if he is waiting for the director to tell him, he can go home, promising a feast of bad acting, in fact he gives the more of a mediocre support actor who listened to a lead in the last moment when the original popular role read and called the script. He shows willingly and gives it a little, but the grace and charisma that the part needs is just not there. Billie Piper lookalike Noemie Godin-Vigneau's front lady does not set the screen exactly, despite the middle stage occupation as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly Vincent Perez's corrupt and distorted Intendant Le Bigot (who is actually the character's name ). the double, drunk, thin, Sebastien Huberdeau and, the saddest of all, Gerard Depardieu's spoiled, revolutionary, dirty old priest in a manikin-gray hair wig. It is a wonderful actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game, as he moves through the movements, which seems to have lost not only the will to do, but the will to live with it. He could clearly not be bothered by the English dubbing sessions (or even a few long shots where he had doubled significantly). Little wonder he was talking about the time of the movie's short version. <br /> <br /> A few short comic relief is provided by Jason Isaacs in his standard Patriot that surrenders Wolfe from Quebec, rather than an asthma Alf Garnett / Archie Bunker played by Timothy Dalton at speed while Tim Roth William Pitt is on the sidelines with the occasionally mourned smile of one in a nice hotel with excellent room service and many days off, but like Colm Meaney's Benjamin Franklin they 'both stay in the movie for less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour also pop their heads around the door for a few minutes, but make no impression, comic or otherwise.) The supporting actresses are generally better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as the heroine's rights and adopted girls and a strikingly beautiful Irene Jacob, looking for the whole world like a young Fanny Ardant, is all refreshingly good and deserves much better.
