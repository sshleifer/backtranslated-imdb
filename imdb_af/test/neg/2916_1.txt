Possible Spoiler Warning, but there's not much to spoil about this movie. I saw Project A part II without seeing the first movie. I don't think I missed much. Project Part Two is not just the worst Jackie Chan movie I have ever seen (yes worse than `` Fantasy Mission Force ''). This film is one of the most irreconcilable movies the world has ever seen. It's right there with 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' on the sleep-inducing scale. The plot was twisted and knotted like a 50-ball yarn that the cat played and eventually left for death. The "humor" if you can call it, seems to have been written by an annoying high school man, who, despite how many people tell him he is not funny, is determined to get his lame humor out, no matter how painfully a movie is not. And this movie is painfully bad. The plot involves Jackie Chan as a naval officer recruited by the police to set up all known criminals. He wrapped them up in the first half of the film and I prayed for a quick end that I couldn't find. Why the movie is difficult to make from this point, I have no idea. The movie goes on and on with no purpose, no plot, and attempts at humor that fail so make Carrot Top look like a comic genius. The Kung Fu in this movie is lame and forgotten. There's better Kung Fu in that movie about the 3 Ninja kids. Project Part II is not an action movie or a kung fu movie, but it is a complete waste of Jackie Chan's and Maggie Cheung's talents, which made the world better. As Jackie Chan repeatedly escapes certain deaths, I enter "Blair Witch" mode that asks (and wishes) "will he die now, so the movie can end? `. An example of how ridiculous this movie is: Jackie Chan is handcuffed to another man. A gang of pirates (who don't look like pirates) throw axes at Jackie. Is Jackie grabbing one of the eternal axes and breaking the chain on the handcuffs? No! You see it would spoil the "hilarious" few of him to another man. If you have a friend who is laughing at everything, I encourage you to watch this movie with him or her and see how even they will not get this movie. If you are an insomnia, this movie is sure to make you sleep. Do not use heavy machinery while viewing Plan A Part II. Possible side effects include headache, retinal tension, and death through boredom. 0/9 Stars
