Okay, I'll make this review short and easy for the people whose mental ability is perfect to watch this movie. Everyone knows about Motion Picture Association of America's ratings: G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17. For the purposes of this movie, I think the MPA should create a new rating standard: IQ-20.
