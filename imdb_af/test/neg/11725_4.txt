One would think that with all the cute care and expense that went into this made-up movie, it would reflect some of the tastes and ways of the top class couple - Wales Simpson and the Prince of Wales - instead of n mawkish, unappetizing historical romance. <br /> <br /> It's also not helped by the fact that JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS are stiff, rather uncomfortable, to watch performances in which events are slow to pay attention. /> <br /> It's hard to understand why a star of OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND's caliber wants to play Aunt Bessie's supportive role, as the role is so colorless she just falls out. At this stage in her career, Olivia appeared in so many "noble" roles that required a right-wing presence, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> A recent movie has come out best under all the made TV movies era.
