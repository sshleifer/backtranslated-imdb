The only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available. This show went from informative news to sensational slap. I tried to support this performance in its decline, because I love human interest stories and Primetime has had some very good people. Unfortunately, April 21 changed my mind about this show and the unethical news officers participating in it. ABC actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and refused to show it until the law of limitations came out and the parents could not be arrested on the charges they had to face. What made it worse was how ABC smashed the whole incident; Instead of seeking guidance and seeking true professional help for these disturbed individuals, they sent a few pop psychologists to strict warnings of obedience to how they should not judge these poor angels too hard. I was really sick. I hope this review prevents one person from viewing this investigative waste in the future. If that does happen, I'll be happy. Nowadays, everything you can expect from Diane Sawyer and the good people of Primetime Live is chick sessions with A renowned celebrities and criminal acts that are covered and praised by the stars. Don't waste the hour of your life; You'll be better off looking at an old sitcom at Nick at Nite.
