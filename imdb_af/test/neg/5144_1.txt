Could be the worst movie ever made. At least plan 9 Outside space was funny. I can't believe they were talking to someone to actually put money into making this thing. Complete waste of celluloid. Before I saw this shit, I had respect for Kristophersson. I think someone has written off a tax. Please, in the name of everything that doesn't suck, stop who made it before they suck again! This movie should be avoided by all people who are not on LSD, or my mad cousin who insists that we are part Native American. If you're in the woods and an owl starts talking to you, see a psychiatrist. It is not necessary to make a movie about it.
