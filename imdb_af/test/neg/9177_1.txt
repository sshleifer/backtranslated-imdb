The only reason I bought this DVD is because Cynthia is Rothrock in it. Now everyone knows she is the queen of martial arts b movies.the problem is it is not a martial arts movie.cynthia rothrock has about a minute or so of fighting scenes in this silly movie. now that you were a filmmaker and you had cynthia rothrock in your movie, don't you want to do many martial arts? all she did in this movie, walk around and look bored, just as I was when I watched this stack of crap. I have a lot of her movies and they are all b movies, but they had at least some cool scenes in them. If you are a martial arts fan avoid it no matter what. I'm still crazy I wasted 4 bucks to buy this DVD
