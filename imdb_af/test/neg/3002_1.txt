Pretentious storytelling like this always uses the same technique: 1) Throw opaque, unstructured threads to confuse the audience. 2) Act only in 'big' subjects such as life, death and God. 3) Make it deep with plays of life, death, air, etc. 4) Depends on an intellectually poor hearing to give you the benefit of the doubt. 5) And finally, lower to critical praise. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretentious faux intellectualism at its bravest. Not only do these filmmakers answer questions, they are afraid to ask the questions. The movie is held together by wisps. Directions are generated and fall uncomfortable. Pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary. There is so little to show that critical machines are missing. <br /> <br /> Critics who have found an intellectual basis for this movie are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this movie is about. Good news: not even the filmmakers. Satisfactory efforts to demand answers to in-depth questions about human existence ask for white, intellect, poetry and genius. Unfortunately, this movie does not show any of these features.
