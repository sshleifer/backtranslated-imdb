A dark horror show filmed in the Everglades. Two couples stay overnight in a cabin after becoming uncomfortable with the local people's unfriendliness. Who, or what are the Blood Stalkers? After a while they find out. Look for the character of the village idiot that looks like a chicken, he is definitely strange.
