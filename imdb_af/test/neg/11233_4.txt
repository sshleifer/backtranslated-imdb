This film is full of sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and make irrelevant material. Why, for example, does Rachel suggest? She has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, except to allow her "Follow Me" truck to run wild and clash in Dorinda's fence. It must be one of the blunt sequences below many in the movie. Another is at the end of the plane (if it's used a B-26 or an A-26? -Bot nominations in the movie), left with props and no claws in place. Of course, this means the plot, but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded destroyer. As it is, the plane would start with taxi sans control. The end (again, avoiding spoilers) involves far too much talk - as at the beginning of sound films in the 30's with all the final speeches. Here, Dreyfuss, just talk over and over. The end also includes other radical airplane protocol violations and some unlikely / impossible things I will not describe. What a dull and endless effort!
