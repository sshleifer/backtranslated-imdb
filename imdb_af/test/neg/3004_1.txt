The frustrating thing about a movie like this, with a real potential for greatness, is that it's almost enjoyed being heavy-hearted. We are talking about allegory, metaphor ... but the truth is that there is absolutely no plot or true character. <br /> <br /> At some point we know most who the people are ... even if we never understand where they are going. The mere pretentiousness turned me every time I tried a truth in this movie. <br /> <br /> Call it beautiful, wonderful and fantastic ... I just call it "fraud". All style and no dust. Certainly, this is a matter of taste ... but I will never take a confusing modernist pastiche of symbols and splashes on the spiritual clarity of Jean Cocteau or Renoir. But if it works for you, I'm all for it. Art is a personal thing, I think.
