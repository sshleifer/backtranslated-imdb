Wow, a racist, ominous piece of celluloid garbage, and an insult to the great genre of Westerners. <br /> <br /> Exploitive? Sex screens are abundant, abundant abundance, violence and gore are abundant. Everything that makes modern films such a good name, especially among those who prefer classic era films. It's the kind of sleaze that gives the old people's ammunition against today's films. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I can't just naked male bath tones in Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey movies. And I can't hear the picture! called here and there. I really doubt that the word was even more than 100 years ago. Still, the f-word is so common, you think you've looked at a story centered in today's urban areas, not the old west of the 1800s. <br /> <br /> Bias? Well, if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty, brutal guy? Do you think someone can complain about a racist movie? Home comes to hear no call when the reverse - as demonstrated in this movie - is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country. <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peeples wrote, arranged and died in this bomb. Remember that name. Apparently he is the "Ed Wood" of today's filmmakers. Even Spike Lee would not be this racist. You can't get much worse than this movie.
