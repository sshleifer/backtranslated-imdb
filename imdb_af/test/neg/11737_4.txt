The 1998 version of "Psycho" had to be put back in the 60's, rather than today. The headliners would have done a good job with the environment. There were two scenes sticking out like a sore thumb. The first one was at the beginning of the movie when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) sat at her desk. Her boss joined his client at his office because "it was air-conditioned." I imagine most Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) & Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Lila, who was the Walkman, looked like it was too exaggerated to update the movie. The movie chased a number of viewers into the theater.
