I wasn't a fan of Westerners, I watched it mainly because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something else as an "I Love Lucy" or "Lucy Show" role. Here she plays Christine Larson, owner of a salon in the Arizona area in 1868, who is about to marry the unscrupulous local Indian agent (Dean Jagger). Ball's performance was OK - nothing really anymore; she didn't beat me away. This succeeded me because the role was very different from what I used to see. There was very little of the shameful physical comedy she later became known, though the movie felt amusing throughout. (A typical, funny line - "There are two ways to deal with women - and no one knows one of them!") I didn't find the story compelling, though I appreciated that the Indians as victims of the Indian agent. There are typical shootout action and lots of horses - your typical Western in other words. As far as Christine is concerned, we can recommend from the outset how her planned marriage ends; It's just a matter of how she's going to get there. If you like Westerns, it would be a very typical one with a bit of humor being thrown in. If you are not big on the genre, it will be missing. I'm not big on the genre. 10/03
