Yes, the voices are in. This movie may well be the Plan 9 From Outer Space for our generation. But while Ed Wood's movie, for all its mistakes, retains a certain charm in spite of everything, this movie defines the word "charmless" to the ninth grade. In fact, I suggest the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary to name this movie as an important example, defining the word in the next update to the dictionary. <br /> <br /> Root Top is an artist of such abysmal ability that normally rational people I know as soon as they hear his name become murderous people who are willing to murder. Kill as soon as possible. Indeed, if you go to Amazon.com and look at reviews for Carrot Top's movie and other performance DVDs, there will be several that are deadly threats to Mr. Top can be seen. <br /> <br /> Another curious fact about this film, I remember that Mike Nelson, the lead author of MST 3000, in his book Mike's Mega Cheese about movies, good and bad, said he saw this movie and short after that he could not remember anything, including the title. It was clear that Mike had a classic reaction to trauma. To view this horror was so aging, Mike Nelson had to block it from his mind. (In a later chapter in his book, Mike Nelson restored his master of this movie. Of the review he presents, Mike Nelson was definitely not grateful for the recycling.) <br /> <br /> The only comment I made presents about the film, and it is not a destroyer, it's just God's honest truth, it's not funny. Not one of them is even a nanosecond of it is funny.
