What a terrible movie. This movie was so out of date and so difficult to follow. It was so difficult to follow and was just confusing. All the time I watched it, I wanted to end it! I felt I was wasting 2 hours of my life, never coming back. Save your money and don't rent this movie. Now I see why Sarah Michelle Gellar was barely in the movie. The first movie was great, but it was just sucked. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Raise your money and look at the trailer because it's about the only thing worth doing with this movie. This movie also has no real story. I'm still wondering what I watched.
