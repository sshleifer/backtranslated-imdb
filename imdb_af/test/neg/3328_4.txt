I want to say I liked this movie, I really do, but if it does, it was just too boring. It starts with promising promise, and even when they come into the mines, the creepy atmosphere and mood are great. The problem is the monster, or the lack thereof. As people said, this is a stop-motion monster, but this is not the problem (stop-motion may look good if done properly). The problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't get killed. It is meant to be a horror movie, such a lack of monster and a lack of death is equal to boredom. There were a few scenes I liked, such as when one girl used her camera in the dark and the monster came to her. There are also some other creepy scenes, but they are too few to keep your interest and certainly not worth watching the movie. This is a shame because I can see that if it was handled correctly, it would have been an effective, horrible horrorflick. The worst thing is that movies like this will never be made again, as filmmakers are dying their films these days and using CGI effects.
