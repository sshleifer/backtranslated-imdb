Ouch !! What a mess we have here. Not so much of a mess as a painfully dull, half-excuse for exploitation. Presented by one single, J. G. "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same one from Moonshine Mountain. Doctor Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, is, I think, a little inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else. The late Mr. Patterson also dies in this joke, as a sad scientific / plastic surgeon, who recently lost his wife in a car accident, and is saddened by grief, to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is to kill many females, then maybe robbed some graves for body parts to put together the perfect mate. It won't be easy, but thank you, his friend Gregg, the hug, is available to borrow a hand and to provide moral support. <br /> <br /> If ever proved that some people's goals were not meant to be accomplished, here it is, gang. Of course, this Patterson hay seed never had any matters that regulate anything, in the footsteps of good oh G. G. as master of gore. I have never seen a gore movie just refusing to give the viewer a single reason to watch. Even the gore is boring. Almost remotely humorous at times, but impossible to say whether it is intentional or not. I choose 'not'. <br /> <br /> In Charolotte, North Carolina (home of the California Ace Massacre), it's probably a 3-digit budget, by a man, as indisputable as he might have " had an appreciation for entry. So, maybe we should do it well, I mean, he tried (I assume) what's more that can be said for most. This movie is better. as any of the big-budget superheroes garbage that these theaters have been putting out these days, although I realize it doesn't say much. Besides, Doctor Gore is quite the improvement of Patterson's previous failure, The Electic Chair, so it is quite possible that he would have improved his craft in time if he didn't die, so maybe it's not that terrible, especially in Compared to the other movie on the DVD, how to make a doll, so what the hell, check it out. 10/04
