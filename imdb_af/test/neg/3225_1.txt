What happened to Mathew Modine's career? I can still remember when he is considered an A-list actor. <br /> <br /> Was it the island's final nail in the coffin of a once-promising career? Wow, this guy really hates Renny Harlin's bowels ... <br /> <br /> This movie is bad to be a comedy, but failing to make any laughs, the characters are caricatures and bad married people . but what makes me still painful is that Mr. Modine takes on these kinds of roles, alongside actors so far away from his caliber. I mean when he made movies like BIRDIE, he could never have had his worst nightmares. thought he would be in movies in the future with a cage that had cut a cow cutting her anus, and perhaps even the worst, alongside Elizabeth Berkley !!!
