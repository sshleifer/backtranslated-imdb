... A good script or director couldn't fix it. <br /> <br /> The original 'Poseidon Adventure' was a story of human courage that overwhelmed at tremendous chance and personal tragedy. The survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual power that would take up anything that God had cast upon him. <br /> <br /> The sequel tries to recreate the mix, but fails through a formula and pedestrian direction. Irwin Allen may have been a good disaster maker and has done a good job of directing action scenes in Towering Inferno, but he can't bring any human depth to his characters. If the characters are not credible, any danger they face will also fall flat. <br /> <br /> The script also tries to copy the original for granted. So we did Peter Boyle doing the Ernest Borgnine thing by being hard and stupid (but he has a soft heart); Karl Malden is the Red Buttons moderating influence (and is terminally ill for a good degree); Slim Pickens makes the comic relief for Shelley Winters, and so on. <br /> <br /> In order to make the story more contemporary, we have a rogue gun dealer ready to explode gunpowder plutonium to the highest bidder. A really nasty piece of work that the wounded men relentlessly leave (the actors playing his henchmen are thought to have been paid extra because they don't have lines) and a woman shot in the back - what a cad! Thanks, the French rescue services made the hole in the Poseidon's hull twice as big as in 1972 (and on the other side of the screw shaft) so he could get his goods. And while we're on the subject, how did they get the crates * to * the ... o, forget about it. <br /> <br /> I actually paid good money to see it when it was released. Given the current reputation of the movie, it may seem strange, but it actually had pretty mixed reviews. Some said it was messed up, some said it was as exciting as the original. Remember, nobody can be right.
