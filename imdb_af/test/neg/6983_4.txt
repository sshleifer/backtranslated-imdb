Yes, I know his character is supposed to be drunk, and he might just have been goofy. But something tells this critic that Mr. Pleasence really drank a lot and was drunk during his screens in the movie. Basically everything he says is unclear and often incomprehensible. Or maybe it was just the poor production values ​​... hard to say. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the race for the Yankee Zephyr is a movie that just doesn't work. It's also a shame as the movie has a tremendous opening and a generally interesting plot. Eventually, the production values ​​are just too low and the action just too sparse for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods. The story is about a US war plane filled with gold, money and medals collapsing in a New Zealand war in World War II. The plane has been lost for about forty years until it somehow rinses off and a drunk (Pleasence) literally stumbles upon it. Initially he gathers all the press heart medals and tries to sell them in town, actually $ 75 for them! Little does he know that the local jeweler comes on the phone as soon as he sells it and starts trying to find information about the aircraft. Before you can blink, all the attention brings a rich scumbag (Peppard) and his henchmen in town and they are trying to force the old man to give the plane's location because they know there's much more to it than just medals. The old drunk's business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then break out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get it. The resulting action is just not as nice as you hope it will be. <br /> <br /> The acting is rather terrible, except for Pleasence. George Peppard is trying to do some sort of (I think) Australian accent, but it's hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren is not bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He basically does his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And it says something. Hopefully, he made enough money on this movie to make his front teeth slightly crooked. I don't remember if he corrected them when he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the role-play is quite unquestionable. Probably mostly residents who never did much else. I think the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for many of the movie, and the lack of danger. The villains are just too nice and goofy to take seriously. And honestly, there are NO helicopters in the movie that look like those on the DVD cover. And neither of the boats in the movie have teeth on them. <br /> <br /> However, the film has its strengths. The start that started as a news rule and then part of the story was a good touch. Brian May's score sounds a bit too much like the one in Mad Max 2, but he included a nice little march that they play in some scenes for Pleasence. Sounds like the one in the great escape! There are a few neat helicopter stunts and a big boat hunt that apparently killed three stuntmen during filming. The landscape, despite the grainy appearance of the picture, is pretty nice. The thing you will remember most, however, is the drunk mess of Donald Pleasence. He was almost enough to save this movie. Almost. 4 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
