As an indie filmmaker, I at least try to make a decent movie. This piece ____ was out of the low budget. It was shot on video and not at least 24P mini-DV. The appearance of this was just baaaad. I met the director a few years ago at the ShowBiz Expo in LA and he talked about the book, Film-making for dummies he put together. I thought this little video would be something, but I think I was wrong. He could have raised the value a bit by shooting 16mm movies instead of that horrible video. The plot was silly as well as the acting and all the false green screen and sound and the whole nine meters. I had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice. Damn !!!!! I bought JoyRide that was a hell of a movie. Perhaps the director should read real-time movie books about movies and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget. Perhaps he should learn from the masters who made, night of living death and evil death and chain saw bloodbath. just to name a few of the many low budget hits. This is a video that should have been dead. I can't call it a movie because he didn't use film.
