When I first saw the movie, I literally walked around the floor (especially when running through the water, and if the man was driving through people's gardens, would I hurt driving the washline?) special effects! This movie clearly didn't have a big budget. either it or the man left his toddler in control of the controls. The water that came out of the dam looked like a shell that had a beer tray. what did the actors think? did they actually believe it was a good movie? Or did they just need the money? not that they deserved much. When I first saw it, I was like "God, how old is it?" When I looked at the information and saw that it was made in 2003, I thought my TV was broken. <br /> <br /> It's really a disaster movie, in more ways than one.
