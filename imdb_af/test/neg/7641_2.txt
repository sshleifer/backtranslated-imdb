... I have little choice but to use it at least once during my review of Respiro. Among other things, defining the prediction, I believe is a lack of emotional sincerity on the part of the author. Respiro is made with an all too complicated and self-conscious intention to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, challenging, metaphorical ... myths, even. But fortunately for all true artists out there, there is no prescribed formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth. Beautiful natural places (yes, these remote parts of southern Italy even look exotic to most other Italians), beautiful actors and some entertaining, gutsy, spontaneous performances by a handful of handsome children will not overtake an inexorable movie than " a nice sequence of images. . Yet, this sincere and vain and ultimately hollow movie is painful to be art, but only to a very limited extent, perhaps in some cases by accident. I will admit that the conceptual pompous end has some visual poetry on it. However, it is my belief that it was achieved in ways that were more concerned with the beauty of the Lampedusa Sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and watering (it links it to myths, mystical, religious, archetypal, etc.) As with Crialese's talent. <br /> <br /> Valeria Golino is histrionic yesterday and is influenced in her performance as Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman of a humble and provincial background, she certainly has a fashionable wardrobe. Her flattering, sweaty blossoms and attractive, sun-kissed beach hairs could have won the pages of any Vogue summer edition. The fact that she was a "nutcase" could, in a way, be nothing more than a fashionable addition to her latest attitude and appearance. Golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent, natural childhood woman who has been misunderstood and suppressed by her backward society, was annoying and annoying, but left me unaware and indifferent at best. I agree with the London reviewer who wrote that mental illness is very badly served by cinema. In the course of the entire film, we never really get a sense of Grazia's disease and do not know what she is really wrong about (except that she is a tired stereotype of a "free spirit"). We do not know why she gave injections and should see a specialist in Milan. This generic way of writing mental illness is one of the most important narratives of the film's overall greed. <br /> <br /> Another relatively offensive aspect of Respiro is its characteristics. I struggled to see if this movie was supposed to be in the past or in the past. Since it was aimed at making even a welcome backward part of Italy (in comparison), it seems a dozen times less and more convenient primitive than it actually is. Again, it cites incomplete and complete lack of sincerity on Crialese's part. Some non-Italian viewers will relax the picturesque backwardness, the cliché of the possessive Italian man, as if in common. So eagerly they would be to visit my country as one culturally stranded in the 1950s (the question I would like to ask David Ferguson, the reviewer of Dallas, Texas is as follows: is your country's mentality stuck in the 1950s? No? OK, why should mine be?). Unfortunately, the aspect of Respiro is actually ridiculous and fine, even in the eyes of this Italian viewer. The subtly turbulent tension between Grazia and her eldest son was so tiring and predictable as Fabrizio Bentivoglio's sexist-but-loving male routine. I especially spoke to the scene in which Grazia and her husband and male friend were talking about a bottle of beer in a man-to-man villain, to her husband's embarrassment and dissatisfaction. According to this movie, it is not a woman's place to participate in a man's conversations. Oh, but our "sweet" "free spirit" is too good for this place and doesn't understand the oppressive, unwritten rules of the Lampedusa patriarchy! Not only does this scene show something so fake, it must be enough to discredit the entire film's credibility. It also gets the wrong end of the stick of the culture it seeks to portray, which clearly shows that it was written without a clear understanding of its location or its population. I would challenge someone who knows the current Italy to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> For a truly finished, contemporary Italian filmmaker, which I believe deserves to be listed under the magnitudes of Italy's glorious cinematic past (which unfortunately is not the shadow of its former self not!), look no further than Gianni Amelio - especially Lamerica, Così Ridevano and his latest, La Stella Che Non C'è. Unlike most contemporary Italian theater, unfortunately derived and stagnant, Amelio's is a fresh and independent creative voice. Despite my fearless review of Respiro, I'm now more than willing to believe that Crialese's latest Nuovomondo, now in Italian theater, will be a valuable one. So I'm looking to enjoy it, but it won't be terrifying to me if I don't (consider my feelings for Respiro!).
