This program was shown in an early morning time slot on SPACE, a cable sci-fi station. I'm surprised someone will pay or broadcast it; It is incredibly amateurish. <br /> <br /> The whole show is a series of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that look like a cupboard with a lot of circles attached to the wall. There is very little continuity between scenes, and no plot. A typical scene revolves around a lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long. The dialogue makes little sense and the special effects look like Photoshop filters. The actors are all adults, but I have seen literally high school games with better writing and sets. This program is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps every scene will work as an interstitial work; a stuffing between shows instead of ads. Tightening all the screens together makes the material's limitations extremely obvious.
