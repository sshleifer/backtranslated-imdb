I'm going to be about this and give it a 3 just because I live in Huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed. That said, this movie was pretty bad. It's as if they have scarcely started a script and the director just told the actors that they should be meaningful with each other, with lots of music playing about it. And Billy D. Williams seemed to be everywhere, but in this movie. It's just a mess. I think I can write a script better than the dislodge for this movie, and I'm not a writer. <br /> <br /> There's one thing I've seen through reviews and message boards. Everyone is under the impression that the film is about World War II and actually it started in the late 1950s / early 1960s. While the army has not yet been divorced, I am pretty sure any troops waiting on a train will still be divorced in a place like Huntsville, Al. If the start of the movie were in the 1940s, Billy D, Lesley Ann and Rae Dawn would have been in the 70's and 80's instead of their mid-50's or early 60's. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time unless you really like the actors, because the story isn't very interesting.
