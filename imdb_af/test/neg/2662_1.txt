Have you ever seen the movie "Marathon Man"? The sharing with the dentist? I'd rather do it with me than to sit back "Random Hearts". It was not only uninteresting or incompatible - it was terrible, painful and painful. At one point, I lost my heartfeltness. For the average, I might have seemed to sleep, but the other filmmakers consciously realized I was really out of the backroom. I thought I was going to die. When the movie finally ended (I think it was twelve o'clock, but I'm not sure), I got a joke "Thanks Jesus, It's Over!" Excluded, to which all other film people rejoiced. If I had to listen to Harrison Ford drones in that monotonous look for one second, I would have to be forced to look for something in my eye to draw my attention. It's 136 minutes of my life, I'll never come back.
