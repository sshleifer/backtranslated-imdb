After a meteoric land in Boston (actually somewhere in the Isle of Man), a terrible, captive alien monster is released and is released into a local girls' school that causes chaos and changes students into humble creatures. This movie is apparently a loose (and I leave loose) remake of the 1986 movie of the same name because it contains the same monster but another plot. Both films are terrible, but for the sake of the 1986 version, it was visible. It's not. Let's start with all the problems? The acting, especially the chief professor, was very, very bad. This film is supposed to be in Boston (we know this because the filmmakers had the ingenious idea of ​​putting 'Boston police' or 'Boston gas company' on everything), but everyone looks rather a bit of British accent. didn't try to use Boston accent, thank God. The writing is a big mistake. The best example of how stupid the writing is when it is determined that you can turn the zombie students back in humans by removing a necklace containing part of the meteorite. Is that what our brave heroes do? No, they walk around to shoot the zombie students. Nice. Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote / directed the poor 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly does not know how to fit his films. The movie is terribly boring in places. The lighting is terrible. The film looks cheap and thin. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of remarkable gore. 99% of the screen shots involve the creatures coming out of a dark corner and pulling someone away while we hear they are "shocked" in the distance. This convention has never worked well and certainly does not work here. The visual effects were AWFUL. The CG opening sequence in the space looked like it could be created on Religious Slide on Microsoft Slideshow! The "explosion" of the Gastenks at the end was just as terrible. Well, I consider myself a just critic, so I will give credit where credit is due - the creatures were pretty cool. Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth! <br /> <br /> To summarize the movie, "Breeders" is a horrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
