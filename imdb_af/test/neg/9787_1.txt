I'm sorry to see so many people giving positive reviews for this "movie". This movie has no reasoning factors. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic. I have a hard time understanding how someone can enjoy this movie, let alone his praise. The idea is terrible, some scenes linked to the plot (such as the continued love story, although the male romantic interest is a SHRUNKEN HEAD) is so bad that I wanted to do bodily harm while I watched it. The fact that there is a scene in which a cut head is flying under a girl's shirt so that he can "feel" her and likes it being enough reason for everyone involved in this movie. The link to West Side Story can only be a mockery as referring to such a big movie in such a terrible one is grounds alone to destroy all copies of this movie. To make a long story short, this movie is horrible in every way. And if I had my way, everyone who loves it should go straight to hell.
