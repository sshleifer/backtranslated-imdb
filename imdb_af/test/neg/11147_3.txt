The plot of this falls to Ah-Nuld versus Satan, and what I remember most about the movie is many explosions, gunfire, blood, noise, and let's not forget the flammable satanic urine. The story is nonsense, completely predictable, and so full of holes I can't take seriously. Join the "Rosemary's Baby" or "The Exorcist" if you want to see a very good devil movie and .... Well, I can't think of a good "Action" movie (probably because they are so far-in-between, so you're in that category yourself. This movie gets a 3 out of 10 rating from me for its camp value, and for a nice good performance by Gabriel Byrne as that old debbil Satan!
