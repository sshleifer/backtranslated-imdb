Unimpressive and extremely low budget sci-fi without any charm and appeal. Even the scenes related to the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other films with the same plot. It's just a bad rip-off of "Asteroid" (with Annabela Sciora) and "Deep Impact" (with Morgan Freeman). Mr. Hopper seems to be anxious to get away from this sensible and dull sci-fi entry. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2 (two). And don't say I'm not a good guy!
