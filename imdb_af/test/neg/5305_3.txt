Chile Palmer is tired of doing movies and wants to do some music success. As a half-mafioso half-expert negotiator he wants to rise in the music market. But knowing everyone is like him and making the good singer Linda Moon record a hit will be more difficult as expected. The first part is funny and filled with irony. This one falls into the easy jokes and has much less good moments. Only the two women (Uma and Milian) are decent in their part. Most of the film is done with a histrionic character, excessively exaggerated (a bit is OK, too much is disgusting) and the only one that one can save is the gay bodyguard, which is at least coherent, the rest is too much idiot. The most surprising thing is the fact that the movie is not boring, everything happens so fast and there are so many things that happen that you don't have time to get bored if you want to follow the movie. It can insult your intelligence (a lot!), And the movie is bad (yes!), But it is not boring.
