This short topic is a reminder of the Three Stooges '1942 movie, "What's the Matador?", About the boys' journey to Mexico and their fight against the fight. Although the original was made short during the Stooges peak period, it is not so memorable and I believe it is one of the more mediocre movies with Curly Howard. <br /> <br /> After confirming this, I believe that "Sappy Bullfighters" are just patheticly terrible, like all the other shorts with Joe Besser. Tired and Larry never had to hire Besser because his shiny, almost feminine character was totally wrong for the violent comedy of the Stooges. His 16 movies with Moe and Larry marked the nadir for the team, and those shorts are embarrassing to look at. This card was released in 1959 and was the team's swan song with Columbia. Maybe Besser was a good guy, but he was all wrong when the third stole. <br /> <br /> I won't review Besser shorts anymore because I'll just give the same negative review over and over. Do yourself a great favor and do not look after it. Rather try catching "In the Sweet Pie and Pie" or "Hi Pollo".
