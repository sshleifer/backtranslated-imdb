There are many reviews that describe this movie as the worst ever made. There are certainly many mistakes: a scruffy, rather boring and clumsy and sometimes paradoxical script, and the stock of B movie sound and 'special' effects. As noted, there are many glosses of plot, making _Cave Dwellers_ a fabric of fantasy film, especially when compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, this movie is not the worst movie ever. Most, if not all, including this review of these reviews are written by MSTK3 fans. Therefore, many of these reviews are pretty much summaries of the MSTK3 episode of _Cave Dwellers_. <br /> <br /> In the episode, Joel, Tom Servo and Crow mark the Mad Scientists that this was the worst movie ever sent to them. Of course, loyal fans took this quote and ran it with it. I accepted this movie - not in one way that one finds _Forrest Gump_ engaging - but in the effort to put this movie through some of the role-players. This film is also permeable without its MSTK3 treatment. This is because _Cave Dwellers_ does not take himself seriously, and it does not attempt to introduce a kind of fair theme to its viewers. For all the monster puppets, the medieval hang gliding, and continuity decay - this movie does not advertise more than it is, a level representation of a fairly flat genre. <br /> <br /> Likewise, I can't hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this is hate for Coleman Francis, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr., and so on. <br /> <br />
