The cookie cutter gets overtime in this obvious and irreversible love story. The plot, as it is, was done a trillion times, so there is no reason to tell it. Suffice to say that all 12-year-old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to face. Even the soundtrack is terrible! It's not that I don't like skating, though I don't, which I don't like, bad movies.
