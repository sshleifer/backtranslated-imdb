Like another reviewer, my wife bought this movie as part of a 20-film family suit. I think you could say that it was a decent TV movie for 1980, but it's super-predictable and the acting, except Robert Conrad, is generally subpar. The soccer screens are nothing special and look especially like a complement to the movie. The movie is now very dated, but a decent remake can probably make it into a good movie. But is it really necessary? I mean, how much "undercover team work together for the big game with the unhealthy guys" we really need? This is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you get it in the bargain, but a sports movie buffalo will miss it.
