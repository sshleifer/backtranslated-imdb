This movie is so mild! I tried to expect nothing from this movie, but it was still a great disappointment. The basic idea of ​​the story is interesting and potential. It could have been so much better. The characters are really simple, no depth. It is a pity that previously talented artists Tiina Lymi and Petteri Summanen did not make all the poorer characters better. The director does not only get the viewer emotionally involved in this piece of cr * p. <br /> <br /> And the sequel at the end of the movie. It's shocking! <br /> <br /> Why was there such a stupid and old solution to that situation? <br /> <br /> It's too much used element with even more horrible way to film it. Oh no!
