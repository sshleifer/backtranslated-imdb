From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, who wanders around the field during the day, thus developing all the clues that the play has used to the phenomenon of the fiery rebellious female character in the dramatic drama to speak. I knew I was in for something to kill me. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Joe Wright didn't just read the book, but to be under the pity that he was not filming Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy. of ways created by sparkling, delicate social interaction in the English drawing rooms, but a kind of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. So we were treated to every scene between Elisabeth and Darcy, which takes place outside the apparent reason, in improper rocky scenery and often in the rainfall. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and especially P&P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It's about different strategies to negotiate the stuttering of eighteenth-century society. It was completely ignored, so the Bennets' house was a turbulent, chaotic place where everyone was shouting, running around, leaving their underwear on chairs, and happy pigs were wandering through the house; the societal accents become rough country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance orgy; and everyone says exactly what they think without the slightest respect for honesty. <br /> <br /> The genius of Jane Austen lies in the exploration of the void created by a society in which no one says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming look, not restrained, and the tragic prejudice of her characters come from misunderstandings and miscommunication triggered by that speechless gap. So both Jane Austen's brilliance and the many factors that allow her plots to function - especially in this movie - have been completely erased. Subtle in general was nowhere in his film, it was in favor of an overwhelmed drama that had completely thrown into the material and performances. <br /> <br /> It was so clear to be a * serious * movie. The humor - which IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost completely suppressed in favor of all of these po-faced melodrama, and when admitted, it was so handled. Pride & Prejudice is a serious story that makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with humor, they are captured on it. You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, just leave the bare legs of the story and expect the themes to stay. Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heartfelt mystical-fauxbrow cinematography. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, adult, mature and prudent and clear person. Keira Knightley played the first half of the movie as a giggling giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an empty schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's white, her powerful verbal swapping, her distinctive feature of the fact that she was able to see with her own, her strength and calmness and laugh at everyone's folly, and her fantastic look was completely lost and replaced with .. What? Much giggle and stare in the distance? Rather than holding her head when everything was lost about her, she started crying and shouting at the slightest provocation - and not really outraged; no, it was petulante hissy fit. And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to maintain integrity and consideration while staying within the boundaries of society and retaining impeccable negligence, Knightley's Elizabeth did not relate to convention . Furthermore, she seemed to have thought that her barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth-century version of overalls had turned her mind over, just as enthusiastic and strong, so nothing in the character as it was written or the performance had to sustain it. A surprisingly impeccable and mere show. In what quest for gentleness and weakness, she is barely adapted by Matthew Macfayden. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet was poor, ineffective and permanently fertilized without the bad sense of humor and ironic promiscuity at the expense of human relations that Mr. Bennet makes it so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, especially because they were both foolish in a world of fools, and totally deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr. Bingley was no longer charitable and significant to the point of folly, but was played as a complete delay for cheap laughter and the woman Jane plays was so wildly inconsistent that she couldn't do anything about the character at all. The screenplay was very popular among hidden pieces of Jane Austen - rendered with remarkable clumsiness - and completely contemporary language that would not be in the modern romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Just getting the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the sadness.
