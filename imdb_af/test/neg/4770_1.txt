My review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself: <br /> <br /> 1. Plants that eat people are done HUNDREDS of times. It was used by Nintendo in everything from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime. It was used in very low-budget 50s, equivalent to the lowest of the Godzilla franchise. And it brings it to a completely different level of cheese with plants that speak. I didn't know anyone who ran out, but I know a lot of people who broke out in the parts of this movie. I was one of them. Does the horror genre deserve something that is no better than this stack of foldable shit? <br /> <br /> 2. The characters could easily be accidentally dropped from the Hostel or Wrong Turn of Wolf Creek or any other movie with collage children. Yet it is called "distinctive" if the movie takes hours of your time to tell you about cliches that had hundreds of characters before? Don't you want to have a movie ever, have characters who have not just forgotten bits of meat with legs? <br /> <br /> 3. It was not a pity. A man cut off his skin. Oh, me! (Not.) A man breaks his legs. Oh me! Gasp! (Not.) I showed such movies to my mom who hates everything with horror because it makes her sick, and she said, "I've seen PG movies worse than that! Why was it R? So, why was it graded? R <br /> <br /> 4. Here is the only plot that has the movie / book: drinking collage children, having sex, getting naked, crucible, bleeding, and eventually dying, which is perhaps the most typical example of a cheap, ungrateful horror movie, but people call this "mature" what the ...? <br /> <br /> 5. I don't think I've ever seen anything less original sense that I have a beautiful thought Looked at. <br /> <br /> Never wishing to sit there and wish the horror genre, easily the most diverse genre out there, would do something ... Well, diverse? Something truly original? br /> <br /> I just wish more horror movies would have real horror, not just cheap collage parties took film on a few wrinkles of false blood. <br /> <br /> 1/10
