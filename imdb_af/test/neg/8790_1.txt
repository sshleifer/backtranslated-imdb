This movie was obsessively obvious and predictable. The screens were poorly written and even worse. Following the terrible scenes, the horrible scripture was full of mindless and weak lines of thought. I will never imagine this movie for anyone who would have any sense to watch good movies. This movie was not just the same ideas as the Bachelor's and Baccalaureus, but it also contains many parts in which you would know what the next move and line would be without ever watching the movie. The decisive thing was good, but the actors played characters, frightening with more drama, then had to be used and said lines were that wanted you to change the channel quickly. As a note, please do not look at this movie.
