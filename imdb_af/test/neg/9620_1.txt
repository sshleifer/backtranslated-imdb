I saw this movie when it was in LA. I think I laughed two or three times. For the rest of the time, I was shocked at how ridiculous / poorly shot and poorly written it was. Kirby is actually the only saving grace in the film. I was disappointed with Larry Bagby's performance, which I usually find entertaining. If you like watching your friend's crappy homemade short films shot on their mother's 8mm video camera, there's a slight chance you can enjoy this movie. Then again part of what makes the movies fun is that it is your friends playing all the parts. You don't know these people, so you'll probably find it so boring and stupid like me. Dear Sir Nelson, go back to the film school for a while, work internally or a grip or a low level so you can see how things are done properly in film. Then look as long as you need to find a director of photography who knows what f. stop means make sure he has ND filter at hand. Then try again. Repeat as many times as needed.
