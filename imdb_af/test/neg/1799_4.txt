The film 'Heart of Darkness', based on the 1899 book by Joseph Conrad, is one with little or no detail and has an almost schizophrenic plot line. When you have read the book, you know that little of the important "story" scenes have been placed in the movie. In the book there is so much left to the imagination and I feel that this is one of the parts that make the book what it is. An example would be when Marlow spent timeless hours and days, even months waiting for rivets and the whole scene was left out of the movie. Again, if you read the book, you would know that this scene in the book is one that best describes the theme of futility. Finally, I feel the film was cut and dry. If you haven't read the book, "Heart of Darkness" (preferably the Norton Critical Edition), it's not enough to use the original text. How did it make the story it is today? <br /> <br / Don't speak your time in renting or buying the movie. But when you read the book, I think you would appreciate the book much more if you decided to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
