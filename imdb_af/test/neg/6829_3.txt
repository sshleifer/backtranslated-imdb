So we can say you are a producer, you have money, and you have Richard and Bruce Willis, so now everything you need is a script ... but why bother? See, this movie is really awful, the acting is pretty good, but the decisive thing is terrible gear and Willis did their best to play those characters they simply can't play. now, this movie has no plot, or rather, there is something trying to pass by: there is an average hit (Willis) that is coolly dangerous and sophisticated (actually he is not one of those things, but from a dialogue between the other characters, you intend to get this impression), so this hit is on a mission to kill someone. There is now an ex-IRA prisoner who is nice and nice and very kind to release the FBI from prison. so he will help them. so now the FBI is "investigating" to find this hit. The investigation consists of a series of unlikely information. As a random person lost his wallet, someone bought his name to buy a car. It's always right on the money. Since there is no real plot and the script is so crazy, you can't expect character development or tension. Instead of creating it through the story, they merely add some dramatic music that is not linked, which tells you that something is happening very dramatically, rather than actually creating something dramatic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it is a very bad movie, and a total waste of time that somehow has an incredibly high score for its level, probably due to the throw - and that is exactly where the producers are counting.
