When naive young Eddie Hatch, a window case at Savory's Department Store, falls for a Venus statue and kisses her, Venus goes out of her foot and gives Eddie more than he had bargained for. This creaking example of what Hollywood can do about a Broadway musical, managing to accentuate the boring story and eliminate most of the first-class songs. The goal was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment, while capitalizing on Ava Gardner's upward mobility to the superstars. Robert Walker and Eddie get lost in an ungrateful role. Eddie is not only naive, but dithering and indifferent. Gardner is beautiful, but the only thing that gives the movie any life is Olga San Juan as Eddie's loving but jealous girl friend, Tom Conway as Savory's eternal owner and Eve Arden as Savory's long-time, wise beating secretary. This is a role Arden can play in her sleep, and she is good at it. <br /> <br /> The musical opened on Broadway in 1943 and made Maria Martin a great time star. However, the only point of a musical is to have music. Since One Touch of Venus was meant to be a social satire of sorts, Kurt Weill composed, and Ogden Nash wrote the lyrics, with a series of attractive, witty songs and one masterpiece. Without the satire, or the clever songs of Martin (or an equivalent showstopper), the movie is just a bad comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death. <br /> <br /> Not only did the film makers throw out almost all the Weill / Nash songs, they included film director Ann Ronell to turn new lyrics into one of the surviving songs . sharp observation in love-dovey romance. Ronell was not a hack; she wrote Willow Weep for me. Wondering what she thought while replacing or changing Ogden Nash's clever work. <br /> <br /> The one bright spot in the movie is the Weill / Nash masterpiece. "Talking Low" is just such a love song as anyone ever wrote. It is one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments given by Eileen Wilson, who doubles Gardner. Dick Haymes adds a choir. <br /> <br /> As with Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a major music director, as well as composer and lyrical writer. Yours for a song: The Women of Tin Pan Alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business, including Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess. And for those who want to hear how little of the Weill / Nash score is recorded by the original Broadway cast, you can get the CD, 1943 Original Cast, or 1946 Original Cast. The music is linked to Lute Song, another Broadway show Martin played.
