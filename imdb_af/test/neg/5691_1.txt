In a world where people can live forever, you spend the whole movie that wants them to die. First, if you insist on watching this movie, you first have to do two things, but don't worry about missing a plot. They don't even talk for the first 70 minutes of an 87-minute movie. should now quickly move forward until the main chick dies, do not worry, even if you pay attention, you will not know why or how she died. Once you get to the "good part", you must dumb it. Oh, how would you know the good part, waiting for an elevator scene with two morons in space packs with WWII weapons. These weapons do not look so long until you realize that the first protagonist has a laser gun and a band of CO2 patterns. The only remnants of a plot take place between a glowing ball and a semi-hot chick that seems to have been attacked by Wolverine. After listening to the "plot", you wish they had gone back to not talking. Of the four people in this movie, none of them can function remotely, even a little, you would be better off working at a nursery theater. <br /> <br /> To comment on the special on special effects, just let me say "Wow", no really, you'll spend the whole movie. "Where did this movie's $ 1.8 million budget go?" Seriously it will leave you in the degree of ambiguity. The best "sets" are basically windows backgrounds wallpaper. The ships are basically kites, Wait some are trucks that look like whales. I've never heard so many words throughout my life. They have buttons on their wrist (big foot meters) that can put them in "fighting mode" and super round mode (make them super vague). This will drastically drain their power reserves, but they find bits of wires to chew to regain their power. The explosions were less impressive than my fourth of July, I just had sparklers. <br /> <br /> So the plot as far as I can figure, something like this "mom" is a spacecraft captain and goes to the desert. for a while, a rocket is killing. Then her daughter remembers 6,000 years in the future (no I don't exaggerate) reminiscent of her mother's memories through a capsule. Anyway, they shake another 10 minutes and then cause a big bang. Yes the same "Big Bang" that our solar system started. It is explained how she goes back in time or something, it doesn't matter, it happens. Role Credits The whole script was actually merciful on one sheet of paper, unless it actually described any of the terrifying scenes. <br /> <br /> After watching the credits, I laughed more than I did the whole movie. work created as a caterer "galactius sarcophagus" and then the special thanks to George Lucas are the best. <br /> <br /> I didn't really expect so much for a movie that I paid 99 cents, but seriously some body owe me this. Most frequently commented on the movie "I want my life back". You have to admire it, but try time and effort in this movie, but seriously, why?
