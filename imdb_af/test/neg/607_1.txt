I can't help but get totally irritated by this sitcom. It's as if they haven't even bothered, trying to write a good comedy, don't make jokes again and hope to stick it. The worst part is that it is all so unimportant and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Making things worse, the leading man, Kevin James, would have a permanent 'I'm so funny' would be tolerable if he only delivered in the comedy section, what he didn't Don't do it, he's lying there and doing nothing like a big unique baby. Which leads me to the relationship between the Heffernans' easiest and most ill-fated performance of a married couple on any TV show, truly headache that is invariably using petty Remini's entire show as if it were a violent task to even her own husband . Jerry Stiller, who knew the few laughs at the show, did a 100% repeat of his role as Frank Costanza in Seinfeld, but this time his tips mostly fit on water due to the inability of the central duo to joke. to recognize, even though it flew with them. . The episodes just float in a stream of nothing, their work adds nothing and their interaction is even worse. <br /> <br /> It's not even a waste of talent, there's no talent here, it's a laughless creative desert.
