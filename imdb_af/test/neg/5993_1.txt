The creature? Yes, it and the movie in which it stars. Hell would be infinitely more frightening if the damned was forced to see it forever. Six college students go to a convicted hospital to save money and end victims of an ancient monster who have to claim five victims before returning to the "shady world from which it came!" Apart from having great logic and coherence problems (plus being unfinished), this disaster has been tremendously acted, written, edited (by J.R. Bookwalter) and directed, and makeup FX is almost inconsistent. It's also much shorter than it demands (only 80 minutes), but I don't complain. This is the worst movie I saw of executive producer Charles Band's Full Moon productions and the boy is so BAD! <br /> <br /> Too late, I almost didn't bother with a review, but it got inexplicably good reviews here and I thought a diverse opinion was okay. Continue carefully!
