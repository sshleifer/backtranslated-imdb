If you are looking for the feel-good hit of summer, Dark Harvest 2 may be your ticket. The production values ​​of this movie are extremely high (seems to have been filmed with a Sony Handicam and edited with iMovie), especially the sound effects - they sound straight from a "Spooky Halloween Sounds" CD! The scarecrow from the cover, though not appearing in the movie and otherwise not relevant, is terribly realistic! From start to finish you will see if a man deliberately searches for his daughters through a pun, MAIZE! In the climate of the movie you will see, well ... you have to watch yourself. <br /> <br /> What I'm really trying to say here is not within 1,000 meters of this movie. I rented it because I thought it was a camping "Troll 2" funny, but it is not. I cried after watching this movie, because I realized I was spending money on it (and I got the $ 4 I spent to rent it). I fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on.
