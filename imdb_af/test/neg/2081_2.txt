Paul Mazursky dislikes this movie. The writing, direction, decisive and acting (with the exception of Victorio Gassman) are all out of the point. I remember the reviews from 20+ years ago were mediocre, but I thought it was still worth seeing. With notes such as Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who overworked most of his plays) and John Cassavetes, I understood much more. The music chosen for the film is shooting, the cut between New York and Greece is confusing, and the overall fit leaves much to be desired. Why Paul Mazursky had the need to update this story or add it to it is mysterious. This prediction from Prospero and his daughter takes very little of the import from the play and adds little more. In any case, the play is not one of Shakespeare's best, and it doesn't even look like a good decision. Unfortunately, nothing is recommended in this movie.
