I appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to portray the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel, and that the film helps viewers put themselves in Moses 'shoes and understand the tremendous burden placed on Moses' shoulders. As excited as I was to see this movie, I was very disappointed in the storyline. (I leave the videography, special effects and artistic ability in this review.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts of Biblical texts. One of the overarching principles of the Bible is that God led His people out of Egypt. He promised that He would take them to a land flowing with milk and honey. Not only did He give this promise, but He led His people into the pillar of cloud and a pillar of fire at night. He never left them; He was always visible to the Israelites. However, the film shows a God who is silent throughout the wilderness. This film has changed the essence and theme of the Biblical text and instead depicts God as a silent, cruel, disciplinary void. <br /> <br /> In addition, the depiction of Moses was just as wrong. Moses was known as a man of faith (why else would he be such a father figure to Israel in the Old and New Testament, even though Moses is known as a great faith man). However, the film shows him as a pragmatic, angry, insecure person despising the calling God has placed on his life. OK, I will allow the creative freedom for the filmmakers in the Exodus story ... but it's beyond creativity - it's heresy.
