This film takes many freedoms with the well-known historical facts. Just as Flynn was licking one after another, when he almost certainly would have used a competent sponge, it's one of the annoying things. Flynn was never tried for homicide or murder. He is not known for having caught his love for another man and is not known to have had a homosexual relationship with anyone and he did not come to Sydney on a shoe trip. He did not get his twopenny half-pen role in In the Wake of the Bounty, and this role did not change him into a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> It's just a mediocre movie where the name of Errol Flynn has just been tackled to sell more tickets and more videos.
