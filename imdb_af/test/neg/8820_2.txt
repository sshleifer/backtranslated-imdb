It is always interesting to see a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans. Experience has taught me that you should never generalize the taste of a fan in a genre. My expectations of this movie were much higher than I watched. <br /> <br /> Children should not play with Dead Things, a movie with a good intended plot that breaks out too many times to perform it. The whole idea of ​​a group of actors performing a resuscitation of dead bodies intrigued me. But everything has turned into cinematic chaos. The actors, who were largely competent and incredibly expressive, offered roles that did not maintain consistent characterization. Some of these characters go from ambivalence over the whole act to disregarding a cemetery, to outspoken criticism, back to ambivalence. It's one thing for characters to have a changing heart in the course of the movie; It's another to create an exaggerated, dynamic circular attitude that runs every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another contradictory element of this movie is the premise. Is the main characterizing that the ceremony is theatrical prank, or is he actually with dark spiritual forces raising the dead? Even with the aforementioned errors, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans as I believe only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and ignore the inconsistency of the plot. The scene where the dead go out of the grave is made by the superbly combined use of scenery and sound, and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to play the reanimated dead (even for a veteran zombie enthusiast). Current filmmakers need to learn from CSPWDT about using the right video and audio techniques in mood development. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are a zombie movie coaching like me, take the time to find and watch this movie. It's a fun watch.
