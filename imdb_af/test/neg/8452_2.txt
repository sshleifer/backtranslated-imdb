This is an example of a movie that has a lot of potential and is very poorly executed. I'm a fan of kids and thumb sucker and many other so-called teenage fear movies, but this one has knocked me off. <br /> <br /> Why is every white child in a rap who likes rap, it becomes one dimensional. the play was terrible but simple, as it mainly consisted of dropping a bomb to a bomb, just a bad bad movie if you'd like to see better movies: thumb sucker kids bully everyone <br /> <br /> Those I think are better, so I recommend one of them, you want to see a good "teen movie". I hope my comments are helpful and hope you hear future comments from me
