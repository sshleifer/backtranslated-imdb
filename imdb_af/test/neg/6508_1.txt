Perhaps it was the excessive weighting that Seagal gained. Or maybe it was the terrible play of Wayans in action. Or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two leading characters? These and other considerations lead me to conclude that Seagal never had to do this acting nightmare. True, the story line was good. Yet, as an avid follower of Seagal's career and background, his physical appearance was inconsistent with his genre of clean, pure, healthy Zen Buddhist life, especially in his screenings with Wayans. (Then again his real life relationship with the "nanny" was not inconsistent!) <br /> <br /> If Seagal wants to become a more diversified actor, he must do what a co-action figure in "Kindergarten Cop "done. ... Give humorous material or situations in writing where the actor has no choice but to respond in a comical way. Otherwise, leave the wise cracks and the useless attempts to get rid of humor while pursuing a serial killer. Seagal is not a natural humor type man. It didn't work. <br /> <br />
