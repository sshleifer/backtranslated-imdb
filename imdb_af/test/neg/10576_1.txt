I took 14 years to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely terrible! This movie should be evaluated at least R. I'm not so strict with movies, but it was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would be comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be rude, but it was WAY beyond crude. I sat there and watched (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what I really got) and I couldn't believe how rough it was sexually. I couldn't believe it would be good for a 13-year-old to read and view this content. I don't understand how the rating system works. ??
