It was so poor that I finally had to switch it off. I have never seen such a pathetic film. I love B-movies and look forward to more of the same, but are sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> It has the worst acting / plot / direction / writing, etc ... of anything I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone thinking or watching / buying / renting is not going there!
