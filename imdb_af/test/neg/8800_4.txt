"The man from Utah" opens with a song cookie that makes a guitar ride. So we are introduced to John Weston (John Wayne), heading to town and looking for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes), he is a bank robbery with his fancy shooting. He is hosting a deputy for the Dalton Valley Rodeo investigation. Apparently, the annual winners of the big prize money in the rodeo are a solid band of bad boys employed by Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who is also the lead role of the rodeo committee. Serious challengers for the rule of Barton's top henman Cheyenne Kent (Yakima Canutt) become seriously ill or dead. <br /> <br /> Even back in these 1930s, the Lone Star Westerns, John Wayne, had a charismatic presence that featured future strength. If there is nothing else, Wayne sees so young in these movies, this is a real surprise. The movie itself cuts with a fast fifty-three minute rhythm, much of it is picked up by stockpile recordings of roping, bulldog and Indian parade and dancing. In the decisive rodeo event, Weston avoids a poisoned needle found in the hall of "Dynamite", a previously unborn source, where he should leave Cheyenne. <br /> <br /> The end is no surprise, as Barton's bad boys leave the Rodeo events and go for the thirty thousand dollar pot prize money deposited in the local bank. But the officer and Weston are there to drop their plans and save the day for the Dalton Valley Rodeo. And as we've seen before in movies like Neath the Arizona Skies and Randy Rides Alone, Wayne's character closes the film with a beautiful young lady. This time, the adjudicator's daughter, Marjorie Carter (Polly Ann Young), was sitting for him throughout the film.
