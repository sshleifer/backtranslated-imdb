It was so bad, I want God to give me an extra two hours of life. I had to sit through it first. <br /> <br /> First, the play was uniformly bad. There was hardly a plot unless "Shaggy dog ​​story with a man in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog" scores. <br /> <br /> Editing was everywhere in the place, and the slow moons of the "gore" (red wheat syrup flying through the air - undoubtedly caught by a spoon) became annoying after the tenth time and succumb to the hundredth time. <br /> <br /> I love Michael Rooker. He did good work. It wasn't good. It was less than good. And with that I mean it is sucked. Hard. <br /> <br /> For this reason, don't look at this movie.
