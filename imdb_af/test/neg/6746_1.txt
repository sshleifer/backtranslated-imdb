I'm still trying to find out what the target of this movie was: 1) To show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant the police are (I can certainly add several adjectives here, but I think my point is clear) . 2) To show how a twisted rogue who doesn't know what he wants from himself can create chaos. 3) Or to show whether a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same and stupid question over and over to the criminal responses? 4) Or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material could be called another movie? <br /> <br /> It was one of those movies that somehow disappointed me. From the first 10 minutes I found out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie prize, and surprisingly enough? it was consistently consistent. It was stupid enough to be waiting to see how stupid it would end and end? and I was not disappointed there either. <br /> <br /> Was it a full time of the time? YES. What increases your demand ?? WHY HAVE I HID THIS? Well, I tried to fall asleep, and I thought it was a good candidate for this, but unfortunately I had too much coffee for that?
