Some people tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek performances, as it emphasizes character development and continuity and features a more complex background and ongoing sites. In some ways, this makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the display fails completely. <br /> <br /> The series begins as a soap opera at a space station, balancing two whole seasons of generic science fiction stories with banal subplots across the characters. The characters are a good bunch, and most of the actors are decent, but I think the authors have tried too hard to make them "normal". In "normal" they actually mean "ordinary and boring". <br /> <br /> At the end of Season Two we are introduced to the Dominion, which spins for a while before finally fighting with the good guys. in season five. This is the main "story arc" of the show, but it only takes a fraction of the whole series. We still get standalone episodes. Heroes are stranded on strange planets for forty minutes. And there's a terrible low-brow comedy with the greedy, goofy Ferengi. Many of the episodes are just boring, and some are unstable. <br /> <br /> The Dominion, DS9's main villains, is bent on galactic domination for the convenient reason they just don't like anyone. The whole war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Impressive pirate space fights appear at high frequency from season three, but are performed in ridiculously simple ways, such as two large fleet of super-advanced star-flying ships moving away. The authors of DS9 (including talented Ronald D. Moore, later of Battlestar Galactica's fame) fueled their monotonous performance by war, but at heart it is still a pedantic soap. <br /> <br /> DS9 remains a very frustrating experience. The ongoing story is too flat and obvious, and the characters never develop in interesting ways. "Babylon 5" and "Battlestar Galactica" both fulfilled the promise of DS9, and did much better. For Star Trek, stick to the original and the next generation.
