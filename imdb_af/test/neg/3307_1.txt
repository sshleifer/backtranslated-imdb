OK, so she doesn't have caller ID. If you get stalked, you get it! And no phone? When you get stalked, you get ONE if you're one of the few full-time working parents who is the head of the household who doesn't already own one. This mother gets a big NUTS in the parenting department. So her mother is in hospital and she decides that a shopping bag will help her. Just a silly movie. Glad I have Tivo and a FF button on the remote. And what's with the 10-line minimum, I just don't have to say so much about such a bad movie. I think I can ask why she likes opening packages she doesn't know who they come from. The boy didn't add much to the movie either. The police were also a big ol zero. Now go to the nearest Verizon and get the darn phone. @@
