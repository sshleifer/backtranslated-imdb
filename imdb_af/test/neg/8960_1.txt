This movie is terrible, I'm SORRY. I bought it to get Star Worms, and it actually expected it to be better after how disappointed I was in Star Worms. Oh, but joke, it seems the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is rubbish, not that there is really anyone, and the main character is a big stupid subject attacked by similar things or things. I can't really tell you. The special effects are so bad that you can't even see the warring dinosaurs, who do not wage war, but just stand and sort of their mouths, or whatever that is. The movie is a headache. It is very clear that the director is trying to establish a universe. Hahahahahahahaha ... Really, this movie is just horrific, even by Troma's standards. The only good thing I can say about this is that it has a Lloyd Kaufman intro, while trying again to look at something that is not suitable for consumption.
