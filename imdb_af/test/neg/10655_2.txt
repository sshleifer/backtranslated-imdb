The characterization in this movie is one of the worst things I've ever experienced. The dialogue is trite and clich√© to the point of extreme distraction. None of the problems faced by the characters have not been developed at all. They are simply surface details that are meant to get a point over without really making a credible dialogue to support that point. Also the imagination of the Chinese characters leaves a little to be desired. I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father teaches English flawlessly from a book (or it is implied in one scene) so that he can teach it to his daughter. Etc. <br /> <br /> The Smile Train is a good organization and it's a nice idea to make a passionate movie about the impact a program like this can have on children's lives, but overall I found it to be more frustrating than anything.
