Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers, as there is no real hard core sex. What do people with hard core sex mean? The kind of explicit hardcore sex seen in movies with Traci Lords and "Big" John Holmes? Well anyway, it's really bad movie, I doubt I've seen so many big names that were wasted in a movie. The script is very poor and relentless, directing and cinematography is terrible and editing is not there. It's really an absolutely horrible movie. You can see it ten times and still don't understand what it's about. The only memorable scene is the one where people are buried to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and covers them. Yes, you read it right, a movie in Roman times has a scene with a heady lawnmower! <br /> <br /> Trivia point. Many years ago, a pirate copy of THE THING (1982 version) did the rental rounds on my island and it was copied on a rental band of CALIGULA which means the pirate version of THE THING starts with the first few seconds of CALIGULA of the man. and woman walking through the forest begins the title sequence of the thing. These learned people who saw the pirate band believe the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter's 1982 film and was very confused about what it meant. Well, that's what you get for renting pirate videos. But after seeing the whole CALIGULA, I don't know what that means either
