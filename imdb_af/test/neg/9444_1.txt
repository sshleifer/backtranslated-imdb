Ed Wood, perhaps the worst filmmaker of all time has been so gracious, entertaining, inadvertently funny and therefore charming and innocent. <br /> <br /> James Lay, and his financial supporters (mother and father, out of the credits) in Dreamland created a movie just as badly done as any Ed Wood movie, but without any charm or innocence . Dreamland simply stinks, and the only good thing about this 90 minute waste of time is the knowledge that James Lay and his fellow perps will never make a picture again. <br /> <br /> I have taken the dramatic number of crew members to avoid being associated with this horrible picture. I'm sure the production manager, after watching the completed movie, asked to change his or her name into the credits to 'Donna Snartlebutt' and the accounting done by 'Brutus'. One might think 'Brutus' with its role of 5 dollar bills that the crew pays at the end of a shooting day. <br /> <br /> I will not mention the many technical issues with this pathetic little videotape, but I need a few commentaries comparing this snail to the work of David Lynch. You know you've become a real stinker when you signed your mother in IMDb and after such an astounding BS - no one except violent spiritual patients could ever miss a "dreamland". What a horrible thing against Mr Lynch and his work. <br /> <br /> Go back to the film school, Mr. Lay.
