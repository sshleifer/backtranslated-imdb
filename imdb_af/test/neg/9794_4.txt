After his widower dies in a horse accident, young Tom Burlinson (such as Jim Craig) was left to run his Australian "Snowy River" farm, with only a staggered professor Kirk Douglas (as Spur) to help. Times are difficult, so Mr. Burlinson is going to work for Mr. Douglas's rich, silver-haired farmer "Mr. Harrison" (also played by Kirk Douglas). When a big job comes up, the silver hair (parent?) Douglas Burlinson feels too young and inexperienced to go with; So, Burlinson stays behind, and falls in love with boss's daughter, Sigrid Thornton (like Jessica Harrison). <br /> <br /> The least satisfying aspect of director George Miller's "The Man from Snowy River" is a poor storyline. For example, the "Jessica is lost" sequence of events. The girl gets lost in one of those freak storms as he runs away. Her worried father encloses a possession of drunk men to get her after he predicted bad weather. Damsel "Jessica" rolls herself to the edge of a comfortable stone. Father and the suddenly sober men didn't look at Burlinson's farm. Hero Burlinson discovers the girl. After building a fire, he decided to kiss her. <br /> <br /> The "romance" is played too innocently for as obvious a beloved man and woman as Burlinson and me. Thornton. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "dark history" that is revealed before any mystery is built up. The main attraction, here, is the Australian beauty. <br /> <br /> **** The Man of Sneeur River (1982) George Miller ~ Tom Burlinson, Kirk Douglas, Sigrid Thornton
