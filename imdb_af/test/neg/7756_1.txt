My only regret is that you can't rate a movie on IMDb with a 0. A Cena ... will definitely earn it! At least. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER? * The movie starts with a bunch of people entering a crypt to wake up an ancient Vampire. When a man cuts himself and drops his blood and falls on the dry and dry body that is supposed to be a blood sugar, the metamorphosis takes place and the Vampire, in an ANIMATION-like effect (would you believe it!) , Quickly take on a more human form, just to reveal that he wears a tux and a tie! A BOW TIE, yes. Red, if my memory gives me justice! I tried to look at random scenes by hitting a bit, but it didn't get any better than the opening series. That's the point when I turned off the movie, cursing it because I made my hopes of seeing a Vampire movie. This is certainly not one unless you are 5 and can take such folly seriously. <br /> <br /> So, if you like Vampires and don't want you to feel rebellious or even disgusting, learn from my mistake and don't even try to see this garbage!
