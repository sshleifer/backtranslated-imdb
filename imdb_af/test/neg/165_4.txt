After I saw it, I concluded that it was probably a chick spot; Then I found out that Keira's mother wrote the script so it pretty much confirmed. However, a chick movie can appeal to men; this one doesn't look as if it's really not that good for women either (look at the bad cash contracts). One thing I believe both sexes agree is the stupidity of the scene, in the film, making an analogy between the pain of giving birth to the pain of a limb being amused without anesthesia. Although men do not undergo the pain of delivery, we understand that this is a painful process; Yet it is a natural pain while amputation is definitely not! Women understand it even better. I suspect a woman is trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste. In fact, many things in this movie are in very poor taste. Although movies are now known for poor taste, this one is really "exquisite" in that department. It could be a good movie showing the struggle of Dylan Thomas during World War II; and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to serve in the army. Keira's writing writer is trying to show how this sentiment was used against Dylan, but that's really it. Instead, we get a chick fly over how two young mothers join; sort of. In a way. Maybe. Somehow. The fact is that a soldier (the friend of the friend of Dylan's wife) is sent back to the house after serving in the battle; but it is unclear if the war ended !! Many things about this movie are also unclear; And although I have already said that, I'll do it again, as it seems to be the central motive of this mess.
