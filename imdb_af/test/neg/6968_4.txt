I recently joined Ed Wood Jr. watched autobiographical film Glen of Glenda for the first time after hearing so many years of it. Nothing I read or heard about this movie could prepare me for what I saw. It must be the most bizarre film ever made. Struggling buffaloes, women in slavery, Satan moving around and Bela Lugosi, as he could, "Preserve, Preserve .... pull the rope, pull the rope ...", it was completely insane. The play was horrific and the dialogue was inadvertently hilarious, exactly what you would expect from an Ed Wood movie. If I said it all so terribly, I have to give Wood Credit. He was far away from his time. You should remember that when this film was made, transvestites were not even publicly discussed, much less the subject of a movie. I read that Wood was a real life transvestite, and I'm sure this movie is based on his own experiences. It was sad to see that Bela Lugosi had to say the ridiculous lines he had to say to this movie, but it was kind of Ed Wood Jr. to at least Mr. Lugosi gave a play at once in Bela's life when he was particularly strange. and a drug addict and no one else in Hollywood would adhere to him. If you've never seen this movie, you should see it, especially if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr. is.
