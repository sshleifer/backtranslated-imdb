The topics offered are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban distribution, public transport, oil and gas exhaustion, energy dependency, alternative energy sources, etc. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is a pure and shameless propaganda piece. One point of view is presented, and then the viewer is hammered. You see that the same handful of 'experts' repeatedly make their case. The supposed "narrator" sounds like a news reporter, but eventually he even preaches the film's dogma. <br /> <br /> The dark side of the movie is not so much the gloomy message about oil not exhaustion, but the feeling that people in the movie are actually desirable for an after-oil society and all that it entails . They paint this picture of a utopian society where we all return to the independent local village model; Walk to work, buy locally, grow own food, and generally live an idyllic 19th-century lifestyle. For them, the after-oil society looks a great vision of a better world. It will definitely be the end of globalization and even better the end of Walmart. I will give them some credit for applying real math to expose the weaknesses of various overused alternative energy sources, including ethanol and hydrogen. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 stars because I appreciated the old footage and premise. .
