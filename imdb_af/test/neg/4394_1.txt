When I went to the video rental shop to get a movie, I saw this one and I immediately thought it would be funny. The photo made it look like a classic comedy type that includes teenagers (like road travel) who I thought would be worth watching. When I switched on the move, I was disappointed as the jokes were terrible and cheese. The only bit the director might have thought would be funny is that someone slides on a wet floor. It's not a joke and won't make people laugh. I actually considered turning this movie off halfway through. I was annoyed with this movie because it was just a waste of time and money lending it. There was not enough care to make this film and not enough time and work was put into it. I found the play too bad. The only time I laughed was with the extremely bad jokes or actions that really weren't funny !!!. I rate this movie a 1/10. I hope you found this comment helpful.
