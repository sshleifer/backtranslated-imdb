We thought it was one of the worst movies ever. I had to be willing to see the end. The romance was not credible; the characters were not developed; the love affair barely made sense; it was disliked; and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like the ADAMS FAMILY GOING ON HOLIDAY ... just creepy, gypsy and cheesy; and the out-of-town banks don't typically look like those on the surf; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it wasn't theirs. Also .. it wasn't realistic. Hurrricanes gives you enough knowledge to drop the shutters. <br /> <br /> The friend was also redundant; and does not match the story. What did the civil war do with the treason anyway? I also need to call the wardrobe ... did D. Lane in every scene need a scarf / pashmina / scarf? It was redundant. She looks good enough not to hide things; without making them obvious as with a light slack. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm worried about the impact on our landfills when everyone has to have this stupid, and I mean STUPID movie !!!! Don't fall for the hype on this one !!!!!! We have. Not even viewable.
