I can't believe the positive response to this movie. I had great expectations for it and was disappointed. In the first place, they use every cute racism clich√© in the book. It was so predictable. From the second moment, the young Latino man showed you that he would be a very good guy, because he looked like a gangster. Matt Dillon's character was played a million times, a cop that has hardened over the years and will see the end of the movie to some extent. The predictability almost ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on poor writing. The morale of the story was the computer to the maximum. There were some clever turns, but not nearly enough. The dialouge was sometimes embarrassing. It wasn't bad. I just can't believe this movie high score so far. It was somewhat entertaining, just a little offensive to the intelligence. I admire what this movie has been trying to achieve, but it has become very short.
