For anyone who cares to know something about the real Diane Arbus, or who appreciates psychological truth, this movie is uncomfortable. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless and upset person, but this film shows her as completely self-indulgent and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment. Kidman portrays her as vague and vague as she was someone who was inundated with her charism. The totally fictitious relationship that is central to the movie is quite incredible, and Robert Downey is really annoying in his smirk portraying someone who apparently thinks he's better than the rest of the world because of his misery. The film shows this encounter as the source of Arbus's interest in "freaks", which is a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century. The secret to me is why some of the talent and intelligence were involved in this movie in any way.
