Not one of Monogram's is better (not even here to entertain) Chan entries. The Shanghai Cobra has a lot to do with it, but in the end it's just too confusing and rubbish to be satisfying. The movie starts with a killer named the twice-hit Shanghai Cobra, somehow in a dinner scene. We have a guy, a girl and another guy who has some implied connection if one man dies in the streets. Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, because it is at the heart of the problems with this movie - it went on too much without any real and complete explanation. I didn't even go into the dinner cook that has some involvement and a jukebox that speaks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't look like a problem! All this is in the first five minutes or so. Then Chan will work in the movie for the government and fly out to help a friend. He also has the right to check a bank's shop of radium and is looking for a man who is related to what he hung in Shanghai years ago. I got involved with the plot, as said earlier. Toler is back as Chan. He always loves. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are also back. Both do good work and are quite amusing. But the intricate plot just didn't convince me, and much of the movie was watched with a strange, questioning look. It's not a bad movie, just a very interesting one, except for the most popular Chan fans.
