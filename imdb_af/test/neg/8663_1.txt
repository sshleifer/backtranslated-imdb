I agree with several of you that this movie was boring and boring. I rejected myself from the main character and the following actors / actresses who came in the scenes. The camera work was not pleasant. Accidental shots and shaky movie scenes made me very annoyed and I switched off the movie. I will spend my time reviewing the 1999 adaptation and hope that it will fit in with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Jane becomes; and pride and prejudice. I only have a few others to watch after these movies, but I believe they were done in good taste. The music was also out of place with the movie, and reminded me of another show I saw this year. It was Hex and a show from the BBC. I found it one night on the web. I had earlier in the first season, but the second season was dry and removed things that had to stay out of the clouds. I found the main male character that Henry was in this movie from his place. Maybe I don't like his way of speaking or shaping. Well, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they muted it and they wanted to look at the fashion of the era or the way homes are kept at the time. Once again I will look at the 1999 version and hope it is better and make Jane Austen right on her writing.
