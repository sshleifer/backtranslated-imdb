I really wish I had read everyone's review before I see the movie ... it was one of the most ominous movies I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes in the movie; I had to follow my instinct. The movie did not offer anything new or clever, it was boring and very clickable. I was surprised to find that it was aimed at a woman! The characters didn't represent any women I know, they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic and depressed and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired, poor makeup and hairstyle. It was recently compared to the Sex and the City movie; It wasn't even half as good. Suggest me, don't see this movie!
