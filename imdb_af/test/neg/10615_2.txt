There are movies that are leaders, and movies that are followers. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" was a leader. And here is one of his followers. <br /> <br /> "Party Camp" is about as changeable as any of its brothers who plunged the depths of the "Meatballs" (the original) so successfully. Of course, that one had Bill Murray. So what did the "Party Camp" have? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked that question. <br /> <br /> Jewel Sheperd made these breads her bread and butter and what side dish SHE offers! Even as an innocent (shiny, shiny) girl on a rich check (Cribb), she offers the boring steam she gives to all her parts. And yes, guys, she shows (if you know what I mean and I think you do). My gosh, that smile from her can melt through titanium. <br /> <br /> What? Oh yes, the movie. Nothing special like I said; Each inexpensive joke is aimed at and strikes (at about crossroads). And the eternal teen Jayne is good for a laugh or two. But instead of a sense of humor, there are only nudity, genitals, more, nudity, a soft core dream sequence, a sex symbol nurse simply for (CLOTH!) Learning purposes, even more nudity. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... Maybe it's a good idea. Bill Murray was NOT in this. <br /> <br /> Two stars. For Jewel, of course. Many "camp" but not much of a "party".
