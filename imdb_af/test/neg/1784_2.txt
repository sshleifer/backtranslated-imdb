If this film was made two years earlier, it could have been much better. But unfortunately, it was made in the decade that had no idea how a horror movie was supposed to look or act. When I first heard of this movie, people on IMDb classified it as the successor to Cheerleader Camp. Oh, how wrong were they? Yes, Betsy Russell was in there, but Uma Thurman wasn't sure. I'd like to find the person who started the entire follow-up rumor. I'm sure many of us will. I'm not going to give anything away, because honestly I can't remember how this movie ends! I'm just going to tell you that you want to see a real jumble movie ... The burning star Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter and the Fast Times geek at Ridgemont High. A Word to the Wise - Just because a horror movie has the title camp in it doesn't mean it's worth looking at. Oh, and another thing, ANY HORROR FLICK MADE IN THE EARLY TO THE CENTER 90'S ALSO ABOUT OVERWATER!
