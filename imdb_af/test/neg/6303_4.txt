Shaggy, friendly but frustrating film has the same old message: if you want to make it in this world, imaginative is not enough, you have to live in your community in society and that means living through the (heterosexual) rules that control us. Australia's Drag Queen comedy drama is a mostly optimistic trip of three male friends who were traveling over the Outback in their pink bus, Priscilla. Although not a formula film per se, there is the mandatory "road movie" sequence (bonding by the bonfire, under the redheads, etc.). Author-director Stephan Elliott follows every possible moment with a bit of humor and sympathy, but there are puzzles in his story, a horrible subplot about a gay man's relationship with his ex-wife and estranged pre-teen son. who is comfortable - and shows the child - with his lifestyle), and a third act with no energy whatsoever. It has a little wrong transvestite humor and a reasonable spell, but a manuscript that cut off along the way. ** of ***
