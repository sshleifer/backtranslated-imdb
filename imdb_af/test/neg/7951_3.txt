Have you ever watched a movie, when it came to your conclusion, did your left consider what in the world it's about? Well, say hello to "Scream, Baby, Scream". It's not that the story's complex or something is, it's just that it spells out in three completely different modes ... 1. A fun 60's drug movie ... 2. A lot of overplayed soap opera ... and 3. A horror flick (with very little to "scream" over). To my surprise, I found out that it was written by one of my all-time favorites, Larry Cohen. Well, I think even the best should be learned through trial and error. <br /> <br /> Play much like something from H. Lewis (only with less fx), this "bad" movie has it perks. For most of the short rally there is a nice cool jazz score to be heard, and there are a few memorable scenes. One of those is where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long ride. to the zoo. The camera tricks the director uses to indicate their hallucinatory condition are simply delayed, but amusing. Trust me when I tell you, there's no need to run out of the house to catch this one!
