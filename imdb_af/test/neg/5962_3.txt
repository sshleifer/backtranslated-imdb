This is a good example of what a good movie and a good idea could have been, but it was really bad in the process. I was mainly requested to get it because of the DVD cover, dumb me, but I did anyway and I was blown away, in a bad way. This movie is mainly about El Chupacabra causing Los Angeles destruction and it is up to a local animal college and writer to save the day, before two corrupt policemen and two evil scientists bring them down. The main reason I didn't enjoy this movie was because of great continuity errors that were hard to notice. Along with some bad acting, good lighting and nothing scary, this movie didn't hit me that much. But compared to other Chupacabra movies, this one is definitely the cards as well. For the first time, the continuity in this movie is over and I mean the shoulders and the trench. There were so many points where the characters said or did something and then in the next shot, they didn't do it or the change never happened. Case in point: the main character has a gun, the Chupacabra attacks, he swears from nowhere a flair and leads off and the gun is missing. The girl walks while defending with the mysterious flair and she has no gun, then the main character with the girl is going and has the gun. Where did the flair come from and what happened to the gun. The time of day is screwed. One minute it is sunrise and you can still see the sun and then it looks like midnight the next moment. There were a few plot holes as in, why was the Chupacabra there, what did the scientists do, what happened to the man and why did he shoot the animal and still live? These things got me off the hook and none of the questions were answered. <br /> <br /> Following on the list is the play. Boy, it was wood and bad. The main character Navarro, played by Eric Algeria, seems a bit too calming and pointed to find out what a few dogs have killed and when a tragedy strikes, his emotion just wasn't there. Elina Madison, who played Starlina, did a pretty poor job. She was the author of a bestseller book about the Chupacabra and she just didn't appear in her role or her performance. Her acting was kind of laughing and poor. Even for a writer, she knows too much about the thing and knows how to turn off a high security defense system in a hidden lab. Tony Criss was okay, but he was a little calm for some of the things going on. The movie reminds me of a bad reenactment to murder for a crime settlement show, where actors and actresses aren't really committed to their work. <br /> <br /> I rarely get these anal when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie I can't help but be hard at lighting. This took me out of the movie several times because the lighting was so poorly directed. There were times when they wanted to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more comic bookish, but it went back. The worse part is at night when it is black, but the scene is so crowded with light, it looks like its day. They keep switching from high intensity light to gentle light for random scenes, and the lights seem so bright that the actors are screaming. It should not be so bright that there are dark shadows at night. During the sunset, when the lighting was perfect, it was the only time the light was good, unlike it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no scare in this movie. There was only one time where I jumped but other than that, it wasn't scary. There were points where it might have been frightening, but it was so damn out, you could see the Chupacabra approaching the man, but if it was dark, it would have been better. Even the creature design for the Chupacabra was poor, it looked good, but it was a short man or kid in a jump suit. They did not hide his face; They showed him with no sense of mystery or any mysterious appearance. There was a fair amount of gore, but it was unreal. This movie was just not scary, that's all. <br /> <br /> Overall, they averaged a large South American legend in a bloodthirsty human ether, which is not the Chupacabra. In fact, it was scared of people and it just killed goats, sheep, dogs and deer because it was said to have hated people's scent. But how would the story be? For this reason I did not enjoy this movie, but I will give them credit for trying to make a good movie with good intentions. I would not recommend this movie to any horror fan, but if you like indie or B movies, you have to clear it out. Also, if you are easily tempted by the cult classics, you want to enjoy this movie. I didn't do it, I won't see it again, but somehow, I enjoy these kind of movies just to see what the other side of Hollywood is.
