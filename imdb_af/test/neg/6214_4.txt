The movie is not bad in itself ... until you see the original movie Hitch (2005), featuring Will Smith's lead. The movie is a straightforward copy with even the dialogue for most of the movie, just translating from English to Hindi! The plot in the original was stiffly executed. The Hindi version fails to let the viewers be interested. David Dhawan's over-the-top comedy seems to have gone overboard, shouting with Govinda at all times hysterically ... sometimes more time is spent understanding the reason for it than the plot. :) <br /> <br /> Knowing English, I assume you know you read it, sees the Hollywood original. At least look at "Hitch" if you looked at Partner to compare. This is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work, which I am saddened, is scandalized by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
