Well, it's stripped my nerves, they're right. I only hired this movie in the 80's when my friend opened a video store that wore every scarce movie he could find. He also wore the shock, horror and exploitation movies he could dig, and I almost left them all. Previously I saw Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs, and Gore's wizard. They were horrific (especially for the period), and Gore's wizard became quite nasty. The Gore-Gore Girls, however, was the one I remember as the most disgusting gory. <br /> <br /> I rented it a little bit ago on DVD because I wanted to hear the comment and thought it might have some cool dancing and clothes. I forgot that it was made in the early 70's, so fashion has gone downhill. I also realized it was a movie I didn't need more than once. It had amusing parts but gaaaah! It was much more disgusting than I remembered. I laughed a lot at filming, but a few times I just grew too big and had to look away. It was not a good choice of the movie to make DVD on both sharp and tidy with better sound and image quality. The comments are amusing in parts and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6100.00). Perhaps HG Lewis didn't feel good the day, but he generally got tired and also hurt the nerve when Something Wild's interviewer compared. him to Ed Wood Jr. Sorry, but you're not exactly Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> The extremely thin plot is about a series of topless go-go dancers in comic strips. A cute reporter and a very unattractive private detective team (kind of - he doesn't seem to stand her) to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman owns a strip club. A lot of very ugly murders happen. <br /> <br /> I'm going to apologize in advance because I don't want to sound like I need to lift up, but this movie was so misogynistic that it p *** Show me more than "Company of Men 'out. Mainly because the main characters and the director's extreme dislike women - and the audience - just from every frame harvest. It's not just the murders. The highly unattractive detective goes out of his way to treat the female reporter like dog litter at any occasion, for no reason. (He's not really a threat to George Clooney as I said) and she still follows him like a puppy. She falls to a terribly mutilated body and he looks uneasy about her and throws her cold soda out of her eyes on her face to wake her. Later he called on the police to report the crime. "No ... Not in a hurry ... She just had a lost face." This man is the hero. You can imagine how the other characters feel about women. I can continue, but you get the idea. Please note that I make this movie sound far more politically correct (and much more fun) than it actually is. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are the type of actors you pray, will never remove their clothes- Not too easy on the eyes, so don't watch the movie just to see the nudity unless you not too picky. The go-go dancers look like they desperately want the scene to end, so they can get their $ 10 or whatever the rate HG has been paying and getting their drug solution. OK, it's not that bad, there was one dancer who seemed to be a pro and another cool dancer with a big afro who didn't look as miserable as the rest, but still not too excited . The only slightly entertaining thing was a few moments of brief inadvertent humor, such as when a policeman in charge shouts at a murder scene: "Get out of here before I arrested you!" Not to a bunch of reporters, but to another policeman they go quietly about their work (they mumble and walk away). Henny Youngman, however, is funny, but as Lewis says, he has said his lines so quickly that they almost need subtitles (he is sure he tried to get up all day so he could get paid and hell could get out of there, he does not seem to be naked to look naked chicks.) <br /> <br /> Just to see morbid curiosity. For the movie movie era, it was probably the most horrible thing on film at the time - or if you're really a big HG Lewis fan, and find him or a low-budget movie-making person fascinating . Otherwise, if you've seen it once, you've seen it and you can continue with other disgusting, but much more entertaining, low-budget movies from the early 70's. This movie doesn't even come close, says "Pink Flamingos" when it comes to the ship-the-popcorn factor. If you've never seen a HG Lewis movie, I recommend you try 'Blood Feast' first, but you'll have a much better time. <br /> <br />
