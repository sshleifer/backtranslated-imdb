There are so many holes in the plot, it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for it and just threw it together. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I saw him in two movies. Obviously he was thrown as the loving father, mad scientist, vampire. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised he ended up in the genre. This is the typical, "I'll create monsters that can be used to fight as an army." By transferring wolf blood (or being coyote) to his hired hand, he turns into a werewolf. Glen Strange, who was one of Karloff's successor as the Frankenstein monster, plays the friendly, lovely hired man who is being victimized because he trusts the crazy doctor. Initially, the scientific can control when Petro (his name) can be transformed. But, like the invisible man, he suddenly begins to march and becomes accountable. There is a little love story from the daughter and a reporter with a kind of high voice (Golly Miss Brooks). She wants to leave, but her father, the doctor, won't allow it. He is also powered by a group of his peers who have previously mocked his research and now he will have satisfaction. The way he plans to give or kill them is pretty far-fetched and depends a lot on Petro and the guys are waiting around to be attacked. It's not a very good movie. The strong point is the atmosphere of the forest, as people and monsters sneak around the Spanish moss. Again, the townspeople are a lot of morons, who seem to escape from a bad western. One thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and it seems unusual for a movie of this era. There is also a pipe that smokes old lady who knows about weather waves, but no one listens to her.
