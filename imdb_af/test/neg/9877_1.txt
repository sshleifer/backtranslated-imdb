I'm going to talk about two different perspectives on this movie here. First, the view of whether someone is watching the film and never reading and reading the book. The second is from someone who has it. <br /> <br /> (Movie without book) From a movie point, it was a good movie. Nowhere near as good as one of the underworld, but much better than Ultraviolet. And I'm not just talking about plot line. The visual effects were in many parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice. The characters have very little development and Vivian didn't even really care that her "love" is killing her species. Some of the other characters could have had more airtime, like The Five. The plot was similar to Underworld for my taste. <br /> <br /> (Movie WITH book) Like many others, apart from the title, character names and a few small parts, the movie and the book are nothing alike. In the movie Gabriel was much older and was the father of Rafe (so Astrid was once his partner). In the book, Gab was about 24, never paired with anyone, as wolves are for life (Astrid tries to win his love) and Astrid was Ulf's mother, not Rafe. Another important thing is the place. The book took place in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia, is very different. The film is what Vivian's fault has and her whole family has been killed by it. In the book, the original leader of The Five, called Axel, killed a girl from their school. Hunters traced the wolves and killed many of them (including Viv's father) and forced them to move. Also, Viv's mother, Esme, was an important character. <br /> <br /> One thing from the book that would make the movie better would have been the "bitch's dance". For those who don't know, it's the ordeal where all the bitches (women of the pack) are fighting to see who is the one to be the tailor of the new leader (since earlier there was a fight for the men) . Vivian won it and tried to save her Astrid's mother (who is a terrible woman in the book) and had to work with Gab. There was no prophecy! Anyway, if you read the book and you liked the book, I strongly suggest that this movie not be seen.
