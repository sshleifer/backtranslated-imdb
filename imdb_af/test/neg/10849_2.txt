As I mentioned in other comments, I have since become a big fan of David Bradley since I saw him in "American Ninja 3". The man is great at doing martial arts, has some kind of charisma and is a cool boyfriend on the screen. Unfortunately, since his debut he went to the DTV department and stayed at the TV movie until 2001 where he apparently stopped making movies. Now, one thing looks at Cyborg Cop or Hard Justice, which is crappy clich√©d movies, but actually nice to watch (it's a pity that it's bad if it has any meaning), but another thing looks like a tasteless boredom like Total Reality. I mean, this and Crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse this man ever did. I wouldn't even recommend it, even to the biggest Bradly hardcore fans. If I knew that, and Crisis would be so crazy, I would not have spent the 3 or 4 euros they would cost me. Total reality is just as boring as Crisis, though funny, starts promising. A group of military prisoners in the future will have the opportunity to prevent a kind of disaster in the past (I'm sorry, I didn't pay much attention to this horror) and they only have 24 hours to get back or something like it. If they do not, they are stranded there forever. The poor director who surrenders, tries a few humorous (?) Cliches like the inmates arriving on Earth and not knowing what a truck is like (wow, hilarious ...). The movie follows on with David Bradley who works with an Earth girl for the rest of the movie. It made me so much so that I had to force myself to use it like 3 or 4 installments to use at least the 4 or 5 euros it cost me. It's every time I tried to fall asleep. And if you have a movie with Dawid Bradley with only one crazy 10 second fighting tones in it, then it's the final touch that will help you throw off a hundred foot cliff so it can never be seen again. I wish I could meet the "director" of this stack of poo on the street and I swear to God that I would ask him for 5 euros back. I would also like to meet David Bradley asking him why he chose in God's name to die in this poor apology for a movie. Don't even struggle with this movie, I mean it from the bottom of my heart, don't rent it and don't buy it specially.
