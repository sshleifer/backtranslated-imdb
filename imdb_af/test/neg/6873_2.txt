Here's another movie with dysfunctional main characters that is totally amoral and yet we need to root for them? Not me. No character in this movie was worth a damn. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays car salesman Joey O'Brien. The man has no class, a loser in all moral sense and a man who thinks he can get out of his head. Ken Williams' ability to speak, he was good at this role. The women in his life also make him pay. Some of them are not much better than him. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins is playing a similar low life that begins with the takeover of the movie when he is full of explosives in the car dealership's showroom, including his wife, hostage. Robbins, as usual for him, plays a disturbed and ridiculous character. I think these utility cases roll easily into these two actors. Well, I wonder why. <br /> <br /> There is so much screaming and screaming in the movie that it will give your headache. Combine the two screamers with Fran Drescher's nose voice and you really have an annoying over-the-top role. It's like listening an hour and a half on a blackboard on a blackboard. It's comedy? No, it's lame. <br /> <br /> In fact, for a Robin Williams movie just to give up a dozen reviews here, tell something. It's far from his best movie.
