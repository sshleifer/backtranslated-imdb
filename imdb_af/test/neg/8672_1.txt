Please ... if someone gets the chance to read it before watching the movie, if it can be called, don't remember ... waste your time !! I also watched this movie after finishing the book and was seriously disappointed. The main character is basically a new Fanny, as she never shows an agreement with the book. She is so lively and laughs all the time. ... if there was one thing the author wanted to say, it was that she was a very shy, introverted character .... please !!!!! All the most important parts of the story, which are supposed to convey to the heavy end, are simply not taken into account ... and the rest made up !!! I think one is better off with the time to read a bit of the real novel or simply do nothing.
