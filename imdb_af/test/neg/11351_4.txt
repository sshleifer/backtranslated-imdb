An incident on and off a mountain road is Don Coscarelli's entry into Mick Garris's Masters of Horror series. Coscarelli is known for the man behind such cult-precious stones as the Phantasm series and the irresistible alien Bubba Ho-Tep; but he doesn't bring one of the features that made the movies good for this TV episode. The plot is a run of the mill following the routine idea of ​​an innocent being pursued by a madman. This time it is a young woman driving down a mountain road. After a head on the accident, she finds herself trapped by a white confronted maniac. The whole chase is really ridiculous, with the young lady every time turning to hides; just for the maniac to show up seconds later, and it is cut with scenes that show her with her husband - just happening with a wealth of information on how to escape bad killers; with lines like "expect the unexpected". The only real highlight for me was the presence of Phantasm's Tall Man, Angus Scrimm. Coscarelli tries his best to implement as many horror images as possible; with things like a dotted baby's dead body - but because it's so stupid, it's hard to take this piece seriously. This is the first episode in the series, and the first I saw; I really hope they get better.
