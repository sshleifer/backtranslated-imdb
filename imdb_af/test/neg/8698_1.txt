This movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time. In the first 10 minutes I was very annoyed because I am familiar with the Torah version of the story (5 books of mosses) ... but I decided to see it to appreciate and see my money how bad it sucked. Well, it sucked. More than I thought it would. First and foremost can start with the writing and characters the skeleton that forms the body of a movie. If you study at least Torah, you will see that the story is all wrong. Here are some of the terrible mistakes: Moses doesn't do slavery because he was in the tribe of Levi. Mosses did not kill anyone on the mountain Sinai. But yet the movie shows that mosses are beaten and aaron and kill themselves ... actually not! If mosses talk to the burning bush, he knows who he is talking to, but the movie makes mosses like an idiot, he says he doesn't know who the gd is in the bush. Either way, Aaron knelt his brother well, regardless of their distance growing up, Aaron was known for his calm, compound peaceful nature, yet he was portrayed in this movie as angry and arrogant. Moses looks like Jesus in this movie. How ridiculous .... Pharoah, the real one was actually ugly that sat on a pyramid of stairs so he could grow bigger if he and Moses were over 10 feet and in the movie Pharoah was longer than he and he was hot with light eyes! The wife of Am Israel (nation of Israel) meant themselves with their hair and bodies and they did not sing or sing before men, they did not participate in the golden calf, so they definitely did not publicly dance wouldn't show the movie. Moses' wife, Tzipora, was married to mosses and she covered herself so humbly as they were, not holding hands or hands. Batia Pharoahs daughter (the one who assumes him and saves him from the water) is really overthrown in Judaism and would be proud of Moses when he said he was going to flee his people. time with two sets of tablets ... with gibberish writing on it. Write the script in the holy language, Hebrew or English, and do not put two sets on one tablet. Bottom line is the movie is terribly written, targeted and the characters are all wrong. Basically, everything is wrong about the movie ... The guy is also inaccurate, but it's more realistic, and their actors are credible. Is Israel Chai!
