It's an emperor's new clothes situation. Someone has to say, "It's not a funny and original (etc.) Film, it's an inferior movie. Don't waste your money on it." The movie is trashy, and the people in it are embarrassing inferior rubbish trailer. They are all too realistic just themselves. They have no lines, they do not act. The American Dream is not to create non-quality films or anything else slim and of no quality; It is to achieve something of quality and therefore success. Only people who are desperate to praise a film not made in Hollywood (it can't be made in Hollywood, can it?) Try to apply any kind of quality to this movie. It's worse than Ed Woods, another movie about a film maker without standards. These movies shouldn't be made and you shouldn't see 'American Movie'.
