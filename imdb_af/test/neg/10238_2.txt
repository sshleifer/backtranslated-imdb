Sammi Cheng & Andy Lau are back in their 3rd movie. JANUARY EARN MORE - Directed by HK's actor Johnnie To ... fans of To's action films will be disappointed to find that no single gun was used in filming. In addition, fans of Cheng & Lau's previous films, NEEDS YOU & LOVE ON A DIET, will be disappointed to find that YESTERDAY is not as close as funny or engaging. <br /> <br /> Mr. & Mrs. To (Lau & Cheng) is a divorced couple ... both affluent HK citizens ... both incredible ... both were just professional thieves - "two birds of the same feather" .... A few years earlier they separated on an inability to get the middle ground to divide the spoil. Now she goes back ... to the son of a rich heir - a total mom's son (Carl Ng) through and through ... The golden mother-in-law (Jenny Woo) is suspicious of Mrs. To's past and she thinks she's only married to her son for the family jewels - the heir's valuable ruby ​​necklace ... <br /> <br /> The necklace is stolen ... is it Mrs. To the materialistic eye that gets the best of her? ... or is it her ex-husband, Mr. Two ways to sabotage marriage to steal the gems for themselves? .. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about two pple that fall in love or revive a love ... it's about two pple that has always been in love but somehow it foolish to realize it ... they make pride and greed over them ... <br /> <br /> Overall: YESTERDAY is one part hijacker / heist movie and one part pays tribute to classic Hollywood glamor of its golden years - that is, Cary Grant & Grace Kelly's to get a deaf ... Johnnie Too heavy on Cheng / Lau's chemistry from their previous films ... hope Cheng / Lau's tremendous popularity and fan base justifies this third film will be. I think Sammi Cheng is one of the most beautiful / charming entertainers who work t'day. . & Lau is definitely the Tom Cruise of Asian cinema ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed their first two movies and the Cheng / Lau mating comparable to those classic Hollywood couples of the 40's and 50's. but YESTERDAY falls short of expectations ... horrible writing, ridiculous situations, product placements in general, and all the subplots and supporting characters were unnecessary ... come to think ... this movie was unnecessary ... unless you just love celebrity look ...
