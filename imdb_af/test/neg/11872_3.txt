The explosion is in Bucharest, where a kind of ex-government agent, named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes), a weapon dealer, Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), was found. However, it is wrong and Dimitru finds out that Sonni is working for the US government. . After a big shootout, most of Dimitru's men were murdered by Sonni, who is unhappy with the local Rumse police force. The man, Flint (Michael Brandon), decides to return Sonni to the US while protecting a woman named Nadia. Cominski (Silvia Colloca) also sent back to the US. However, it appears that Nadia is owned by Dimitru and his boss Jozef soccer (Tim Dutton) who needs her to complete a nerve gas bomb deal they intend to kill in Washington and kill millions of people to make. <br /> <br /> This American and Romanian co-production was directed by Po-Chih Leong & The Detonator. This further confirms any doubt that Wesely Snipes joined the rolled-up action movie star club rejected for generic action films in Eastern European places, Yep Snipes joined such locations as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer and Chuck Norris. I give Snipes a little credit, as he held a little longer than the rest with the excellent Blade: Trinity (2004), still fresh in a lot of filmmaker's mind. Every movie he made is straight to DVD. but it had to happen sooner or later, as many of the names I mentioned lived Snipes the reputation of some great movies. Looking at his career, he is the good in the worse movies. Like the recent films by JCVD ​​& Seagal, the Detonator is very terrible. Martin Wheeler's screenplay is as predictable, boring and by-the-numbers as anything out there. The Detonator is the kind of movie you expect to see on an obscure cable TV channel at 2am in the morning. The Detonator is bell-shaped cliches, Snipes are forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman. In the first place they keep apart, but eventually they fall in love. His closest friend to the CIA seems to be a traitor while he seems to be the unpleasantness of the book boss who doesn't like anyone. Snipes character is allowed to walk around in Bucharest, to kill and blow people, it doesn't matter and he is never arrested. The action is boring and forgotten, the bad man has a soccer club, so there are many annoying soccer terminology and there are not even funny one-liners. <br /> <br /> Director Leong does nothing to live things. The Detonator looks cheap with a car hunt in which the two cars never reach the 30mph point. OK, the action scenes are fairly well performed, but they are little and far between and completely forgotten in a bad manhunt on Snipes & misses. In return, Snipes snipe a bad man and make him a blow. There is a half decent car accident and explosion, but very little else. The Detonator seems to have been shot in a Romanian football stadium. I think I'd rather watch the game for 90 minutes rather than this movie. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 15 million, the Detonator is pretty well made, but not so much. Set & filmed in Bucharest in Romania. The acting is not that good, Snipes just doesn't look more important and feels like he's just there for the money I'm not at all guilty of. <br /> <br /> The Detonator is another poor clichéd action movie starring a is actor and in Eastern Europe. Why does Sony keep things going? Not recommended, there is much better action rate out there.
