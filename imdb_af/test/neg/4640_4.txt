Another day - this movie requires you to see it another day to understand it. I thoroughly enjoy Shannen Doherty and I was very interesting to see how well Julian McMahon and Shannen appeared along the roles they played in Charmed. I can surprise the acting skills throughout the film, even the direction - but the plot ... what happened? I have a loss for words because I'm still confused. I have to remain true to the actors who really did a good job because of the insanity of the plot. I also recommend that you look at it, because I have looked at it in spite of the plot.
