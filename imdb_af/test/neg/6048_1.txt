Just saw it ... the story, the plot, the writing absolutely no sense !! His Samvise is the brave part 2 (without the RING), his characters point out of the blue (without reason), his Hercules hated by everyone (no one knows why), his Leelee Sobiesky shows her true talents (two of them), she crazy special effects, these are some good actors wasting their talents (did I call Leelee's two talents?) ... should I say more? THIS IS ONLY LEGAL, even for NBC TV standards !!! It's just the lowest .... what a waste! By the way, how can you give people this mini-series so many stars? It's outside me! .... Shame on you! Must make 10 lines, so this is my last word: avoid, avoid, if you are considering buying it!
