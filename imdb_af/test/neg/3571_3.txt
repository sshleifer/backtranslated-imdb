When writing this review I have problems trying to think about what to write. Nothing much happens in this movie. The storyline is a South Asian woman who falls for an English Londoner. The problem is he and his friends had a racist streak. At the same time, her girlfriend at work is unaware that she has sexual relations with her brother, and it just rises from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. Once all these things have happened, it's all pretty standard. It pulls a little, though it's only about 90 minutes long. It's more of a Chick Flick than anything else. So if you're male, I don't recommend this movie.
