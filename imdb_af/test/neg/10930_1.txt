This movie is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. A woman "The EX" suggests being a number of people to access her ex-husband. To kill people for no reason in bathing to reach her goal. The women I don't think have ever gone to the acting college. She only spends the whole movie making stupid expressions, and she seems as if she is trying to avoid the camera. Failure on most occasions. She makes friends with her grandmother's wife and son, she does it to use them against her husband. Only when you watch this movie do you think the "Ex" wants to kill her ex-husband, perhaps because he treated her badly. But the women are actually busy with the man and want him back. The two used to enjoy rough entertainment (of course, using whips). My advice to the general public is not to buy this movie, don't rent this movie and don't look like me (at 01:15 on FOX)
