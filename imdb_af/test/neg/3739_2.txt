I love John's work as a singer, but the movie was boring and "not worth the time" to watch. <br /> <br /> I thought he did an 'ok' job to do his part. If he says, "you have a relationship with the uncle", with his co-star, I spent a little bit of time with his facial movements ... or a lack of it. <br /> <br /> If you like John's music, but not as a Saturday night video, I will introduce the movie. <br /> <br /> If you like his music, then the video has some music from it, but not much. <br /> <br /> So .. at its best
