It's not uncommon for Hollywood to pump out crappy movies. Sometimes a handful of good movies come from them while the majority just suck big ass. It's also not surprising that the bad movies are again from the old TV series. Sometimes a surprise comes up with 'The Fugitive' (which has seen the best photo Oscar nom)? But for every "Fugitive" there is a McHale's Navy or another totally original movie without any plot or interest. The Mod Squad, in my opinion, is going to hurt my top ten of really bad movies, in which Hollywood has to get it, hit ass for producing what a good movie could be. We are being moved right in the middle of a story that just doesn't make sense, it wastes the talent, and the dialogue is just bad. We don't actually know who the hell these characters are, and we can give a flying f ** k about what they are. Instead, you are expected to automatically know who they are and what they will do. There is a particularly bad riff, about the "I'm too old for this s ** t" line, it's just stupid. Something my friend noticed verbally when we got into the movie just to end. It's just an insult to Hollywood theater. Degree: F-
