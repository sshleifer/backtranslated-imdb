Kidman and the law lack the chemistry to make these messy, poorly written novels / melodrama work at any level other than grandiosity. Kidman pouts and <br /> <br /> disappear for her absent lover. She just met him when he was beaten to fight for the South in the Civil War and they only exchanged 5 sentences and one kiss, but they were completely beaten. Right's main direction appears to be continuous: "Look free and shock shocked, but sensitive." Ren√© Zellweger is about the only spark in this urgent script, but she plays it too broadly and at the top, as she was in 'Annie Get Your Gun'. Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it was in a Monty Python sketch - the one of `Holy Grail 'where farmers spend all their time making mud pies without cause. Kidman is a clever enough actress to stay out of her way when she can. Their scenes are like a cartoon hidden in a Victorian Era novel. <br /> <br /> When the action lines are set in the total tedium, which is regular, all the authors do `` Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain! "And Teague (Ray Winstone) comes out of nowhere galloping to do his unspeakable deadly acts, such as killing and torturing innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-stricken <br /> <br /> Confederation. All the other times, he misses in action, which is even in this choral print preposterous, and there is an abundance of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles - these are the characters that Law meets as he draws his Johnny Appleseed From the front lines, where he left, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain, eventually there is not one of these characters, rights have no time for them or their lives. movies have the same tired theme: war is rippling, and otherwise decent christian people become rabid animals. <br /> <br /> And the writing is too predictable, too hard-hearted. g. You spend the whole movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman turning her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes, you just don't care. You will look at your watch and wonder how much more of this slap you have to endure. <br /> <br /> I give it one star out of five for the battle tones. There is a strong anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful. But it is only about 15 minutes from this 150 minute dog.
