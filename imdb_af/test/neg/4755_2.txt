I really don't understand how the movie here on IMDb can get a score of more than 4. It's simply a big mess, and I have to admit that I really liked AvP 1: Nothing about a story, okay, I can live with it, but at least they almost at once reached. AvP 2 not. After the stupid presentation was presented, there were more than half an hour of stupid and inappropriate teenage cliches, stupid as hell dialogue and close to nothing else, except for a few Alien scenes that excused the first half of the have movie. and Predator scenes that make you wonder if the guys who made the movie even watched another Predator movie or just didn't have enough to bother. <br /> <br /> Then the crap party eventually gets the point where the Predator starts attacking the Aliens, or at least pretends to do so. And boy, is that Predator stupid, blind and deaf. It's terrible. How he even managed to earn those things is beyond me. He misses with almost every shot, watch only strangers when they are right in his face or if it is absolutely essential for writing so that he can move where he should be. He is constantly amazed by indignant human teenagers and delegates. What should the guy be? After the first hour of that horror, I shook my head on every scene. Almost no scene in this movie goes through with amazing stupid dialogues, stupid Predator actions or stupid missing drugs or silly acts of our "heroes". <br /> <br /> Then that thing ended. To my surprise my friends and I not only knew or were laughing or crying, but everyone I heard left the room, half crying, half laughing over the 1 1/2 hours they just wasted. <br /> <br /> Don't look. Never.
