Looking for work, straight guy Bud Abbott (as Jack) and comic partner Lou Costello (as Dinkel) get the latter a baby working self-described "problem child" David Stollery (as Donald) is working. Young Stollery winds up to Mr. Read Costello's favorite novel (see if you can guess the title), which Costello sleeps on, he and his dream come true. Abbott revives the story of Jack and the Beanstalk (you guessed it). <br /> <br /> The sepia tone switches for most of the production. Apparently it was an attempt to make something different for the duo, a colorful children's fantasy. It fails, but this is where you will see Abbott & Costello in color, the silent movie star William Farnum (as the king) shares his last performance, boxer Max Baer's brother Buddy and Stollery before Disney's "Spin and Marty ". <br /> <br /> ** Jack and the Beanstalk (4/4/52) Jean Yarbrough ~ Lou Costello, Bud Abbott, Buddy Baer, ​​William Farnum
