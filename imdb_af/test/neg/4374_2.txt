Chuck Norris stars as Danny, a police spokesman who fired an assassin, but when the murderer escapes, Danny knows he's the only one who can stop the terror. However, Danny had a secret, he knew it was a great luck that the terror had been arrested, and even more luck that Danny survived, is now a final battle, but is Danny right? Right there in my description tell what the problem of this movie is. Norris plays a wimpy hero who is still suffering from psychological trauma. In the hands of a better actor, this concept will be interesting and can be a great excitement. In the hands of a Norris thriller it just makes ridiculous and hopelessly unholy. Also on board is American Ninja's Steve James and Superfly's Ron O'Neal, but any attempt at character development is defeated by the horrific script. Also there is almost no action and I always preferred a Norris movie with more fighting and less talking. Given the rating on this site, I shouldn't be alone. <br /> <br /> * From 4- (Bad)
