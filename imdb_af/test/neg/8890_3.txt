"The Quickie" tells of a decadent Russian crowd family living in Malibu and ... well, frankly, this terrible attempt at drama is not worthy of comment. <br /> <br /> Jason Leigh introduces herself to Mr. Mob man like "Pacific Exterminators" with big letters in the bare eyes on her back saying "West Coast Exterminators". Eventually the gang guys become suspicious because they are wiping out in a bedroom. (Duh). <br /> <br /> In another scene, Mr. Mobguy Russian roulette hooker $ 4,000 to determine if he will live or die. She has 5 chances out of 6 to keep the money as his 'live' bets. Well, she bet "dies". (double duh) Later she complains it wasn't fair and wanted to play again. (Triple Duh). <br /> <br /> The list of errors just goes on and off while this intelligence offensive film stinks and sinks into a rogue of common music, mediocre camera work, poor direction, boring story, and so on. Pass on this loser. (D) <br /> <br /> Note - The barebones DVD I rented had no English language subtitles or closed captions.
