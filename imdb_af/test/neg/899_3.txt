I didn't really care about it. If they got rid of the comedy / slapstick and focused on the dramatic / philosophical aspects of the script, it might be worth it. <br /> <br /> The more the movie goes on, the less I kept the main character / postman. He has interesting things to say, but he is also a hypocritical, unsafe jerk. <br /> <br /> 3/10
