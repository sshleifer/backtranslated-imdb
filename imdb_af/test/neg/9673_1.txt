I wanted to say it since I saw the movie. I still won't let any of my children or grandchildren see it. At least not until I tell them and they understand that it is complete fiction. The only thing that I saw was right was that animals went on the Ark, and everything was fake. Lot and Noah fight like a pirate movie on the sea. Make sure you tell your kids the right story before you allow them to see it, but really, until they're old enough to understand it's not real, they can have some vision of the Bible. It was the worst Bible movie I've ever seen. Bruce and Evan Almighty were much better and had more to learn. Let your kids see it
