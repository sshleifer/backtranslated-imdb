It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This movie goes beyond ridiculous. It's like the director wants to sue his actor by the actors because they misrepresented their roles as the fantastic four. I believe the movie had to be released in comic book stores, so the only way you should say it is desperate geeks who don't get enough cheesiness and want more and more crap movies. In conclusion of my paradox statements and thesis, I believe this movie has had major drawbacks to the future of the role-players contributors, with the exception of the character of jay underwood, in which I believe it was his best performance, taking into account roles like the not quite human movies in which the story is so told He has no character. He can't act and people have made good decisions not to see his movies. Therefore, he will probably not be big roles unless he unleashes his career in a very scarce but interesting way. .
