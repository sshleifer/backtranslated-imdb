Well, the episode I just watched looked at the older "Gastineau girl" about why people are talking about her husband (Gastineau, a well-known American footballer apparently). She seems reluctant to assume that he is the only reason why she does not hit civilians, she has married a celebrity and therefore his cameras showed her. <br /> <br /> When challenged by an interviewer to explain what she's actually doing, she gave a wonderful reason why people should pay attention to her: "I'm really working hard on my reality TV show". Then she said, "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm a personality." <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure who this series is meant to appeal, except people who had everything removed their intelligence. It's certainly not a role model for anyone except gold diggers, as the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all that tells about rich people is that they have no money problems.
