Low budget "movies" like this only give me hope as an aspiring scriptwriter. In other words, if there are people who are willing to finance such a shock, then there is definitely a lot more than a shining hope for someone like me who can actually write stories. This movie is right there or should I say "out there" with the Ed Woods of the world. The story, if you can call it, and the dialogue, not to mention the sophomorical acting, is a travesty to the genre itself. Someone had to play a role through this stinker while it was just on paper. From this follows that the literature is almost killed, that movie must follow. To have a good or even fitting movie, you should at least have good writing. The legendary Curt Siodmak comes from. They used many of his stories for low budget films, but then they still came out as good, serious entertainment today, "Donavan's Brain". The cast for this "work" should seriously consider going back to work at their respective hamburger joints or shoe stores and forget about any future poor efforts to appear in front of a camera. Avoid this one like the plague itself !!!
