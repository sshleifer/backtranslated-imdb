New Year's Day. The day after a few too many vodka martinis and Cosmopolitans mixed with a bunch of midnight, my wife and I discovered that the local cable company offers the digital specialty channels free of charge for the monthly January. We had a choice - do we use the freebie channels or start looking at the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD we got from our daughter from Christmas? <br /> <br /> We've chosen the digital freebie as the DVDs go nowhere and we need something like ten twelve hours to see how all the X files are ending. The Drive-In channel features a horror classic three movie marathon: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum is well reviewed here and the well and the sling were too late to look which means we can really only be properly critical of the House of Petrified. <br /> <br /> To be honest, we've been trying to be serious about the movie as his stars have pretty good acting testimonies - Greg Evigan (William Shatner's overwritten copywars) and Alexandra Paul (the only Baywatch babe who can act, although she has a ten-year-old son). Unfortunately, we quickly giggled under the influence of a puppy, as we each shouted the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters! <br /> <br /> The play, especially by Evigan's real daughter, was not bad, considering the stupid writing they had to work with. The CGI, for 1996, was hilarious - at the worst point in the final scene when it had to be the worst, it was so bad, my wife and I acted in laughter. Overall: Acting 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5
