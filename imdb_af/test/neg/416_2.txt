Ron Howard and his "editors" just had one job to do. Follow the guidelines of the book that were "rich", "mysterious", "shift" and highly spectacular in its approach! <br /> <br /> What they did? They have changed EVERYTHING and I mean everything! What is left is something that didn't call the right "Angels & Daemons"! <br /> <br /> I really love the book and find it very difficult to see it being treated like that! <br /> <br /> I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself for this "movie". <br /> <br /> I really have no patience to sit down and rightly the 1,000,000 changes they made, it's useless .......
