The world is now in a strange stage of downsizing, in which objects such as DVD and CD players are becoming smaller. Of course, it is much cooler to have a smaller iPod than a larger one. This is not the case with theater screens, just like the IMAX, the enormous, well-known theater system that satisfied audiences on its release and to this day. As long as the material is right. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with 'Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D' is that it uses the big screen as its biggest advantage. It's boring, uninformative and relentlessly eager to marvel at its crowny special effects and inspirational quotes of famous names like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Another problem with the movie is that it does not even take the time to sit and maintain with the happy couple who have not had such an extraordinary experience as being at the moon. Instead, the authors simply printed COPY and PASTE and hired famous voices such as Morgan Freeman, Bill Paxton and Matt Damon to imitate their famous quotes. These tactics are carelessly repetitive and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a moment's hesitation I will say that I haven't learned one piece of the movie I didn't know yet. <br /> <br /> It has repeatedly insisted. About the annoyance of the crap from me with his constant sentimentality for three minutes it seems to be a clue to Tom Hanks's voice to say something like "Without the contributions of these brave men and women ...." Watching the movie is looking at a bad commercial. For forty agonizing minutes. <br /> <br /> 1/4
