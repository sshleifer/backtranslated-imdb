Bad, bad, and did I mention badly? Apart from the comic monster terrorizing the workers, the workers were the funniest part of the movie when land surveyors were in the desert and one said they had an hour's daylight, but you could clearly see through their shadows and shining air see it probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. Read the author director! <br /> <br /> The only cool part of this movie, except the stretch on Clara Bryant, of course (as another reviewer mentioned), is the phantom skeleton that the Bone Eater drives. That thing was pretty cool as it drove the surveyors on their motorcycles.
