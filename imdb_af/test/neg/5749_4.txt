A wall flower is thrown into the sea and dreams herself in a pirate fantasy as a girl in love with a pirate's pupil. Energetic and good-natured, perhaps, but an unashamed business; a failed musical broadcast of "The Pirates of Penzance" with a cheap, background feel, overblown bubbly songs and constant learning. Kristy McNichol's film career then hit a huge hit, while leading man Christopher Atkins couldn't get hold of a particular emotion, bumping his voice over the search for a fitting tone. You have to wonder if this is the best title they can come up with, how will the level of white be in real writing? The movie's "Grease" feelings for musical not loaded with its love of hitting a low plane. Although McNichol works overtime, it becomes slightly effervescent and the impressive handling of handling becomes very thin. For the most part it is an embarrassment. * 1/2 of ****
