I want to agree with the previous reviewer: This movie has great animation, but has problems throughout the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Plot holes are large, dialogue hardly explains the concepts of the plot. The MAIN POINTS are not even fully laid out until the last five minutes of the movie. The characters set the obvious, while not explaining the more confusing points of the movie. There are characters that pop up and interest in the storyline that is never explained. Most of them have names just mentioned * once *, and it's very confusing for a viewer. <br /> <br /> Don 't waste your time with this movie. Unless you're in for a good laugh and how DUMB is.
