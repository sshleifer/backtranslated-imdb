I don't even understand what they were trying to do with this movie, I really mean. You got this guy out of a lot of cats, because he's dead, but to be really dead, should this girl shoot them? And they leave a body, though ordinary people can't see them, because they're dead? The writing already has a hole in the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character Susan Paterno played that only makes her songs drunk in a monotonous boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she can die as well as " a female terminator robot. It is absolutely horrible and I don't even understand how I managed to get to the end of the movie. The end is just as stupid as the whole movie, you think, and with absolutely no reward for the viewer so ever. They might as well call this movie, "the little movie that choo-choo ka-choo can choose."
