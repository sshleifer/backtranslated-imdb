Well, the artifartyrati of Cannes might have had this movie, but I'm not scared. If you like the kind of movie where shots hang so long, you're wondering if the actor fell asleep or the cameraman went for lunch, then it might be for you. A large part of it is so with short stays in the area of ​​unpleasantness. I didn't find it shocking or disturbing, as some other reviewers have - just a little unpleasant and useless. The only reason I didn't give this one star is that the play is laudable, and the movie is pretty well shot. However, the plot recommended little. Much of the movie just shows a grumpy woman who is learning the piano or listening to a few people. But if you don't think it's innocuous enough, be prepared for a few pips of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
