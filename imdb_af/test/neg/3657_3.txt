Oorambitious and shoddy; and sometimes even dark. DARK REALITY's scenario is not even close to the original. Dark and damp basement. Kidnapped prisoners. Terrible survival. Carey (Alisha Seton) tells her family and friends that she is going to travel across Europe. She didn't make it out of town. She is grabbed from a rainy pavement, stunned and awake in a dungeon chain. She finally realizes that she is not alone and at the meeting of some of her fellow prisoners there are different thoughts on survival. Her cellmates die one by one. Can she get enough strength and courage to see daylight again? Others in the movie: Laila Dagher, Rachel Oliva, Eva Derreck, Arthur Bullock and Jen Parker.
