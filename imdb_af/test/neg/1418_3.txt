The premise of this movie, of a comedian talk show host who acts as president and independent to shake things, is funny, entertaining, brilliant and even a little inspiring. (Thinking of the West Wing debate when Tom Dobbs left his podium, thought about Steven Colbert who announced his candidacy.) The first 15 - 20 minutes of this movie is therefore very entertaining, especially the debate. When he is eventually elected, it is a pity that it is because of a computer disorder, you want him to be fair (although it is unrealistic). <br /> <br /> But after that, this movie is going down completely. I thought we would get a big movie like "Dave" (1993), in which we see how a comedian would actually have run the country. Instead, the movie turns from comedy into a thriller, a romantic comedy and a drama and does no one good. The computer glitch becomes the main story, which really sucks. Son is disappointing. I give it 3 stars just for the point of departure and because I actually managed to watch this movie from start to finish without stopping it, which is usually a good thing with me.
