I think I should now comment on a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; the persecutors surprise me again or amaze them by their sluggish and deliberate _absurdism. They form or form a 4th way not classical, not revisionist, not European, but a sleazy Americana, related to the violent vigilant '70s movies, absurd trash. This installment is also bombastic sleaze ?? inexplicably uncomfortable and even somewhat strange. <br /> <br /> Now, I find that these successors don't just have their opportunist supporters; but that the fans simply did not experience any difference between the original style and the persecutors. <br /> <br /> These prosecutions are not boring or rude, but weird. Of course, they are very poorly written, "messy scripts, rubbish lines. It is straight mold; In this installment does every armed man get several women? Van Cleef's young wife ordered him to release a young prisoner; He finally ends up. The young man resumes his life, shoots Van Cleef, kidnaps the woman, rapes and kills her, then joins an offender. Van Cleef, who previously refused to defend a town, now defends a small bunch and beats the hacienda of the unjust; then the offenders charge the town where Van Cleef has. <br /> <br /> I like the cast. <br /> <br /> Van Cleef is Chris; Stefanie Powers, who is active in the 70-year-old Western Cape creatures, is Van Cleef's treasure. Callan, very antipathetic, is Noah, a writer and Chris's sidekick. The rest of the aggressive bunch is Askew (one of the only three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is really hot, fleshy beauty.
