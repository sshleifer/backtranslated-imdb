One commentator said if you like Austin Powers, you'll love this movie. I love Outin Powers and was disappointed with this movie. The film works hard, maybe too hard to laugh. Perhaps it was that all the villains in this movie shouted as if the screaming in itself was supposed to be funny. I get where they try to go with this movie. A cross between Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel, but it just doesn't work. Austin mastered as stupid, but intelligent, Zorro's Gay Blade lacks the skill of Austin Powers, The Big Lebowski or Kingpin. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for a laugh and while I was waiting, I was surprised someone was actually paid. the writing. My 15-year-old daughter also thought the movie was flat. My 17 year old who chose this movie came out after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Many people on IMDb seem to enjoy this movie, but for me it lacks the good timing or jokes of a good comedy. .
