What makes this movie so bad? Is it the lame sub-par youth humor? Could it be the horrible "trendy" sucking ass music? Perhaps the uninspired narrative story is? Or maybe even the fact that Traci Lords ever delivers her worst performing performance, and to bring in injuries, keeps all her clothes throughout the length of this steaming sandwich. Whatever the reason for this movie, the fact that it really does happen remains. I have never wished I could see a movie with Dean Cameron in it, instead of what I watched in my life, but "Ski School" is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Cookie Cookie: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes are all releasing their Tupperware tits. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
