With: James Belushi; Peter Dinklage; Alex Neuberger and Jason Lee Underdog are a true hero's story. Here is the story of Shoeshine, a regular, playful little beagle. When he is a dog with a megalomaniac, he is totally devastated by the destruction. Something is happening freaky. <br /> <br /> Our special little neighborhood pooch gets extraordinary powers. He can run a cheetah so fast; fly a superhero so fast and have the thunder. He is no longer Shoeshine; he is undercover? the best crime fighter in the animal kingdom. The city can't sleep until Underdog explains it to the evil drunk Dr Simon Barsinister and his cronies. <br /> <br /> If you want some light entertainment with all the clich√©s of superhero action movie, then this one is for you. As for quality entertainment, this one is strictly for the juniors. Those of you who are hoping to enjoy the comedy of the fast star -James Belushi - a word of caution: this is not one of his finer works.
