Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) travels to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and is trapped in the same mysterious curse that has killed so many people. With a group of others she tries to solve and end the curse. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2 rebuilds everything from the first one and it only produces a few frights. The first Grudge was at best an average movie. The premise was decent, but the acting was wood and some of the scenes were really ridiculous. The grudge 2 is even more stupid and less frightening than the original. Scary Movie 4 also made it impossible to take these movies seriously and I had problems keeping a straight face during the scary scenes that should last longer than fear. How Takashi Shimizu gained his own franchise is inexplicable, but he managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, he kept the movie slow with a bunch of dull characters and lame frightening tactics. Obviously he did this movie for money and I'm glad it failed. <br /> <br /> The script was pretty bad, mainly because it didn't make sense and they didn't develop the characters at all. In the movie there were three different stories going on and each one was somehow related to "the resentment". The compounds were weak and a lot of people were killed without a real reason. They did not explain the rules of the curse very well and it eventually became a bit of a carnage because everyone died, although the PG-13 rating became interesting, even though some of the screens were pretty paralyzed. The dialogue was poor and none of the characters were nice or good enough to really care. <br /> <br /> The acting was on par with everything else and it was much worse compared to the first one. Amber Tamblyn was irritating wood. She moved very slowly on the screen and all her emotions looked fake. Sarah Michelle Gellar was okay, though she just had a cameo. Jennifer Beals performed the best, she had some good scenes and was very effective. Arielle Kebbel was okay, a little thin. The rest were either horrible or just too forgetful. Overall, The Grudge 2 was a disappointing successor. It lacked many things and it is not worth looking at. Rating 4/10
