I hated that the first movie was very boring and we only saw the Octopus at the end. <br /> <br /> The Death Bodies plot is found in New York Harbor. Police have no clues or suspicions until Nick and his colleague realize the killer is a giant octopus. Everyone, especially the police captain, refuses Nick's story and soon the harbor will be filled with boats for the fourth July celebration ... <br /> <br /> In this movie we see more of the Giant Octopus and special Effects for this movie are really good for the time. <br /> <br /> The play is not bad for this movie, but good, but good and good. <br /> <br /> There are some real cheese scenes to watch, but if it's over, you'll have to enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
