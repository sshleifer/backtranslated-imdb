Being a fan of the game and watching this movie made me physically excited! <br /> <br /> It was a horrible movie, although the story was similar to the game plot. the whole superhuman soldier thing. Unlike Jack Carver, an American man in the game, playing germs, unless it's a kind of twisted irony, it made me pull the middle finger on my TV screen, the second it started. The fact that you have filmed it in a forest in the middle of summer is unashamedly because the game is set in the tropical rainforest, while the director looks just like his window. The morning and it was "it's a good forest." <br /> <br /> THIS IS A NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: If you ever plan to make a movie based on a game / book, play it, understand it and ask fans it ... don't just play it for an hour and assume you know it !!!
