Telly Savalas presented a fitting (but not better) performance in 1916 than Pancho Villa, the notorious Mexican bandit / revolutionary, in this report of Villa's attack on Columbus, New Mexico, in 1916. Villa is not really a historical figure I am very familiar with, so I won't say much about the historical details of the movie. As a movie it is not nice, although it is here and there of action and humor. Chuck Connors's performance as Colonel Wilcox, commander of the US Army base near Columbus, hit me a little over me, and Clint Walker as Villa's Gringo sidekick Scotty didn't really do me much. The movie is, of course, a fairly low budget effort of limited technical quality. For a movie with just a little over half an hour, I have to say that this movie has been dragged into places, especially in the last 20 minutes or so. Villa's attack in the United States was an interesting (as in the overall scheme of things, not very important) historical sidebar, and probably deserves better treatment than that. 10/04
