I went into this movie, expecting me to get a messy style in the seventies, but what I got was more of a bizarre pseudo-western with too much talk and not enough action. Obviously this movie was made on a budget; The sites are dead and shot badly, while the play also leaves much to be desired. The plot focuses on a trio of robbers (a father and two boys) stealing a load of gold after killing miners. They come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother ... and it is all told in flashbacks by the young girl currently living in an asylum. It is clear that directors Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were making something really shocking. But despite its best efforts, South Hell Mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer. The movie drones up for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters spitting boring and prolonged dialogue. The only good thing I have to say about the movie is about the music; which is good in places. The end is the only other good thing about the movie; And that's just because it's the last thing to happen. I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it ... there was much better trash in the seventies.
