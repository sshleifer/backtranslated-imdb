For the uninitiated, almost any Andy Milligan movie is a shock, but despite seeing many of his films, this one still takes the cake for sheer cowardice. <br /> <br /> Of course, Milligan's takes the Sweeney Todd story, with costumes (but not necessarily hairstyles, in some cases) and the usual headache-penetrating camera work and grain quality. As far as the gore is concerned, the version I have seen may have been cut, because there is not much, for a movie with "bloodthirsty" in the title. The best indication of subversive filmmaking here is a meat pie that consists only of a few poor victims. <br /> <br /> So while estimating this piece of your work on my video shelf, it's definitely a bit of an eclipse as far as content is concerned. Recommended for just the fool and foolishly curious. 3 out of 10.
