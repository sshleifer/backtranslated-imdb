!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The premise is as follows: A shop is burnt down and assistant. Sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to accept the wrap on which Sergio votes. br /> So far, but there is a reasonable lapse of logic involved. Sergio agrees to do it for the sum of $ 25,000, but why? Come on guys if you were a pretty white boy, would you run the risk of getting a long game in a difficult prison (a very real possibility for arson) for the sake of 25 grand? I know I don't want to, and since you have a criminal record, no employer would want you to hit a pole, so $ 25,000 is so much for a life of work and welfare testing? There is also something else that apparently went without prior notice, since Mister Lumpke Sergio told him that his son had made the fire, he didn't seem aware of the possibility that he could know too much. Don't you want to hear alarm bells in your mind about someone who wants to keep you if they tell you something? <br /> <br /> I think we're not going to think about such details, as a PYROMANIAC's LOVE STORY isn't an intelligent thriller, it's a light romantic comedy / chick spot most likely to be rated as a girl's night in. By watching this comment sheet, it is clear that the movie has its defenders, but as a cynical man I was also not impressed and William Baldwin goes over the top
