Boston Blackie movies have some strengths - mostly because the pacing is fast and the hero is excited, even in the worst conditions. But the plot is often abominable, and the inexorable comic pieces often kill the pacing (if the plot appears unpopular) or is just unsuitable and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> This one includes Blackie who is an escape from the asylum (Steve Cochran in a very poor performance) that is fitting on beautiful Nina Foch (which features a nice, subtle play). Inspector Farraday, of course, believes that Blackie has homogeneous maniac (at least he has some evidence in that one) and is incapable of imprisoning him when Blackie goes to the real killer. The plot has possibilities, but anytime, any real tension, we do not get a funny comedy routine. No one in Columbia seems to understand that in a movie about the quest for a very dangerous maniac, cute little comedy screens to hide an uncomfortable body from the inspector disrupt any willing suspension of unbelief. (One just makes out our smart hero, is an idiot - deadly for a movie like this.) <br /> <br /> This one is not worth it. For a well-scheduled episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
