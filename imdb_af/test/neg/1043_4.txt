Karen and her boyfriend Jerry haul into their new Los Angeles apartment. They discovered an old copper bed that Karen saw. Unfortunately, it has a very sinister history of kinky sex killings. "Deathbed" tries to be a creepy supernatural story, but fails failed. The action is slow, the acting is nothing special and there is no tension. Even though the sex scene is lame. The climax is pretty greedy and violent, so fans of plunder should be happy. But the first hour of "Deathbed" is deadly dim and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scares.Definitely one to avoid. My rating: 4 out of 10 and it's generous. Look instead of "Re-Animator" or "Castle Freak".
