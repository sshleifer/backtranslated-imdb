Movies like this don't need prosecutions. Part of the benefit of Don Bluth moving away from Disney is that he didn't have their endless tirades of straight-to-video, poorly animated cash-in-prose. But it was obviously someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to "All Dogs Go to Heaven", so we get it. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he's not really good. Most of the movie is just a bad excuse for a successor and it's not nearly as dark, different or entertaining as the original. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for future generations that must endlessly endure such as this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood didn't rely entirely on successful movies as a crutch to banal crap to release. <br /> <br /> Please, no longer prosecuting children who do not need it.
