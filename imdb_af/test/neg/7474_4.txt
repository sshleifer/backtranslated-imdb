... a recommendation! Gloria Grahame manages the kind of orphanage where discipline is given with a meat nail, orphans are hung on meatballs to punish them and the bodies are kept in the freezer so they can be brought out when social services call. We know that the orphanage is tied up for cash, because Gloria is putting all the orphans at work, and also because there are not enough clothes to walk around - especially for older nubile female orphans (age group 12-30 ish). The new arrival, however, seems more than a game for Gloria - and has only taken her own mother and mother's lover (in a critical claw and arson opening scene). Predictably, Gloria ends up on a meatball herself. This one was made for about tuppence but was / is a BIG BIG big hit on the grindhouse circuit. My DVD cover promised "disturbing and politically wrong scenes" and it probably didn't. I believe it is considered the Burger Kane of orphanage that sets torture porn movies. 10/04
