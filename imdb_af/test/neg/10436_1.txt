The recent DVD of Good Humor Man calls the movie comedy. It's hardly a comedy, rather a dull indie movie about a group of losers. It is believed to be established in the 70's, and hardly any attention is given to periodic details, with too much muted color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the recurrence of the movie (perhaps it is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) The click of losers actually just seems to be in one place, the bleachers. hang. The film's packaging seems to be a comedy meant to trick people into renting or buying this movie, which is a total waste of time.
