Perry Mason: The Case of the Glass Kis Finds Raymond Burr Defends David Copperfield / Rick Blaine Like The Wizard Peter Scolari Of A Murder Case In One Of His Assistants. A trick involving a suspended glass box in the middle of the middle of the air goes wrong and Nancy Grahn's body comes out. <br /> <br /> Nancy was one of six female assistants working with the act and we are learning two things about her. Only in a moment of drunk weakness did Scolari seduce her and she alleged she was fertilized. Secondly, she lives under a supposed name and has a secret of her past. <br /> <br /> Billy Moses, who probably never thought he would do such rough stuff in real school, is getting some good old-fashioned boys when they find the truth in Grahn's home town. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky, he almost gets killed. <br /> <br /> One big mistake in this mystery is simple forensic. The medical examiner's report had given concrete evidence that the victim was murdered in such a way that Scolari might not have been able to do the act. The police had to look in another direction for the killer. <br /> <br /> If you see who the killer is, you won't blame the individual, but you'll also see how investigator, James McEachin, got it wrong. This kind of spoils this particular Mason movie.
