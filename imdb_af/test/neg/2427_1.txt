OK from the point of view of an American, who I don't know much about rugby, it would be a great movie for them. First, his heart, good morale, is the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy. But for us where I come from rugby, is the number one sport, it's a way of life, it's a game that is only played by bravest and the victor looks like heroes as if Americans are doing their baseball / basketball stars . I'm not really sure if it was the cheap budget, or maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and is a rugby fan. All my life I can see if some of the actors didn't even know rugby existed before they worked in this movie. . To summarize this movie, it was terrible. If you see it and thought it was great, make time to go online and maybe Google "All Blacks" is New Zealand's national team and those who announced the haka. Believe me they will make the Highlands boys look like schoolgirls.
