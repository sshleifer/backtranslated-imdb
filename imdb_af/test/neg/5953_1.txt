Awful, Awful, Awful show. Real World issues dealt with blatant unoriginal issues. Stereotypes in general. What Happens to the Black-American (Black!) Guys Eyebrows? Tyrone power! Awful, Awful, Awful, Awful, Awful show. The fact that it lasted three seasons, think of faith. This show is really swill for the brain dead of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Saved by the Bell looks almost humorous compared to this one. Well, afterwards, no. It is the same banal ilk and therefore without intelligence. The only thing missing so far is that Jesus is a GOD message. The mentality and salvation are the same, but somehow feel angry and rare. You can almost hear the TV drivers spreading ghost words on each other. In fact, I felt so furious at this exhibition, I was forced to comment. <br /> <br /> Awful, Awful, Awful show.
