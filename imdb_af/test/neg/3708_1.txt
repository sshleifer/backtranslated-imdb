It's a sin how these things are made, but then we won't ever film the best "Dummy scene" ever. Ahhh the beauty of a low budget Bigfoot flicks, you lean to see the beauty the more you look at them, that's when your brain doesn't even melt. As I said before, it has the best dummy scene ever! Words can't express it, you have to see it yourself. Wonderful lines like "Smells like decain flesh", "Thems Human ..." (You will know this one if you see it). The creature makes a Blah, Blah! sound and the scene where the baby is shot will make you cry (with laughter) you will recover it. Has a car chase, snow mobile racing, a Bigfoot folklore as well as a Disco song. It doesn't end while you see the credits a friend noticed, "K-Mart Clothing". You ask, how can you even get as far as the credits and then look at them? I can only explain it as a kind of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted that you cannot move, and I think you should know who was behind the mess. All that is said, this is a must see especially if you want to punish yourself spiritually. It's a keeper!
