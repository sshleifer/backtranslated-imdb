Not done well, the whole movie was just the Grudge to go around and kill random people from nowhere. Random people who have nothing to do with the story, such as the 3 schoolgirls. <br /> <br /> The family at first had nothing to do with the story, I believe they are random. family who never went home and never had anything to do with the killing of the grudge. <br /> <br /> Not at all impressed me, I wasn't scared, I didn't jump anywhere, and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money off. The Gridge 1 also looks like a crap, which was actually a good movie. <br /> <br /> I believe The Grudge 2 is like a leading movie at The Grudge 3, if they ever make one. They shouldn't even call it Resentment 2, they should call it the prologue to the grudge 2, and you'll see if you looked at it, because I'm not going to spoil anything. Not that it mattered anyway. <br /> <br /> 1/10, not scary, bad story, and just totally random.
