"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow moving B-movie in which Blake plays a desert motorcycle man who wants to become a murderer detective and is triggered in a murder investigation. A mediocre film at its best, "EG in B", includes some members of the Chicago group, a flute of action, a philosophy and many and very boring dramatic fillers. Not worth the time.
