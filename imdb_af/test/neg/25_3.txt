Is it a poorly performed, click-directed stack of waste? Of course. Anyone who doesn't realize that when they pick up the box in the video store, they probably don't have the right to evaluate movies. So, I will now rate the aspects of the movie we really care about on a scale of 1 to 10. <br /> <br /> Violence and gore: 4 - For this genre there are very few deaths, and The gore is almost non-existent. Anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the fact that children do these terrible things, which increases the bar a little. <br /> <br /> Suspension: 1 - Okay, I feel bad for anyone scared of this trio of dorky looking for kids. Nudity / Sex: 7 - Very boobage of three different women, one of whom is MTV v. Julie Brown. There are two sex scenes, but little is shown. <br /> <br /> Unintentional humor - 4 - There are some good laughs with the kids trying to act but it's just bad. , not funny bad. <br /> <br /> Overall - 4 - It's not incompatible. There are a few fun moments, and plenty of nudity to keep your attention for the whole movie. Just look at this movie if you are a big fan of the 80's flashes. It definitely falls on the bottom of the scale, but it's not quite at the bottom. The real downside is the disappointing end. It almost ruined the movie for me.
