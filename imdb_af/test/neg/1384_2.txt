Much has been made of Carlos Mencia's (Mr Holness, excuse me) theft of other comics' material. Quite even before Joe Rogan arrived on stage with him, I knew that Carlos Mensteala had flipped Cosby and Kinison material and hosted others. <br /> <br /> To set up the crime of his theft, he has this comical brilliant joke BADLY. <br /> <br /> And it's a crime he continues to pursue on this show. I'm sure the series of authors should share some of the blame - it should be difficult to write jokes day and day ... but that's why people are being paid, so much to do! This series of writers should return to their day-to-day work of shrew citizens or whatever they did before deciding to pursue a career of intellectual theft. <br /> <br /> Not to say that he is his material. You can know when he has devised a joke on his own as you look, just overrun the net and go straight into the terribly bad area. Because he likes to b b *** h On his performance, ten-year-olds call him a genius. They'll grow up one of these days, Carlos, and when they do, you'll dry up and blow away.
