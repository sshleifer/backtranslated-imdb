As you can tell from the other comments, this movie is just about the WORST movie ever made. Let me see how many different words I can use to describe it: Drilling, Underbearing, Laughable, Lousy, Dumb, Horrible ..... <br /> <br /> I could go to such descriptions, but you probably get the point. <br /> <br /> I would have given it a 0, if possible - bad acting, bad direction, bad production, bad plot. <br /> <br /> It was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965. Very low budget, boring plot, terrible acting, very bad special effects, etc. ... <br /> <br /> I rarely see Ever a Sci-Fi movie I absolutely think is bad. I mean it's pure garbage. It doesn't matter either. As far as a "B movie" is, it is the very bottom of the lot. <br /> <br /> I think I'll be more entertained by staring at an empty piece of paper after 90 minutes. Rubbish like this gives good low-budget "B" movies a bad name. This means that Ed Wood movies look good. <br /> <br /> The thing to watch live videos is just when you think you've seen the worst, and you see something even worse! <br /> <br /> DJ Perry is a horrible actor and has no individual features that leave him alone. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste at all costs! Oh humanity!
