Avoid this movie. If you expect the "Poseidon Adventure" (1972), you can experience nothing more than a "twist" case. This film offers nothing more than two extremely long and prolonged hours of complete boredom. <br /> <br /> The role players act as if they are angry with the irritation of a bath of water spilling over a bed. of an insignificant petunia. The script is completely unrealistic, and the film doesn't even have the feeling of a disaster movie. In fact, everything about this movie is bad, with the exception of Tom Courtenay. It is a pity that such a good actor was swept away by a flood of misrepresentation to appear in such a scum. When this film was made, the Poseidon had to be turned into a sham in a watery grave. And, Shelley Winters will rise again, from the dead (straight from the Poseidon), to haunt anyone who dares to take this pathetic movie. I rate this movie a 1 out of 10, but it really gets zero. This movie will make you avoid or totally turn to water. And it will leave a bad taste in your mouth. It can even make you want to see 'Jaws' (1975) and go with a big white.
