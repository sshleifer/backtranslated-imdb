This movie is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is a very good actor, shining in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Ordinary Suspect, 7 etc. But it's really rubbish, he didn't get anywhere near a decent Irish accent, maybe he had to practice it with Kate Hudson while she was doing about Adam. For Irish people this film is laughing and even worse, it is very annoying for several scenes. I think the producers made this film and hope that the target audience (non-Europe) could never have been seen or heard by the "General" or Martin Cahill and would be delighted with an interesting and entertaining story. Total rubbish !!
