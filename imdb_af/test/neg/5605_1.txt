I watched it out of curiosity. I enjoyed Stargate SG1 and I watched many of the other TV shows and movies that the main characters worked on. <br /> <br /> My expectations were not high, so I was surprised to be so disappointed. <br /> <br /> The acting is really scary, and the writing is worse. <br /> <br /> Zero research into the bad science that is being injected throughout the movie, or into martial arts (involving various role players throughout the film, despite the fact that they have no martial arts training. (Baton twirling is not a fighter.)) training makes the already indisputable plot even less credible. The same weapon (worn by Michael Shanks) when fired on a mountain side causes extreme damage, but when made inside the wall of toes, creates a small firework effect without damage the tone structure. Shanks fans will be sued to see that in Stargate SG1, where a staff creates a weapon or burns a surface on a main character, or a hole in a part of the castle wall as required), but still. A Bad CGI Snake "God eats one of the believers in the way a dog would eat - snakes just don't behave like that. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of an amazonian warrior cult on a distant planet is at its best. Matriarchal societies have always based on a lack of understanding that men are needed to multiply the species - for example the Picts, which did not find out the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century - at that time, the balance of power moved some of the women to the men. They carry technological weapons and show some knowledge of science - especially of medicine, so that the idea that a matriarchal society can exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based only on the original author's wet dream. Of course, the few references to the star science made in this movie show that the writer knew nothing about it (except for some key words he had to hear in other movies). Yet, it could have been better - like 'She' in 1965, for example, who proved the matriarchal society with a certain reverence, much more credible, and even after 45 years it looks stranger than this deadly stupidity exercise. To march a few women in an armor, dress aggressively and spit out their lines like a kiddie looking for a fight in a nightclub ("Come on! I'll do you!"), Seems to much to simplify the complexities of a matriarchal culture. <br /> <br /> The cultural references are so simple - "everyone takes the snake mother" makes it all up. Even the smallest village shows more cultural variation. <br /> <br /> There is nothing smart, thoughtful, interesting, visually exciting or entertaining about this movie. The soundtrack is of similar quality. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the few positive reviews received by this movie are from shiny Michael Shanks fans who will give a thumb to anything he's involved in. Don't be deceived. Low budgets are not a reason for a movie to fail. Cheap B-movies can be brilliant. This is not one of them, and there is no reason to apply this movie to yourself.
