While most of Wayne's B efforts are entertained in a fun way, this movie is so smoothly edited and written, it's a dud. The first ten minutes alone shows Wayne and bandits in the night screens intercut with stock footage shot naturally in the day. Dwire plays half a white, half-Apache bandit with a heavy Mexican accent and he may not seem to provoke any nationality! I give it a 3.
