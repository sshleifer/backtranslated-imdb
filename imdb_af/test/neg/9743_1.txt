I remember this movie vaguely. I remember it for one good reason that this is the only movie I've ever come out of !! and since then I have never seen it before! I can't spoil it, because I can hardly remember it !! To think, look at the cast, it was a winner, with John Landis directing, but good god, they had to be paid a lot for this drive! All I can remember is that the dad disappears and the family tries to find him by placing a real photo in the slide of a computer. I went out about half an hour from here. I have to confess, I want to see if I can get a copy, just to see if it really was that bad! <br /> <br /> It won't surprise me if it was on every actor's black list! I mean Christopher Lee was in this? The legend of all bad guys, who was in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings? As I said - black listed movie, The Stupids!
