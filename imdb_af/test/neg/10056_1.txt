Caught in Arizona by a mostly foreign crew, "Nightkill" is one of the biggest crime dramas I've ever seen. Robert Mitchum (in a cowboy hat) routes recently woke up Jaclyn Smith and hopes to find out if she had a hand in her husband's death. Jaclyn's wardrobe is from the Dale Evans variety and her dog is called "Cowboy" ... Seems like somebody surely bought in the American myth that all Westerners talk and dress up like John Wayne's descendants! Screenplay by Joan Andre and John Case could have worked better than approached as parody; This riddler just plays tame, with director Ted Post asleep the controls. Don't be recorded by the video boxing art, while Jaclyn shouts as he crashes. She does take a shower in this film, but it is not known (nor does the dark plot one iota). NO stars from ****
