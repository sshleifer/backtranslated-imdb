This film had a lot of potential - it's a wonderful story and has the potential to be very creepy. but of course Tim Burton does not make creepy movies, he does cartoon movies. and I usually like Tim Burton's stuff. but I thought this movie was very poor. The best thing about the movie (and it's really just worth seeing) was the art - the movie has an incredibly intangible quality. the writing was not good. It was boring in parts and confusing in other parts, and there was no building of characters. I never really care that people have their heads ripped off, with a headless creature. I thought Johnny Depp had a good thing about his approach to the character, but since the text was weak, he couldn't go too far. And I was very annoyed by the efforts on a slight accent on his and Christina Ricci's parts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is not a good movie, and it is not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art.
