It's hard to believe there are a few people in the world who actually think it's a worthy Charles Bronson vehicle. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a good actor who can do more than a gun and can turn off bad guys. He was silent in the TV movie "Ja Virginia, there is a Santa Claus" and showed a lot of class and style in the Sean Penn directed "The Indian Runner". <br /> <br /> In "The Evil That Men Do This," Bronson again plays a character who sees injustice and fixes it with fists, knives and of course guns. There is nothing here that you haven't seen in the last five "Death Wish" flashes. <br /> <br /> Wait, I'll take it back. It should be the most sadistic and repellent violent movie. Bronson ever had the dissolution to be in. Not only repulsive in the scenes of torture or the description of torture, but in the fact that these scenes were placed in a movie to sell tickets. And Jose Ferrer! What did he do in blue bladder? I mean, he won an Oscar, crying out loud !!! <br /> <br /> Good, sorry about that eruption. Let me just say that "The Evil That Men Do" should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen based on a book. Yes that's right. I wonder if this was written with Bronson in mind? <br /> <br /> No stars. Instead of "Death Wish". At least it was topical.
