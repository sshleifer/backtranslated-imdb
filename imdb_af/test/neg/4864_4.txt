I rarely saw an action / tension click that was so boring. None of the action scenes are exciting. The story line is nothing special, except for some actors the play is bad. Charlie Sheen (Platoon, Major League) stars as the White House Head, who finds himself in the midst of a conspiracy that wants to kill him and more people. Donald Sutherland plays a friend he tells everything he can and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante's Peak) plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation. Charlie Sheen is OK as the star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who delivers a good performance. Linda Hamilton gives a poor performance. With a bad movie, I really like it if it's a good ending, but this movie has a very nice ending with a few almost smiling things.
