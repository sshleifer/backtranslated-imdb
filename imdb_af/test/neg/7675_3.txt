"Oh, your pilots are such men." "They don't call it the cabin for nothing, honey." Dialogue like this is just one of the reasons why The Concorde ?? Airport '79 (or, if you saw it in the UK where it towed, the heels released, Airport 80: The Concorde) was the last and by far the least of the range. The disaster movie was in the late 1970s, featuring The Swarm's many unintentional hilarity and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, when Time Ran Out and City on Fire offer a lot of boredom and the despair to find a new turn on the genre . is too clear here. This time it's a conspiracy plot, with Susan Blakely's news anchor woman discovering billionaire kid friend. Robert Wagner sells weapons to terrorists and North Vietnam. Of course she decides to tell him everything rather than make the story public, but he fobs her off by explaining: "I am a very rich man. I have everything in life that I can ever have. Why should I jeopardize it by doing something so incredibly stupid? "Just if she doesn't buy the line, rather than renting a hit to kill her on the ground, he decides to do the smart way through the plans to destroy the Concorde while flying to Paris via Moscow. "I've done a lot of things I'm ashamed of, but I'm not a murderer," he urged his way to reprogram a guided missile to destroy the plane. So, nothing unbelievable stupid there. And if it fails, he then sends a jet fighter. And when it fails? <br /> <br /> Don't even think of something that looks like logic: it is the real bottom of the bottom that even gave up the studio and marketed it as a comedy in the US after critics laughed. remove it from the screen. Where the previous three entries all had the appearance of shining big-budget entertainment, this tiny screen-friendly effort (the one not shot in the 2.35: 1 widescreen) may not even look good for the Concorde, which is quite ' a thing. TV veteran David Lowell Rich was presumably given the go-ahead because he was fast, inexpensive and had previously had TV movie SST: Disaster in the Sky where Peter Graves's supersonic plane could not land him because of sabotage and Senegalese flu (what not was not, deliberately at least a comedy despite the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the cast and looks like the natural choice for what looks like a $ 14m TV movie somehow in the theaters escaped when no one was watching. <br /> <br> Like a bad episode of Hollywood Squares, stars this time are very short, and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to be rounded off by rehab clinics and busted sitcoms. Alain Delon gives the Hollywood one-shot career as the "Happy Fish" pilot (don't ask). George Kennedy moves from the executive suite to the co-pilot's seat hoping to remind people of the other movies, while the rest of the ensemble includes some veterans of The Towering Inferno (Wagner and Blakely), " a soft porridge (Sylvia Kristel, who tries to respect), an Ingmar Bergman regular (Bibi Andersson ?? and she is the one who plays the hooker!), David Warner's diet co-driver with nightmares over what through bananas the voice of the devil (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and her Seeing Eye Chihuahua ("Dohn miscon-screw me"), Martha Raye and her weak blow, Jimmie Walker play the sax in his seat and smoke weeds in John (in the few moments she was not occupied by Martha Raye), Cicely Tyson kissed her credibility as the compulsory mother with a critically ill child and a frozen heart in the overall dressing room, airline owner Eddie Albert and trophy wife Sybil Danning is the best seat in the house is, Ed Begley Jr. in the spectacles, and the Russian Olympic team and their beloved coach Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhhh!) on a goodwill series from the States (who knew about the boycott? ). Just to add a touch of The Simpsons to the proceedings, Harry Shearer is voting one news story in the same tone that he later used for Smithers. <br /> <br /> Worth? Despite the impromptu wedding during an accident landing, it should only lead George Kennedy to divert a heat-seeking missile by opening the window, extending his arm (almost twice the speed of the sound!) And shoot a flare ?? while the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon turns off the engines so there won't be a "heat source" for the missiles to live in? Yes, someone was actually paid to write it, and someone was the future Oscar winner and author of Munich and the insider Eric Roth. (Hey, everyone has to start somewhere), but in his defense it was the manufacturer Jennings Lang who plotted. Still, what do you expect from a movie that deserves stunt balloons and ends with a shot of the Concorde flying in the sunset? Incredibly, in one of them, the moments of defeat that the studios used would not tend to take Universal a few years later, a few minutes later, into the network (not on the DVD). Unfortunately, the cash register failure led to the fifth entry in the series, the 1984 Laughing UFO Uphill Laughter riot never came off the ground. Even more tragic, it was the Concorde used in this movie that crashed 21 years later in France. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and if you're wondering what Charo tells her Chihuahua in non-subtitled Spanish if it's not allowed on board, that's "What do you think? Don't worry. When the revolution come, I promise you will fly on anything you want. I promise. What a shame, my love. What do they think they are? "
