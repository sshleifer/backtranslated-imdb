This movie was not good at all. I could catch it at a movie festival and didn't appreciate the content I was forced to watch. It's a well-shot movie about family who dies after the death of the family's cornerstone (Gabrielle Union). movie stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle's brother's brother. Well, actually, Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman Billy Dee Williams was older sister. It had to be Billy Dee William's greatest achievement in his career ever. He didn't seem to remember his lines in a few scenes. He was an unlikely, scarcely empathetic character, who took a daughter while married to a white woman, with whom he had a daughter. The two daughters are now older and while the daughter he had with the white woman (Lucy) tried to commit to him, his other daughter wanted nothing to do with him. Billy Dee's character was so pathetic that the only way they could leave him for Paris for his sister's funeral was to tell him that the funeral had already passed and that her late sister had the responsibility to handle her paperwork. . Why did they have to deceive him? Because he didn't like to attend funerals. I know. You ask, "but he didn't want to attend his own sister's funeral either?" Yes! He claims he did not like to be the forced feelings of emotions shared between the people who pay their respects. He didn't want anything to do with it. Now we're supposed to empathize with that? The rest of the shows in the film were flat with equally flat characters. The director and editor didn't mind considering the pacing of the movie. The flashbacks were painful to watch. It was a bad movie. However, it seems to be the favorite with black film festivals; A movie that relies on African Americans from Caucasians to find a love they can establish themselves, even if it's a healthy relationship. When lame love stories like this win the best of celebrations at the black film festivals, it makes me question the judgment of black people on film. In the same festivals, the only films that win awards are educational films about African American culture and black films directed by Caucasian directors. I'm not saying that something is wrong with a white person who directs stories written to people of color. The problems with these movies are that they never argue about both views, which are usually the movies that actually talk to the masses. These films are often one-sided forms of didactics. These films fail to perform the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is being reversed. The authors and directors never put together the scenes and empires that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. These films always have the argument overlooked. What I am saying is the people who run these black film festivals judge a pure content movie, which means they condemn director, acting, cinematography, editing, etc., or movies, of strict delivery of the message about African American culture? Should we expect a movie like Constellation to have a shot in the world against movies like Million Dollar Baby and Sideways? What happened to movie entertainment? When I am entertaining, I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen, investing a tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfactory, meaningful emotional experience. Why can't these festivals appreciate movies without preaching? Why can't these black film festivals acknowledge movies that are well-told of work that is brutally honest, to tell the truth? "I believe we have no responsibility to heal social diseases or renew faith in humanity, elevate the spirits of society or even express our inner being. We have only one responsibility: to tell the truth." - Robert McKee. Now it's something I totally agree with. The same black film festivals put Hustle and Flo off as if they were the horrible movie stereotyping blacks. However, it is an honest movie about a pimp with a dream. A Pimp Can't Dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp that he was a man. And isn't it they, pimp and prostitution are a harsh reality in our society in general, not just in the black community, but everywhere? The forces in "black Hollywood" believe that movies like these African Americans look bad in the eyes of others, as if others don't know there are pimps in the hood. The truth is, until African American people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, then our films will never have a chance in the world. This movie was terrible. The best thing was the cinematography and Zoe.
