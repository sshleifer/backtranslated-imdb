I had a very difficult time sitting through this movie. Unless you're really very pro-adultery and like to hear people talking endlessly about their sexual exploitation, I can't see how you can enjoy this movie. Geez - most of the main characters acted like rhombus, and they spit out their many unreliability. Over the only element of this, I appreciated the ILLNESS scene where one character urinates and blood has plundered everywhere because he picked up an STD --- GREAT REVIEW!?! Hmm. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD movie, watch the sequel, Barbarian Invasions. Despite the general unlikely nature of many of the characters, the successor is VERY involved and more realistic - worth your time.
