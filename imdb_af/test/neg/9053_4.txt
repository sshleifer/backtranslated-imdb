Geetet Alive is a small film opened in New York City and the Arctic where tribal men shoot snake poison at a few people. Then comes a woman in the police station trying to disappear her sister who disappears after 6 months. Sheila is from Alabama, but her accent sucks, she is with an adventurer who apparently only wants her money and seems to say a lot through the movie. They venture through the Amazon alone to find a community of people and they find the sister, again confronted by a crazy man who probably saw one too many Jim Jones preachers. He'll bring them to a better place, it can be heaven, but no, Mark and Sheila later find themselves a cult of suicide. <br /> <br /> Why do I call Al eat a "small movie"? I'll tell you, but when I looked at it, I was flowing through all the cannibals. Robert Kerman has a different role as his professor in the cannibal holocaust. He's a little annoying as soon as we meet him at an arm-wrestling match that looks like the Russian roulette, we know he's a tough man. Just the strong misfortune just makes you approach and I seem to have seen somewhere, o the screens of animals that kill each other. But the whole movie turns on those scenes. a picture of nature with parts of a movie But after watching this movie, I realized that most of the movie scenes were taken from other cannibal movies, even the death of 2 of the characters. Well, most of the movie is. That's why I call it a little movie, when I found out that scenes were borrowed, I felt like throwing the disk over the room, it's not a movie, just a simple fitting of kinds.
