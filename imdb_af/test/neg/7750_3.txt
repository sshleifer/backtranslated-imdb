Even in her glasses, geek mode, Kathy Ireland is very easy on the eyes, but her acting is not easy to watch. Most of the actors in the film also make it to the top (outside "campy fun") or get a little embarrassed to be there. The effects and soundtrack are nothing special and reasonably low budget. The plot line really extends the ability to suspend unbelief. Catch this one to laugh when it comes to a premium movie channel or network Saturday afternoon TV, but don't save money on this thing. <br /> <br /> One worthy mention for trivia purposes is that one of the underground gangsters is played by Deep Roy. Deep is now known to play all the Oompa Loompas in Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
