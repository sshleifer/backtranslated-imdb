And also a great start, a real quick start. It keeps your desire and waiting for it to come. Unfortunately, the high adrenaline evaporates quickly, but after half of the film is definitely over. <br /> <br /> And this is a pity, because this movie has many good ideas and thoroughly explores many of them. But this is also one of his mistakes. By exploring too many things, it is mixed on many things, so in the end you are too confused to follow any plot or characters. It is very dark and moody, but it doesn't help much if it is also genre-hopping just to try and everything in the story!
