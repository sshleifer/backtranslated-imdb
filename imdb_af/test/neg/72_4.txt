Oh my ... bad clothes, worse sense music and worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80s are back in revenge in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, ordered by infamous Joe D'D'Aato at the production office and short-term director (thank you for little miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti. As a sort of successor to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (called La Casa), Witchery offers some modest Gore groceries and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A blend of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film pushes off the scene to another without dropping some serious woodworking and hilarious day and night mixes. This is the progression to an expected end, with a serious WTF surprise climb. (I just like the look of her face ...). Surprisingly, Laurenti gets some tension and air of malice in little - very few scenes; Undoubtedly for him, these few smiles of soft film magic are going down quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> The plus edges are experienced when the gore hits it. This department is fairly effective and entertaining in the classic latex and red paint style of the 80's Italo-Gore, when things are 100% handcrafted and so shocking and lively as modest budgets. I could only look with sadistic rejoicing and few laughter all the top ways that silly characters (and actors) abused and abused one by one. I just felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently was not left to try anyone other than that good old-fashioned girlfriend / female roles in his career, or he seems to be reviewing his filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, people - not much more to tell, and even less to tell from home. Don't expect too much if you spend a rainy afternoon with it, and you'll probably experience at least some gentle fun. It also helps if your rotten heart pound in the beating of 80's euro-gore horror. And to speak heartily - every movie that Dawid Hasselhoff drew through a large metal object and correctly bleeds in the room and corridors, MUST be in the right place. <br /> <br /> That's my truth - what's yours?
