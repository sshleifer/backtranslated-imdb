Wow! That James Purefoy looks exactly like Thomas Jane! <br /> <br /> This is the most profound thought I took with me after seeing George and the dragon. For a fantasy comedy the story was very boring and the effects are unclear. <br /> <br /> The problem was not the play. James Purefoy makes a good knight, and his different lace heads are not bad characters. I even thought Patrick Swayze in this role was also a good idea. Flat-Chested Piper Perabo also had a great potential. I even liked the child. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything that happens and the * way * it just happened to be "eh". Not interesting. Compared to another recent fantasy comedy, Ella Enchanted, who was actually funny, this movie comes terribly short. I'm sorry for the decent actors who were jammed in this yawn-inducing. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
