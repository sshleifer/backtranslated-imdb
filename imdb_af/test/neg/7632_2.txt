Sorry, I couldn't be more expressive in my summary, but these two words described the movie perfectly. It's not just a bad movie, but a bad movie with bad acting and a plot that will be essential to most viewers. <br /> <br /> Just look for a naked Rebecca De Mornay linked to a chain link. and groaning with 'ecstasy presumably' erotic ', but actually hilarious. <br /> <br />
