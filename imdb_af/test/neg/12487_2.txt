A remake can be successful. An adjustment can be successful. It is irrelevant whether it is a remake or an adjustment. <br /> <br /> A good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie, regardless. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid, Sarkar was a very poor movie. First, just by making characters dangerous, or macho, don't bring an aura over them. <br /> <br /> What was so brilliant about Nagre (Amitabh Bacchan's character) that we should have been in the aura of his "strength" and what showed the "goodwill" of the character? Nothing. <br /> <br /> This fact was said by a commentator and Amitabh gave facial expressions. Now, Amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions, but why it should mean something if there is no history or story to go with it. <br /> <br /> There was no proper mapping of the characters that also worked under 'sarkar'. Just because a man had glasses, why should we assume he's wise. ] The movie of the movie was generally dull because screens of the Godfather were created (like beating Abhishek Bacchan), the older brother murdered by Abhishek (as Fredo was murdered on Pacino's instructions), but too much sought is to pack the movie with too little story and depth to go with it. That was indeed the problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to pack 3 hours of complicated details like a godfather in 2 hours and also with a few dialogues you get is a highlight of a cricket match, never To the make a full impact to see a full game.
