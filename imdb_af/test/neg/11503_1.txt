I think it was just like Lizzie McGuire, except that it was much worse than the original. The only thing that is different is that she loves animals and science, and all the spiritual things. everything else is the same. she likes a guy that she is too nervous to ask. And later she finds a guy like her and she has no idea. I think people should stop making the same kind of shows. And another thing that is the same is that it is always, the friends are two girls and one man. Don't think that these things get old and tired and these ideas are still used over and over and yet they stick to these ideas. but I know people who see this show and I know they love them.
