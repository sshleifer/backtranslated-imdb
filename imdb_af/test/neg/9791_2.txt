Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie played by Julius Harris. I didn't see all his movies, but Julius Harris was in very good movies and I remember him the best of "Live and Let The" where he was Tee-Hee and what was full of Voodoo references, something common here in South Florida prevent! I always thought LIVE AND LET THE was a good movie because it had some atmosphere and mysticism, unlike most of the 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo persona! He has a good style of mystery and the occult, and his role in this movie is excellent. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is something of a comedy. SPOILERS: Three kids who seem to have been fired from the film by THE LITTLE RASCALS, are killed by a nearby hoodlum who seems to have been dismissed from FAME's role! or as a dancer at DICK CLARK'S AMERICAN TIRE. In other words, these children give LOW BUDGET a different dimension. Julius Harris goes to the mortuary funeral home, cuts off the three children's heads (and no one knows) and then takes them to his Condominium Unit where he has a huge boiler boiling water. The three heads are thrown in, along with some herbs, spices and Voodoo items. At a certain time, Mr. Harris had the ugly little heads on a table and he spilled his blood on them, and they came to life as talking heads! They can fly, make jokes, roll their eyes and exact revenge on the Bose Doers. They usually look pretty funny, but the effects aren't bad. For some reason, one of the children always has a switch in his mouth, and he uses it to cut people's necks and cut holes. This movie is strange and funny, but only the first time you see it. Meg Foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays a male leader of the local gangsters. Strange movie.
