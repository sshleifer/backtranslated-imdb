Still, it's not nice enough to make it enjoyable. In fact, this one is just boring. It's done pretty well, although the writing is bad, the effects are OK and the acting average. (In addition to James Mason who is always wonderful, but in this one under-use) <br /> <br /> I suppose it's hard to write anything about this movie because it hasn't made any response in me what ever it is . <br /> <br /> Dull, boring, boring, boring, boring.
