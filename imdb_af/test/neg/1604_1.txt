Very boring display. What's worse, it's very racist. The white guys are stupid idiots and the only romance is between a black man and a white woman. There is nothing interesting about this romance, it's not exciting, it's not nice, they don't even care about each other, it's more like the writers and directors who are intrusive. Why is it so popular in the media today? It's social programming and will lead to nothing, there is always tension when too many people want the same. This show is not worth the $ 20 for the season, it's a waste of time and harmful to society. At least when they use TV shows to sell products, they are more strategic. The sale of any agenda here is very clear. And without clear thinking, some may feel wrong in resisting it, but some of us know better.
