Let's get one thing straight; It was BAD! So, say it doesn't even qualify to hit someone's memories. <br /> <br /> The repeated story (whose constant retrieval of not only jokes but story lines and character shows.) A typical story goes as follows; Sue (the mother) opens the episode with the quotation of how she loves her baby son, but smells awful (As if it's not getting old, ha-de-bloody-har!), See some Australian quasi-nationalist "bogan" seems to say how she thinks she is wonderful because she is an ozzie while everything / everyone who doesn't suck before they disappear for the rest of the episode. (a mercy) <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot turns to the father (Gary) who comes in some disagreement with Sue and he talks to members of his group for advice on how to sort. <br /> <br /> The phrase "words fail me" is an old one, but that's where it's most true to say. It's so awesome BAD! So surprisingly, I would like each track of its existence to be sent to the lowest depths of the North Sea and life to continue. <br /> <br /> However, it is sad to see someone as good as Sally Bretton (good actress, I love her) talking about herself, Ardal O Hanlon (My Hero aside) has the ability to reasonably to be funny - but not here - and Ben Elton, who is distinguished for so many good things, somehow succeeds in doing so. ... then comedy is in very serious trouble!
