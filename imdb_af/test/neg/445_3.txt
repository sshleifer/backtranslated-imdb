One day there was a big American movie. Which combined horror and comedy with equal excitement. This film contains clever direction. Pioneering special effects and wonderful comic and serious acting. It was titled An American Werewolf in London. 'Sixteen years later, the long-awaited successor was finally pinned on the billboard outside your local theater. Surely it would have at least some of the original excitement. Think again. An American Werewolf in Paris' is an incomprehensible mess from beginning to pitiful finish. The problems start with the leading man. Tom Everett Scott's performance is stiff and tiring. From the beginning, he seems to prove that all young people are simpletons. In his defense, even a seasoned Shakespeare aunt could not have obtained a good performance from the young and unnecessary dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's late friends, whose soul is doomed to walk the Earth after being hijacked by one of the werewolves, can eventually leave for the afterlife. He then kicks Scott and his friends. "Okay guys, see you." What a memorable goodbye. July Delphy appears soon as Scott's mysterious European love interest. Basically, she is a French girl playing the French girl. It's not much of a stretch. But all this stupidity is not even the most disappointing thing about the movie. The special effects, such an integral part of the beautiful original film, fall very short in this flop. The werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how good you form a cartoon with nerve lycanthropic muscles. It's still hard to be afraid of a cartoon. Thus, the holiday-American gang, led by ultra-weak Scott, still keeps excuses to return to the werewolf's catacombs. Here it is much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer fortified creatures or absurd animals under the guise of darkness. Some said that if you don't watch this movie as a successor, it's not that bad. I disagree, this movie cannot stand alone, and is even more of a shame compared to the brilliant original. If it is not to be regarded as a prosecution, it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film. I don't care how much you are werewolves. Or how much did you worship "American Werewolf in London"? as I did myself. This one is simply not worth wasting your time. "Okay guys, see you." Awful. 3 out of a possible 10 T.H.
