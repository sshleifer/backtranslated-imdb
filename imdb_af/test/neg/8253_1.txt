Large-scale suspension of unbelief is required where Will's "genius" is involved. Not only in maths - he is also well-read in economic history, capable of various shrinkage, etc. Shrinking. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they are there, they can have as much "S" on their chest, which flies faster than a plane and bullets stop. <br /> <br /> Among other issues ... true genius (regarding the moment the problem of what it really is and whether it deserves such an indifferent tribute) does not simply appear / ex nihilo /. It is never so multi-faceted. And it is rarely appreciated by contemporaries. <br /> <br /> Better to make will be a basketball wonder. Except that Damon is too short.
