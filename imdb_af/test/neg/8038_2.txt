This is one of the "family" movies I can't imagine, I greatly appeal to someone over the 9-year-old. A group of brothers and sisters discovered a "sandfee" (yes, really) conveniently at the end of a non-secret passage in the country's home of their eccentric uncle, from whom they were evacuated from the London flash. ... And there you have it, all in one sentence. The story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of fulfilling wishes, but none of these issues are being explored in a way that will be interesting for adults or pupils for children (or vice versa!). The only reason I can think of is to see how strong Freddie Highmore's outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.
