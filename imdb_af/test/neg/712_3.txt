Delivered at a time when Duvivier was again in power. "Black Jack", which was closed between the extraordinary "Au Royaume des Cieux" and the spectacular, wonderful Sauce Le Ciel de Paris, is a jumble that Duvivier itself hates, which is not surprising. There is almost nothing to write about this dud. We can see that: <br /> <br /> 1.Orson Welles admired the Duvivier. This may explain why Wellesian actors appeared in Duvivier's movies: Joseph Cotten in "Lydia" (1941), and here Agnes Moorehead is completely lost. This is the first time. <br /> <br /> I didn't enjoy Moorehead's performance, but Welles borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier). From Duvivier's "Au Royaume des Cieux" for his "Othello". <br /> <br /> 2. In any Duvivier movie there are one or two valuable rows and this one is no exception: the search in the caves where Duvivier's sense of mystery works wonders (for a short while ), then the chase when Dalio is caught is a fishing net. Duvivier's touch can also be felt in the unfortunate end. <br /> <br /> As for the rest, as my dear pen-writer's reign writes, it's a black joke.
