It is difficult to respond to this movie. It's one of those little movies. Dimension didn't actually lie (it's hard to come up with a reason) and it is rushed to an insignificant 500 theaters. This is opening day. Maybe Dimension was scared of how people would respond to a swamp using his trailer to pull a house apart. <br /> <br /> Ray Sawyer is just a trailer driver until he saves a Voodoo priestess from a bad car accident, and in return he is attacked by a bag of snakes and drowning. At the mortuary, Ray comes back to life and stems a group of teenagers who have seen the terrible accident. <br /> <br /> What brings this movie down, it's paper thin characters. I didn't care for any of them for one moment. The dialogue was also less than ho-hum. It was also very predictable. Characters have the typical dumb horror movie character stuff, such as ticking sounds, calling people's names, and traveling on a rock while being chased. I can also immediately choose who the final girl would be. And why did the camera have those quick white flashes when someone was killed or when the killer was shown? <br /> <br /> What's good? Well, there is an impressive tension scene where the killer goes underwater to get to his victims and a tense series where the final girl has to camouflage herself with a lot of other bodies while the killer looks. <br /> <br /> However, this is another disappointment in August / September. I'm looking forward, but I didn't get what was expected.
