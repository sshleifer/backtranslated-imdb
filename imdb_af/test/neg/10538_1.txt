My Tasks: Of course, Steven Seagal is too boring to be a lead in an action thriller, even a completely dull one. <br /> <br /> Remember Steven Seagal? You don't? Don't worry, there's not much to catch up with. After Seagal starred in admirable crowd-pleasing films such as UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, hit the low ground of the bad movie ground. Now he is staring in low budgeted B-level action vehicles, some of which are television entries "Movie of the Week" that have lost their way to the big screen. HALF PARTY DEATH is under this, we will say, dead action flicks. A hard and loosely action movie, sloppy and lazy (and worse, poorly performed). It's one of those bad movies I don't need to look to the end to know it's bad. I didn't bother to die all my braincells while wasting my time with it. It's these kind of bad movies you realize, the other movies you hate are not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The plot (and venue) is being lifted from a similar picture, Michael Bay's THE ROCK, although similar, may not be the word to describe it. Both movies are summer movies, and not meant to be taken so seriously. But in comparison, even THE ROCK (which is not much in the writing department, it is more than characters, a more compelling plot, better performance and overall, a more entertaining atmosphere. Although there are action scenes in half past , nothing exciting about them, although it is sometimes boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> Although predictability was a welcome asset in summer action movies, predictability has never tasted sour in those who aren't fun, and half a past is never very nice, many times it is just a pain in the head (hear the bad rap music repeat over and over through the whole movie, let me hear every aspect every two seconds) The acting is terribly mediocre , the plot is derived, with no compelling or attractive characters whatsoever. Seagal's character, a sheltered agent sent to Alcatraz to stop a criminal master brain (Morris Chestnut), a very boring villain, is nothing to excite not become Seagal's character also provided with a sidekick (played by rap star Ja Rule) and a lot of amigo prisoners. There is no chemistry going on. <br /> <br /> As a star in a series of other forgotten action vehicles (which were those movies again?) killed from Seagal's career for good, half-dead is overkill. And audiences are warned: you are invited to feel the pain. Advice: Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 5.
