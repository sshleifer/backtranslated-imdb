After seeing Shootfighter 1, and the bucket of blood they poured out, I was ready for another bounty of open-handed heart massage, and chiropractic in a cage. But nooooooo, it was like the Barney version of the first movie, with the lame of the Karate child. At least Bolo Yeung is still kicking booty, although he has to do more movies like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
