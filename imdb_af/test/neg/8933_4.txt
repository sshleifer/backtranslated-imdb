"Flashdance" meets "Meatballs III" or maybe it should just be called "Meatballs IV". This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, mainly because he still has something about J.V. cheerleaders have. As someone has said, "It's good, more than fine, but as you get older, you have to iron out. Whether you want to or not, society demands it." <br /> <br /> "Gimme An F" has the best JV cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a lovely Alicia Silverstone before her "Clueless" days. Wesley hates Miller's other movie, the horrible "Teen Wolf Too" three years later, where she plays a capricious southern belle, like Martha Smith's character in "Animal House". Personally, I admire Miller's series, as the two characters can no longer be different and she is both convincing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Ann is a naive beginner cheerleader from Moline (a member of The Lucky Ducks Group) who comes to Camp Beaverview for cheerleading instruction. She is befriended by Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the leader of the tough girl group, called "The Demons". Jenna is protected by Mary Ann after her main rival has an immediate dislike for Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Later, Mary Ann gets a crush on Tommy Hamilton, the chief instructor. Tommy spends his summer struggle with the dilemma of growing and continuing. This is a problem, as his only skills are cheerleading teaching and sophisticated dance routines in the shower for the enjoyment of viewers who have that kind of thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's long-suffering friend, she has a well-adapted attitude and an experienced perspective. She even tolerates Tommy's flirting with Mary Ann's trust that Tommy won't actually benefit from young Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> While these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm, the supporting role is almost as poor as the material they need to work with. It's a pity that they brought a real comic relief to the production, it would be a decent movie. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a social climbing and terminal greasy instructor who goes to the camp's money hungry owner Bucky. And there are still some with a thing for the characters of Mad Max. Since nothing is very funny, you just stay a cute semi-romance and some good dance routines. <br /> <br /> An effort is being made to create a tension by slowly training to a final competition, but unless it is your first. movie experience the outcome is never in doubt. And there is a story about some Japanese businessmen. Bucky wants to get money, but it doesn't happen dramatically or comically. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
