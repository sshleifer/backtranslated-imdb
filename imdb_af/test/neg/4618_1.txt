** Can be considered a few soft spoilers, but no more than anyone else's review of this movie. ** <br /> <br /> I knew nothing could lead to the absolute glory of the original "Carrie". It was more of a film about social criticism than it was about igniting the gym on fire. Carrie White was a victim, and her story conveyed the helplessness that the real exploits should feel. <br /> <br /> Whoever thought the Rachel character for "The Rage" had completely missed Carrie's subtleties. . "For the audience to really share the victim's anger, he must be a sympathetic character - a true outcast who is more than a victim of circumstances than his own possessions. to convey emotional depth and connection of Sissy Spacek's "Carrie" and she looks and acts as if she should be right next to the "attractive and popular brigade" that she is about to. A soul that is just as corrupt, while Carrie was completely innocent. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work There is no satisfaction to see the beautiful children - not even the "Home Improvement" bed - in the climate scene, and it is so unnecessarily gory! There was no real bloodshed in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And there is one person in particular that this movie should NOT have to kill ... but I won't tell who it is, if you saw the original "Carrie", this is the kind of character that dies unfairly. <br /> <br /> At least they appropriately made that connection to Carrie; This is explained as it should have been. But this, and the poor tattoo, which was done pretty well, is just the only thing this movie is about. <br /> <br /> Another terrifying "Scream" knock-off, which retains the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. I didn't expect much, but I was still terribly disappointed. An intrepid character, a series of annoying pop culture references spoken without good reason, and an end scene that compares to Carrie's tombstones.
