Spoilers are abundant. You're warned. <br /> <br /> I was thoroughly disappointed, this is my first STREET FIGHTER movie I've seen (I dare not close to the 1994 joke). Very little grab your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The battles were hilariously done aboard (Shun versus Zangief was heavier) and the dramatization was far too naughty, especially at the end when Ryu had to control everything in his fight against his brother. <br /> <br /> The main street fighter, Ryu, is weakening to a much darker interior of himself. Frustration in the control of this darkness is further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A harmful street battle tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter's mind. <br /> <br /> What's with the artist's drawing of feet? Any anime that is pulled above the stomach is impressive. The soft nature of the story makes the STREET FIGHTER genre too intelligent and puts much more emphasis on a character (Shun), it's not even a fighter in the video game! A character study of more than just the core stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times have you caught Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO does not have the imagination of the video game.
