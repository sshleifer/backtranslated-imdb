I will not vote this movie as a terrible one, mainly because I was like it, I was one of those summer days that I was so nice to do something and decided to rent a movie in the stupid part of the video store . In addition, I didn't sleep before and the movie woke me up. Let's start the autopsy. OK, the movie has a strange plot. First, isolation, there is an expedition, they are isolated in an island. because there is no gas on the boat, so there is no single convincing performance on the actor section. The main problem begins with the isolation idea, the POV of a snake and then another ... then another, then snakes that change, then false talk, many of them, and if we believe the movie is going well for the movie that misses the tension, we fail because after ten or eleven races we don't get carried away, the one scene that reveals everything is the scene when we see a drunk lesbian show watched by snakes that appear to be dance. After that it is not a horror adventure, but a comedy-driven movie, the adventure part is also discarded. /> <br /> For me, the problem in a movie is the third act, it's the one section that just drives the movie for an already estimated conclusion, or if it succeeds, we didn't notice it, as A ninja smokes in our eyes. Snake Island has a bad conclusion, it all comes to an "end to the book", with a confrontation, persecution and escape order, it was predictable in the moment I rented the dam copy. The other real problem is concept, concept is very important, that's why you believe that dinosaurs come to life or a body full of stings that just want to live, the main concept about snakes who want revenge on human torture after decades Civilization, though ... hmmm, just doesn't sound like the wall. One thing you will enjoy (if you see it with an open mind) is the more bz sections, naked lesbian girls, a few amateur camera angles, the brain homage with the lawn mowers, the black man doesn't die and that's all. .. if you want to see snakes, black dudes and comedy and you prefer bigger budgets, see "snakes on a plane". <br /> <br /> Hasta moviegoers
