First, this film works in the fact that it is disturbing. I really didn't like seeing all these scenes where people are cut alive. The strange erotic introduction gives a feeling of necrophilic wonder. It's somewhat ... for me personally unpleasant. But the movie really works in that respect, and it is encouraged to be scary, so I give it credit. Yup, a few points for those scalpels and .... well, damn alarming idea to be alive. <br /> <br /> But what this movie lacks is an interesting plot, characterization or true surprises. The whole teen movie horror genre usually goes in a very simple, predictable way. Many "tense" moments, creepy guys who are mad, and the big question of everyone: is the boyfriend the killer? This movie fits the category "Scream" and many others that originated in the 90s. Well, I won't spoil it for you, but it's not exactly who the murderer is. We find out who is halfway there ... and from there, the movie pushes and tries to fill in for a while ... rather annoying to say the least. I look at the watch a bit on this movie. <br /> <br /> The main actress is great as usual, but the cardboard box she puts in place hurts the pain ... the college girl who is a detective who thinks everyone is crazy, but she is the one who really knows what's going on. And the policemen? Aghh, they just laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable, flat, sometimes disturbing and mostly boring and boring. It's like a US movie company has taken a flight to Germany to make a movie to make it strange ..... hmmm ..... or did they? <br /> <br />
