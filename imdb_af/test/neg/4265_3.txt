There is nothing wrong with showing that an old man falls in love with a young girl. Lolita did this. American Beauty did it. <br /> <br /> But. They did it subtly. They did not make it clear from the start that the director built them up to fall in love with each other. Not as natural as two people would (Age bar), but force them to be each other as if they were SUPPOSED to fall in love. <br /> <br /> All in all, there had to be chemistry. That would have solved the biggest problem. People with discussions on the subject would also have been judged and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, regardless of impracticality. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe Jia's character at times. What I find harder to understand is why Vijay - a serious photographer and artist - is interested in a girl who was so clumsy. Unless he himself hid a frivolousness in himself, that didn't come out at all. <br /> <br /> There are many uses of Dutch corners or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is usually used to show something unnatural or something that can lead to something that is not right. So the RGV calls the relationship unnatural. <br /> <br /> The camera angles, background score, editing, and even the contrast of shots and symbology emphasize and elevate their relationship. Is the Indian audience so stupid that in 10 different ways we have to tell something we need to understand? Especially when the two of them were together, it was clear what had happened. What was the need to slow down the scene with dramatic background music? I feel the topic is very well chosen. But Verma did not always have to keep the film in mind that it is a controversial subject. If it is, handle it carefully, why don't you?
