I read the book 'Scarlett' and for the first time expected a good movie. I'm afraid to say I was disappointed. The movie didn't follow the book and made many changes I didn't like. <br /> <br /> One of the changes I didn't like the way Lord Fenton was portrayed. It doesn't make sense to make him a bad man. The way things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett were very different and their whole relationship was too intimate. <br /> <br /> There was also a lot less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the movie than originally written in the book. The movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways, and they often didn't have enough roads to make it seem like there was still love between them. A good movie, but I think it might have been better if it was, it became more true for Alexandra Rippley's book.
