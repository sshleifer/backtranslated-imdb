"Tokyo Eyes" tells of a 17-year-old Japanese girl who, like a man hunted by her big hunter, is a policeman. This lame flick is about 50% filler and 50% talk, talk, and talk more. You will see the less than three star cast while talking on the bus, playing video games, talking and getting a haircut, talking and walking and walking and talking, talking on cell phones, hanging out and talking, etc. as you read captions are waiting for something to happen. The thin scratch of a story is not enough to support a film with low end-production value, a slender role, and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama ... Just incessant yadayadayada ' ing. (C-)
