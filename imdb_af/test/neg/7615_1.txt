I am and was a serious collector of Christmas related films, TV shows, holidays, etc. For over twenty-five years. Please keep my warning and don't be fooled by sterling reviews and media hype about this movie. It's not a Muppett movie as we got to know it and is definitely not for kids. The fact that it was manufactured for a large TV network is / was no surprise considering their level of business. What is hard to believe is that the Jim Henson organization has been so low-priced in getting involved in this Christmas transvest. I wish there were reviews for me to read that would have warned me before wasting my hard earned money on this piece. from the trash.
