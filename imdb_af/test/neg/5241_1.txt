<br /> <br /> I watched this movie during a festival here in Munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans. At about the middle of the film one part of the audience slept and the other side was fascinating. Drilling dialogues, badly choreographed battle order, a terribly stupid story and even worse special effects. Well, at least the actors didn't have much to do, except to worry them or (if they were female) to show their breasts in the right light. Even GÃ¶tz Otto, who was under the audience, then admitted that the spirit could understand the disappointment of the viewers. Be warned, people, of the cheapest fantasy movie ever ........
