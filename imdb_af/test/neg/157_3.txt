The (DVD) movie "The Tempest", led by Jack Bender, was published in 2001. It did not come to German theater and the director or an actor could not receive a major award for this movie. The film refers to the Shakespeare play "The Tempest" published at the end of the 16th century. The director tried to create a modern version of this play, but failed. At the start of the movie, the plantation owner Prosper is in conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of their slaves. Antonio puts his brother on a journey and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch, Prosper can escape and flee with his daughter and a slave Ariel to a small island near the Mississippi River. For more than twelve years he has been isolated on this island, to a happy opportunity enabling him to take revenge on his brother. If Prosper will be happy, find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this movie is really a bad attempt to create a modern version of the original play by William Shakespeare. The story of the movie is confusing as well as the characters. Prosperity does not have the same power as in the storm. END OF PART I
