To be a great street fighter and enjoy the previous movie, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, I really look forward to this one! <br /> <br /> However, the movie doesn't seem to have any real sense of direction or purpose. Most characters I could not associate and it just lacked the intense action that made the other street sweeper film so superior. <br /> <br /> There are some good points but the animation is great !!!
