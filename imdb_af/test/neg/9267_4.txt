With an inexpensive newly opened pound shop, I thought it was worth checking if they were cheap DVDs that look good. And while the back of the cover made this sound like a Jeepers Creepers-type movie, it's actually an anthology movie! and thought one or two of the stories felt very familiar. It's still a fun light horror / comedy. The Plots: <br /> <br /> Story One: The Classic. <br /> <br /> A young couple feel it's time to try and prove their financial life by picking up a $ 1500 car. But if the man gets a car, start a car with him. The car (called Banns) says getting everything he ever wanted in life should buy Bans for $ 5,000. So while guys crumble relationships, Bans does everything he can to show who is really in control. <br /> <br /> Story two: Food culture. <br /> <br /> A man who might be thrown out of his landlord, Due to his messy apartment, he discovers a tuna paste in his fridge for six months, now it has grown and develop into a green, temperate version of himself! And as they start out as friends, they end up with a big fall, leading to a final battle to see if the real guy or his fridge will survive. <br /> <br /> Story Three: Too Good to Be True. <br /> <br /> A girl is signing up with a dating agency and she gets a custom man that's perfect for her. But she's not sure the man is too perfect, and if she thinks she sees him "shut down" she starts haunting. Watch the movie: <br /> <br /> The first thing I need to mention is the grading for the movie in England, where it has received an eighteen rating, even thinking it has no nudity, curse or blood everyone. And the other weird thing about all the stories is that they all have happy ends, where the goodies win! And while the first story is too close to the Stephen King classic Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the movie. , with director Tom Parkinson making the usefulness of the story, feels like a low-budget Muppets episode! <br /> <br /> Final view on the movie <br /> <br /> While it's a bit of a remake; feel, they are enough wackiness to make it a good horror "comedy".
