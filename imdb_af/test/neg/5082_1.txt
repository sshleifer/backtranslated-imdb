Honestly, I'm surprised to see that this movie becomes relatively good reviews. I will be quite honest and say that the only reason I even got it is because of Ryan Phillippe, not for reasons that are particularly related to his abilities as an actor. Although I think over the past few years he has shown that he was a better actor than his first major roles in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> As far as action / tension movies go, this movie thrives in almost every respect. The play is good, but the writing is absolutely terrible and makes very little sense, a fact that the filmmakers are trying to cover by adding absurd references to the Chaos theory, as if it would convince someone that the movie is actually clever . "- but again, based on other reviews, some were. Don't be deceived: the writing is a boring, distracted mess and no other element of the movie makes it out. Wesley Snipes probably never had a less interesting role in a movie, and Statham is a thoroughly dull actor. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
