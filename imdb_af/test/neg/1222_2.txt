It will be a pity if Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval ever see this movie, as they will probably be associated with it in the coming years. "Oh yes," the public will say, "Comanche Moon," it's the mini-series about the Texas Rangers and the Comanche Indians who knew Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval. It was a real stinker and probably the worst movie they ever were. I think it was a comedy, but not a very funny comedy. I really don't understand why they agreed to be in it. "It would be so wrong if the original" Lonesome Dove "was a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and Jones and Duval will be remembered.
