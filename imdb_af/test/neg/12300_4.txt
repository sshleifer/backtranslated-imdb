"The 4th Floor" is a mediocre movie with Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a big neighbor. Jane (Lewis) recently got a huge 5th floor apartment from her grandmother, and by agreement with the landlord, gets a ridiculously low rental. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a creepy weather man) wants her to move with him, but she wants her own space. So she moves in, and strange things are going on, and because it's a B-grade horror movie, there's a stupid, non-to-be-in-fact reason. As the non-intriguing Jane stays trying to tell others - her boyfriend, police, colleagues - what's going on, everyone thinks she's losing it. So, of course, she must face the problem - the uncomfortable life right under her alone. Not scary or interesting. The movie's single-saving grace is Lewis. She is a very good actress, but is poorly used here, which is not the best thing about this movie - because she is. She has feral charisma and keeps the screen better than a dozen of silicone bimbos that regularly populate this type of film. However, this kind of movie is not worthy - which is ironic, as she is probably the only reason why anyone will see it.
