After a while I did not review anything about this, but after I had the inconvenience of sitting through this garbage, I expressed my thoughts. <br /> <br /> Usually, how bad it is, there is one stand-alone part, whether it was a good actor, a sensible scene, an attractive role-player or a general feel. Unfortunately, this is not true, as the movie starts with horror, with a ludicrous shooting, which was so poor, I thought it was an exercise, and two half-white, otherwise known as the blue-eyed boys next to a school. chat. br /> <br /> One of these idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only died of it, but also actually managed to get this garbage out, and unlike his brothers, he could not cough up. Not that he was alone here, as everyone appears to be at the acting school of a trained chimpanzee. Fortunately, for me, I only watched one hour of this masterpiece, as the DVD won't work and is probably made by the same fools who made it. So if you have nothing to do but look paint dry, watch it as it's just as boring and ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests.
