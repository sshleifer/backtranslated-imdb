The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof, which launches you to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of "Drake & Josh" celebrity, personally I would have given the movie to Josh which is much more funny) and the "Rick Punchers" -grap is picked up straight from the plane, so the authors seem to scramble for ideas for this movie. Rick's class is on a science trip to The Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we meet the 1 star name in the movie, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG), with Dr Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically engineered dragonfly, where his forces come from. <br /> <br /> We meet our next big star names at Rick's home, his aunt Lucille (Marion Ross from Happy Days boast) and uncle Albert Leslie Nielson from the plane, Police group and Naked Gun celebrity). And we were introduced to Carlson on the Amalgamated Board of Directors (Dan Castellaneta of The Simpsons) who are then killed very quickly. We are told Rick slept for 5 days and gets some cheap, crazy sexual oriented scenes designed to give the teen-masculine audience. The Stephen Hawking Lookalike's scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesn't work and isn't funny. <br /> <br /> We get another Spiderman spoof (Rick catches the girl and all the planets) but the movie has to end right there as Jill is hit in the head by a bowling ball that would break her skull and killed her stone death. You will see Rick's 1st forces come forth (gripping ability and speed) then his 1st salvation that goes very wrong. We also get an input reference that is in very poor taste indeed. We get a look back and a Batman spoof in which we find Rick alone responsible for the death of his parents. Spoofing Spiderman again Ricks Uncle was shot with Jeffrey Tambor (of Hellboy) playing the hospital doctor. We then get an X-man spoof (very badly done when Patrick Stewart is about as white as they come), Barry Bonds is played by another look. <br /> <br /> We meet Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson look beautiful in her costume!). Rick's 1st outing in his costume (as soon as he sees his ability to see and breathe) is another Batman spoof. The Tom Cruise Youtube maintenance clip is played by another videographer (and not a very good one). There are many modern references such as Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia, all of which show that the movie is in the current series. There is a very poor gay joke (never a good idea to do it) when Jill Aunt Lucille helps make Thanksgiving meal and the pissing scene is not very funny, just childless. <br /> <br /> The Tannie scene is not very funny, just incredibly childish. Anyone who finds it funny should have a mental age of about 12. She's dead and then we have a very bad necrophilia joke (isn't there a topic that these people won't try to get a cheap laugh out of?) At her funeral, and the even worse cremation joke. <br /> <br /> We get the 2 worst viewing lights in the entire movie (Prince Charles & Nelson Mandela) at the award ceremony and if you haven't yet known how childless or stupid movie is Landers wins the "Douchebag Or The Year Award. Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a very bad scene where the same girl manages to run twice in the same direction over Jill.) Of course, the Hourglass is filmed, Jill is saved from some death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final.
