I really wanted to keep this movie, but after a few minutes I almost cracked a smile. I agree there was no chemistry between the two and the other characters were cliche driven. The script totally wasted Bud Tingwell's and Kim Gyngell's talents. <br /> <br /> It has to be said, however, that there was a lot of laughter and even an applause at the end. Maybe I couldn't do it enough. I'm just glad I went on cheap tickets.
