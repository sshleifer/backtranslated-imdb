Oh boy, was it really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw it on video tape. <br /> <br /> In scenes that had soundtrack music, it was difficult to hear the dialogue. When people were on the phone, it was difficult to hear the person on the other side. It appears that at least two different types of movie or video files have been used, as the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between changes. And there were lots of focus shots that didn't seem deliberate. <br /> <br /> One indicator of the budget (one of the most) was when a news release appeared on TV. There is only a "news flash" title card that is heavily overloaded with a video effect on a TV screen, and a new author's voice review. They can't shoot screens from a new writer, and then actually show on the TV? <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a killer wearing surgical screws and mask, carrying a scrape. He is thought to be a paranoid schizophrenia escaping from the hospital to prevent him from having a lobotomy on him. <br /> <br /> Students are leaving the school for a break, and three young women decide to have a slumber party. Three guys decide to crash the party, and a geek named Science decides to crash it too. The slumber party is pretty boring, and the guys are still randomly wearing masks, showing off the masks and then disappearing. The mother and father (the surgeon who had to do the lobotomy) of one of the girls also stopped. The killer knocks cut people's throat without anyone really noticing. The apparent advantage of the movie goes more or less through the movie. Perhaps it was bad acting, or maybe it was intentional, as many of the movie is a nightmare, and some of it is a nightmare in a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The end is also very terrible. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the cheesy United Home Video VHS box art, revived for the DVD release (a dual feature with Terror at Tenkiller). I can't honestly say whether it's a photo, or a painting or a combination of both. The women appearing on the cover are not in the movie, and the clothes they wear are far more revealing than the women in the movie. The throat cut on the cover is scarcer than that in the movie - where people tend to influence a throw, pop-eyed look. For that matter, that's what the killer has most of the time: head hook, and eyes that fall apart, strive for the camera. Often the skull was held close to the camera, while the murderer's mask-covered face was close to the back but out of focus.
