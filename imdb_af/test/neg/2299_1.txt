When my mother went to the video store to rent a movie for the night, my sister and I learned a lesson to always talk to my mother at the video industry! In fact, the only reason she chose it was because Colin Firth was in it and his * cough * thinks he's a good actor! <br /> <br /> It starts with a few beautiful veiws from Africa and then goes off and off AND OFF, AND OFF. After this film, I was very surprised that Colin Firth did as far as he did, as this senseless movie could destroy any actor career. <br /> <br /> The story is about a divorced woman whose son is trying to adapt to a man named Matthew Fields he met while impressing his friends because of his great home. <br /> <br /> Nimi doesn't divorce Matthew and goes out with the local minister who doesn't like her son John. ... and the same with him! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if you disagree with me and I hope I didn't offend you, but to all the people who haven't seen this movie, I'll leave you with one word of warning , DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE !!!!!
