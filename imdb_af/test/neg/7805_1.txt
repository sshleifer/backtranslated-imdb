I unfortunately saw this movie because it was the only option at the time and because David Zucker was the director. I have his previous "Naked Gun" (both parts), airplane and Top Secret! Seen, and I liked, I had at least a good time and laughed. I'm not saying the movies I mentioned were masterpieces, but it was OK. I don't remember any other, more stupid movie than that. It's amazing how Hollywood industry is in total decadence. If a studio spends any money producing this dreadful picture, it is no surprise that this kind of history is more common today. It is a clear reflection of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid sites are produced to entertain ordinary people. I have nothing to say about this movie. If you plan to rent or buy it, don't waste your money or your time, avoid it anyway. Even if you're a fan of one of the actors, it's not worth it. In fact, this can be a very good example of what a director should avoid. I won't see a Zucker movie again. (He plans to direct the fourth sequel to Scary movie, think so!). Pathetic. Awful.
