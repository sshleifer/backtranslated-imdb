Mild spoiler in the second paragraph. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie was Garbo's bright lips. She and Dressler look like the only people who know what they're doing in this movie. The old guy who plays Garbo's father (George F. Marion) in the movie is so ah-noying !! All he does is get drunk in a completely fake way and shout about "that old dah-lot sea". He blames Garbo's "past", his whole life, and everything on the sea! He comes across as stupid x 10. Charles Bickford is Matt, the rough "tumbler Sailor Garbo falls in love with, and he is good at his role, but nothing really outstanding. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Garbo unleashes her "terrible secret" on Bickford and her dad. Finally, Marion stops with the evil of the sea and speaks his head and fists on the table in perfect time with Bickford. Then he quickly passed over a tirade over the sea. <br /> <br /> I almost had to force myself to finish Anna Christie. It is too melodramatic in many parts and creaking. There are many good early talks, but it is not one of them. If you didn't see Garbo, try something different for Anna Christie, like CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL.
