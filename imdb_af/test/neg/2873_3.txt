wow ... I just watched this movie ... American people have this stereotypical view of Hindi movies like, ALL Indian movies have dances, songs and a love story .... It's pathetic how far from the truth. This film merely the stereotypical Western view of the Hindi movies. Horrific acting, terrible direction, terrible cinematography. And all this by a Hollywood director. Most Indian movies today are much more content-driven, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of crap. Indian theater (not just Hindi) also covers a variety of different subjects. Just like most other Hollywood movies these days, it shows a very stereotypical view of another country where the truth is poured out. It is a highly non-recommended movie. Rather look at good Hindi films like black friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, dor, shoay, mother india, laughter ... These movies are what the real indian theater is about.
