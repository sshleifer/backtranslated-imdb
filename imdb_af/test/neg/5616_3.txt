I actually expected this movie to be pretty good, maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but the fact is I love Judd Nelson. In fact, he is the only reason this movie is worth watching and really its role is not that good. The main highlights of this film are racial sex scenes and boring dialogue. If it's the highlights, I'm sure you get a good idea of ​​what kind of movie it is. There is definitely a reason why it is made for television films. Just see this one if you can't do anything better on a Friday night, or just wasting money on video rentals. Save your time and rent the Breakfast Club!
