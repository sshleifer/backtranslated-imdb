The movie goes as follows: run around, run around, kill someone, freak out and then call one of the group to pull it together or just calm down! Repeat as many times as their characters are left over. Between these things you get empty, black screen. It's not fast, but rather a few seconds. I thought what a waste of the movie every time it happened - yes, it happens more than once if you can believe it. <br /> <br /> I see others mentioned "Blair Witch: and it reminded me of that In the way the camera was splashed, this movie is extreme. Every time the characters move, the camera jumps out. Sometimes you can't make headlines or stories about what you look at, bring us to lighting, too dark in some areas, and get them to make us feel like we are in a cave, but Helllloo. .. I watch a movie here, it would be nice to see. <br /> <br /> Then there is the end, I actually shouted aloud, "Are you kidding?!" dumb, stupid. I think the end was purely the trouble of the people who made this disaster to shock us to so much time of boredom with a so-called "twist." At this point of the movie you could have seen the "monster" chose his nose and it would be disadvantageous idered a "twist." Really horrible.
