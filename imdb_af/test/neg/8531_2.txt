Well, at least we must admit that the big Hollywood horror producers eventually become smarter and more remarkable. Instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of Asian horror hits and later recovering them in America, they have now discovered they can only hire Asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the States. It's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! "The Messengers" are actually identical to every other supernatural chiller that has come from Eastern countries since the "Ringu". Almost translated, this means that it is a boring, oblong and totally gore-free movie, but it contains huge amounts of fake scares and terribly weak "have we scared you yet?" moments. The Pang Brothers (Danny & Oxide) used to make the highly over-rated "The Eye" and it is a tradition for them to build a story with clues and tips to a point where it will be almost impossible to expectations of their curious to meet audiences, but they do not seem to change their formula anytime soon. And they're also unscrupulous enough to regain the same old and repetitive ghost topics. Restless spirits of previous residents trapped in the walls of a remote farm? The family of the main characters has torn off untreated traumas from the past, so that they first have to restore faith and trust each other? Give me a chance! Throw a video tape and a seven-day curse, why not? Even the attempts to get you in your chair are too de-vu and will not scare anyone over the age of 7. Sleeping doors, dirty and gradually growing stains on the walls, haunting looks, sounds coming from the basement. The endless over-exploitation of cheap tricks like this is almost offensive to horror fans. "The messengers" turn to a family on their way to a new life in the country as producers of sunflowers. The family situation is kind of dysfunctional since a personal tragedy (which does not appear until late in the film) caused their youngest son to stop talking and nurture parents' riotous teenage daughter. Soon afterwards, the children experience strange incidents in remote places, but they cannot convince their parents to leave. It pretty much makes the whole movie down. Little Ben sees things, but he can't talk and Jessica is repeatedly attacked by supernatural forces, but no one listens to her. The basic premise of "The Messagers" is very much derived from Stanley Kubrick's immortal classic "The Shining". It has only the continually ominous atmosphere and disturbing tone. The writing takes itself too seriously, although it is quite easy to predict the final denial and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least "The Eye" finally made some real shocks, while the happy happy celebration ending the "Messengers" is just pathetic. The only positive elements I can think of are the beautiful rural filming stations, the adequate editing and the promising young acting talents (and beauty) Kristen Stewart. And there is an incredible but unfortunately underdeveloped support role for William B. Davis.
