I always loved horror. From some of the well-known "The Exorcist" to some of the more underrated "Black Christmas" or "Just Before Dawn". But who are people who are sheep, even a b-movie that calls this garbage? It is straight on the lower Z grade. The acting is the worst ever on film. Really, I saw better on an episode of "Young and the Restless" ... SPOILER ... Looking out for when the woman tells them about Jack-o's legend. She sometimes stumbles for a matter of seconds as if someone was flashing her calling cards and she was struggling to read her lines. A ROT! <br /> <br /> Besides the bad acting, absolutely no gore or F / X. And Jack-o looks like a plastic pumpkin. See Linnea Quigley in "Night of the Demons", or "Silent Night, Deadly Night", much better flashing.
