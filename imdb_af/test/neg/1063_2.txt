... Say the continuity notifier, as TACTICAL INVESTIGATION is about to be broadcast. After seeing the first two minutes, I started thinking that Rutger might want to get a new agent. After seeing the next ten minutes, I began to think that Rutger might want to retire to save a potential audience from any of his performances. <br /> <br /> It's a really horrible movie. I didn't expect much and why should I appear in the credits as the name Rutget Hauer, but within seconds of the opening credit points containing NATO war planes with USSR bombardments Bosnia, I realized that I was going to go to turkey for three months feed after Christmas. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail does not exist. NATO aircraft carry USSR marks, saying Hauer's character has been spent in an Iraqi prison for six years. Which NATO bombed the Serbs in 1997! I think the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy, but I know I did. The producers also probably hoped the audience would not see the lack of continuity, such as dogfights with Iraqi jets who suddenly returned from Migs to F-4 Phantoms, but I did. Even strange characters will take off in F-16s, and when they return to the base, the plane has turned into a Soviet-built Mig <br /> <br /> and, if you're expecting a silly action trick, you're just half right because it's stupid, but most of the plot is centering on a BASIC INSTINCT revenge plot. I will give credit to the producers (Perhaps credit is too strong a word) because after we saw plots with hell of hell, policemen from hell, hell out of hell, now we have a fighter pilot from hell who every occupation of the 20th means century has appeared in a hell-type plot with perhaps TATICAL ASSUALT the worst movie of fate
