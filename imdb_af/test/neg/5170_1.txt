There is no doubt that the Kokoda route portrays a wonderful event in the Australian Military History of Australia's brave defense against the brutal barbarian Japanese army. In this film, the story of the "Fuzzy Wuzzy's" or the New Guinea Natives is not taken into account. that the Australians help them carry out military operations. The film also fails to give a credible version of the Australian soldier and his behavior in this opportunity. It's more like an uninformed contemporary view of what it was like. <br /> <br /> Again, the Australian film industry failed to give this important chapter in Australia's history the movie it deserved. This is the filming of the film at its worst with arbitrary cinematography, dissertation and dialogue, no character development and clich√© jungle battle scenes. <br /> <br /> It fails to enter the audience in any meaningful perspective if the Japanese army was relentless. and cruel killers of a poorly equipped and poorly trained group of Australians fighting in a jungle. <br /> <br /> The movie fails as most Australian films do to attract a significant Australian audience, in fact they ran away. br /> <br /> I'm not joining the usual parish garbage because it's an Australian movie. I also don't say a good job or just leave it to someone who knows how. This government funded movie is just another failure by Australia's rich and spoiled rich children. <br /> <br /> I give it zero stars because it is an insult to the descendants of these wonderful Australians and their enormous sacrifice. What a disgraceful waste and contempt and I know this review will provoke more negativity from the Movie Show team and most reviewers, but I have a right to my opinion and that is what Australians fought for our freedom and that includes freedom from speech and the right to express an opinion.
