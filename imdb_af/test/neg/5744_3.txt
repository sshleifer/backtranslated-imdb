It's about some vampires (walking around in the sunlight) that cause problems in South America. Casper Van Dien is filed with his team of commandos to investigate. The film opens with Van Dien & Co. running through the jungle, and there is this great black man who can only act positively. He speaks all his lines as if he were reading the cue cards for the first time. His voice is also so low that it is very positive. Good way to start the movie! Anyway, they run into some of our vampires, shoot them (causing them to die about 20 seconds), and then of course they come back. Van Dien remarked that one of them was placed over a tree length, and shouted to his friends to kill them with wood. The stunt work must be seen to be believed - the vampires are on wires that pull their trees, which are supposed to look like they can really climb, but they just seem to be reflecting on bungee strings or something. <br /> <br /> Yes ... anyway, the big black man was later included in South America with some guys (Van Dien not) and they are being attacked by more vampires. It's really bad, these guys have never heard of a crossbow, because it looks like it's the perfect weapon to kill the little blood sugar, but instead they use big old wooden legs that they try to get the vampires with the drop by hand. The big black man ends up getting trapped and eventually becomes a great powerful vampire leader. Van Dien ends up later. It does not help that everyone in the movie forgets that everyone if you shoot a vampire is excluded from their 20 seconds, allowing a person to keep an interest in them. They just try to keep them in the middle of hand-to-hand combat. Yes, not exactly brilliant tactics. <br /> <br /> There's a hot babe (remember Veronica from The Lost World TV show? Yes, it's her!) Whatever happens in the middle of Vampire County on some kind of research mission, and she is also just Van Dien's ex-wife. Hey, what's the chance? It's a pity she's no longer in the movie. Will she and Casper finally get together again? Will Van Dien defeat the big black man who can't act? Will the circus print vampires let you through all the many action scenes? Will we hear the three stooges music when someone does something funny? Did even Lynda Carter forget how to act in her little cameo (she is more convincing in her Sleep Number Bed ads)? These questions and more will be answered if you make it to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know, it may score bad points, but it's a good scale, but it's about it. Eh, it's a lot of goofs running in the jungle, I think it's a kind of entertainment.
