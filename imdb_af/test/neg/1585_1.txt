This is the sad story of the self-absorbed relationship between two unfair people, one of whom is married to someone else. It's high on my list of most boring movies ever, and I'm a dying romantic. My husband chose the first hour of his three. By that time there had been little. The desert landscape is spectacular, with the endless sand and sunshine on Katharine's golden hair. But cinematography does not make a brilliant movie unless it is a National Geographic travel report. The wonderful Saharan scenery in this bad pregnant story is like placing perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a badly burned, dying pilot called Count Laszlo de Almasy, who is left in the care of a Canadian. lower nurse, Hana, during World War II Italy. He seems to remember a bit of his life, but through a book in his possession, his story is VERY BAD revealed, with the help of a man from his past called Caravaggio, who mysteriously appears on his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to view the Sahara desert. He has a relationship with the wife, Katherine, of a fellow explorer who became a British spy. Meanwhile, Laszlo's nurse has her own relationship with a Sikh nickname, Kip, involved in the dangerous work of mine disarmament. <br /> <br /> My strife with this movie is great, length and pitch for beginners. I don't particularly violate the acting, it's simply not a good story. Caravaggio looks unnecessary, his connection with Almasy is sketchy. He offers a torture scene, but does not seem to be an essential goal in the film. <br /> <br /> The key issue is that the two parties of this relationship, Almasy and Katharine, are badly unsympathetic characters, level and boring. They are simply not very beautiful, so there is no one to cheer. Almasy is cool, indifferent, haughty, and ultimately disgusting to another man's wife. Katharine is also detached and unpleasant, not to mention a deplorable lack of guilt or feelings for her imperfect but loving man ... except to manage one tiny tear on the corner of her eye when he dies. <br /> <br /> It's a story of LUST rather than love, with such pearls as "I can still taste you". Almasy ridiculed for a colleague's erotic obsession with the penetration into his beloved's neck, surely more indicative of a focus on Katharine's body. The victim of this unyielding adultery is the unfortunate man, Geoffrey, who is treated so little as an unpleasant nuisance. It is all sordid and disgusting, Katharine's charade feels weak so that these lovers can enjoy in their daring, unbridled passion, all as the silent night is sung in the background. I am not sure if the intention was to contrast the karol's purity with their selfish desire, but I was certainly not impressed by the sacred undertone. We have full frontal nudity with Katharine, but their sex scenes come across as cold, selfish, lustful and sometimes straightforward ... not hot, loving, giving or even passionate. If one of these two feels any emotion for the other, it is a completely selfish and definitely NOT love, as I define it. <br /> <br /> Almasy's return to the Swimmers Cave around the body of his beloved is over as he moved instead. Katharine should only have lapsed moments earlier, as she shows excellent color and looks scarce, but not like a body. Of course this is all for dramatic effect, as the romantics who watch this story (usually I am one of them) will not appreciate a dilapidated, deadly body. To regain his adulteress's body, he betrayed his comrades and the Allies by giving his cards to the Nazis. The English is thrown as the villains of the piece. Regardless of whether he keeps his last promise to Katharine, his treacherous act is not something I admire much. <br /> <br /> Chicken seems to be a pleasant fellow man and Hana is generally fond, but their romance is not at all enchanting, but only a short time with the parties that reflect small trauma. Moving back and forth between the two institutions (past the Sahara desert and present-day Italy) was tired and unpleasant, but really, both stories were dull as dishwashing. The only spark of interest in the whole picture was Kip's tense my disarmament scene. <br /> <br /> Not completely heartless, I had sympathy for the current Almasy's heavily burnt and dying state. However, my big complaint to this movie is the euthanasia at the end when Hana obliged her patient to give him an overdose of morphine. We are supposed to feel that it is justified and morally acceptable because of course she has love for Almasy, crying as she prepares the deadly syringe and reads aloud from his allegedly passionate Herodotus book to comfort him as he dies. <br /> <br /> The wonderful director David Lean's masterpieces should not be offended by this pathetic, immoral story. Yes, Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert, but in Lean movies (Doctor Zhivago, Letter Encounter), those involved in business are sympathetic characters displaying admirable restraint, guilt, and some respect for the betrayed spouse , versus total self-absorption. of this couple. In Ryan's Daughter, the chosen man shows loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This movie is a supposed intellectual, much-persuaded little boring and disgusting drive that unfortunately leaves itself as a great love story. His best photo Oscar doesn't speak well to the Academy. For those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie, the answer is simple. It's terrible.
