Rarely do you find a movie so bad that it is the often sought-after paradigm to have so little redeeming value that it is only worth looking at. "Cyclone," I'm happy to report, is such a movie. <br /> <br /> I knew I was in for something good when I found the videotape. I am at least his fourth owner: it has a "Used Movie Sale! $ 9.95" front sticker, and a one dollar site sticker. I picked it at a fifty-cent savings store. <br /> <br /> The used movie sales! Sticker covers much of the cover art work, which means that what I see is a really strange mix, still in front of the Cyclone super bike, a crashing car, and Heather Thomas, wearing Flouncy Eighties Hair with her mouth open in an expression that says, "I'm an" ooth pain. " I saw it and thought, "All right." The case was fair enough ("with nowhere to turn and no one to trust, Teri slammed headlong into a maze of danger and fraud"), but I was surprised by actually looking to see it. I always make time for the very bad movies. That "Fight Club" band can wait. <br /> <br /> Meet Teri. Teri is a wonderfully well-crafted character, as we can tell of her launch, in which she and her friend do exercises that relieve her breasts and later her leg warmers. Then Teri goes out to join her boyfriend for the night that goes terribly wrong. Before she knows it, Teri is powered "straight into a web of deadly double crossings in CYCLONE." The VHS box tells it as it is. <br /> <br /> Stay out of the boxing summary - perhaps a little hoping that real-time copies of this movie will be sold - is how terrible the acting is. It was just me, but I thought I could read the characters' thoughts through their eyes. "It's stupid," thought Heather Thomas. "I know," thought bad man with too wide mouth. <br /> <br /> a drive (no pun intended) for the second half of this epic picture is the car hunt. It was pretty good, though, but I tend to think petrol doesn't need coaching on how to explode. What really impressed me is that the streets in all the backlogs were almost empty. It's like there are only twenty people in this big city. <br /> <br /> I know what you think. You think, "Give Wilikers! I must see this movie!" The sad thing, however, is that you can't find it. Oh no. "Cyclone" is a movie that finds you. Just wait. Sometimes, perhaps at lunch, maybe late at night, maybe when military scientist Jeffery Combs ('Re-Animator') is murdered by hired assassins. "- You will hear the rust of leg warmers and know it's time.
