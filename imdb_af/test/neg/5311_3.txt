The first 10 minutes of the movie make fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. These are the 2 reasons why the movie is so bad. They constantly refer to a movie called "Get Leo", which becomes the movie-in-a-movie version of short. Every time they do, you'll be really angry. Travolta is not very cool, neither is Keitel. The rock and vince vaughn, however, are hilarious. They are not the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie. If you haven't seen, you'll be short, you'll probably be cool. If you like being short, you will leave the theater to kill the director and screenwriter. Waiting for the DVD.
