In 1989, here in the NZ wrestling was somewhat of a mega-hype phenomenon, and what was sending a star ship on the run was the orange goblin itself, HULK HOGAN (one of my uber heroes at this time ), so it seems obvious to me why I loved this movie in 1989-90 when it came out here. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is a shocking bad actor and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lister is worse !!! The story line follows a standard WWE (then WWF) about 88-91 story line that culminates in the standard good guy who knocks off, takes off and then only gets the story line to follow that good man calls all his inner strength (gained to eat vitamins, say prayers, etc.) to come back to the epic mountain ..... Nice standard formula here. It is worth watching if you just remember your youth!
