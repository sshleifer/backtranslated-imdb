To judge a movie just for the landscapes, d√©cor, costumes .... it's just not right, you miss the core: THE STORY <br /> <br /> A movie should tell something, tell something impress you Yes, I was happy with the sea, cliffs, clear water and everything, but ... There is the plot? <br /> <br /> They are more interesting movies with crazy people, such as: FLYING THE CUCKOO "S NEST ... etc ... etc. This one is about a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than his children or his husband, just a clear psychiatric thing! Nothing extraordinary. Sadly wasting time. There is all the rage coming from? Fish smell?
