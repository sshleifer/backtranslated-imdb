This movie, which is a "Life In the Fast Lane" movie, is easily one of the least entertaining movies I've seen in the past. I think it's kept in mind the sick, twisted and clad L.A. women representing about .000001 of the population in the United States. The characters are all one-dimensional, even the lead. After putting her boyfriend in the head with a pair of scissors, a cheap laugh is attempted (and uncertain) by inserting a cork into the boyfriend's skull to stop the bleeding. Oh, clever! Patrick Dempsey (whose movies are almost always a class action - sarcasm) plays this "devil" who changed her life - but from what we saw, her life was this series of vignettes to start with. No emotion, no laugh, no story. The only reason I give it a 2 is that Jeffrey Jones is good to the priest and there is some style (albiet zero dust) in the camera. Otherwise, one of the 5 worst movies I've seen. Grade 2 out of 10 AN F! I think even the most junky junkie will laugh at this movie seat. I can't stress enough how much you need to stay away. <br /> <br />
