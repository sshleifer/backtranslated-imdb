Construction workers disrupt the Native American cemetery of a large skeletal monster that disintegrates the victims with its touch, breath or leg sword! The head of the resort project, Krantz (Jim Storm) recommends its construction team to keep their skeletal findings secret because it will stop the ongoing development if the nearby Katona tribe captures and excavates the wind that remains. An obsolete Bruce Boxleitner, as always, dies as half-breed Sheriff Evans trying to keep peace between the Katonas and Krantz's crew. The peace was at its best, but with the skeleton leap running and the victims disappearing without a trace, Krantz will soon have answers why members of his crew are missing. People are also beginning to lose citizens. Evans is warned by Katona Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) that an old demon, the Boneeter, has been detached and can only be stopped with a holy warrior. The ax was removed by a worker who found that it was left at the weapon inside the weapon, now in the back seat of his daughter, Kelly's (Clara Bryant, wearing a sturdy jeans and shirts to reveal how daddy's girlfriend got into a properly hit woman's friend's truck. Evans has to somehow defeat the devil while stopping the murder. And it must be before the Eclipse, or the power will become too strong for anyone to overcome. <br /> <br /> A solid throw that bumps into embarrassment of horror trips. The CGI is not very good, although the sample could have been very threatened if it was done with a better budget. It drives a horse that is being dusted after it's prey, for Petesake! Some of them appeared yesterday, including BUCK ROGERS Gil Gerard as Evan's deputy Big Jim, STAR TREK's Walter Koenig as a writer, and William Katt, a country doctor who attends Evan's deputy wounds. None of these issues last longer than one minute or so. Say, really. Adoni Maropis, impressed in an underwritten role as a breeding Katona, Johnny Black Hawk, who wants to use the Bone Eater to manage the white man from his tribe's land. Jennifer Lee Wiggins portrays Kaya, a delicious dish from a Katona woman who opposes Black Hawk's hate for the white man and wants Evans to follow his Indian blood to put an end to the Bone Eating monster. It can be worth seeing if you just dressed Boxleitner in warfare and Indian dress. I felt for the actor, honestly, because Bruce is trying to keep a straight face in such a horrible movie. In another overworked and tiring clich√©, Bruce's sheriff has an estranged relationship with his daughter, whose 17, hot and want to be the "bad boy". Although it is an underlined subplot, it is most of the plot on the deadly skeleton and many of the poorly developed characters.
