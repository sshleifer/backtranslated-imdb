Let me start by saying I love horror movies. Big budget, low budget, big name actors, no name actors, it doesn't matter. And when it comes to filming, I'm very forgiving. However, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The actors show little or no emotion when they deliver their lines and the acting is worse than much lower budget horror flicks I've seen. As the actors are killed, you can take less care. There are many gores (I have no idea what movie other reviewers have seen when they say there are good gores in this one because there are none) and the special effects are at their best. They steal so much from so much better horror movies (Jeepers Creepers, Friday the 13th, Leprachaun) and it still doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Luckily, I saw it at Showtime and I didn't really have to pay. any extra money to see it or waste a place in my Netflix rope. There are so much better horror movies out there and I recommend you see them instead of this big draw.
