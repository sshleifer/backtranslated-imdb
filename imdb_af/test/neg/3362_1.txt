I remember when I first heard of Jack Frost. I was in Miranda with my family in Video Ezy on a monthly video rental tradition. It was at this time that I had the courage to venture over the horror section of the store. By browsing the different titles, I finally got Jack Frost. The cover was enough to convince me that the movie was beyond my viewing pleasure. Years later, the film disappeared, only to be replaced by the inevitable but unnecessary successor. I waited again for the horror section and just picked up the case to come to one conclusion: the movie would be scary? but not intentionally. <br /> <br /> Jack Frost 2: Revenge Of The Killer Mutant Snowman (quite a title) follows where his predecessor left. Sheriff Sam is looking for counseling after his trials and Jack is now in the form of anti-freeze. To escape his past, Sam and his wife go to an island hotel, where he is in the company of a wide variety of movie stereotypes, including busty female models, thick-skinned jocks and Caribbean staff. However, Jack is released from his liquid grave and is back to his icy methods. He bends over to the island and continues to kill anyone who will prove a wonderful death. Only Sam can stop him. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this is a straight-to-movie movie, so it's bad. But it's terrible, even in the eyes of others about the top movies. The camera work is poor, using a camera that would make a soap soap look majestic. Half of the actors look like they are coming from a porn shooting and the other half seems to have come out of a retirement home, but in reality they came out of an asylum. There is extensive use of special effects used in the film, which tends to vary between mere puppetry and CGI that can be improved by a baby. The dead scenes are mostly out of sight and leave little of what happened to the unfortunate, but deserving, victims. But the movie is most memorable because it is killer one line like "There is something a little Christmas stuff needs" and "I officially invited you to kill!" Ultimately, the whole purpose behind a movie like this is to make a popcorn for that Friday night of boredom and even fail it. To make a sequel to a film that was a poor shooter with a concept that a child would find incredible, must have taken some nerves of steel? or a total frontal lobotomy. To director Michael Cooney ?? Thank you for wasting my time. To everyone else ?? Avoid like arsenic.
