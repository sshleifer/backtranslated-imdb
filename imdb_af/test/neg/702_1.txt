This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't see it, even if your life depends on it. <br /> <br /> This Laurel and Hardy movie is when they inherit an island, shipwreck and hang up. An incredibly boring film that is not close. <br /> <br /> It was the last Laurel and Hardy movie and a very low note to end such a wonderful career. The movies of the 40's were not nice, this film was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in their first, 1930s. The movie films are better than the movie films, my favorite is "Me and My Pal". Another reason why this movie is terrible is because it is called. The actor opens his mouth and the words come out three days later. Absoulutley crap, but let's end up on a high note, Laurel and Hardy were, in my opinion, the best double act ever.
