Pretty bathing PRC cheapie which I rarely bother to look at again, and it is no wonder - it is slow and crispy and sows like a butter knife. The mad doctor, George Zucco, is back on the turn of a wolfman in a wolfman turning a shredded farm hand in overall (Glenn Strange). Unfortunately, the makeup is virtually non-existent, consisting only of a beard and dimestore fangs. If it wasn't for Zucco and Strange's presence, it would be totally uncompromising with the cute Anne Nagel. Strange, who will play Frankenstein's monster for Unuiversal in two years, it looks like a Lenny impression of "Of Mice and Men". <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of four)
