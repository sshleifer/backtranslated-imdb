DANGER: Beware of traps ... <br /> <br /> Boy, was it a bad movie. I know they have a "true love conquering all" kind of thing, but over all this movie was about 3 (which over 9) felt my afternoon that I will never return. The film is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta who live in a remote world in a fantasy world. Kai is the very abused bellboy at a hotel owned by Gerta's dad. Initially Gerta Kai's predecessors ignore, but eventually he warms himself to the dislike of (You Guessed It!) Gerta's father. As if this obstacle was not enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shot a glass of glass in Kai's eye and became a common man who treated Gerta badly. Kai is eventually taken to the snow queen's fortress (which is the same as the hotel that is only covered in ice, because the good people at Hallmark want to break out) and Gerta is on a mission to get Kai back. Along the way she walks in the 3 other seasons that are angry in their own special way, but Gerta escapes them with some dull and forgetful characters she meets along the way. (All the time you will want to turn it off, but you can't force it to do so. This is probably the worst and most effective game thrown out by the Snow Queen. Anyway, I'll save you from the end because Everything you can think of in your head is probably better than how they ended it, so finally, the Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie that takes the fan out of the fantasy.
