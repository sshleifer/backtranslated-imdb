(very serious spoilers) <br /> <br /> This movie was a great disappointment. There are so many problems I don't know where to start. So, I'll talk about what's good about the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was wonderful. steve martin delivers a very funny performance of a middle-aged, top class, unceasing white man. queen latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black gal. And egg tax, well, he plays himself pretty much. add betty white and jean smartly and you have a good roll - everyone really played their parts well. And if you watch these guys for 1.75 hours, $ 8 is worth you, then you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But the movie makes very serious mistakes. First, there are plenty of racial stereotypes and jokes to insult everyone. all white people are excited bigots. all black people are ghetto ebonics speakers. the blacks are hip, cool, with and arm and arm. the whites are nerds, stiff and rich. (Except Eugene levy, he becomes clear with Queen Latifa and "called the lingo" - so latifa calls him a "freak" so - if you are a white man and you like black women and you know street snake, you must be a freak). The film is captured on the black role-playing teams with fearless races and the whites are portrayed as morons and boobs. <br /> <br /> To put away the race card, we can look at the big mistake in the movie. destroy latifa's character. She comes up with martin's house under false pretense, but Martin keeps her in any case. she must be wrongly charged with robbery, martin takes her case. 3/4 of the way through the film we find out of Latifa's character escaping from prison. So, our sympathy for her goes out of the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot. The film slides from scene to scene with latifa appearing in a place where she is not "supposed to be (like a country club or martin's house) and martin tries to hide her. It's the running plug. then they decide in the last minute of the film that they are ultimately about Latifa's allegation that she has been wrongly accused of bank robbery. and everyone lives happy ever. <br /> <br /> Finally (but there is much more wrong with this movie) this movie seems to be a hodge-podge of clips from other movies. martinfilm borrowed "the house-sitter" where goldie hawn comes to live with martin and shakes his stodgy middle-class life. martin and latifa meet online - ala "you have email." The whole "strange nanny fixes the rich man's life "goes as far back as" the sound of music "and" mary poppins ". <br /> <br /> I won't see this movie again for free.
