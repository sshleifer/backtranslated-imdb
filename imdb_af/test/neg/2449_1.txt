Before I saw this masterpiece, I would never have guessed that a devastating and shameful infectious virus could be defeated by the use of Lutheran prayers ... and "erbs". Ralf Moeller's performance is grim; realism glowing. I was so inspired that I fly straight to Zambibwia tomorrow to break out the pesto and gather my hands for the third world prosperity. God blesses this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm going to have to watch Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty, just to believe it is possible to ease more hamfistedly clichéd dialogue. It's so tortured that taking a cheesegrater to your knuckles would be better off putting it around. The only subtle that enables it to reach is in its thinly disguised racism, as the poor islanders change to ineffective carnage-collective prayer that reaches nothing until the überermschlich, linen-covered Teutonic hero Moeller, with his direct line to Yahweh , a blood sample that the horn-blowing Yankee scientists can work on and save the fearless natives. This movie sucks.
