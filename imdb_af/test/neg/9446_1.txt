I never comment on a movie, but I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I felt it was made by a novice film student and did not lay talented film students, but it was terrible! I didn't buy the main actress and felt like I was with her in the active class while on film. Her decisions were very safe and I feel she is imitating other actresses in movies and not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. The end might have made a little more sense if someone was telling the events and not a song. I love Patsy Cline, but her songs often appear in movies. Perhaps the song selection might be a little more original. The song "crazy" was such a clich√©. As I said before, I never came to movies and I saw my share of good and bad, but it was the worst. Sorry.
