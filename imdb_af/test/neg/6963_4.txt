First, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever, plan 9 from outer space does not resist. Coleman Francis deserves the title. I offer exhibition B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is a surprisingly thoughtful cross-dressing exploration, especially since it was made in 1953. The last 15 minutes of the movie is also not bad as well. <br /> <br /> That's not to say the movie doesn't have problems. Bela Lugosi was quite strange, intimidating strange lines. Poor Bela seemed to be unsure of what had happened. The acting was definitely wood, though not worse than a Universal B movie. The long dream sequence that made up the middle of the film was completely bizarre; more like a vague threatening film as a dream sequence. The Alan / Ann story, the supposed original focus of the movie, has a concise quality about it. <br /> <br /> No, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever. At least for a part of this movie, he could make a serious social statement. When Coleman Francis tried it in Night Train To Mundo Fine (also known as the Red Zone Cuba), it just ended in chaos. Glen or Glenda is at least watchable without robot help.
