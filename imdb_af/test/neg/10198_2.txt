Unfortunately I went to this movie for entertainment purposes, based on the limited information I saw on Fandango. Since I'm a sci-fi buffy, the idea of ​​a movie about UFOs interested me. <br /> <br /> Instead, this movie revealed itself as an evangelical Christian propaganda movie. Suitable for an audience of like-minded individuals, but very un-Christian, wants to exploit the film-tunneling center and preach to an unsuspecting audience, especially in view of the cost of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci code did not retain its madness. <br /> <br /> So, these B-grade movies (and I'm friendly) will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs, probably shown on Wednesday and Sunday evening youth groups. But if you're a Christian or non-Christian lead, you won't be comfortable.
