This movie has some good lines, but watching Dillon's less-than-mastery Rourke impersonation just let me see the original. I like Marisa Tomei, but she's not Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the number one movie rule is to make the main character of someone you care about. You may not love the character, but you must care what happens to him. It is achieved in Barfly with the hilarious runway over the battles with Eddie the bartender. The main battle in Factotum is when he is completely unaware, he steals to the Lily Taylor character in a bar, hits her on the floor and calls her a whore. <br /> <br /> The whole thing just didn't work. . Again, some good lines - a little laugh-aloud - but as a movie in general it's a failure. Moderate attempt to rediscover something that was brilliant and you can't pass by. Next? Let's Receive Breakfast at Tiffany's with Kate Hudson.
