Well, since this is called Porno Holocaust and directed by Joe D'Amato, I went into this movie. And while I got it a bit, Porno Holocaust was a massive disappointment because it's just so damn USED. The title suggests that the movie will contain pornography, and it is not wrong. Porn Holocaust is actually just porn, and most of them are just the same things over and over. I was fast driving before the end. The first sex scene is between two women and it has my hope, but then it is only released in normal pornography, and the rest of the movie (for the first time!) Consists of talking and you can imagine how much fun it's about to go! The plot focuses on a deserted island where, whether it believes or not, something strange is happening. Of course, it's not long before a group of people - some men and some scientists, all of whom are sexy women, land on the island. They have sex a few times and some strange things happen, and then an hour later they are attacked by a mutant zombie orphan for the ladies. <br /> <br /> It had to look like a good idea for original porn - a zombie that likes to get it up, but it's not surprising that it doesn't work well at all. The movie looks just ten minutes short of the two hour point, and it's too long for a movie like this. I have no idea why Porno Holocaust is as long as it is; if they only cut one minute out of every sex scene, the movie would be under ninety minutes, and that would make it far more tolerant! The zombie who looks like an eternity to appear (it's quite a long time before there is a sex pause long enough to travel to the island in the first place), and when it finally appears, it's a great disappointment! I realize that this is a low budget B movie, but D'Amato would definitely have tried a little harder and better than it could have been! I'm not even going to call the acting, atmosphere etc., there's no point. Porno Holocaust is basically just your average, dull porn movie with a slight dash of horror, and I can't recommend it!
