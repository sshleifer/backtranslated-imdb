Guy Pearce looks and looks like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of the bimbo guys wearing Levi's Jeans and standing in front of a herd of buffalo because they realize that Buffalo is like Levi as well. In every scene, Guy Pearce looks like he says, "Look at me, I'm so beautiful!" As a hero his character is a total wimp. In every courageous scene, Pearce gets the short point of the stick. SPOILERS: Yet, at the end of the movie, this wimpy bookworm character runs a pack of baboon-like Morlocks that can run and jump along the walls (like Spiderman). About the same time it seems that the TIME MACHINE causes some kind of nuclear explosion that wipes out a whole valley. Strange, even though Pearce and his grandmother Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock killed. Seconds later, Pearce, Mumba and the tribe look to the valley of the safety of their mountain. Now it's running fast! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is wonderful. He made the movie much better than it was. Mumba, the model-turned actress isn't very cute, and she doesn't play much in this movie. The scenes that took place in the 1900s have no real atmosphere. Although the dress and vehicles are shown, the characters like caricatures look like they think 1900s are going to talk and talk to people. The original version of this movie was much better in this respect. The time characters were much more realistic, and they were much better actors. The original version of this movie looked the VOTE as the right base of the characters. This new version does not have dust and feel. The screens in which Pearce handles Emma's death and then fails to save her from her fate are very good. The issue of the Morlocks that are cannibals is not very well explained, and it does not make sense that they have a large butcher's store filled with knives and cutlery. Yet they are never seen using any weapons other than a thrip. Also stupid is the huge pit full of water and bones. The Morlocks walk through the underground chicks on meaty bones. So how can all the skeletons be in the pit? It looks like there are some Morlocks who eat Bar-B-Que their people and eat from the grill, and other Morlocks just like fillet meat? And where are the toilets for all these creatures? Looking at the dozens of Morlocks who cared for human flesh, it seemed to me that they had a very advanced toilet and plumbing system, as they threw in many legs. All these issues have never been addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce holds Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is watching her friend, Mandingo. Another very annoying thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music that is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); The LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is the African singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) who starts crying about the LION KING jungle music. I watched the credits at the end of the movie and the jungle music was not specifically identified, but I think Elton John should probably look at this matter. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with some good FX. See it once, then forget about it.
