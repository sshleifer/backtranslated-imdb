Let me get it straight: <br /> <br /> "Hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and falls in love with newly divorced bed and breakfast within about 24 hours gaswoman meets her because of her solid advice on bedside. "<br /> <br /> Wow. Move over "The Notebook", there is a new child in town. <br /> <br /> Where to start. Well, how about the depth of this "relationship"? I think we can safely sum up the basics of this ominous love in the following steps: <br /> <br /> 1. Swap polite delicacies over a dressing. 2. Drink large amounts of Jack Daniels; play basketball with old food 3. Give glib, unsolicited advice to each other about your crazy life. 4. Make love during a hurricane. 5. Speak your lives through air mail to each other. <br /> <br /> I noticed George C Wolfe in his "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Project" dossier. Will "stick to your genre" be too hard? Enough said. I think most will agree that the best love stories make us cry, or laugh or even hope. But the reason they can do this is to start caring for the characters we see on the screen somewhere in the storyline. To take care of us must spend time developing these characters ... their lives, their history, why we are watching them now. Wolfe did not want to waste our time with such trivialities, but gave us background information about each character in about 8 minutes before rejecting us in an intense one-to-one interaction between two ACTORS. Everyone comes to worship, but two qualities we can care less about. <br /> <br /> For a short while when Richard Gere exclaims that he doesn't expect her to listen to his problems, she invites him to dinner, the viewer sees a gleam - a start - of something special between these two characters. But instead of enjoying the anticipation and playfulness of "what happens next" in the wonderful, unpredictable joy that court justice is, we are in the first place pushed into a love affair between two people we hardly know. <br /> <br /> Let's look at it. We all heard in the romantic films stockings one liners. But the reason we got a little slack at Bogart in Casablanca or Nicholson in "Something Gotta Give" is because our hearts and minds are lifted to heaven and dragged by the mud and back with these characters, and against the time that they deliver the line, we are so deeply involved in their destiny, we do not even see the cheese factor. Since Wolfe does not allow us to love or even be our protagonists, we are all left with a sandwich sandwich and a few snickers in the audience. <br /> <br /> Wolfe takes off the old Hollywood director's phrase "far too literally here. As each striped one liner is produced by our film, the viewer is asked whether director Wolfe is subliminally telling the audience : "C'mon. This is a Richard Gere romance. Just buy. "<br /> <br /> It is because of this incredible lack of character or relationship development that the movie's climax failed to drag into our hearts. When Gere's character died, I felt like I watched the news about someone I didn't know to go away, or look at a ladies overnight rowing race during the Beijing Olympic Games Just did not care. <br /> <br /> Epic. .
