Please, if you are thinking about renting this movie, don't do it. If you are thinking of watching a few downloaded tracks, don't do it. If I had my way, no one would even have to read this summary. <br /> <br /> The acting was despite the fact that one of the high points of the movie was still pathetic. The director was probaly a sadist. The witty one liners was something you'd expect from a room of highly paid 7-year-old anti-socialist who eats breakfast slides. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it is trying to be a movie like 'Evil Dead 2' (do not associate these 2 movies under these circumstances) because it is so bad it is funny. But it also tries to be funny at the same time and fails to do so, so your sense of humor is crippling to do anything, but getting your gag reflex to save him. <br /> <I could do a lot more and just how awful it really was, but I think it will break me off just to live to think about it. If you need me, I'll try to cook myself so I can feel clean again ...
