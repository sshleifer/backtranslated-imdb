Certain filmmakers cannot do wrong with national critics, which is one of the reasons why you should never pay attention. This movie is a perfect example. The critics like director Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring soap over a woman and a teenager ("Pauline") who cares for the summer and the relationships they have with a few men. . It's talking, talking, talking and talking. <br /> <br /> For those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated, there are a few quick shots and a few swords, but otherwise it is a harmless French morality game. A friend of mine lent me this bond. He thought he was getting some sexy French movies, and was disappointed. I was just as disappointed as it was so boring. <br /> <br /> How it gets such good reviews is almost incomprehensible.
