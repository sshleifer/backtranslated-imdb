A movie that hardly tries to say something and generally fails. Like the turbulent academics that populate the movie, it deliberately plunges, replacing endlessly (it seems to be listening forever), talking for action or plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is one of the best examples of Canadian cinema I've seen.
