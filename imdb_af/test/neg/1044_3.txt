I watched this movie in front of something else I rented for a while ... and it looks decent. I saw good videos from Full Moon video, and thought it was worth a shot. Unfortunately, it was not good. <br /> <br /> The story is about an possessed bed. A couple moving into a new apartment, discovering the bed, and strange things are starting to happen. Strange things like the woman discover kinky sex. And the man discovers kinky sex. And the woman draws pictures of kinky sex. And the man pictures kinky sex. And they both start dreaming about dead people with kinky sex. You'll think a movie with so much kinky sex will be good, right? <br /> <br /> Well .... No. The problem is that it is supposed to be a scary movie, or at least a thriller, and it just doesn't deliver. There is little tension, no tension and no fear. Apart from some disturbing dreams and visions, there's really nothing for this couple to worry about. The whole movie is basically the two of those who have these visions and play in bed. Sure, you get a monster fight in the end ... and some bloodshed ... but nothing spectacular. There is only one murder and one good scare. And that's it. <br /> <br /> And the kinky sex? Don't get your hopes (or anything else for that matter). Their idea of ​​kinky sex is to put woman on top, completely dressed, trying to bump her mate with a tie. Not exactly my idea of ​​a good time.
