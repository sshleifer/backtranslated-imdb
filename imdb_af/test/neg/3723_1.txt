WARNING! SPOILER! This movie is absolute crap. It's not fun. I didn't have the words to describe the dislike I felt at the end. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie about the conspiracy. Throughout the movie I was still waiting to get it better. It didn't. Instead, it just got worse and worse. <br /> <br /> If I see a movie that is as bad as this, I always try at least one good thing to say about it. In this case, it was impossible. I don't have one good thing to say about it. How bad did it get? Well, here's an example: Dan Akroyd melts and kills Vincent D'Onofrio while Reeves and Diaz watch! It's not fun!
