There is nothing worse than science fiction made by people who don't feel like it. Grab a concept that would not be so terrible in itself (a future where cloning is generally enough to make it a crime so you can break up with someone genetically close to you), the scriptwriter has sick - suitable imagination to run wild. <br /> <br /> When Tim Robbins's character could guess a security guard's computer password, simply by telling her to tell one thing about herself, I knew I was in trouble. This ability was later revealed due to Robbins taking an "empathy virus", viruses used to give immediate (or almost instantaneous) skill upgrades to their users. Robbins' love affair complained about her own experience with such a virus - a Mandarin Chinese language virus that allowed her to speak Chinese, but as she complained, "she couldn't understand what she was saying." Good, first, empathy, no matter how intense, is not ESP. Without including some sort of true spiritual reading aspect (such as an empathy virus that releases viruses in the environment, contaminates nearby people, picks up bits of their memory, and departs to the original host - that is, as you might say , a condom on the impractical side, you can't justify a specific detail like someone's password, just by listening to the things you didn't say. Also, you can't get the ability to speak a language without understanding what you're saying - the virus can't infect your vocal ropes and translate you on the fly, because a virus can't * think * no. To give you the power to speak Chinese, such a learning virus will have to change your brain. This will have to encode the knowledge among neurons, and once it's there, it's * yours * - you definitely understand what you say because you have to. To use your own brain to perform a task, you must understand the task (for the most part). Unless, of course, the movie suggests that the virus is deliberately designed to place a bizarre multiple personality mindset where some sub-staff function as your built-in one-way translator. <br /> <br /> The many languages ​​spoken by the characters are decent enough, but nowhere near remarkable enough to justify all the love that other reviewers have given. Moreover, all the multicultural inserts in the world cannot make a simple, frustrating fact: the dialogue stinks! It's slow, it's plowing, and it's unnatural. Again, I'm sure fans have convinced themselves that the dull strangeness is merely the result of an inspired genius that creates a truly futuristic (and therefore subject to language-driven) form of speech. I do not agree. Good dialogue is a good dialogue in any era - and that also applies for a while. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will see the central concept of the movie again - the prohibition of sex with yourself. Widespread cloning is a nice, classic scientific topic. So global warming leads to ecological destruction (which Code 46 also includes). Unfortunately, the two don't go along! If you severely cut an ecological disaster on the available living space, you're not running to clone people! You have population problems enough as it is - you don't add them by eliminating re-issues. Regular, old-fashioned sex and birth provides all the people you need, and any kind of cloning will be relentlessly suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the movie wasn't bad. It had some fine cinematography. Perhaps if I looked at it, I could have enjoyed it.
