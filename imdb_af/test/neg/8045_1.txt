COC had its moments. I enjoyed the action rows, but I despised the script and plot. I hate this movie so much, I'll just write about the stupid part. First, the plot would never happen. Secondly, the fraud of the Chinese president was unaffected. It will never happen. Finally, the dialogue. Using non-Chinese actors to play Chinese roles is understandable, but writing dialogue for those who are TOTAL AF is stupid! For those who understood the Chinese in the movie, you know what I mean.
