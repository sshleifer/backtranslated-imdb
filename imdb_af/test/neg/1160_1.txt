PLEASE PEOPLE! Don't worry about this poorly directed joke. The direction was completely wrong from the beginning. Where is the history of his mother's emotional interference and the general madness in the original family? Why is ED portrayed as this great, exaggerated imposing figure of anger and hatred? What is this crap? The author and director of course had no investigation into history and just wanted to enter the infamous Gein name. The fool who made this movie has taken so many freedoms with the truth, it's ridiculous. If you don't want to see a brilliant Gein movie. go back to the minor classic "Deranged" to see how Ed was really. There is humor in that movie, and Ed is portrayed as more of the sad, lonely little man he was, HISTORY. Where's the background story here? There are only badly set shocks (which are not shocking) that we have seen before, and more. Take the worst Texas Chainsaw massacre ripoff, and add this one to the list. Must give it ONE in ten because the rating will NOT accept NEW. I want my money back. Looking at this movie as 'stunning', it is possible to get a financial backlash.
