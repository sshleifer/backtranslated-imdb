An Asian fan killer takes out victims from the Niagara Falls and New York City before being run by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden, Janet Agren) called a hilarious Southern belle to show that she is from Alabama. There is a connection between these murders and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senators) and investigate. It brings her to New Guinea, where she promises a sloppy guide (Robert Kerman, American porn study R. Bolla), $ 80,000 to help find her sister. After scarcely making it through a jungle of bloodthirsty cannibals, they eventually find Diana, who is under the control of Jim Jones-type cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical crazy guru-style stuff, like going out of LSD, initiating group murder and threatening to kill anyone who doesn't obey him and kill Agren with a huge dongo in the blood. Each time a character will look right or left and sees a gory scene directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN FROM DEEP RIVER (both are also directed by Lenzi). I'm pretty sure they also use at least two scenes of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Here we get the expected animal drones (a gator, a native who eats live snakes), plus some extra nudity and a castration. Ms Ms Lai points out to give her breast implants another workout that plays a widow who is a gang of three of her brothers in law on her ashes. Mel Ferrer appears briefly as a professor and is not given much. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with MANGIATI VIVI! you actually get a promise that is fulfilled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste you expect from one of these titles, so if you are a sleaze dog, look it all in all. Personally, I got bored halfway through and just wanted to end it. The original (heavy cut) US release in 1985 was titled THE EMERALD JUNGLE to deceive people into thinking they actually hired John Boorman's EMERALD FOREST. It is also called DOMED TO THE DIET AND EAT LIFE THROUGH CANNIBALS!
