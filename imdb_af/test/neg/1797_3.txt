Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, is a dark, profound and enduring novel depicting the futility and irony of Africa. If you are looking for a good book after the weekend, this is not the book for you. Conrad retains nothing when imperialism of the 19th century is described, but the novel is meaningless without giving the reflection and consideration it deserves. If I read this novel that is looking for a great adventure story, I'd say I wasted my time, but in the perspective of explaining the futility of the 19th century civilization, I'd say this is one of the most important novels what I've ever read. Because I read this novel in my English class and analyzed each page, I think I appreciated the book more than anyone would just read it for entertainment. I'm not going to lie, this book was hard and it makes the reader dig deep in this novel to find the true meaning. The movie on the other hand, I found tiring and boring. The film, "Heart of Darkness" does not come close to where the book of justice is given. The movie left out many important parts that I consider important to get the real message from the story. If you're having trouble understanding and visualizing the novel, the movie can be a good profession, but I wouldn't recommend seeing the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective.
