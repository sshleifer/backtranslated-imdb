Simply put, I was incredibly disappointed. I'm a big fan of Asian Horror, and I can watch unoriginal (I enjoyed myself from "The Red Shoes" and "Phone"), but it was just poor. <br /> <br /> The movie has many high quality elements: photography is striking, the visuals are cool, the direction is inspired, the acting is pretty good, the music is easy on the ears, and the CGI is incredible. But since it's a horror movie, we're expected to be scared, which just won't happen to this movie. As with most South Korean horrors, it is almost indestructible from beginning to end: there is the trademark long-haired shaky female ghost, ominous lumps of thick, black hair and pool water, and near the end, a twist that * almost * Don't make sense of the whole thing (the twist is easily one of the best features). And for the viewer's irritation, when the movie is not recycling (sometimes so precisely that it can be easily plastered) images of other movies, it makes you jump. Very. And with jumps I don't mean things that matter or anything, just VERY loud sounds and screams in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air (there are even some "made-your-jumps") moments that are simply uncomfortable). And if it doesn't cut other movies, it's boring and difficult to go through. <br /> <br /> And that's a pity, because "Ryeong" could easily have been really good, and it has everything to do. It's good, but it's the annoying over-exploitation of completely predictable loud noises and jokes destroy the movie. A perfect example of how good it could have been: there is a moment when one of the characters looks at a body, and without a sound the body looks back. It is completely predictable, but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. And unfortunately it is as scary as the movie got me. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, "Ryeong" has some good features, and even some skips that aren't so predictable and do work. There is a very good and sad story used to explain the events, and the turn is pretty unpredictable. This is the only thing separating the movie from any other Asian ghost / horror movie. But the problem with this is, although they do work, they were previously used. (J-Horror fans will easily realize that the great revelation is inspired by a story of two sisters), and it takes the back story a good fifty minutes to go. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Ryong" really looks like a really wasted opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped that the plot would turn and act as good distractions so that the audience would not notice the big mistakes. But he failed, and well ... We noticed everything. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10.
