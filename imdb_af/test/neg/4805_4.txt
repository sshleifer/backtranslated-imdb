It was only the second year of the academy, but they already voted politically. Jeanne Eagels's brilliant performance in this creaking early talkie had to go with an Oscar nominee and the statue to win the worst performance. Mary Pickford's in COQUETTE. The only existing print was a workload without music or final editing, but wherever it was shown, Eagels pushed and buckled with her nasty, powerful performance. She is so convincing on the witness stand that we, while we know she lies through her teeth (we immediately killed the man), we in the audience find us, as the jurists, believe in her innocence, before we suddenly catch ourselves. THIS IS GREAT ACTIVITY. The film must be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this tremendous achievement again. (Jeanne's silence exists in archival print - MAN, WOMAN AND SIN - and her only other talkie, JEALOUSY, is "lost", so this is the only document we have of her. Start to see it (when it first came out of the archives that had to be shown in NYC in the early 1970s, the Village Voice printed a full page review, worshiping the Eagel performance).
