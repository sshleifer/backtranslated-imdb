Although inevitably linked to the 1970s, the concept of "exploitation theater" is almost as old as the cinema itself. In addition, Universal Studios invented virtually the term with their long-running monster cycles Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and The Mummy. Every original classic has at least a few persecutors, and after a while they even thought of the idea of ​​making real monsters! "House of Frankenstein", released a year earlier and also directed by Erle C. Kenton, was quite a successful effort with interesting ideas and enthusiasm achievements, but "House of Dracula" is a bit too rewarding for me to do so. to recommend. The plot suffers too much from extremely annoying 'accidental' situations, forced coils and dialogues and ?? most of all ?? a short time to extend the monsters' personalities as they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not receive the best bill, but plays the most fundamental role of miracle of a doctor challenged to cure Count Dracula (Carradine) from his uncontrollable thirst for blood and change Lawrence Talbot's disease of a furry Wolfman when the moon is full. . During a run-in in some caves, they also pick up the reminders of Frankenstein's monster and the good doctor himself eventually becomes a Jekyll / Hyde metamorphosis due to a bad blood transfusion. The last invitation for the messy party is a female hunchback (though not the Notre Dame). Something is very wrong when you look at a movie that is literally filled with horror icons, but the only character in the entire movie that lets you down is a common village called Siegfried. The real monsters are boring and their once-off fabulous backgrounds are fully drained. Count Dracula is a sling romantic, Talbot is a pitiable and also whining old martyr and the Frankenstein creation ?? Well, its share in the plot is not even worth mentioning. There is a serious lack of atmospheric settings and nifty photography in this Universal movie, especially compared to all their other efforts, and the abrupt climax is a disaster.
