Don't waste your money or time. Terrible movie. Bad acting, plot across the place. Really, very bad acting. Man, this movie is just bad. I closed it for 7 minutes. The writing is bad, the direction is bad, it seems to me that a high school group has come to do a project for their drama class. Yes, it's so bad. The play is not convincing at all, but I only saw 7 minutes of it. How this movie made it to DVD is beyond me. <br /> <br /> It had to be left in the editing room. I saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool, I probably won't do it next time: _)
