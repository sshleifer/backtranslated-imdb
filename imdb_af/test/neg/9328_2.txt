Well, after I saw "Begin", I thought why hell burned their Schrader version and did the poor one. But now, having seen "Dominion", I understand this decision a lot. Even they didn't do much better. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie is really crazy. A few good moments, but a very boring story story and some big plot holes kill this movie. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of things about the Exorcist story and in a prequel on this you can build on a lot and give references that the audience would like to see. But there is so little of it in the movie. The effects are really bad - not even TV standard.
