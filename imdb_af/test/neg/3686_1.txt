Last week I suffered the movie at the Sitges Festival. If there was a possibility of filming a movie to avoid its existence, it should be the first in the list. María Lidón is not a director, she is just a stupid woman who pretends to hold a camera by hand and shout "action". It makes her a professional filmmaker. What a mistake! The movie itself is senseless and a total waste of good actors who can do something better in another project. Val Kilmer does nothing except his face in front of the camera. His character does not have specific weight in the movie. The same thing can tell about Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida. This is a pity the way Rade wrote Serbedzija's character. WARNINGS SPOILERS <br /> <br /> He spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking to himself in the road (now I do it, now I'm low on bats, I'll look in my pocket, now turn I left, now I turn right ...) just to give the audience a clear idea of ​​his actions. It's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director. END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the movie itself had the idea of ​​the rating everyone should give: NO
