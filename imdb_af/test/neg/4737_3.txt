Anyone who has watched "Alien vs Predator" should know that the "Alien Quadrilogy" conventions are not exactly adapted to the movie. Among some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of the Aliens seems to be a matter of minutes, strangers with extremely long tails, and so on. However, the idea of ​​the Predator species offering the impetus of the city and temple building to create a hunt would be that warriors were so attractive that I could not resist. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the end of the movie would not be the impetus of this successor, and unfortunately I was wrong. For those who have forgotten how the first movie ended, the dead Predator burst an Alien through his chest, bearing the characteristics of both species. <br /> <br /> For this movie, I'm just going through a list of "good" and "bad" features. <br /> <br /> The Good: Very nice people, especially the men. <br /> <br /> The Bad: Many beautiful people are mumbled by both the mutant Predator / Alien and the Predator. <br /> <br /> The Good: An interesting idea of ​​the Predator planet. <br /> <br /> The Bad: An Inconsistent Scale of a Town. It is a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated (read: big city) sewerage system and homeless. Is it a small town or city? The police force is one Sheriff and three Deputies, or so I counted. <br /> <br /> The Good: Um .... <br /> <br /> The Bad: Why does this mutant grow aliens / predators? so fast? In a matter of five minutes, they seem to grow to their full size. I mean, don't ... what are these things ... Chia Pet Aliens ??? And while we're on this subject, why is it that an Alien mutates into a Predator's body, but an Alien in one's body? Does it make sense? <br /> <br /> The Good: Think More ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: Why Only One Predator Will Come? And why throw it all over the remnants of the "Aliens", but it decides to kill a cute deputy, and then rubs it and puts it upside down. I mean, so much for incognito! <br /> <br /> The Good: Oh ... I'm stuck. I think there are very loud sounds! <br /> <br /> The Bad: How are these mutated Alien / Predators produced? Apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss-type movement they put several offspring in the woman's body. Yes, just what you want to see, eh? Pregnant women who have their bodies explode in mutant strangers - as if the previous road was not gross enough !!!. I mean, there's not even an Alien Queen. <br /> <br /> The Good: Did I say the guys in this movie are beautiful? <br /> <br /> The Bad: When a nuclear device breaks down, how does a helicopter survive the explosion? And how nice is it for one of the passengers to make the pilot blatant? I told you not to crash! "I mean, because of the nuclear waste, if he wakes up in the morning, he will not leave hair !!! <br /> <br /> I can keep on but I think you get the message. Mutated Alien / Predator bars by killing the Predator's body, growing over the course of a few minutes, killing all the predators and driving down to the ground.More mutant Alien / Predators are created, while ONE virgin Predator comes to earth Destroy these new types of mutants Predator kills people Mutant Alien Predators kill people People kill people Struggle to be in this movie, <br /> <br /> If you're impressed with many buttons and lumps, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like the First, I suggest you skip this sequel.
