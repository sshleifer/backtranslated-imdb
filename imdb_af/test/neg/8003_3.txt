Drilling, cliched and predictable. The only original piece was the Brighton gangster gang. This is definitely no "Lock Stock" etc .... "Hannah was similar in" Sliding Doors. "In" Circus "I didn't develop empathy with his character and he couldn't give a gift to him or his girlfriend Although this movie was so clickable and predictable, the end was not surprising, I was so uninteresting that I didn't even care why the movie is called "Circus" ....... .... Don't visit this great one above.
