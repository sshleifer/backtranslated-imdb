Why would Burt Lancaster allow himself to play a weak schnook, ultimately undermined by femme fatale Anna Dundee, played by Yvonne DeCarlo in 'Criss Cross'? The same reason why Robert Mitchum dropped himself as another loser, who fell in the 1950s, "Where Danger Life" falls, falls to femme fatale Faith Domergue. Perhaps they both felt it was a good way to show that they had a series of 'actors' that were playing against the type, the ordinary 'tough old' role they were known to enhance their image as actors who could play any role. But the problem was that roles like Steve Thompson, the pathetic love disease milquetoast in 'Criss Cross', did nothing to improve Lancaster's career. Not only did Lancaster fail in the one-note role of Thompson, but first of all, there is something inherently unlikely (and may I say). The main actor of the film is the first place. <br /> <br /> 'Criss Cross' is a tirelessly moving movie. Among the many unnecessary scenes in the film are at the beginning: the jump that twists Thompson's confrontation with Dan Duryea's Dundee at the nightclub. Everything that occurs in the first jump is explained later in the picture: the illegal relationship between Steve and Anna, Steve's tense relationship with Martinez, the policeman and his bad blood with Dundee. If director Siodmark feels compelled to start the movie with a jump, why not keep it within three minutes? I think it would have been more effective. <br /> <br /> In 'Criss Cross' it takes quite a while before the protagonist joins himself and out of the 'ordinary' world of Law One steps. It's the scene where he walks past and runs Anna into the nightclub. And see how Siodmak spends so much time between Anna dancing and Steve staring at her? In addition to the cross cut, he also spent a lot of time on Esy Morales and his Rhumba band than moving the story together. <br /> <br /> To Act Two, the story goes with Thompson with several uncomfortable encounters with Anna, and then she is drowning at his usual well. At the center of Law Two, he learns that Anna runs away and is married to Dundee. It is becoming increasingly clear that one of the bad bad of the movie is that Dundee is never on the screen. During most of the second act there is no confrontation between Thompson and Dundee. We have the unaware of the two love birds. It turns out (and Anna later explains it to Steve), the reason she was gone was no just because he disappeared eight months, but she also felt pressure from Steve's mother, as well as direct threats from Martinez, the police spokesman , which meant that he would see to it that she ended up in the Women's House of Detention. Anna goes back to Steve because she realizes she has made a big mistake with Dundee. He seems to have beaten her and she is scared of him. <br /> <br /> One of the stupid disapproval caused by more than one Character in Criss Cross is that you can never cut an armored car. But everyone is so surprised when Steve points out that this can be done if it is an 'inside job'! You would have thought that Dundee would have been about Steve's occupation as an armored car driver and had proposed him beforehand. But of course Steve has to make the proposal so Dundee won't kill him after discovering his relationship with Anna. (If they're so scared to get caught, why does Steve and Anna meet at his apartment where Dundee can find them so easily?). I really got a kick from Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the "brain" of the operation. Dundee is so stupid that he has to carry this alcoholic ex-professor type who portrays the elevator on a map. Oh, there is the matter of buying the ingredients to build the gas bombs used during the robbery. Of course, Finchley is good too! <br /> <br /> The only very well done scene in the whole movie is the armored car robbery. The editing was pretty good because it portrayed the rising performance of an elevator. As the gas bombs go down, the gangster's brutality is shown in high relief when Dundee kills the innocent armored car. <br /> <br /> The climax of the movie is as laid out as the rest of the movie. Why is it so long that one of Dundee's goons kidnapped Thompson? There is that nurse, then the goon goes outside, then he comes in and pretends to be a friend, Steve falls asleep and eventually after he wakes up, the goon kidnaps him. <br /> <br /> When Steve finally arrives Anna at home we wonder how Anna has her hands on the cash. Did she steal it from Dundee somehow after going out for dinner? It is never explained. Worse still, Anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatale from the blue. Earlier, her selfishness and appeal to Dundee could be explained by her alleged rejection in the hands of Steve and Martinez's threats. But after returning to Steve for fear of Dundee, she inexplicably turns to him if he is the most vulnerable. Just as there are 'instant coffee', you have 'instant femme fatale'. <br /> <br /> In the "Film Noir An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style" by Silver and Ward, the authors "Criss at Cross" as one of the most tragic and compelling of film noir. I differ. To have tragedy, you need great depth characters and to be compelling, you need a story that's likely. Criss Cross didn't. It's an overstated "B Movie" that somehow found itself in the pantheon or art house noirs. Once again, the herd mentality has come in the evaluation of the photos of last year.
