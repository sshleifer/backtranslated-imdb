Having sat through this movie, I decided it was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. I knew when I was three teenage girls screaming and convincing when they (OMG!) Meet again, and then look at the same thing, just done by women who are old enough to be my mother. And it's only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Mid-aged women + ridiculous dance moves completed with hip push and over the top costumes = not a good idea. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Brosnan couldn't get his way out of a bag. Neither can anyone else in this outbreak, for the matter. <br /> <br /> 3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown into the incredibly confronted and STOP plot. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old nephew could have written a better script. <br /> <br /> I laughed or laughed at the movie. And I usually like movie music. Of course they should be a little crown ... but it was ridiculous. What a waste of talent. I mean, you have great actors and actresses in this movie ... I'm ashamed of them being part of their career. I regret my money and waste time on this piece of crap.
