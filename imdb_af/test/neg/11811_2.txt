Well, that's how it should have been called anyway. Mainly, due to the ridiculous, ham-fisted use of which can hardly be called symbolic by the director. It wouldn't surprise me to find out that it was A. One of Lea Pool's earliest efforts, and B) at least semi-autobiographical. Pointers A are wrong, though I do not; I do not know B. I will bet that she attended school, and have a rather terrible gender relationship. This is the message that has been beaten to our throat by this film, and the short film that preceded it, the name of which I no longer remember. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the character development was awkward (Who puts her by saying what her name means? No one.) The symbols were about as subtle as a glass container full of teenage girls who lost a cable and eighty stories increase. About a speaker. Honestly, the scream of a falcon when Perabo declared she was a raptor and jumped off the table? It was ridiculous to the point of parody. And it was just one of too many symbols meant to even show the stupid viewers what her point was. And it's that she had a baby and the need to make movies about it, seeing Vincent Gallo, rather than a therapist, all of us who are continuing with our lives. There was nothing tender, nothing sweet, and nothing had moved over this movie. It was badly decayed, and the actors could not use the Brett Ratneresque over "HEY THIS IS MY POINT IN THIS FILY" but use film techniques, writing and acting. Sorry, but it was terrible.
