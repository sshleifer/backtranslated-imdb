"Council Chairman" is a ridiculous stupid movie of the popular comic Carrot Top (also featured on the 1-800-COLLECT commercials). He plays a surfing inventor who comes across a man with a flat band. Top helped him out and a few days later he discovered the man's death and gave his company to the comedian. Even if someone else was in Carrot Top's role, it would have been bad. The jokes (aimed throughout) are terrible and the idea of ​​a romantic "plot twist" had to be thrown away. DO NOT WATCH !!!
