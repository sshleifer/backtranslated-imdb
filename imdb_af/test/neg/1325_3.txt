I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie, but it was full of triet melodrama. It was too long and at least slightly uneven (granted, I didn't give full attention ...). For a more entertaining portrayal of the battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy At the Gates. True, some pretentious people will mock because it's a Hollywood movie, and don't show "the eager reality of the war" like this wonderful foreign movie, but it did flow better and is just more fun to watch. In addition, there is already a "gritty" war film, and this one just looked amateurish. But hey, you may like it, so go straight; It just wasn't for me.
