*** SPOILERS! *** I sometimes wonder what the successors think they should (and therefore destroy) the riddles behind iconic Horror movies. The original "Hellraiser" of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. The 1988 sequel "Hellbound" was also a fantastic Horror movie, but I didn't personally like the viewer having background information on the Cenobites, some of the all-time creepiest horror villains in the original. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992), was already a mess, the makers of which, of course, needed to add a dose of humor to the previously incomparable creepy lead-cenobite Pinhead (a typical 90s folly) and therefore most of its scarcity. This fourth part, "Hellraiser: Bloodline" (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third, but it lowers this quality by finding even more stupid and unnecessary "background information" about the cenobites and opening the gates to hell. br /> Seriously - did we need to know how to make the mysterious puzzles that open the gates to hell? I don't think, and that's not the only secret of the cenobites that are stunned in this movie. The setting of "Bloodline" goes back and forth in three different periods. The film begins in a 22nd-century space station when scientist dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) attempts to close the gates into hell forever. When government soldiers disrupt his mission, he must explain his reasons. In the 18th century, Paris, the merchant's ancestor was a wizard dedicated to building a puzzle through an aristocrat obsessed with the occult. An excited demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person capable of destroying the gate to hell is the one who built it, cursing the toymaker's bloodline and his ancestors contaminating cenobites through the ages ... The movie in the 18th century, present, and the 22nd century, is really a mess. I admit that the part of the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but it is also the smallest part of it. The parts that are set in the present and in the future are fairly poor and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. The film's undoubtedly strong points are the awesome makeup and gore effects, the absolutely surprising Valentina Varagas as his devil, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, despite losing his creepiness, is still a threatening danger. villain. It's an almost offensive idea for Hellraiser fans, but Pinhead is supposed to be defeated by a ridiculous light show. Overall, "Bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it is definitely an unworthy successor to a series that started so brilliantly. Even director Kevin Yagher was clearly ashamed of this because he chose to be credited as Alan Smithee. Overall, it is only recommended for hardcore Pinhead fanatics, and most of them will probably be angry with another reduction in their favorite demon's creepiness. All the others are well advised to stick with the brilliant first and second second part of the "Hellraiser" franchise and skip the other. The makeup effects in "Bloodline" are creepy like hell, but almost everything is disappointing. My rating: 3.5 / 10
