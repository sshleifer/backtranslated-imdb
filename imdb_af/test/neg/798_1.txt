I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme, with judges either praising a movie at the stocking or tearing items. I don't find any of these reviews helpful, so I don't give this movie the terrible review I'm going to lightly. The film is the worst-of-the-art art-house fiction dressed as a Hollywood star. The trailers pull you in by showing you what appears to be a coherent plot, but are actually only a small part of a deliberate baffling series of events that are never properly resolved. I like movies that challenge the viewer and I don't have to make a plot. That's why my complaint against this movie isn't that it's too high. No - the movie is just awful. As the credits roll, you will feel true anger if you have lost your time on Cameron Diaz's woodwork and a fake plot line. Avoid.
