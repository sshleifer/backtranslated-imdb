A boring movie about an unfortunate loser ... it's Factotum in a nutshell. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinaski, author of author Charles Bukowski, whose novel is based on film. While we meet Chinaski, he can be a writer, but he is definitely not a successful one. He drives through life, is discharged from one multitude of works to another and does not care. The fact that he is always drunk can have something to do with not caring. He met a woman, Jan, played by Lili Taylor and a relationship emerged. Chinaski moves in Jan's apartment and now, instead of getting himself drunk, he can get drunk with someone else. Good times. Eventually he had enough of this relationship, so Chinaski came out on his own. Unfortunately, he still can't keep a job, as soon as he's broken. At this point Marisa Tomei shows up and for some reason her character, Laura, decides to save this unfortunate drunk loser she doesn't even know. We will soon meet a few of Laura's acquaintances and the movie will spring out in a bizarre world with this rather eclectic forest. Soon Tomei and friends are out of the picture and again we are left with Chinaski and she drinks and his miserable little life. There is even more time with Jan, but mostly there is only time to be a drunk, unemployed loser. And then the movie is over and not a moment too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer than the movie draw. Nothing happens. Nothing ever happens. If you want to spend an hour and a half of your life, see Matt Dillon then drink it for you. If you are looking for a compelling story, well-developed characters or any entertainment value whatsoever then you have come to the wrong place. Dillon's performance is not bad at all. The film that surrounds him is actually pretty bad.
