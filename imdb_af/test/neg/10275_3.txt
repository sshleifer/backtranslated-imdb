I know my summary sounds very loud, but this film has very limited appeal. The average Joe out there will have a hard time with this movie. The entire film consists of animated loggers doing their work and dancing on swing logs. It's all with lots of brilliant and artistic colors and the movie can be great for showing customers in an art museum. But unless you're really into this kind of art or a Canadian who loves movies about your own country, it's likely to be impossible to finish. I have a fairly high tolerance for this kind of thing and even I had to force myself to look after a few minutes. I can respect the work that worked on it, but it's not compelling.
