This one barely compares to the space adventures of his time. This is Star Wars and Star Trek. And while I'm not a Star Trek fan, I admit that this movie is over the Trekkies series. In fact, I'll be back to the future in better light in terms of space and travel. <br /> <br /> The story is of a boy being captured by space shifts (pirates). In a clear false and unforeseen battle, the prisoner boys find the pirates and even help them. And slowly, one by one, those raiders are dying. In the end, the boy gets home and the last remaining pirates escape seriously injured. <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't so good. But what is really obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogue, effects and storyline. How they even have 80 minutes of it is outside me. <br /> <br /> If you want to take a shot because it involves space, continue. But be warned. "D"
