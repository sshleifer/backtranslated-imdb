I couldn't. I was bored not only because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b-movie, the plot of which was all about cannibalism, but the fact that I watch a strange movie subtitle, which doesn't bother me at all not, but is still baptized. <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were terrible. As the back of the plane is split off, you can see the model is hollow as it "breaks away" into the fake snow. Most of the movies take place on a sound phase that is clearly not real and looks almost like a play, as the "sounds" of snow are heard everywhere, but not actually. <br /> <br /> But what will they eat? They have no food "one military person (it is never clear what this man does or why he is in control), say, what I'm sure no one has ever actually said or even thought about food because they were worried if the people were alive, not how they would eat, it was just a dull line written to point out that yes, they will have to eat the bodies to survive. <br /> <br /> When they finally decided to eat the bodies, one man found one shirtless body, who, despite how long it was in the snow, was not deeply frozen, in fact his flesh was very flexible and fresh, cutting the fresh meat from his back, which doesn't seem to be frozen or cold again, and this scene lasts five minutes, that's where I had to stop, the remake "Alive" was a much better movie about trying to survive in a horrible situation I'm sure the right survivors have praised, while I can't think any of them have something nice to say about this the version is not. It was easy to eat empty bodies and everything was secondary. Avoid.
