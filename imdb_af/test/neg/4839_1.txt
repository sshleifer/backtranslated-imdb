Dead Man's Bounty (the film's American title) has the look and feel of a classic Italian western. The cinematography, costumes and sets look good. The cast is robust, not a pretty face among them. Initially I started preparing for a nice, cool movie, but what I finally saw was an absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The writing was terrifying. There was no tension and very little action or worth. <br /> <br /> Despite having played well, the cast (English) spoke with heavy European accents that were often incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The final nail in the coffin was the broad line of pretentiousness that painted most of the pictures, emphasizing the character of the barmaid that appears in some awkward sex scenes. Her speech near the end was also quite disturbing! <br /> <br /> The only novelty comes from Val Kilmer's stunt throw in the role of the dead, and continues with his recent series of DOA appearances!
