(May contain spools) This movie is the hallmark of strangeness. I rented it and hoped for a movie so bad it would be funny. However, I still cannot honestly decide if this film is meant to be scary or humorous. It combines the emotions in a reasonably disturbing way. Apparently it tries to be clever, but in reality it is not. For example, when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher, it starts playing happy music. If we go to Toxico, we have a knock, Mrs. Sir. Roger's Neighborhood Music. However, when the little child dreams of falling into the blood and when he gets the leg, it is clear that it will be time. So, look at this movie and decide for yourself. It is too strange to describe in words and for that I say, kudos. <br /> <br /> "Nose diving ... WOW!"
