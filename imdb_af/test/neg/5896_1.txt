This documentary was very amateurish. This could be done by students. If accepted, my rating is as follows. Content: C, Sound Quality: F, Cinematography: F, Acting: D, Sound track: F, Pouring: C, Boobshot: A ...... Overall Grade: D <br /> <br /> I found myself to Seesick as we walked into the streets with the characters, with every step of the cameraman's bumps occasionally. My mother-in-law even changed the batteries in her miracle and she couldn't hear the muted dialogue. Extended post-production editing and CGI won't help this bomb. These students will hardly pass my course. My advice ... don't waste your time or money for one "A".
