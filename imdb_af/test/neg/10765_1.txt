This is by far the most repulsive and horrible version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be invented. As a Pimpernel fan, I was genuinely offended by what they did to the characters - but these atrocities aren't worth watching even if you're not familiar with the story. <br /> <br /> For example, Percy Blakeney will never put people in the back just to get a go. Chauvelin will never have a string of women in his bed. Marguerite never had a relationship with Chauvelin, or Armand with Minette, whoever she is. Chauvelin didn't want to shoot Tony in the head randomly. Chauvelin's name is not, nor does it, Paul. They completely wiped out any reference to the Pimpernel's disguise, replacing them with James Bond-like gadgets and gizmos rather. <br /> <br /> Regarding the movie itself ... The makeup is scary. The women look like clowns. Elizabeth McGovern's beauty point randomly hits her face. The poor, spicy actors have no writing to work with, so it's not really their fault that their characters are as wet as wet paper. The dialogue ... o, the dialogue. The dialogue is unbearable. And anyone responsible for all the small captions at the bottom of the screen must be forced to watch this movie as a fine. (I have 13 places captions in the first half hour before giving up. As if we can't find out the water between England and France is the English channel.) <br /> <br /> The movie - If I can do it myself mention, because it is really just a videotape with a filter, it is absolutely without impairment. Don't waste your time and brain cells on this turmoil. Rather see the 1982 Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour version, or the 1934 Leslie Howard movie, or indeed ANY but this one.
