Why is it that such "romantic" movies that never really go completely, always start (and probably end) with crappy jazz? It's not smart and it looks like a bloody TV movie. Harrison Ford was probably trying to be mysterious and rough, but he was just a crawling mumbling police who seemed to walk into the congressor's house, as everything was good when he acted like a pervert - to Thomas watched with a perverse luster, which almost never spoke. <br /> <br /> And why do they always have British actors to attack themselves - they are thrown out because they are known, and everyone knows they are British, precisely because they are known!
