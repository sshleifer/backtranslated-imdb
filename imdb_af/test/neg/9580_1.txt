I bought the DVD from a huge bag for $ 4.99, and I was convinced in a documentary pearl that would actually showcase extensive footage from the Karakoram Mountains, and especially K2. Fast forward through the movie I reached the climate scene in which the climbers caught their first face of ---- Mount Waddington, which fell to 13,260 feet in Canada's coastal area. At least one of the many booze K2 climbs to climb has no idea how the real mountain actually looks. He must be assured by his friend and climber that he would not be brought to an ugly by the said partner. mountain. While one of the films' premises is that 27 people have lost their lives on K2, you might think that the push may have taken a minute or two to compile some basic facts, but the clown seems to think that preparations for this scale, while being good enough for the likes of Reinhold Messner, are under him. To be honest, I didn't look at the whole thing. What I saw is approaching me. They say you get what you pay for. At $ 4.99, I'm torn.
