As a fan of the writer Gipharts Lightheaded and humorous books (of which I am not the best of you), I look forward to the movie. However, I didn't catch it in the theater, and after watching it on TV, I'm very happy. I resisted buying it on video. From a good book they managed to make one of the worst films in Dutch film history. All the good parts were left out, the story changed, not its benefits. All humor is cut out. What remains is a bad, dramatic, non-consistent movie I never want to see again. <br /> <br /> I renounce Giphart with this result and am pleased that Robbert Jan Westdijk has made a hell of a better job on Giphart's top Phileine says. Sorry. Go see that one!
