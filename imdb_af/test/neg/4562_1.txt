I think if you like to see how dudes are "dimmed" to outrageous sizes, it rises upright. Otherwise, this is an exercise in ego. I also don't need to do it. And it is of historical importance, I think, to see how this muscle got positive and brain negative chumps like this (before / after / between steroids) - but otherwise it won't affect many guys and, like women, , I'm not one so I can't say ....
