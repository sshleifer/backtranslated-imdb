Why Lori Petty was like a girl, I'll never know. Her appearance is lacking in gloss. Her voice is grid. It's almost impossible for me to say how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There are several "modern pop" references in the film, which I found very strange, as the film was supposed to be far in the future. It would not be difficult to make this presentation interesting either. Some better writing would have helped. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts appears in it as a soft, manipulated techno-geek. I think they probably had to change roles. <br /> <br /> I will never know why anyone would like this movie unless they were a little guy. <br /> <br /> Don't try to see this movie. . Total waste of time.
