I saw Wicked Little Things as part of the "8 movies to die for" Horrorfest, and that was the only movie that disappointed me. A mom, her daughter, and her teenage daughter go to a deserted house in the Pennsylvania mountains. Every night, the feelings of revenge of children killed in a coal mine run and someone who finds them is killed. <br /> <br /> I think the director was banking while his viewers apologized that children would be able to pick murders. and eating human flesh (of which there are delicious close-ups, as a good tribute to George Romero) because the film is not terribly different. Simply put, there are far too many shots to create from the evil children running to their next murder scene. If someone gets it in the shed, there will be a shot of the children coming to the shed (oh the tension) and then coming in for death. <br /> <br /> Come to think about it, why do the kids run so slowly when they cage their prey? And not that I have any experience in this, but I think a shotgun explosion will throw a child. A MUCH FURTHER than this movie implies ...? It also doesn't help the mother to be one of the worst parents I've ever seen in any movie. "The lock on the front door is disturbed"? You Have A EIGHT YEAR OLD DAY IN THE WOODS WITH BIRDS AND MOUNTAINS! FIND THIS, YOU MORON !!! Plus, Mom and her oldest daughter look too close to each other - even for a teenage pregnancy, and there is a very incredible death which means someone is trying to push a car out of the mud with their buttocks. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 because it has tried. As a blunder, it's not bad. But for a good fright, go elsewhere.
