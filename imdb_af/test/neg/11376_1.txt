Comparing this movie to anything by Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say about it is that it desperately tries to be like an Almodovar movie and fails. The writing is terrible, the characters are one-dimensional and the performances are the quality of high school drama (except Marcia Gay Harden's, which is pretty good, given the material she needs to work with). Furthermore, cinematography has absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of Gaudi's architecture or the infectious charm of Barcelona. If you enjoy the grit, pathos and dark, exciting comedy of Almodovar's movies, you won't find one of them here. Spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.
