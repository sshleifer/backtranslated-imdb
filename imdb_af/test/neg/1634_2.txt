Still in the long line of Conan wannabes who are tired of cash in the film's success, this Italian monstrosity is about as bad as they have come. You know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheap, there was no money for any sufficient special effects or to hire real people. I won't even go into the plot because I testify to someone to follow it and make sense of the storyline. Maybe it's the television track I watched, but I can't imagine any version being so much better. It seems to me so random. Evil wizards, cavemen, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hang gliding? nothing of it fits together. It is as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic fit while making Cave Dwellers (or any other half-dozen names the movie goes on) and throwing everything he could think on the screen, no matter how unrelated it was or how it fits into the movie's already enigmatic plot. The acting is bad enough. Miles O'Keeffe can never get out of a wet paper bag and he proves it again in this movie. The rest of the cast is equally scary. Then there is the. . . Well, you get that idea. It's late, I'm tired, and I've wasted more than enough time on this piece of garbage. Take my word for it? Avoid cave dwellers (or whatever you want to call them) at all costs.
