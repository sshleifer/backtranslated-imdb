I tried to watch this show on several occasions and considered it a mere mood every time. <br /> <br /> The reason, to name one thing, is that it is based only on anything the Republicans have done. In short, it is basically democratic party political opinions that are designated as humor. <br /> <br /> All Mr Stewart is wary of anything the Republicans have done and the audience trembles in the storms of forced laughter. <br /> <br /> My guess is that the left side is without any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate Republicans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> my belief: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
