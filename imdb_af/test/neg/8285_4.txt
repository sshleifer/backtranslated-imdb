Six months after high school printer Laura dies during a race, a killer starts killing the rest of the team with a variety of sports equipment as weapons: this is the spectacular plot of the early 80s scraper graduation day, a slender addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore. <br /> <br /> What it does, however, is some amazing horrible musical interludes, some familiar faces (including an early appearance of screaming queen Linnea Quigley), and a flattery of nudity (' a prerequisite of any treasure trove!). <br /> <br /> So do the death tones forget? They are lame and rather bloodless? and rather the movie's more memorably enjoyable elements: the quick editing that can cause migraines and epileptic seizures; the roller disco, which is accompanied by a long rock rock song, 'Gangster Rock', performed by the unforgettable horrible Felony; an impromptu stamp session by the school's students; Christopher George is hammering it as a major-heron coach Michaels; and the cheesy music teacher who mocks his female students (who for some reason finds it irresistible!)! <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, the action picks up a little, with the discovery of the sex bodies among the bleachers, and a rather twisted scene with Laura's body in her cap and gown, but It comes late in the day to save this film of mediocrity.
