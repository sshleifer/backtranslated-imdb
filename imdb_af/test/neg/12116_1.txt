TV Show Shows half the time he comes up for nominations, comic relief, chat shows, quiz shows, games, charity shows, Brighton. Just when you want to end up in your mind and think you can find salvation in the wireless is the desire of good old JR. If you find a freight train, no one goes from Texas to downtown NY. It lost an hour and tried to make it up. <br /> <br /> About this show (FNWJR). <br /> <br /> This is a normal chat show format with JR As host and a home group that is the best of four gay men (ha ha ha, ow my sore side.) And season one had Andy Davis, but he ran away to give Ross's Ego. <br /> <br /> Ross will use his guests less than props and you won't really hear them. Because of his "This is my ball and I will take it home", you also see the bigger the gas the more he is willing to lie and suck up, to enter into the big boys (Like the weak child at school who hangs around with the bulls.) <br /> <br /> But when a small TV Star comes to reality, he would like to humiliate them, ask personal questions about the past and tell them about their lack of story. nt to get the laugh. Sometimes he'll estimate the popularity of a gas, say something to belittle them and then the shoulder will turn quickly and start making the fake man. The best example of this was when life on Mars stars John Simm came and he said how someone works like you, you look good but not Hollywood. (Keep in mind that the Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were in the green room, he really just tried to suck in front of them. They were even on the couch). When the audience was shocked, Ross quickly said, "What, I'm a little corset light, I don't know what I'm saying". If he does not have a low form of TV life, he will only dig on the four gay men on the piano with jokes that are more outdated than his fashion. <br /> <br /> It's a very different story when a Hollywood A-list or big TV star comes to the show, he'll tell stories to them for humor. When an actor explains that he is in a support band, Jonathon Ross will say something like "Wow, he'll ever see a band, I tried to be interested in the support band, to make them feel like they were" With " An underlined message is "like me, I was probably one of the people who encouraged you when you were in your band." Top it off with an audience of Ross fans, so addicted to every bad old joke and bulling it really make a poor performance. <br /> <br /> You better watch American talk shows instead, they're more written, but not everywhere, so hard to watch.
