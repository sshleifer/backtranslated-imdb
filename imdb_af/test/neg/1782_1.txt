There is so much to say about this movie and so little is it good! <br /> <br /> The plot has enough holes to sink the Titanic, the characters are absolutely incredible, the monsters are so unrealistic, and I'm sick and tired of watching movies an ex-husband and ex- Include a woman in a bitter emergency. It happens too much in movies and it is still a bad clich√©. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that someone would invest $ 1 to make this garbage, no matter what the $ 100 is. It has to cost. <br /> <br /> You can make a better movie with more compelling special effects on your computer! I didn't think movies could get this bad! Avoid it at all costs - do something that is more fun and enjoyable, like pulling a tooth or having a day!
