Oh man! This series should be the worst possible anime I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It started new, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it. Kagome was a good female role model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and hot-headed. <br /> <br /> Then it just got downhill as the series progressed ... and I'll tell you the reasons why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT !!) Okay, they destroy Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome early by reviving his 50-year-old dead girlfriend, who is brave, juicy, and a total waste of time. . <br /> <br /> They announce a pervert called Miroku, which is supposed to be a kind of religious figure for the show. (What really deceived me because it was out of place and stupid.) Then they introduce a devil's boss known as Sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save her broken brother. <br /> <br /> The big bad thing about the show, Naraku, as he started out as a very bad guy, got lost after a while. (He became quite old, and it bothered me that he was the only bad man in the show to do something.) <br /> <br /> The characters all turned out to be wood, and unemotional. And then the end of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there. Nothing happened. Naraku was never killed or defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fell in love again (because he was still in love with his 50-year-old dead chick.) Plotgate is left open. The animation got worse and worse when the series progressed. And nothing changed in the plot. (I mean, they dragged it to more than 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot.) And they expected me (as well as other show fans) to be content? I was disillusioned, frightened, and annoyed as a shit. At least I had hope that there would be a good end to the series. Instead, all I got was a sold out commercial for the manga. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you want to see a good anime about swords and things, I strongly recommend Rurouni Kenshin. This performance progresses and goes somewhere, plus it also has a good animation. <br /> <br /> But stay far away from this common excuse for anime, as well as you can.
