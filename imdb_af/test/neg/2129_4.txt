I wanted to enjoy this movie because I have an admiration for Italian rip-off theater (especially Jaws rip-offs!), But the simple fact of the matter is that Monster Shark is not very good. All the signs that it's a big piece of waste are there; We have one of the kings of trashy cult cinema, Lamberto Bava, in the director's seat - one of the best ridiculous cult actors, Michael Sopkiw, who plays the lead and a central being who is stupid enough to give even the best. kind of movie has a run for his money, but somehow the movie runs pretty well. The fact that the "monster shark" does not occur too often is probably a good thing for the creature design, but there is never enough elsewhere to pass through the film without it. The plot focuses on a resort on the south coast of Florida (or rather, somewhere in Italy) where several locals are missing in the water with arms and legs. It is not long before local authorities have decided that this creature has never been seen before, and it is up to a moderate crew of several sea experts to catch it alive! <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie is that it always feels very senseless, and since there is little in the way of characters or plot development, even the least demanding of viewers will probably get bored long ago. . This kind of movie is hardly known for being brilliant, although the fun element of movies like 'The Last Shark' and 'Killer Fish' is unfortunately absent for most runs. The thing I love for the main actor Michael Sopkiw is that he always looks like he is taking himself seriously, no matter what movie he is in (although he only made four). This is certainly the case here, although Bava never really allows him to dive in, and often he feels like a spare wheel than the rest of the movie. Much of the time is spent looking at the different characters of the American Army, and it's not very fascinating; Although Bava managed to get along well with an entertaining wave of action at the end, the central monster would eventually get devastated on his prisoner. Overall, there really isn't much to recommend this movie. As I mentioned, I really like such things and even I have bored myself many times. For hardcore Italian horror fans alone!
