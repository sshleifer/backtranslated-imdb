Sci-Fi channel thinks it's Sci-Fi; It's a pity. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasts, constantly. They persisted. <br /> <br /> Some of Universal had the brain to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, good one) and Firefly in their line for a short time. up. I know they know they differ between total refuse and extremely high quality sci-fi. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, they were all about high and powerful, making productions that were not just for us. lama-o Trekkies. Thank you, Sci-Fi! You know, you make movies so bad, even Trekkies won't see them, so you've achieved your goal! Fire Snake, Ice Spiders, Manticore, Larva, etc. And a great relentless shake storm later, and they're still faster than the latest flu virus! How they do this is beyond me. Why they do this, I just don't know. I don't know how to ignore these reviews, comments, blogs, and emails, but it's clear they don't think much of their audience or care about our opinions! They seem to think that's what sci-fi fans want! You would think one or two good productions would crawl with a little sense when someone who is a little greenish is on holiday. At least they use the Misfit Toys collection; much of the week's sci-fi movie was featured in Science Fiction programs and now the cash needs. Keep you from people and hope you get better work!
