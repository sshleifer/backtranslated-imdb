I am speechless, honestly I cannot understand how someone could have conceded to such a script, leaving anything in the film, let it be straight. The fact that I write this review feels like an insult to my fingers. This movie should be thrown in the garbage, rather than being reviewed. I'm disappointed in Flex Alexander to even think about accepting such a GREAT VINTAGE for a script, let alone the essay. OMG! I think I just insulted the word "essay" ... ... yes, I did. Know what, the less said about this foolish dreamer, the better. You have been warned, no one has warned me that I had to experience the horror myself. Look at your own risk.
