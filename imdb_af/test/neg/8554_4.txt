Not the best of the WIPs, but not the worst. I honestly feel guilty of this movie because it must be career lows for everyone involved. Still, the acting, dialogue, preliminary scenarios, and ever-present boom microphone come to me every time and surely add charm to the bad movie. So much of a Linda Blair fan I am, top (or topless) honors goes to Sybil Danning. Also, special kudos to Henry Silva, who is the only one in the role who doesn't play his part too seriously. Look, the movie now, let me look more closely at the Stella Stevens character. She plays the lead officer and I have to wonder if Hilary Clinton decided to accept her current look and attitude. After all, I'm sure she shouldn't look beyond her husband's video collection to find this movie. Not that I judge. I've seen it myself several times, and it makes me wonder what would have happened if Mr. Clinton was allowed to install a hot tub in the Oval Office. Hmmm.
