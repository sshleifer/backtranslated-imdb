I was very worried about this movie. It was scheduled to play at a Jewish Film Festival. It was very hostile to Israel, using clever humor and irony. <br /> <br /> I was relieved that the movie was not a diatribe, but as a film work it was very disappointing. The film was full of random events, some of which were ultimately connected, most of which did not. Some of the events were very clever and funny, but some were just random and useless. <br /> <br /> There are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car, wordless and play a hand. Perhaps it is erotic in some cultures, but it's like watching the thumb wrestling. After the third time it really got tiresome. <br /> <br /> I always found David Lynch to be generous bizarre, using strange stories and images to make him think he was so sophisticated that they didn't understand. she works; In fact, there is nothing to understand. The same applies here, the stories do not add up, and there is not much of a political point made. In one scene, a savage Israeli soldier humiliates Palestinian drivers at a checkpoint. This is news?) <br /> <br /> I don't understand why this movie has been disputed, and why it has not been addressed. It is an inferior job and it was a waste of time.
