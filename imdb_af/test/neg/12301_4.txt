A good arrangement of actors and a seemingly nice plot - although not original - promised me a nice evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors gave up by default (Juliette Lewis is nice as William Ever, but in the background; convinced Shelley Duvall as always), but the story was too thin to get me into the story and the turn to the final was too late obvious and late; there was only one character who was nice to him, so guess what? Then the final post-turn? I don't know what to think about it. The boyfriend and the neighbor? Contract with the devil, or just to move her in? What! The movie had a good idea for that, but the idea was not fully worked out. It could have been good, but it wasn't. Too many loose points to tie, Columbo will say.
