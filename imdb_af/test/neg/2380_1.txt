This movie almost gave me a nervous breakdown. When I repaired appendicitis a few years ago, I just started to learn in high school. The whole teaching business was a bit nervous for a beginner, but preparing me to go back to the classroom, I decided to watch some horrible movies. The Flintstones were one of the movies I chose, and then I put 'King Of The Streets' (the British title of 'Alien Warrior'). Just before it was finished, I almost got in tears with the mere waste of everything ... my life, the movie stock, the Â£ 2 I paid a few weeks ago in the Blockbuster ex rental, the time it must have taken to print the art, the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (as negligent as their efforts) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. Let me make it quite clear. I love watching crappy movies from Blockbusters. Me and my friend Dan use to watch and laugh at many, very cheap jackets horrors. But it was another kind of crappy movie. I don't think anything came close, not even Tobe Hooper's "Death Trap" (which is probably my second worst movie in the world). The whole thing that made a car out of abandoned parts almost killed me; repeating music at any available opportunity, regardless of screen events; the whole .... AAAGGGHHHHHHH !!!!! I can't even continue with this "critical" dissection, as my gag reflex has begun. The futility of the movie, even now, three years after watching it for the first and last time, still makes me speechless (but I can still type). The whole part that made a car from strange parts, considered my terrible things. <br /> <br /> I beg you, if you are interested in watching this movie, just look at the front page of the video and think of the worst possible version of the story summary on the back. I can almost guarantee that it won't be half as bad as this movie really is. Do not under any circumstances consider viewing it for any reason. Not if you are a Christian and you want to see a Christian story; not if you are a bad movie afictionado and you want to experience the true nadir of garbage; not even if you want your life to look longer (and believe me every second that this movie looks like at least a minute). Make no mistake with this, this movie is unholy. This is the antichrist in video form. As Bo Cattlett said in Get Shorty, "I've seen better movies on the teeth."
