Plants in an ancient Mayan pyramid structure kill all who come near. Yes, it's weird, as the travelers don't find out until everything starts to go crazy. And in a movie like this, I just wished it had become absurd and marching bands were attacked by plant-seeking machete. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a group of people from America vacation and go in the mountains with some of the other newly-made German friends who know about the place. When they arrived, the Mayans started screaming and hiding on the structure. And when there, when the plants decide to take them out, mimic cellphone sounds, people and ancient Mayan dead. <br /> <br /> Nothing was really scary about the movie and wasn't even entertaining. Not even the odd end can save this piece of crap. I kept looking for something really good to happen, but nothing. Oh good. "F"
