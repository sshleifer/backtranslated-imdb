This is my first "terrible" rating ever on IMDb and I couldn't think of a more deserving movie to honor it. I was hoping for the ruin of trash and found trash of the saddest, boring kind. I found a movie that nobody can care about, including the creator. <br /> <br /> "Hell Ride", directed, written by and with Larry "Friend of QT" Bishop, has a simple plot on a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two ties of cyclists and " a horrific murder in 1976 that still has to be revenge. Larry seems quite determined not to tell this story, and rather focuses on putting his swinging, strangely grim character in situations where he can love women who pretend to be. He also has a dialogue with enough horrific hotspots / metaphors to postpone one of the words "fire" for life. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper escapes complete humiliation, others are not so happy. Sometimes they hit the bicycles on the bike, and feel sorry for Michael Madsen, as his high handles are insulting to the injury to appear in this movie. There are many silicone enhanced nudity, but pretty little action and no humor whatsoever, but you just wonder what kind of audience they had in mind. <br /> <br /> My guess is that most people watching this movie, including fans of trashy 60s biker movies, will feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and review the right things instead.
