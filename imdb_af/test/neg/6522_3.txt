This script was originally original when it was written in 1935, but the poor performance and the conflicting quality level make it impossible to recommend. Some of the vignettes are absolutely horrible and the dialogue is never natural. Some of the plot twists were creative, but I was very surprised to see it so highly rated at the IMDB. A few scenes are worth it, it's like a movie that if not totally entertained. If you like this kind of montage, don't run and get 'Tales of Manhattan' (1942) a wonderful movie that follows the life and times of a top jacket.
