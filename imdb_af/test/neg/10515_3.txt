Ron Hall draws a threefold threat as he writes, director and stars in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clich√©d cop-on-a-mission who finds himself in his neck in some nasty vampire action. He rubs off his weapon and looks for the last vampire killer (no not Buffy!) To take the streets back and return the bloodbugs to the grave. <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible movie. It ripens so many other movies (can you say Blade?) That it never even tries to establish its own identity. The script does not exist. The action is terrible. Who says a micro budget stimulates creativity? There is nothing here, but here it is also interesting. You won't get anything from this, except a headache. Stay away at all costs.
