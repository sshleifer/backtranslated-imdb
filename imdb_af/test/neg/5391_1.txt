I, like many others here, bought this movie from my local WM in the "Two for $ 11.00" cheap-o-bin. I love cheesy B horror and sci-fi movies, and this one definitely fits in that category. Almost everything everyone said here is dead. Yes, it was bad, but it was to be expected. The main problem I had with this movie was that it was just basic. I mean serious yawn-o-rama. The acting was bad, the costumes (K Mart Skeletor outfit circa 1982) were worse, and the editing was terrible. No continuity whatsoever. Mr Skeletor eventually died in an explosion of ... ... although he experienced several explosions throughout this move. I think the last one just took his toll on him. Apparently, earlier encounters with this "military" group (cough) took his toll on his horse. It will change from red to black in this shit party. Even for a B-movie, do yourself a favor and skip it. The only good thing I can do now is to add it to my DVD collection. Hopefully nobody will recognize it when they look through my movie collection. Thumbs down, great time.
