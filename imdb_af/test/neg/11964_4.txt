This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. I know, I know ... but how good is that? Well, let's not be stupid. It's pretty bad, but compared to the first two, it's a fine movie. Again shot at digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> When a college baseball team expels new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. Of course, they leave him in a wheat field tied to a scarecrow. In keeping with the legend, the boy's soul is transferred into the scarecrow's body, which comes to life and brings terrible revenge, well, pretty much everyone. The co-operatives drive to the beach, which is somehow very close to the grassland. On the sunny beach they are killed one by one by the whistling scarecrow. <br /> <br /> Author / director Brian Katkin does a credible job of bringing a much needed drama to the film. Unfortunately, the drama jumps over stuff and lands in plain cheese. Much of the acting was fair, but there were some horrible pieces, including a terrible piece of bad lip sinking. Some plot points were mostly left unresolved, and most were used to get someone alone so they could be slaughtered. Again, better than previous installments, but still missing.
