This movie was OK as far as movies are concerned. It could have been as a transition to secular films. However, this had little to do with the left behind books that it was supposedly based on. Great story site was removed, and new big story premises were added. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me most was how Nicolae was portrayed. He was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have in the books at this stage. Antichrist is not Satan, is not omniscient and not almighty. <br /> <br /> Faith and beliefs were portrayed in strange, surrealistic ways that made the movie silly. <br /> <br /> Non-believers who see it will have more ammunition to mock Christian beliefs.
