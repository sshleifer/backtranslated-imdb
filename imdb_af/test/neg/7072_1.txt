OK, fans, this is on DVD. But the only reason to see it is 1) to say you've done it (because of its fame), or 2) if you're a stubborn Bill Paxton fan. I'm not a hardcore BP fan, but he was nice to watch and that was the only thing that prevented me from getting bored. This is a pity, as it could have been a good movie with a script work and if it was made by someone with some intelligence (and with a role guided by someone other than the completely misunderstood and talented Judd Nelson) . Certainly it's gross, but it's BAD, and not in a good way. If you're after all the comments about how bizarre uprising and dystopies dirty this movie, you're still interested, do yourself a favor and see some good, bizarre uproar dystopic dirt instead. Movies by John Waters, David Lynch, Peter Jackson's "Braindead", Henenlotter's "Basket Case", etc. All come. There is much better out there.
