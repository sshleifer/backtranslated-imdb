After Kenneth Opel's thrilling story of excited me back in the pleasure of reading during grade school, I have a great hope of this series. The story of an underdog bat that reunites across the country to reunite with its colony has enchanted my imagination and deployed me deeply with my emerging imagination. When I heard about this series, I started on the Bardel Animation website and liked what I saw. The character design looks impressive and the fast plot has stretched over a thirteen episode arc. It was very disappointing when I decided to see an early mornie. <br /> <br /> The opening section shows our hero, Shade Silverwing, who follows a tiger moth in the deep hours of the night. If we eradicate an echolocatory song, we see a fine problem if a rough CGI effect illuminates the moth, and the chase takes a frenetic turn, as the small insect causes numerous illusory copies of itself, deceiving his pursuer. As a lover of biology, I had a proper understanding of the principles that are in place (tiger moths can use the sounds that their predators use for echolocation and spin a sonic covering for themselves) but without such exposition I would surely be lost has. A little thing, I thought. Surely their director will fill us in soon. I waited in vain. <br /> <br /> As soon as our protagonist goes to sleep with some of his fellow humans, we are treated to some of the dull dialogue I have ever seen on television. Chinook, Shade's youth rival, is launching the small hero with the stupid lines I've ever seen on a show. I can understand the writers who do not produce Shakespeare, but one would think they would have had some social contact in their lives - probably enough that communication looks natural. Oh, how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> The voice acting, while not terrible, was hardly a shining example of human achievement. "Oh, shadow, you've broken the law!" Shade's mother sucked emptily. "You must come with me, young one." Croaks Frieda, the wise elder of the Silverwing colony. The actors are trying, but it doesn't matter as the story becomes less and less compelling with every pass minute. <br /> <br /> Whilst each episode deals with a week's problem, such as typical of most television series, overarching story arches, the saga penetrated for better and worse. While the main point of the story is Shade's reunion with his family, later episodes are based on other story bows, including cannibalistic bats of the Southern jungle and a breeding war between birds and animals. The authors are trying to do too much immediately and fight to gather as many promising ideas as possible in the hope that it will grab the public's interest in keeping the bloody performance going. Unfortunately, these efforts are useless to all, but the eight to ten year olds at whom this show is aimed. <br /> <br /> Whilst enjoying the Canadian media, it continues, it will be sweeter than the enjoyment of The Series is not limited to the immediate family of the animators, nor to the horror of followers of Kenneth Oppel's books. There are worse things out there, your kids can watch as Silverwing, but there are also better programs out there. Review the mediocrity and read the books rather.
