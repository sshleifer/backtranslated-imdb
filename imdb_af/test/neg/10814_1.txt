The movie "The Cave" must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There was no plot, no story line, and the lighting was terrible. For most of the movie, I couldn't get the scenery as it was highlighted by flashlights. The persistent 'gray spots in the film were irritating. The only scene that was really translucent was illuminated in the circumference by a bad simulation of the conditions found in hell. All in all, the movie wasn't really worth watching. If the growers can't do better than that, they have to find another job. The underwater screens were especially awful, mostly consisting of bubbles and flashlights, and sometimes watching the actors. In summary, a very horrible movie flashes with bad lighting.
