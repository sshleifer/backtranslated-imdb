I just watched this movie in a lovely air-conditioned theater here in Bangkok. And since the temperature moves somewhere around 37C with very high humidity, my 100Bt is not wasted. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't seen it, I hadn't messed up such a good deal long ago. . This is the kind of movie that offers a taste of taste, as it was. Anyone who claims to like or like it goes immediately to the same list of tasteless phonics that still speak about the superiority of British television. In any case, the worm-like old width in the wheelchair was good for a few taps. <br /> <br /> Pseudo-abundance and fat lips, which are characteristic of many French films, are really not a good movie. I'd rather see Independence Day ten times in a row than to sit through this stinker again.
