Once I will see a movie that totally surprises me. One coming out of nowhere to be a little surprising entertainment. One that is pure fun from start to finish. Well people, when a stranger calls is NOT that movie. This is an incredibly stupid and far-fetched remake of the much better 1979 horror camp classic. Our main hero, Jill, was forced to babysit after she was talking about her cellphone minutes and was plagued by phone calls from a mysterious caller. Every clich√© in the world is used here by the stupid cat-jump-from-a-hidden spot to the car that doesn't start to the killer, can be anywhere at any time. This movie is bad ... not even bad in a "so bad it's good way" more in a "so bad it's boring." Save this divine movie and save your movie for something else. You will thank me later, trust me about this. Degree: D-
