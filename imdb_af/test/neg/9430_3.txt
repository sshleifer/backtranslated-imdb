It may be, though there are two or three I missed. This film builds an interesting nightlife scene, reminiscent of so many misty scenes of Sherlock Holmes movies, and populates it with sinister, Kafka-like characters. In the midst of the film, Mia Farrow, which appears to be still playing Hannah and Woody Allen, represents his nebbish role from Play It Again Sam. Should we laugh at his tribe and handwritten? I think I would, if the rest of the movie was a comedy, but it wasn't. At least I don't think it is.
