Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I enjoy the guy! His movies bring a certain flair to those who are not actually brought by the director or producer, but by him! Recycled plots ... look. Rip-offs of better movies ... check. Woodworking ... check. It's not that Van Dien is a bad actor (he's effective in Hollywood glory as Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow). He's not really offered a script worthy of his talents; and yes, he does have an acting talent other than eyeball. This movie gives a slight indication of what Van Dien can offer, but has been overtaken by its production. The writing can be better developed (see Oliver Stone's U-Turn). Directing can be better utilized (see Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Til Dawn). The DP could have made the desert more exotic (see Russ Meyer's Faster Pussycat Faster Kill!). This script is poor because it is something we have seen many times, so the double / triple crosses are expected. The direction is poor because it does not offer anything new and telegraphs many of the poor writing moments. The cinematography sometimes refines a beautiful autumn desert flavor, but at other times it does not benefit from the scorching light and the start sequence is terrible in chorus blue. <br /> <br /> Now on the scene. Van Dien shows some grace and charisma to his Jake. He does not become too methodical or champion in his role. A nice balance, especially since the rest of the cast seems to be distracting about how they should act in this movie (bad writing or bad direction ... you make your opinion). The only other worth-worthy guy is Bryan Brown's villain as it is the only true credit to act in this movie ... trying out aspiring actors trying to learn how to act on green screen, to learn how to act in a terrible writing and take notes on Bryan Brown in this movie. He adds extra depth to his role and is a beautiful part of Van Dien's character. Jake always looks as if it is a step forward or control over any situation whether it is out of control. The femme fatale is weak (it's actually a desert noir) and is another nail in the coffin of this movie (you decide ... writing or direction). The Rosalita character had previously been in the movie instead of being pushed into the background later to make way for the real femme fatale. So watch the movie for Van Dien and Brown; And having fun, try to hit a rock over the plot holes over the movie.
