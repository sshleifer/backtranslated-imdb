This film was highly recommended by a friend and, as a big fan of Brando, I ordered this movie from Harrods and waited to get it. I'm rarely so disappointed with a movie. Brando was good like a German official, but the rest of the movie was simply unbearable. You'll never love or care about any characters (except Brando, maybe). The acting was OK. Story, what story? Maybe that's the point. It's war, but I've seen much better war movies. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, even Star Wars) It was so boring, I checked my watch ... <br /> <br /> Overall, it's one of the worst movies I've seen. Please do not waste your time and money. May I also add that this is the first user's comment I wrote. I just had to make my feelings about this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, my favorite time is: Casablanca, The Godfather 1 & 2, one flew over the cuckoo's nest, pulp fiction and Amadeus. If you haven't seen it yet, save the time to do so. And Amadeus MUST be in widescreen 2.35: 1
