I'm glad it was the last of the 40's Universal Mummy movies. The movies were all changing features and this movie was definitely one of the lesser. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is a very slow moving movie, basically nothing interesting or exciting ever happens. Perhaps all this would have been better if the mummy had made its way into the movie earlier. Instead, the film spends its first 20 minutes explaining what happened in the previous mummy movies, and again using this time's archive material, The Mummy, from 1932, after which this movie is the fourth mummy movie to follow. the 1932 mummy story. The movie never knows how to find the right pace and although the movie is barely an hour, it still feels a bit like a grief. <br /> <br /> Of course, it doesn't help that the movie has a fairly simplistic and actually very little interesting story. The movie also feels completely unfounded. The first and second half of the movie do not really make contact with each other and they looked like two separate movies on their own. <br /> <br /> At least Lon Chaney Jr is still in it. He repeated the role of the mother Kharis again for the third time. It's a pity he has such a limited screen time this time around. Unfortunately, he becomes very little interesting to do, which is also a huge waste of the mummy character himself. The movie is filled with dozens of foolish actors playing with dull accents. It was so unnecessary for me that most characters had to speak with such an accent, and it was actually quite distracting and annoying at points. <br /> <br /> The least worth the mummy movies are. <br /> <br /> 4/10
