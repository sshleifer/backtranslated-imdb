I always think it would be nice if you could have some preview of some of the old movies released on DVD before you buy it. In this way, you can save yourself time, money and some aggro when you drop so completely. <br /> <br /> The Buddy Holly Story is such a movie. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go into the characteristics, whether the holes in the plot, or with the historical facts that include this movie, because I've agreed with me twenty years ago when I first started it watch. <br /> <br /> In the early 1980s, I recorded it on the old (Monaural) Beta machine, and enjoyed it so much that it became a regular favorite. The best part, in my mind, was Gary Busey's performance as the young Buddy, and his almost perfect chorus and guitar play. <br /> <br /> I looked forward to the day I could get it. STEREO ... and that's where the disappointment comes. <br /> <br /> This DVD version is repeated (repeatedly) in both audio and video, according to the shell information, but I'm afraid it has dropped my sadness and watched my watch and wanted it to end. <br /> <br /> The sound is dark, bordering on the incomprehensible, and so unprofessionally mixed that it longs for the crystal brightness of my old Beta band! <br /> <br /> Despite what you think of the images, or the plot, or the characters, the right draw card here is the MUSIC ...... and if you can't hear the main choir, because they are drowned by the cymbals, or the back harmonies, or other ambient, then there is not much left, is there? <br /> <br /> I'm going to convert my old Beta version to (Mono) DVD for later views, and put this one where it belongs, with the junk! <br /> <br /> "Eradication is the rule, survival is the exception ..."
