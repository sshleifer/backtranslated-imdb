This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea of ​​selling records. It wasn't serious. The idea is that if you made a movie full of pop songs, you could pick the songs on an LP, sell it and make even more money for the studio. You can also release a few songs as singles and cut the promo video with the clips of the movie so that when MTV plays a job, you actually get free ads for the movie. This is a good business deal, but an artistic disaster, because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I judge in the mid-1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American filmmaking and FLASHDANCE has opened for this "Let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie-type movie production. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welding machine to meet ends and right away If the logic disappears with this choice of career, welding is a fairly sophisticated trade, it is not something you walk into within five minutes, there are other gaps in logic such as ballet dancing and flashdancing is somehow similar. apply to be a ballet dancer and do a little hot, dirty flash dance, the male judges may want to meet you after the audition, but you will not get the job, this is kind of to say that the writing writers, writing and sk Drive work in one way or another is the same as they are <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> But I don't think anything of it mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie. . Actually, Lyne is almost a very sexy movie, JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent. Luckily, I struggled why her face was brightened while her silhouette was long shots, except when the camera cut to make her heavenly, cramped body. That's because a body double is used most of the time and often the body is double a man! I'm sure there are some naughty boys who feel guilty about not calling a little disgusting to know it
