Enchanting, but overestimating dramatic thriller, filming efforts to portray the spiritual out-of-control inner demons of a troubled artist. The problem is that not a single screen-illustrated relationship is credible, and the likelihood seems to have been thrown out of the window. The title character is so difficult to relate to the fact that it is impossible to imagine any of the screen characters invested emotionally in him. The conclusion is also fairly predictable; There are certainly enough clues that are provided from the beginning to show exactly where the story is going. If you choose to completely suspend one's belief in the situations or relationships, the movie itself is well maintained (especially through the lead) and manages to create good tension as the story unfolds. As a metaphorical feature, there is some thought, and if the writing was stronger, there was definitely potential that could be better used.
