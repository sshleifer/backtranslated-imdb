Just if the title didn't give it away - this movie is garbage. <br /> <br /> Short overview? Yes. <br /> <br /> I decided to spend so much time writing this review, as Hollywood probably decided to write in the script. I doubt it will be published in light of how badly I have ordered everything, but if it is and someone reads it - stick to the first Sandlot movie. It was completely surpassed by its predecessors. The successors are never worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making it should be ashamed of the destruction of what one of the classic, original films of our childhood should be.
