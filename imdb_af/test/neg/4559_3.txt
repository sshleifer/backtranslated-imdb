Ugghhh !!! This is exactly the kind of Pre-Code movie that the viewer can think is wrong that movies of this time are uncomfortable - and it's NOT - it's just that this particular movie is terrible. Horrid, because while the film is trying very hard to be "hip" and "mature", it is so hopelessly old-fashioned, dull and hokey that I torn or laughed between the laughs on the film !! It's a unique combination, at least. <br /> <br /> So why, exactly, did I hate it so much? Well, the movie is incredibly messy, but has no style and the film is meant to be shocking, but not subtle and takes too much ridiculous turns to be credible. The movie starts with a clich√© - a hooker with a heart of gold. Dorothy Mackaill is a prostitute and she accidentally looks to kill a man! Soon after she escaped, she met an old boyfriend who insisted on marrying her (he didn't realize her profession). To see this man's innate goodness, she determined to change her life and stop living the wild life. It's hard to hide on a fictional Caribbean island. Here, alone and waiting for her husband to return, there is nothing to do and the place is contaminated with super-hopeful and totally unattractive men. In fact, this part of the movie is so boring that the audience may be difficult to stay focused. The men on the island are so upset by the presence of Mackaill that they are apparently raped on the edge of her - just to defend because she is no longer such a girl. Honestly, I got very tired of all these voluptuous scenes - there is just too much eyeball and tongue walking to make it look different from a very bad movie. And looking at all these ugly horn dogs was just annoying and stupid. <br /> <br /> But wait, it gets a lot worse. The man she thought appeared on this small island (what is the chance?!) And he also tried to rape her. However, he should not be deterred and she ends up shooting to save her newly-found virtues. While the jury on the island is releasing her, she jumps back into court and lies - they tell her to kill the man and it was presumed (?) For even if she was acquitted, she knew that the evil prisoner was getting away with her when sent to jail for possession of a firearm. As the jailer gave himself the gun to set her up, she chased in court and said she was guilty, really really stupid. Why didn't she just tell them the prison plan? Maybe she did it to preserve her virtue, but to admit that someone is being killed so that people will think you are a virgin! So, in order to avoid a brief jail sentence (and again the threat of rape), she does not think in court that he is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation (the jailer has promised to rape her when she is locked up) ). And just before she is taken to the gallows to avoid the rape, the boyfriend shows her in time to send him off and roll the credits. <br /> <br /> Impossible situation and coincidences are abundant - Come so often that the movie is just silly. It combines it with all the sexual innuendo, making it a bad and messy mess of a movie that will only appeal to the most mortal followers of Pre-Code movies. Everything else, beware, it's very tough and stupid from start to finish!
