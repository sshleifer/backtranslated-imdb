OK, usually I am fascinated by Z-movies. Some of the actors, directors, writers, etc. In those movies, a piece of talent has come. They want to get that talent so unhappy for them, they have to associate with crappy people to make their movies. But some Z movies have at least one thing that can be remarkable about them. <br /> <br /> Not here. <br /> <br /> Once I saw it, I thought ... "Wow, a Blade knock." Believe me, if this movie could have been on that label, it would be a better movie <br /> <br /> Instead, I was subjected to the most horrific acting I've ever seen in my life, Master Kao was bad, so bad I believe some of my neurons explode in my brain Understanding his acting, I still try to make sense of his pronunciation and why he will raise his voice to speak certain words ... to add dramatic effect, I'm sure ... but that was for no apparent reason Simply staggering. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is the black man in the press cape near the end of the movie, Purple cape man is fighting the hero for about 30 seconds, but he's so bad it actually he was afraid to fight. <br /> <br /> The main hero and the villain did decent work, the main hero (Derek Washington) seemed to be fighting knew.
