It is difficult to build any enthusiasm for this horrible cartoon epic that has become a cult classic for some reason. It certainly cannot be because of the totally artificial appearance of the set designs or the bright play of an all-star cast. These days it gets too much on Fox Movie Channel or AMC. <br /> <br /> It hurts me to report that veteran actors such as Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even thrown into this devastated science fiction travesty, which is not one true. It's like looking at a costly budget spent on a Saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialogue. This is a comic book version of the Jules Verne novel. <br /> <br /> The obsolete Fontaine was still attractive but had a painful expression on her face, perhaps she regrets that she accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script. She carries absolutely nothing on her cardboard roll, but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and most of the time looks completely out of place. Goodbye no better, is Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and - especially Peter Lorre - as well as Frankie Avalon, who will sing the title song - which is safe to say - has not become someone's favorite tune. <br /> <br /> A terribly frustrating experience of such a film that loses an attractive role and an insult to almost anyone's intelligence. Completely unconvincing from beginning to end. The movie, as well as the fantastic submarine, sink to the bottom of the sea long before the battle with a rubber octopus, bringing the film to an urgent conclusion.
