At all appearances, this series has been made ever since the mid-forties. The cardboard sets, the moon kings with lightning bolts sewn on their aprons, you know the drill. This one is a Rocky Jones adventure, with space cop's handling of the ungrateful Bitch Queen of Planet Offeecious, a communion planet that won't join the United Planets. When the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that Offeecious is on a clash with this other, vague Slavic planet, Bitch Queen decides to blow the other guys rather than evacuate her country. It represents a moral for the effect of "The greatness of a nation is not in its land, but its people," which is spoken five or six times in the climax. The BQ's constant nasal ranting on "OffEEEEcious" provides relief from some serious space effects. Is this a TV show?
