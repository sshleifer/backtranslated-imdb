What a sharp movie. I can't believe I actually sat down and watched it. A very, very, very, very, very, very pathetic attempt, with no redeeming features whatsoever. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The so-called "racing" series are terribly horrible, and the plot is so bad, I forgot it. Part of the film was made in 1988 at the Spa-Francorchamps course in Belgium during the actual Grand Prix. I was there and am glad I didn't appear in any of the movie scenes in the movie. It could have been good ... what a pity.
