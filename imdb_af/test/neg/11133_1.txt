Wiea, this is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen! The packaging for the movie is better than the movie itself. My girlfriend and I watched it this past weekend and we just kept it in the hope that it would be better ... it didn't ... <br /> <br /> The picture quality is poor; It seems to have been shot on video and transferred to film. The lighting isn't big, which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions. The acting self was cheesy, but I think it's acceptable for "another" teenage horror movie. The sound was a big problem: sometimes you have to rewind the video because the sound is unclear and / or mumbled. <br /> <br /> It holds no real merit; try to ride on the chains of "Sleepy Hollow." Don't save with this one.
