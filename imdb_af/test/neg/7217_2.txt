If I have never seen the first road house, then I think the movie can still get a star, but even then it makes it a 3 star movie. For the case, I was very surprised at the relatively high rating he currently has. <br /> <br /> In fact, I couldn't finish this movie because it was painful. Where it went wrong (in the most obvious way), it is almost parallel to the original, although the original chart is still referenced. It doesn't really make sense and doesn't work. Also, the acting is weak ... I never felt like I was in the movie, but I felt like I was acting. Even good actors like Busey don't work out, probably due to the script or perhaps the awkward editing. The strangest thing is that the movie looks like a mid-90's B movie, but it's made in 06. I don't know why, but sometimes it seems to happen with successors for some reason. The music, the look and the whole overall feeling reminded me of movies you saw at Cinemax ten years ago in the morning. The strangest thing of all is that I also expect Ja Rule to come at some point ... often I remind myself of more current movies with rappers as actors. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing is love interest Meisie whose character looks like a total partition of the Lois Lane character on Smallville, which is also very annoying. And don't forget the fakest sounding "southern accents" I've heard since Walk the Line. I realize this is a common place in movies, but no accent has to work better than sounding like you're from the universal hitch on TV where someone from any southern state (or KY and WV) sounds exactly the same. Sure, people in desert villages in AZ sound just like people in southeastern 2000+ miles away. It was thin in the B-movie ten years ago where technique comes from. Why do writers / directors make such decisions? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I really wouldn't recommend it if you're a fan of Road House or if you like good movies. If you haven't seen it yet, don't spoil it by first seeing this version. The original Roadhouse was one of those casual classics that keep people over and over. It was an unexpected success such as American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and more recently Office Space, Fast and Furious (only the first one!), And Napolean Dynamite. Why did they spoil it? ??? <br /> <br /> They never had to make a sequel to Road House, except a high budget version with real actors / directors. Sure, you can never hide the original (eg Bad News Bears, The Longest Yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it right, it will be present on the basis of the examples I mentioned . But to make a low budget, off-network, Road House's self-production is criminal.
