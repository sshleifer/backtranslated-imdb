Early talks survived to become classic. 1929's "The Squall" is a classic right, but not as intended. Melodramatic in story and acting, today it seems ridiculous, especially the decisive Myrna Loy as Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine Nora Charles breaking up a young couple and driving a young man to steal. Gross! But, as many people know, when Loy was in Hollywood for the first time, she did some of these exotic seductive roles. <br /> <br /> Based on a play, "The Squall" it is about the aforementioned Gypsy who is in the movie now in Hungary (Spain in the play) running away from her cruel master and herself in the house invite from the Lajos family (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), basically by appearing on the door. One by one, Nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm speaks her pidgin English ("Nubi is not bad! Nubi does nothing wrong!") And tips on fine gifts. The son in the family, Paul (Carroll Nye), is busy with the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and can't wait to marry her. He lost interest when he met Nubi. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the lovely Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts as a housewife and the beautiful Loretta Young, the play is uniquely horrible. Loy is stuck with the characteristics of her character - bad English, winning and hysteria. With her darkened make-up, chestnut and curly hair, she's not only beautiful but right from the 1980s. Quite modern, though Richard Tucker reminds his hand of his forehead, we are just out of silence. br /> <br /> Robert Osborne on TCM said this film was one of his secret pleasures. While it's nice, it's not nice enough to go through again. It's just bad - but a good example of how far we've come, and someone didn't pick up on Myrna Loy's sense of humor, how limited her wonderful career was.
