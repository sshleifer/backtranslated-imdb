First of all, season 1 is unbearably bad. The jail is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two-dimensional that they are almost transparent, and the direction is terrible. It runs like a bad video of a junior high school game, characters wandering over the camera and sending out very timely and repetitive lines, talking as random prison. Soon the show is getting better, but not much. The return of the commercial break is always accompanied by a ridiculous monologue by the wheelchair-bound Augustus Hill, which is played by Harold Perrineau. The only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad-acting monologues, most of which occur in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what is happening in the show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the bad ideas in Oz can fill out an encyclopedia of several volumes. Consider the whole situation, first of all. Prisoners can immediately stop getting drunk, using drugs, and not just having CD players (CDs? They can only send steak knives), but all incoming mail is thoroughly investigated by PRISONERS. Christ, the place is like a men's club with guards. Guards who don't do much. <br /> <br /> By the end of the season, an older prisoner's grandson is diagnosed with leukemia, and all prisoners put in $ 20 and $ 50 bills to send him to Disneyworld for his dying wish. to reach. This must be the richest prisoners in the world. Every single prisoner in Oz suddenly cares, loving guys except Kenny Wangler, an annoying character, but one of the only ones that is consistently convincing. Even Adibisi wanted to be nice. But it is good, because there is no order or sense in the show, so even that is not much of a distraction. Later, shockingly, there is a boxing scene in which one prisoner is an "I love Cops" t-shirt. In prison !! Can you imagine yourself? I had a cousin who was in jail a few years ago. I sent him an old photo of us with some friends in high school, and in the picture one of my friends kept an "I Love Cops" bumper sticker and one of the bushes (guys in prison for years and years have seen the picture, but only grabbed it and tore it. My cousin's happy. <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler also constantly robs the guards and even more senior officials not to call him Bricks. One of them even tried to get him to go to an English class. You may be deceived who are in charge, the prisoners or the guards. For example, more than one investigator is in prison and is being killed to stop the drug trade. Personally, I will just stop inspecting incoming inmates rather than risking the lives of investigators. <br /> <br /> Let's see what else? Shillinger's son OD's are alone and no one thinks it's waiting for him to have the drugs. He just ... got them, I think. And make sure you pay attention, otherwise you will have the reason why the prisoners have enough money to afford ascellular gut grafts when they get bad gums. I didn't know that guests could afford such luxury treatment options in maximum security prisons. How about this if Robson asks about dr. Faraj's schedule, so he can ask what breed of gum he was given, is so frightened by Faraj that he goes to the officer and finishes his work in that place. Do not doctors and dentists have the right to request not to see certain prisoners? After Poet and O'Reilly made the announcement on the whole jail, Robson asked to see Dr Faraj, and was escorted to his office, brought in without knocking, and the guard immediately watched without a word. They could just as well give him a firearm. <br /> <br /> I shouldn't go over stupid ideas in this show, but it's like a flood, I can't stop it. Who thought of the Chinese refugees who can't speak Chinese and who disappear a lot from the face unless needed? Who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverent prisoners? Who's Robson's Gum Transplant? What is the deal with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon because he clearly doesn't belong in prison and Busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson. Macbeth, for it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it was. <br /> <br /> But what are the worst ideas? Things that go nowhere, that's constant. An Irish man comes to jail and builds a bomb. He threatens to blow up the whole prison, the bomb seems to be a dud and the episode ends with the fact that he is being driven away by the bombing group after the entire prison has been evacuated. Nothing is ever heard of him or the whole situation. It's like it never happened. In one episode, prisoners are given dogs to train. What the hell? If it wasn't bad enough, a guard burns his gun in the jail walls as an exercise during a workout. No one thinks. <br /> <br /> I also like how every time some kind of indifference breaks out, the culprits are pulled aside, they say nothing and the guards or keeper or sister Pete or someone who always says, "I hope you think don't let me go! " And then they walk away and let it go. The audience won't remember. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm spoiled by Prison Break, but Oz is just a goofy prison drama that can be better than a play. A short one. At least a low-budget movie. There's just not enough here to maintain a multi-year TV program. Then I watched it on DVD for six seasons. Sometimes I don't understand myself ....
