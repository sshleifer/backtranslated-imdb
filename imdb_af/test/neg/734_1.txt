At one time, a movie accidentally comes by, which doubts your common sense. We just studied the novel, Northanger Abbey, at school and decided to remind us of this unbeatable piece of humorless rubbish with the BBC adaptation. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it really makes you want to kill yourself. The movie is nothing like the book, for example, the subtle evil characters seem to be transformed into transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while Isabella plays the role of slut. Catherine, the main character, is the most depressed stupid and annoying actress on God's earth (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like basketball) while Mr Tilney looks and acts like a retired pornstar double. The plot goes completely down the track at certain points of the movie, I don't know what hell the director thought when there was no reason for a 7-year-old black kid we've never met before. from that abbey and start cartwheeling for her. Yes, that's right, cartwheeling. Nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by Catherine's "fantasies" in which she is carried around a cathedral one morning. <br /> <br /> The Northanger Abbey is basically visual euthanasia, so if you want to kill your boss or something like the BBC basically discovered a new way to kill someone. Northanger is a scarcely legally bad movie. Don't look at it unless you're in a stuffed cell.
