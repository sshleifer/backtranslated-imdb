Since they wanted to do a vampire movie in space, I thought, "Well, it'll probably be cute, but at least interesting enough to see the whole genre." Oops. I don't care what kind of movies you want; even if you are the biggest vampire, horror, thriller or suspense fan in the world, or negative, if you have never seen a horror movie and would expect your first to be impressive in any way whatsoever ... you are wrong. I don't think I've ever seen a "made for TV movie" or aftercare special this bad. I have never seen a TV pilot look like this. I've never seen footage of animals that sleep or shoot so bad. This is by far the biggest waste disposal you can otherwise spend and consider the importance of dish towels and their impact on your life. I would rather be caught in a bathroom for weeks, with nothing to eat, but my own urine and feces than to even watch a single cut from this movie. Looking at it, I won the fortunes that the characters fell into rather than dealing with knowing that I had paid money to see it. However, it was like a train wreck: so bad you can only help but look and hope something good can happen. It didn't. For the love of God, if you or your friends - even while using illegal substances while doing it - even consider watching this movie, rather choose a game to see who can shoot a snot rocket further. This will bring you much greater enjoyment and entertainment.
