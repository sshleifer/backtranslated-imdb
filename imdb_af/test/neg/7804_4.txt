Anupam Kher is an excellent actor. He made his debut at 28 and played 50 years in Saray. <br /> <br /> Now he is directing with OJJ <br /> <br /> The movie has a good plot but it's regressive <<br /> <br /> The theme was killed and Urmila's Character also seems to fit, while Anil-Mahima and Abhi-Tara tracks are too sudden and then forgotten. <br /> <br /> But the movie moves a snail's pace and begins to drag, but there are several good scenes like the whole conflict between Anil-Fardeen and Abhishek where Fardeen says to sell the house. <br /> <br /> Abhishek is caught for a crime and Anil calls on him <br /> <br /> The climax is too much, but <br /> <br /> Shows anupam potential but it is a bit to go. Music is okay. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor admonishes in his part as always Fardeen difficult and good, but must improve Abhishek is excellent, it was a turning point, people realized he could act. Urmila is good. Mahima and Tara are wasted. Waheeda is good.
