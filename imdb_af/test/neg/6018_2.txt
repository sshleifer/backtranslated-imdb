Mockumentaries have recently spread so much that the approach therefore requires an injection of fresh and creative material every time it is used to retain its vitality. This film does nothing but worn threads of similar stories, a goalless writing, poor ad libs, uninspiring acting, and infallible self-satisfying humor. <br /> <br /> The premise seems promising enough; The legend of the Loch Ness monster is made to order for one of these goofy mockumentary misadventures, with a wide variety of history and legend waiting to be named for outrageous satire. The filmmakers, however, destroy this enormous potential. We get a fool putting a fake Nessie in the water. Give it, it's original. Another scene has one offensive idiot that threatens another stupid idiot with a gun. Very ridiculous. Some free pictures of a pretty girl in a bikini. Annette did it 40 years ago (and much better, incidentally). Throughout the film, it always seems that someone is screaming: I think it's designed to wake up the audience who has been crunched at this point. <br /> <br /> The worst of all, however, is the relentless burst of that reality. shows type of "maintenance comment" made by the characters. Not only do they do you with this tired joke every five seconds, but the actors apparently also improvised; That's the only explanation for how humorless the jokes are. If lines like: "I have never seen someone write a book on non-testimony", it is actually written, then the writer in turn must be shot and fed to Nessie. <br /> <br /> No wonder Nessie has become violent; This, of course, saw this movie.
