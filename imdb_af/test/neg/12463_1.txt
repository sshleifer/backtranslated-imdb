I just wish I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Instead, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I did. <br /> <br /> The title has nothing to do with the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The play consists of a guy John Cusack wants to be, but can't pull it off. The head is a girl trying to be Claire Daines. Unfortunately, she can't subtract it either. They are in love, though God knows why. And by the end I was hoping they would all kill everyone just so that I could believe that none of these children would ever devour the world again.
