I come out here, because this film was shot so well and so well cast that I am twice as angry with his depopulation as I would have been with less work. Without revealing too much of the plot, I can only say that part one of my 2 VHS sets was an unpleasant, unfolding joy of bizarre, but likely plot developments. The main character was appropriately naive but also intelligent and very open. The events he was quickly forced to determine were the separation of his parents, the cultural shock when his Pakistani roots in the sixties in the sixties in the sixties of the sixties in the sixties in the sixties in the sixties of the sixties of English collided. His father's dubious transformation into the coveted Buddha of Suburbia, and the turn of his cousin into a feminist militant as his best friend suddenly became an icon of the budding punk movement in the seventies. Amongst other things. <br /> <br /> What made me so angry was the amount of detailed work each actor made in the first part to create and establish their characters, just to divide the whole thing into very bad porno episodes in The second part, too much to justify plot development, and much too explicit to look even erotic. My biggest pet is when directors interfere with their private fetishes with the truth of their movie, and that was a supreme example to me. <br /> <br /> I felt like I was invited to a party of very clever, funny aliens, just to close the doors and the guests didn't allow to communicate, and we all forced them to watch seventy sex movies. What an insult to the hard work of these great actors! Why don't you just make a cheeseball movie? And why throw a big main character that can actually act and then cut off when he builds up to a good performance? I almost felt as if he had also become tired of the endless gender scenes where everything he did was lying there, there was a pelvis for yet another breathtaking actress. Bottom line - Part One is small genius, Part Two is the second pole soap operation perversion. I know the book is very explicit, but I felt that these good actors were exploited in real life, as their characters were in the movie and it made me very angry and very uncomfortable. Only John Waters can derive such a dubious humiliation from actors and plots and it seems artistic. My suggestion is to first look at the first part, the second in the proverbial rubbish dump, and you will love the Buddha forever. Count A + F = 0
