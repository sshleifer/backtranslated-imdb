Shemp finds out he will inherit a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours. Predominantly how horrible he looks and his personality, it's not surprising that he can't get a taker - that's until an article appears in the newspaper explaining his difficulty. At that time, five crazy women appeared out of nowhere to claim. their new husband (plus the money of course). <br /> <br /> While I don't hate the Three Stooges and like to see their pants on occasion, they have never, even on their best day, come close to Buster Keaton's brilliant comedy. That's why I didn't like this movie because it was a ripoff of the plot of Keaton's masterpiece, SEVEN CHANCES. With the Stooges it was not uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy plots or recover older Stooge shorts. So, from the beginning, this movie is a pale imitation of an original. It is also evident that this film does not have the charm and subtlety of the original, and the gags generally look very forced (especially the phone show). The cousin Basil Basil, however, was pretty cute and funny - though far from subtle! The worst aspect of the movie, however, was the not very funny conclusion. In the Keaton version, hundreds of women were married to him and the action became very quick and furious - it all stayed in a small room and didn't have a comical punch. It ended in a fizzle. <br /> <br /> Overall, a dull correction. Also, before marking this review, "not useful", you first need to see SEVEN CHANCES to see what I'm talking about - then you decide.
