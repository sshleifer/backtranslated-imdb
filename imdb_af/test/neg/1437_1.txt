I do not recommend watching this movie if you are easily offended. I'm not even easily offended and this movie made me frustrated. It's so disgusting. And it doesn't make sense. All the internet thing is so clich√©, and the producer obviously didn't understand all the "internet rules". If you chat with someone, you can follow their IP address. Really? (see the sarcasm here). It was stupid. Useless. And I didn't even see the end. I can always say "it doesn't make sense, either ..." This movie is at its best pure shit. Nice comment right?
