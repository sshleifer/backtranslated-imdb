"The James Dean Story" is introduced as "another kind of movie," explained. "The presence of the leading character in this film was made possible by using existing movie material, tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique - dynamic exploration of the still picture." The only "tape recordings of his voice" worth mentioning is a short recording, mr. Dean, while visiting his family in Indiana; He wanted to find any family memories of his great-grand Cal Dean because he played a similar name "Cal" in East or Eden. Dean asked if Cal Dean was interested in art, and learned that the relative was an auctioneer. James Dean was interested in art and of course had a warm relationship with his family. This is the only 100% accurate revelation in this documentary. James Dean was interested in art and has a warm relationship with his family. <br /> <br /> A wonderful "East" Eden "screen test" / "edition" appears near the end of the movie. It's a black and white scene between Dean (like Cal Trask) and co-star Richard Davalos (like Aaron Trask). Dean is at his best. If this scene just appeared here, and no "East of Eden" movie was completed, this documentary would be an essential, high-rated movie. But the scene, a perfect "10" in isolation, should be regarded as an "East of Eden" extra. Dean's "Traffic Safety Film" is also worth seeing. <br /> <br /> There are anticipated interviews with family and friends. My favorites were the guy (Lew Bracker) going through a boxing thing the Dean left with him and Dean's family. There wasn't enough of Auntie's and the letter from dean to his little cousin was very nice. More reading of Letters of Letters would have been welcome. Dean's unknown author friend had a better thesis for the film; filmmakers may consider developing it as their main focus. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman's direction of Martin Gabel's reading of Stewart Stern's script is scary. What do they think? Perhaps filmmakers can be forgiven for being close to Dean's passing. Don't expect the "James Dean Story" at all. This movie is about dean's impact on people (both fans and filmmakers) and man. This is clearly an early piece of the James Dean mite-making legend. Tommy Sands sings "Let me love". The story refers to Dean as "He" with a divine air. <br /> <br /> The shots of dean's family who seem to know he is dying are really miserable. <br /> <br /> ** The James Dean Story (8/13/57) Robert Altman ~ James Dean, Martin Gabel, Richard Davalos
