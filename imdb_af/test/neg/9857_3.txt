Kasparov vs. Deep Blue is undoubtedly a fascinating story, but I don't think you will know this by watching this movie. I think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that IBM has deceived ... and what is this theory about? The idea that the computer at one stage made a move that "looked humanly". I'm not a chess master or a computer scientist. And while I have no doubt that the move looks human, it seems to me no more than the possibility that the most powerful chess-playing computer ever created could make a surprising move ... or that such a machine could beat even a genius like Kasparov. The film comes too many miles from this theory and not enough from the personalities of the people involved. This could have made it a very interesting story. The direction also relies too much on the appearance of an inexorable whispered narrative and the image of an 18th century chess player that looks like one of those animated gypsy fortune tellers you see at the carnival. The story was also delayed by many empty shots of Kasparov repeating the "scene of the crime". I have no doubt that Kasparov and the chess community have found IBM's behavior, but I don't think it's different from what you would find from any other big corporation. At the end of the movie you are left with the feeling that Kasparov is a big crybaby and the Deep Blue programmers are either victims or fraud. I think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he had to provide much more evidence. In fact, more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place. The whole thing left me with a sour taste.
