The movie "All That" gives a good place for good humor in the "Good Burger", a place like an old-fashioned fast food restaurant. The comedy is fantastic, the fun is non-stop, and although clich√© is a for kids and family comedy. <br /> <br /> A movie for all ages, this movie is meant to enjoy, laugh and pretty much a lazy movie for a rainy day, because that's what I want to save this movie, a rainy day day. USA broadcast it today, and since I know the "All That" cast is in it, I thought it might be a bit of a chuckle burner, but in good fun, such as Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell (probably one of the best young duos of the time) was great together, the pieces came together, and everything worked out and it made it good family fun with a lazy daytime work to get out of the bad day. <br /> <br /> Can I take your order?
