I'm glad I didn't expect too much when I saw this sequel to one of my favorite children's films. The storyline was boring and unconvincing like the characters, and I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. I also didn't think the characters themselves were similar to the previous movie. Charlie changed, and now he has a girl. The first movie had good music, but the music in this movie was irrevocable. In short, this movie just didn't do it for me. And look at other user feedback, it doesn't look like many of you. It is not worth looking at.
