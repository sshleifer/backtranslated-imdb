It's a strange movie. On the surface it is no different from many other d-grade gore movies, but in some ways it stands out. First, the killer character is very strange. How the shit slapped by a guy like a chicken is completely out of my mind. What did the female parole council think: "he is completely reformed and rehabilitated". He knocks! Another problem with Luther the Geek is the writing / direction for the women. The daughter is so pathetic and apparently stupid that if she was mine, I slapped her. While trying to loosen her mother's bed, she struggled with buttons and didn't seem to think: "I'll get a pair of scissors or a knife." Later, in a similar attempt to untie her mother, she walks down stairs and starts looking for scissors in a box of scrapbooks, eventually getting a knife. By the way, this is after the killer apparently left in the car and just returned. Bizarre. On the positive side, the girl got her kit for the shower tones, so it was nice, though it was unusual again. It seems that in many of these d-grade gore films they happily show that the throat is opened with bloody blood, but the sight of a female breast is somehow too strong for the audience. In general, it worked, but it was irritating and nasty, although the bare breasts are some.
