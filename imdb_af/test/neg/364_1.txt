First of all, let me first say that I have since been a dedicated follower of C Thomas Howell's career since the "Outsiders" and "The Hitcher". He was an emerging and upcoming star in the 1980s - with hits such as "Soul Man" as well. The future was clear to this young actor and he has the potential to continue from there and really prove himself in Hollywood. Put it this way - Tom Cruise had a bit of a part in "The Outsiders" while Howell took the lead. Check out Cruise today! But choosing materials like this drift will only break down Howell's career - if possible. Why does he choose things like this? A small part in a big movie will be more beneficial to him than this litter. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story takes place here in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone lives underground where chaos prevails. Howell is a shepherd - to protect the flock of various religious leaders by killing any undesirable people. In other words, he is a hit. <br /> <br /> The sets are so bad they won't look at a Thunderbird episode. The use of slow motion unnecessarily repeats itself throughout the movie, but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a good word here), no continuity, scenes for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that seem to be made Out of a Corn Flakes box and a direct style that is dumbfounded. Oh, and the storyline was also pathetic. <br /> <br /> I hate writing bad reviews about movies - especially those I really like from the star - but this movie is so bad, I don't believe one second that someone could be proud of it. I'm not a filmmaker, and I'm not a director, but I'll put my head in the sand if I have spent so much money and time on this movie. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would never recommend anyone to ever see this movie. It was released with a DVD player I bought, but I still kept the thing halfway because I was ashamed of Howell. Come on C - give yourself some credit and struggle yourself away from these untouched wonders and try to grumble and get a good share - no matter how small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and just because there is no set for 0/10.
