Honestly, the only reason I picked up this Blockbuster movie was because Aaron Carter was in it. Good first thing's first. Do you see how ugly Aaron Carter became? I mean, he was so cute, but now. With that slim body and fleshy skin - EW. I think he should sing and the film's directors could have found a much better old man who could be lip synchronized. No offense. I thought this teenage movie was largely lame - and it comes from me, I'm a teenager myself. The "average girls" in it are o-so predictable, the acting is so amateurish, it sometimes makes you moan (especially from Aaron) and generally I just didn't enjoy it. Although, I give points to the storyline - it was good, but not realistic. Anyway, stay away from this movie anyway you can unless you have wads cash at hand and absolutely nothing better at 94 minutes of your time. It's not worth the $ 6.50! <br /> <br /> (Ps. this review may not apply to younger children under the age of 13!)
