Impact! Pretty boring, and they can also be shot in black and white. It was so colorless. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with rolling text explaining cryogenics, asking if God or Satan is behind. There are some protests outside a cryogenic laboratory. Some people rob a bank, and many of the robbers and guards are shot. The father of one of the robbers (according to me) arranged that his son had frozen. There is a lot of jumping in the beginning from scene to scene in which characters are introduced without us knowing how it relates. <br /> <br /> There is a power failure, and the cancers that contain the frozen people are hit by lightning and they come out. as zombies. They all have silver mylar-like dress, and their skin is dark green and shrunk (no idea why they look so bad - it is clearly frozen, has not kept their appearance) and they have silver eyes. They go around killing people, sometimes sticking out like zombies, sometimes like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair keeps up every time, and for what reason I don't really know. I think her character works at the cryogenics lab, but she is not very important to the plot, and her role is very small. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a few freeze frames with text captions telling us what happened to The following characters, which is quite stupid.
