This movie shows what you can create if you have a camera, some extra paint and cardboard, a toy, some community theater performers and the wrong idea you can make. The end result is an irreconcilable time heater that you will hit unless you take it out of the DVD player and first throw it through the window. <br /> <br /> The play in the opening scene (especially by round Lee Morgan as "Captain") and the toy ship crashing into the rocks before the credits are a good indication of what you envisage (with All the foam, it seems that this "special effect" was shot in a kitchen sink, I think Boyette thought he was saving cash by washing the dishes at the same time. As for the bad theater, it looks as if the funny thing Dungeon of Harrow (perhaps coincidentally) has inspired Manos: The Hands of Fate. Yes, it's the same lamb. "I was the victim, and now I take the crazy villain's place" ironically end. The bigger irony is that two unknown, talented filmmakers can make and get rid of two equally miserable, Texas-filmed horror movies. <br /> <br /> Monotone nerd Russ Harvey is a noble in a large family line (why they were wonderful, never upset), we got bored while killing the death of his family line and crest before his ship even crashes. We also treat a drone story in the movie. Unfortunately we are not so happy. His family's toy ship falls into a sink in a sink and is washed ashore with his inflated captain and a woman conveniently on a crazy Count's island. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the spell is visited by an evil spirit. dressed in a Blackstone's Magic Kit outfit, attack with several dolls (spiders, snakes, bats ... all the evil things). The Count (William McNulty) persuades worse than Shatner and has a visible difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical madman ranting. <br /> <br /> I would also love to be in this disaster. The woman is immediately killed by the count's fierce dogs, and the two gnomes are captured by his servant. The Count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear), he beats his slave for many (apparently his greatest joy), Fatboy is tortured, there is a woman who is a servant and one who is a nurse, rotting leper a wedding gown Countess in the dungeon (she digs the Nerdy Noble and is the only effective and creepy thing in the movie), a very relentless dialogue at a dining table, the blubbery captain being killed while he make pathetic way out (look at a lazy fight a pack of lions). . . It's an ugly haze to me. I spent most of my time on the speed button. <br /> <br /> In any case, the jerk noble and nurse breaks away and thinks they're going to be saved by three guys in a rowing boat on the lake. yes, we are supposed to believe that a lake is the sea). They do not, since the nerd's hair has turned gray and he is frightening the rescue workers. Honestly, I think they just took the opportunity to drive away from this horrible movie while they had the chance. They go back to the castle, the nurse starts as the Countess (and your stomach, by this time) rotate and we end up with the two getting ready in the. . . DUNGEON OF HARROW !!!! Sheet metal toys! <br /> <br /> I love old, lousy horror movies, but they should have some entertainment value. I feel ripped off even at the low low price of $ 5.99 for this cookie. Mystery Science Theater will have a tough time making this one fun. I was welcomed by some jealous judges who claimed that this film had atmosphere and some creepy moments. Wrong! Avoid this tribulation at all costs, and don't even waste a buck if you find it somewhere in a dollar bowl. This movie makes Corman's "The Terror" like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
