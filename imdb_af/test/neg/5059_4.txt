Moto's Gamble has a fairly straight plot. When a boxer with a mysterious poison is killed in the ring, it is the even more mysterious Mr. Moto to solve the case. <br /> <br /> I'm shocked at the number of positive reviews for Mr. Moto's Gamble on IMDb. Because for me ... I found it very disappointing. I enjoy Mr. Moto and I enjoy Charlie Chan, but I can't say I care about this mish-mash of the two. For those who are unfamiliar with the story behind Mr. Moto's Gamble, it was originally meant to be a Charlie Chan movie. But when Warner Oland is backed up, some of the screens and action have been restated for Peter Lorre and Mr Moto. As I indicated, the end result left me unaware. Mr. Moto is not Chan. He's more secretive, he's more athletic, and he's more exotic. So trying to put Moto in a Chan movie is trying to fit a square pin into a round hole - it doesn't work. And listening to Lorre / Moto is trying to deliver one of Chan's brand euphemisms, ending just fool. Add to this the fact that nearly 10 minutes of the overall 72-minute runtime consists of boxing screens (something I never want to enjoy) and you end up with a movie I can't help but don't like. If I want to say something positive, I point to the performance of Keye Luke. But even he is not close enough to Mr. Moto's to save Gamble in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but a 4/10 is about the best I can give.
