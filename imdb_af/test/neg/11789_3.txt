I wanted this movie. Big throw? Walter Pidgeon in a role reminiscent of his iconic "Forbidden Planet", Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musician inclined sailor (is a man on a submarine a sailor?), Even Scientist Peter Lorre With a love for sharks. Maybe it's a good kiddie movie, but I have trouble staying awake. Lorre was very underutilized. I think he was a red herring, like Pidgeon ?? You expect him to go and try to throw the hero or his gall into the tank. No such luck. By the way, why is there a hairpin on a submarine? This is typical of the film's lack of ambition. They explain why Lorre is moving the shark back and forth (because we see it), but just expect us to accept the fact that there is a shark on this sub for some reason. "Research?" Yes, scientists always do those research materials, who can understand them? Of course, if there wasn't a shark, who would kill the evil psychologist (Joan Fontaine)? I'm sorry, but even the child's movies in the fifties are able to be less predictable and honestly idiotic (not to invite). <br /> <br /> The first 10 or 15 minutes have gained my hope. Great theme song sung by Frankie Avalon. Pidgeon, lead Floyd the Barber (Howard McNear, sorry, Howie loved you in "Blue Hawaii") and Joan Fontaine on a guided tour, careful to hit the room with the big "WARNING" sign on the door, past Peter Lorre with the aforementioned sharks, and then we see a full screenshot of Eden that moves her moneymaker to Avalon's passionate horn! The movie goes downstream quickly. There is no real explanation for the storm that threatens the Earth, so there is a clear lack of dramatic tension and no villain to start. Instead, Pidgeon's character is made in an unconvincing red herring, vague from the Ahab variety (I think the "Caine Mutiny" was still fresh in people's minds), and Fontaine's character suddenly became mischievous, without any reason. Oh, I think the reason is that it's a surprise to the audience. And it's a bit surprising, because the only negative thing she did is talk badly about the captain's mental health and there is still no reason why she's done the sabotage after revealing the villain no. Very poorly done and unconvincing. The guy who was the pessimistic Bible nut was better? at least his character made sense. <br /> <br /> What else can go wrong? Endless, interminable scuba dive footage. I never understand the appeal of that kind of thing. A giant squid attacks the ship for a minute, so there's a monster for the theater wagon. Perhaps it is misleading for some people to think it would be a fantasy adventure movie, rather than a half-baked tension over military scientists who are never wrong. Yes? Perhaps worst of all, it's hardly a fantasy movie, much less a science fiction movie. It did nothing for my imagination, because the whole point of departure was nothing but a disaster / apocalypse and these characters never experience feelings of wonder or discovery. I'm with Irwin Allen. In any case, I never had his later movies, but this one got me by pretending to be Jules Verne, if it's just another formula-escapism formula exercise. The whole movie is just waiting to see what character is unlikely to get angry and die. He always hired an actor / actress with a beautiful and pleasant shimmering son to play these roles and this is the only element of 'surprise' found, since there are no logic for these characters anyway. What a pathetic waste of time for these actors. George Pal's movies are 100 times better (the only one who was lame was "Atlantis", who wasn't coincidental with the Allen-esquire), full of wonder and excitement and? think of it! ?? ideas! Unlike a few effonentials and Barbara Eden, it seems to me nothing worth seeing here. I think it's fun for those in disaster movies, but I think they're a hollow and dull movie genre.
