This movie is much like any other modern horror movie. It is predictable in the way it builds and progresses and just never fails to bring anything original or shocking to the screen. It is really the biggest disappointment of the movie, which overall had another promising concept for a movie of its kind. <br /> <br /> You can call this movie a great walk-modern horror movie clich√©. It has all the elements in it that modern horror movies are often not so great to watch. One of these is a groaning and very naive little child. Why do they like these things in movies? The same goes for the type of drama, in terms of family life. It just doesn't work out for the movie and is far from interesting or effective. This often causes the movie to be dragged into parts and an annoying one to watch. <br /> <br /> So it has all the cliches present, but it doesn't succeed in bringing any of these cliches to good use. As a horror movie, it's simply a very poor one. It does not handle its abomination or stress very well. For the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. The film's story is not too well connected and does not build up within the film. Too often the movie sleeps in parts and it does not completely kick the horror. <br /> <br /> The movie is often too dark (no doubt as an attempt to hide its reasonably low budget) and it also shows very little, mostly because you simply can't see things so well. <br /> <br /> You can only tell by watching this movie that director JS Cardone doesn't have much talent for the genre and doesn't know how to properly handle his current ingredients. He has made some efforts in the past, but all his movies have failed so far. He just tried unhappy. Who knows, maybe with the right people behind the camera (like Tobe Hooper, who was initially attached to direct), this movie could still be something decent. <br /> <br /> It's a poor movie, with largely unknown in it. The biggest name of the movie is Ben Cross, but his role is just too small and somehow not really relevant enough for the film and its story. He didn't even have much fun. <br /> <br /> Just skip it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
