NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic according to the lines of "The Ten Commandments" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told", and instead chose to make a half-hearted cartoon more like " Waterworld "was like anything else. I don't remember a Bible passage where Lot becomes a pirate and attack the ark, nor do I remember one where Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, and I also remember that Noah is a little old guy pay is suddenly acting as he recommends a naval fleet and running to shout nautical terms such as "tackle the mainstay!" It was possibly the worst marketing decision in history. Obviously, most people who see it will be Jewish and Christian parents with their children. Why is the film so offensive to people on earth? If they deliberately try to offend, why not advertise it and at least in the right audience? I hope one day they make a REAL Noah movie, one that is done seriously and thoroughly, one that actually appeals to people and makes money. Until then, don't waste your time with this trash.
