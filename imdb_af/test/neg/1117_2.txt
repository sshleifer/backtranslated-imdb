I guess the people who talk this fool are a victim of the director or something. It's bad, not the Michael Jackson song. Comparing the pace of this movie with the progress of a snail, the snail would insult. This movie coincides for what looks like an eternity, to introduce us all to some terrifying zombie children with a dull makeup and a kind of vendetta, or thirst for blood, or whatever. Believe me, you won't mind. The only thought that Mom would move her two daughters into this dilapidated and FILTHY house is absurd. And worse, I just didn't care. Backstory about the zombie kids? Snoring. Threat of mother and / or daughters? Don't mind. <br /> <br /> In short, WOW was so boring. Don't bother.
