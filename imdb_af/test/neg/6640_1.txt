So I turned on HBO that I just thought it would have some quality movies and I saw it. Root Top is so unique, it is tempting to look. I've seen unfunny movies before, but I think I find this one so impossible to watch, because Carrot Top seems to be hilarious. Watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5-year-olds crazy about the top-of-the-line reactions that are full of ultra-dumb jokes that only a 4-year-old would appreciate. <br /> <br /> What's great is how other talented actors actually signed up for this project, such as Larry Miller and M Emmet Walsh. If you've ever seen Carrot Top's absolutely terrible MCI ads (or whatever they were) then it's more the same, just worse. It's a slapstick festival that is a waste of a high budget that could do something, save homeless people ... except that. I'm not sure it's in the bottom 50 of all time, but for the $ 10 million it is a shame.
