My guess is that the producers of this low-budget space / horror movie wanted a serious movie, but the director put his heart on a parody. So ... that's what we get. Set in an abandoned spaceship for 1000 years in the future, with characters and props right from the 90's. The set is an industrial complex, perhaps an oil barrier. Their use is as it is, the controls consist of shelves of old TV equipment. One place is of course the employees' dining room and sports an old TV and VCR, as well as a water cooler with plastic demijohn. Tiny Lister and Coolio get the best lines and argue throughout the story. The dialogue is full of terms that are quite dating ("A-OK, Daddy-O"), but maybe the 30th century might be very retro? When the captain declares the cargo, a charge is the coffins of "The Transylvania Station". You know it's all a run. It's a little stranger, sharing JasonX, shameless rip-off of all the best sci-fi and horror titles. At one stage Casper VanDen even tells his pilot to make it with a straight face. This movie would have been better if they just let everyone run with the satire, but they keep trying to make the story serious. Maybe the backers were on that set that day. Anyway, not a bad boredom killer if you're not too picky. FX is as good as the sets are bad.
