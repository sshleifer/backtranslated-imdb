This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect crime is being carried out and the investigating police officer ignores all the clues, knowing immediately who is guilty. The audience has to wait the whole movie for the culprits to be caught. The result is like every single episode of "Columbo" or "murder she wrote". The director himself refers to the hackney story by showing that the police officer is watching an episode of Matlock! This story hardly fills out 90 minutes, but the director insists on filling in 120 minutes with every click in the book. Skip this one, you don't miss anything.
