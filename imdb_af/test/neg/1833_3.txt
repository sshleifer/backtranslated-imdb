Well, I had pretty high expectations for this. The controversial subject was a good concept. As a horror fan, I admit I was fascinated and very excited about it. <br /> <br /> It turned out they had a good idea, but it was terribly executed. Let's look. This movie looks in three modes: Happy, Sex and Dark. The problem is that the film never decides what it wants to be. The "Happy" parts I believe were meant to contrast with the "dark" parts, but it doesn't work. The soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> The movie transitions between these 3 modes very badly, I can't even begin to say how much the directing and editing sucks. There is sex in the most unattractive and unrealistic way. I don't complain, but even for Horror standards they were unnecessary and filling. <br /> <br /> The characters are all unattractive, with the exception of Paula (Potente). Her Munich friend is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in movies. <br /> <br /> There is a little plot I won't go into detail. It's not stupid and in more talented hands a good movie will make. There is even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy. Don't try to understand everything, because there are huge plot holes here. <br /> <br /> It's so scary you don't care about the victims, the perpetrators, anyone. And to think it could have been good. I can say a good thing about it, which makes the film a bit on today's unethical medical procedures. With the promotion of genetics and controversial sciences, it could be a great philosophical film addressing and discussing these questions. But you won't find it, just a series of scenes have been detached with people and things you don't mind. <br /> <br /> Skip it and check out Flatliners instead, you're welcome. <br /> <br /> 3/10
