This movie, despite its list of B, C and D list celebs, is a total waste of 90 minutes. The plot, with its few peaks, was very predictable. It was so stupid that I couldn't believe I was taking the time to write a review. Flex, to his credit, has grown in his ability to act since Michael Jackson made a TV movie a few years ago. Tangi, on the other hand, regressed because she was more talented in her role than Felicity's flunky a few years ago. While putting this train wreck of a movie, with its zealous production and horrible sound quality, other four-letter words came to my mind to qualify what I thought of this movie. However, in an effort to keep my writings G, I will simply say this movie is another four-letter word starting with a L. LAME !!!
