"You have beans? Beans are good. You just eat them and you go." I couldn't help but laugh at that little dialogue. Bone is the musical fruit you know. The more you eat them, the more you go to the toot, toot. <br /> <br /> Hmmmm ... OK, I can understand why the actors were here because they needed pay slips to pay their bills, but I'm not really sure what the director and the author was not. Even after watching the documentary in the DVD extras. <br /> <br /> Mike Rooker gave it a show that didn't really deserve it. I saw him in other movies much better than this one. What would have made this movie much better was to throw everything out, keep Rooker and instead make another entry in "The Substitute" franchise. Rooker would have made for a terrific substitute teacher who instructs naughty and morally disabled youth about the mistakes of their ways and how they can become more useful and productive members of society. <br /> <br /> Casper, you really shouldn't â€œJust push the undergrowth as you could poison. Oops. Do not worry. I think gift oak is the least of your worries now. Well, at least this time your croaking wasn't done by the giant tail python. There is little more embarrassment than being thrown through the chest by a giant snake. At least the movie scene in this movie had a little more dignity in it. As well as a more liberal smear of karostrope and red meat. Nothing says sad and tragic death like the liberal use of karo and red color! <br /> <br /> The first time I saw a monster, a shiny rayon cap wore a fur collar. First time for everything, I think. Just to be nitpicky, but if it was an Indian ghost, how come it looks exactly like a European culture and folklore monster? Wouldn't the monster have been more Indian? <br /> <br /> Having looked at the end credits, I don't really believe I can recommend it to others in good faith.
