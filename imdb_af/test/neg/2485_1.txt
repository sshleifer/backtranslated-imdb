I've seen this movie on videotape with my younger brother for a long time, despite the fact that I was a young boy who was hearing impaired. At the time I didn't have the closed caption decoder (it was 1986, the year of The Transformers: The Movie), but I could follow the plot and understand what was going on. It wasn't my fault, I saw the animated movie for girls. My dad hired the video to show my other younger sister. <br /> <br /> A decade later, I hired the video (for 50 cents) to watch again with the closed caption turned on. My memories of this movie have been completely destroyed by none other than a WRETCHED SCRIPT. I saw very badly written movies (like COOL AS ICE and JASON GO TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY), but I've never seen (or heard) the dialogues, just overwhelmed with enough hassle to turn your head off Laughing in hysteria and screaming for the pain of enduring torture through this movie. In spite of good plot and intriguing story concepts, the text should NOT be ONE OF THE WORST, ALSO WRITTEN FOR THE SCREEN, NO BAR! The inept Howard R. Cohen should never work as a scriptwriter, professional or otherwise. I can't believe they will even allow the terrible manuscript to produce a movie like this in the first place. Did the Japanese producers read the script, in broken English or translate before they know where they were? Even crap like G.I. Joe The movie and my little pony The movie has values ​​compared to this horror. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of 80's animation, or just taking a nostalgic journey, BEWARE RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR Stealer! No matter if you are exhausted or traumatized by the sloppy animated movie with a horribly written script, or you haven't seen the movie, stay away from this movie. The film should be watched with the prescription to learn how NOT to write a bad script!
