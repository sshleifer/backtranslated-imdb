This film is in a dead band with the original for the worst movie ever made. I think this one can be a little worse if there is something. WASTE WARNING !!! Here are these survivors on a ship that has been stuck long ago. Unlikely? No - impossible. The whole point of departure is so frivolous that it is not funny. There are some big names in the movie, and even they couldn't save this pity. I really find it a waste of good celluloid. After I saw it, I unfortunately decided that it would waste my time. Don't save with this one. Or the original for that matter! I gave it a 2, mainly because they cast 1 out of votes.
