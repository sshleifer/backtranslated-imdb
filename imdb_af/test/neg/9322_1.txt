Don't get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's movies, so I was thrilled with the performance of Rolling Thunder at the Parisian French cinematic movie with December 17, 2004, of course. most people were there (I was too). The movie was then finalized, but the score, so P Schrader uses excerpts from The Return of the King and another movie I forgot (Was it Conan?). Anyway, apart from the film was finalized. The lucky couple there (maybe 200 people) said they shouldn't write about the movie on the internet or magazines, as it has the chance to be selected after the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the film, and then realized that the movie might not be chosen for the festival because of its quality: never in my life have I experienced such a sense of discomfort in the audience, since people were skeptical to laugh clearly at the pompous spectacle. I couldn't believe how low the writer of Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction sank. <br /> <br /> Forced over-the-top acting thorough, stupid end, black and white moral, terrible FX's, The worst takes Christianity from Schrader, not even exciting, just boring like hell (no pun intended not and unpleasant! Some good places, but unfortunately abuse or at least not the initial hope! In the end I was 100 times more satisfied with the Schrader penned Rolling Thunder and wanted me back 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Don't believe the hype, even the John Boorman movie is more exciting and original. Oh, and the Billy Crawford pours, the poor guy does his best, but what do you expect? He is now part of the small club of the worst decision mistakes ever! I give the movie a 1/5 just because I didn't leave the room, but I have to.
