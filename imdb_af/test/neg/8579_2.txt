This year I attended a performance of 'The Cooler' at the Toronto Film Festival. While the other reviews I've read generally seem to be positive, I have to tell you without any ax to hone that this movie is incredibly unspeakable. The very brave and open-hearted performances by William H. Macy and Maria Bello are terribly missed on what is probably the least polished, most clicked-in writing to receive the green light in years. I don't know how bad the Brown Bunny was, but I'm sure it couldn't have reached the Dante-style depths that this one did. Just as courageous as their performances, perhaps the bravest thing these other brilliant actors have done is to give themselves to such a terrific director and battered screenplay. <br /> <br /> He must beat pretty well in the boardroom because he should never be within a hundred yards of a camera. The dialogue is so embarrassing and clumsy that I actually blushed myself during the show. I'm aggrieved that Macy's talents have been driven into the hands of someone whose direction is so incompetent as his writing. <br /> <br /> Watched gift actors like Alec Baldwin work through Kramer's terrifying script and ham-fisted direction was watching a baby seal kill - I was angry, helpless and sick at the same time. Although I am always pleased that investors and industrialists are willing to take risks on impressive scripts with interesting sites, this photo was a complete, complete fiasco. Kramer couldn't have been cruel to these actors if he had a steel pipe on their knees. I hope they will all avoid similar humiliations in the future. Macy pulled out the side door wisely and didn't even sit for the investigation. Unfortunately, the bad luck of the main character on the photo seems to have averted the worst possible way. Anyone who is accustomed to quality independence is likely to find it quite unbearable.
