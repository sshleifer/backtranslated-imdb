I remember seeing a movie of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared the living shit out of me. When I found it, I looked at it. I wish I didn't. The movie wasn't scary. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around an old woman running the castle. She feeds this terribly mutilated person in the basement of a 12-century castle. She knocks the poor guy every day and feeds him regularly. Well, she's dying. Then, a few months later, a family moves in. A father, a mother and their blind daughter. The father was involved in a horrible car accident that killed their son and kept their daughter blind. <br /> <br /> Later through the movie the girl hears sounds, things break, etc. And everyone is not worried about anything. at all. This is until a few people die. Apparently the creatures in the basement broke free and killed people. How this thing has survived without food or water for the past few months is impossible! Every time I saw the creature, it gave me the creeps. The creature goes on a deadly killer and police blame the father for death. <br /> <br /> It was a nice, bad movie. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 stars out of 10 Sometimes it's not scary!
