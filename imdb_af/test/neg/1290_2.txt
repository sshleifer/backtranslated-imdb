While the dog was cute, the movie wasn't. This was not the point of departure or the issue that was a problem. The premise has both great possibilities for humor and pathos. The theme is a worthy one. Helping others is more important than collecting a fortune. <br /> <br /> The unlucky dog, the unique premise and the theme was interrupted by poor acting, stilted dialogue and amateur filming. <br /> <br /> Even my youngest child, who is going to sit down almost anything, got up halfway through. How many times can the dog walk up and down the same passage? I can't spoil it for you, as I've never seen the end. It just wasn't worth seeing the road to the end.
