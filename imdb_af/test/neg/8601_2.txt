Sometimes when a movie is placed by critics, you just have to see if it's really as bad as the claim. Well, in this case, it was. I believe it was meant to be a sex comedy, but it wasn't sexy or funny, I think I struggled once when Johnny Vegas didn't hang a road fence and it was. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living, each having a problem with their sex life; Dave left his wife and searched for an old flame that invited him a couple of years before a triple room. Ferris lives with his mother-in-law who deals with him as a sex object. Tolly is obsessed with involving strawberry jam in his encounters. and Jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship, but does push a poor woman. <br /> <br /> The tone of the jokes ranges from tasteless to "I don't believe anyone can write it" an example The latter is when they tell a small child that his father is in a car accident dead, and then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mother is, they tell him she is in a coma. The blame for this has put all the countries completely at the authors' feet. Of course, the actors made a poor choice to vote in this movie, but I didn't think their acting was so bad. Not that it was so good either. . Surprisingly for a rather messy movie about sex there is no nakedness and the sex is never erotic. <br /> <br /> I would definitely not recommend seeing it for any reason other than morbid curiosity, although it appears from other reviews to love it or leave it movie, I suspect it will better looking at a few beers and with your friends.
