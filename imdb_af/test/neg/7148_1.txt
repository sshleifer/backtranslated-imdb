It looked at Sundance last night at a receptive as a dumb crowd. Obviously the story is worth it, it's powerful and true, but did the director throw every roll with a recognizable face? I mean, you really spend, your time said, "Oh, look, this is the guy of" Armageddon, "or" Hey, it's Easy Rider! " and you see the story out, maybe it's the only way this man could make his movie, but it's a bit distracting, like 'The Love Boat' or the old Towering Inferno movies, it was a 'shock o "block with stars!" I wish he'd just tell the story just with lesser-known faces. Also the camera work looks kind of lazy, as there wasn't a thought about where to put the camera to the best of the story. All in all, I thought it was okay, but could really have been good.
