Deepa tried again to brave a topic that nobody wanted to talk about. The story line is OK, cinematography is excellent, script and acting are well below average. I think it was blamed on the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India, where her original set was destroyed in 2000. This led to a totally different role, I just wonder what a spectacular movie would be if it had the original Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. Current actors Lisa Ray (who is only good at painting in Bombay color beds) and John Abraham are pathetic, need basic acting lessons. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda saved the movie as much as possible. The child did an excellent job. The editing and the flow of the movie is also not something you would expect from Deepa. Big topic, send out a strong message about a practice that is fairly fairly in rural India, but does not keep the standards set by Deepa for herself in Fire and Earth. Look at it ... when it's on DVD, don't bother paying $ 10 to see it. Well, that's the day the average Hindi movie is.
