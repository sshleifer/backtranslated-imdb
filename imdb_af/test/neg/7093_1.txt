The moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, bad posture, bad work, and back and forth. They are apparently miserable and abhor themselves. However, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be rich, successful and attractive. <br /> <br /> TLC should be ashamed of this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt. If nutrition really is so important, they should be able to develop a show using honest and true methods. If they really believed in their computer simulations, I'd like to see them do a double-blind test by 40-year-olds to find out what their eating and exercise habits were like children, photos. Then compare with the right things. Hey, it sounds like a project for Mythbusters! Discovery Channel - are you listening? <br /> <br /> TLC must stand for Tabloid Lies and Cons.
