Nothing to spoil here, but it could be a SPOILER. Beware, especially five effects, especially at the level of a video game. Or maybe the original Star Trek. The acting was just pathetic - some shining blonde mourning over the desert while a voice was drinking in the background. And so on. And so on. It was the drunk and drunk half that I actually went through. Progress is interrupted by a few battles. Ships inflate each other for no real reason apparently episodic. Again, it's not that there is a real fight that you would expect from a movie, more like a cheap video game. Boi-ing! Boi-ing! The ship exploded. Next ship. Apparently some of the ships are looking for the blonde. Here in the distant future ships need to be closer and astigmatic because many of them are directly transferred overhead from the attractively-dressed black futuristic babe, but never see her. <br /> <br /> Then there are some choreographed fights that look like something used by high school children. Again, the raw video game mentality is prominent. The fighters move to "Fight Mode" by turning something on their wrists, echoing a loud computerized voice and flashing "Fight Mode". It should be a dandy design if you try to sneak on someone. Then you go to a large power station that looks like a current power outage and plug in to load back. LOL, I'm not joking, you can't make these things, it's like a freaking video game of about 2000, just the play is better in the game. <br /> <br /> More draw. Then she appeared at "The City". She gets a fight with a mech robot of the future who can't hit her with his big gun, though she runs right in front of him, about five feet in front of him. Clearly, robots of the distant future are about as good as toaster ovens in battle. She threw sand into his eyes and killed it by throwing the rocks into it. Roughly, I was about 95% of the tolerance at that point, my nausea circles flicker red. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, she ends with a rope attached to a rocket. I don't kid you, tied to the outside of a rocket. It is supposed to be an advanced form of transport. At that point I called. <br /> <br /> This movie is a total disgrace to a movie being made at the moment. Just a freaking shame. There was a droplet story, but the movie derived from it - someone who is constantly drunk about a mother. <br /> <br /> I gave it a two because there were a few scenes that showed some beautiful works of art of science fiction as background. Unfortunately, the plot, acting, action, cinematography, and narration have derived from this artwork and broken it down. Seriously.
