First, let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular. The role play is like being rescued by the clock reunion, the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and as always; the army is useless. It seems that the more training you have and the bigger your gun, the more likely you are to die if you are in a low-budget horror movie. Apparently people in the film business have little respect for the naval seals, marines and ninjas, which are getting the worst. The plot is thin, a neutral cryptozoologist by the name of Dr Pe√±a falls the Chupacabra. He then smuggles it on board a ship where two crew members release it. You can do your taxes and see this movie and not miss a rhythm. The most notable part that really makes a difference is the captain's daughter. By the end she goes all the martial arts on the monster and kicks his butt. Let me get it straight, the monster wipes out the entire fleet seal unit while using ARMOR PIERCING ammunition! OK, it's a movie, can it happen right? But here comes the captain's daughter who can't be over 19 and kicks the shit out of the chupacabra with front and side kicks. It was hilarious. They have to get a medal to come with.
