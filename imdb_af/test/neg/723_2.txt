Initially, I thought 'descending ka man' could be one of those progressive new Filipino films. As someone noticed earlier, the movie didn't look bad. Clearly, the directors use more expensive cameras to shoot, better angles, better sound equipment, good players and great places. <br /> <br /> The improvements, however, are purely superficial. If it weren't for all the Polish and expensive filters, "after-school ka" would just like your typical second-class local movie - hyperactive drama, predictable plot twists, "yes right!" moments, crying, screaming and characters that you can care less about, everyone has hid your throat. <br /> <br /> A few things have annoyed me about this movie. in the first place, since when is it ok to have sex with adopted family? that non-blood argument does not make our difference. Secondly, would a woman for 40 years really tell anyone that she was raped, just because the father told her to keep it secret? and where was hell the lights in this movie? I know the director tried to make things look dramatic, but I just had to set the brightness feature on my TV.
