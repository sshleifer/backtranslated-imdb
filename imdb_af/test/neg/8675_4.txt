Oh, dear! The BBC is not about to be pushed off its foot for recording drama through this one. I agree with this novel by Jane Austens, it is difficult to portray especially to a modern audience, the heroine is almost an Elizabeth Bennet. Even Edmund is not calculated to beat female hearts. However, I have to say I was hoping for an improvement at last and unfortunately I was disappointed. The basic story has been preserved, but the dialogue has changed so that everything Jane Austen's tone, way, feeling, white depth was diluted if not lost. If some adjustments of the past can be considered dated, the weakness of this one should be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party' ?????) The throw was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone to hold on, I got no idea of ​​hidden depths under a submissive outside, she was more like a female child. I see I have to wait for the BBC to weave its magic again.
