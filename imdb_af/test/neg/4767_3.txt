While it's not one of Miss Davies's worst movies, it's pretty bad. And it is sad that recent IMDb riders deliberately inflated the scores on some of her films in a revisionist manner to prevent them from being slight in the past - or so. For years, conventional wisdom was that Davies was a terrible actress and just the roles she got, because her beau, William Randolph Hearst, bought her way into Hollywood. This is definitely the image created in Orson Welles' CITIZENS. It is true that Hearst uses his considerable wealth and clout to build Davies' career. With all this money, it is not surprising that she has made excellent films and it is not surprising that people have become snippy because of all the extra attention they have. To be with the man who finances your movies will be noticed. Despite this, she also made a decent number of bad movies and I think we really need balance when it comes to her movie scores. Finally, no rational person can think that PEG O 'MY HART and two other Davies movies recently shown on Turner Classic Movies (the FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) recently, because of today (1/5/08) the exceptionally high scores deserved - rank them higher than such films as HOW NOON, BE HOW, THE BEST YEAR OF OUR LIVES AND EVERYONE AGAINST THE REALISM! In fact, MARIANNE will now be the fifth best movie ever according to IMDb with a score of 8.8 !!! Considering most people out there don't even know who Marion Davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters, that's a serious problem !! However, she was a much better actress than CITIZEN KANE implied and initially broke into movies before she began to sleep with Hearst. <br /> <br /> What sets PEG O 'MY HEART apart from these two other movies, it's MARIANNE and THE FLORODORA GIRL were nice little movies - while PEG O' MY HEART is just awful in some ways. Much of the reason was the terrible mistake of Marion. While her French accent in MARIANNE was cute, her Irish accent in PEG sounded bizarre - not especially Irish. Plus, and maybe I'm wrong, but her continuous use of the word "you" makes her sound like she should do Shakespeare, not a film made in Ireland in 1933! There was also a bizarre insistence that Marion had to be the completely talented star - so they didn't just let her act but dance and sing. The song actually fits the scripts in some of her films, but here it looks out of place and it is severely subtracted from the movie. It just seemed like you could hear Hearst screaming. "See - she's a great actress --- watch her sing and dance". Unfortunately, Marion lost just as uncomfortable and oblivious in many of these scenes. But for me, the biggest problem was the idea that Marion's 36-year-old plays such a youthful role. It was clear that the character she'd played at the beginning of the movie was supposed to be like those played by Mary Pickford in the teens and twenties - complete with the pork tail and the gentle attitude. Miss. Pickford CAN do these roles, even if she was no longer a girl. But here, Marion picked up some weight and looked at at least 30. No offense - she looks good for her age - but she doesn't look like a teenager! <br /> <br /> Strangely, with the millions that Hearts spent on Marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money was a good writing and one that Marion's talents fit. Believe me, I have rated several of her films very high (I especially love people), but here she just can't help but this movie is a turkey.
