The production values ​​in this video are so poor that it is uncompromising. The show took second place for the stunning creative hijackings of the studio, with about thirty special effects per minute. It is filmed by a cloud of smoke, only one or two seconds per shot, and often the background lights are shot directly into the camera. The relief was terrible for filming. There is constant in and out with a total lack of visual continuity. There might be good dancing available to the live audience, but the video viewers will never know.
