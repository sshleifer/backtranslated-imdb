First of all, this movie is brutal to the point of misleading, and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again. I tried to watch it, as it seemed to be funny, but soon it got upset with the body parts and surprisingly graphic effects. It opens with a boy named Greg who sees the horrific murder of an ice cream man (Greg later dies and becomes the title character) who seems to be murderers. There is no explanation for this murder, which makes it the biggest WTF moment in the whole movie. Other, lesser WTF moments include the surrealistic asylum Greg goes to (with evil clowns), a woman speaking in tongues because she is possessed by the Holy Spirit (which has to do with anything I don't know) and the fact that Olivia "Holy crap thought her career so bad". Hussey is in it. <br /> <br /> None of these are good reasons to see it. The only reason for this is the character Tuna, who is a thin child with cushions filled under his shirt so he looks like a fat child. For some reason it has become hilarious to me. I stayed much longer at night than I had to watch this movie just to find out if there was some reason they could not use a real fat child for the role. Although I fell asleep before the end, I summarized from other reviews that Tuna eventually lost the "weight". Okay, so they didn't have the budget to deduct it realistically. Proposal for the director: How about making the character ... not overweight? <br /> <br /> That's it; If the prospect of Tuna doesn't interest you enough, there's no other reason to acknowledge the existence of this movie. If disgusting horror movies about ice is your preferred entertainment source, look at the much better "The Stuff" instead.
