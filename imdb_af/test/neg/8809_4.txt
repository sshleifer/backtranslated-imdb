Eh. It's a popcorn film, nothing more. I watched it with a lot of friends (and although it might NOT be the best way to see a horror movie ...) and most of the dialogue and action was laughable. <br /> <br /> It left me longing for a real movie. :) <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the lack of tension in the movie. It shines back to 'explanation' scenes, which reject any noticeable tension. <br /> <br /> And the character ratio 'turn'? Yes, they suck. I won't say what they are, but they don't add anything to the movie / storyline. <br /> <br /> (By relationship, I mean the two main characters.) <br /> <br /> Oak. My recommendation is this: look at this movie if you can't think of anything better. Moderate at best ... Maybe it's not even.
