I'm usually a glutton for bad movies, but this thing stinks. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible effects and very little humor, what hell was the point of making this movie? No thing to talk about and not acting to talk about. <br /> <br /> I could only drop 45 minutes of this rat, and it's hardly for me. <br /> <br /> Something positive to say about this drift? Cover art was OK, I'm pretty sure the movie also ended, even though I didn't make it. <br /> <br /> The rats were disorganized and blew their lines all the time, they had intensity and just seemed to go through the steps for their debit card. The actors were worse.
