I love the first and third Beastmasters, but this one was an abomination. It was almost as horrible as The Never Ending Story 3, for the same reasons. They used a fascinating fantasy world of barbarian tribes, farming villages, witches, supernatural beings and a cult of religious fanatics with a pyramid; and thought it would be funny to mix in our materialistic pop culture world of rock & roll sushi (I think that's what it was) and flashy sports cars. These two worlds do not belong together. I don't want to see a bunch of old barbarian people dancing to a rock song on the car radio. I have a sense of humor, but it's just stupid. That's what Hollywood does with good fantasy flies when they run out of ideas. Don't give up, the Eye of Braxus is much, much better. The one I gave. 10. This one, Portal of Time, I give a 1. Believe me, I don't always give such extremely high or low ratings. I just tend to produce such movies.
