I clicked on the Encore Mystery Channel to wait for the movie I wanted to see, Island or Dr. Moreau. I just caught a few minutes from Shadow Conspiracy. An old man ran to meet Charlie and grabbed him by the arm. Suddenly, an Assassin in a bright raincoat cuts off the old man in the head (with his arms) from across the street. After "C" waited to turn and look, try "A" to shoot "C" and miss out clearly. "C" was a much easier target, the old man couldn't go far. Duh! There is a chase and "C" is on a lift. "A" is on the roof, so he tries to shoot the cable parallel to the "A". He hit the cable and made it impossible. Later, this time with a specialized rifle, the "A" is perhaps 50 meters at 'C', perhaps 50 meters, but it is stupid to find a motorbike and get the rider in hand. How does Charlie get his parts? Go to Dad for the producers and say, "Look, my kid needs work ..." It reminds me of his stupid Sit-Com. All the actors are good except, yup ... you got it. I usually need 2 or 3 minutes of waiting for C.S.I. to continue. Let's see, what can I do for the next hour. I know I will decorate my toenails! Much better use of my time.
