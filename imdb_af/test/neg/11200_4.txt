I went out of my way to get this movie, and was happy to get it on VHS. Being a great Gloria Grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Other than that, I really can't say much about recommending this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the movie is to watch Sterling Hayden with his own department in trouble. Miss. Grahame is always nice to watch (if you love her like me), but the dubbing of her song hurts this picture. She works in a dive, so let her use her own voice. It can only borrow from the atmosphere. I have to agree with an earlier reviewer; the end borrows heavily from the great warmth. To the point of detracting from the end. I got worse movies with me. Grahame (MACAO) seen, but I will never have the opportunity to see her on the screen. If you have a movie night and are looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. Enjoy the picture.
