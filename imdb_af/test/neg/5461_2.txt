It looks like one of these Australian movies done by "talented" students and funded by government. It is full of clever shots of colors and shapes and oral excursions in Freudian psychology appreciated by art students and teachers, but in general it is seen as a dull mockery of good theater, good storytelling and overall good taste. What happens is I think when art students become so obsessive. "Pink Flamingoes" is one kilometer ahead of the same subjects. Some 70's porn movies are much more viewable and inspiring. Book of Revelation is not entirely without merit, but as an overall experience it is well below the average B grade.
