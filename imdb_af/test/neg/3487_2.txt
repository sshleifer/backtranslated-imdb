The bad news: The Canadian version of Beast In The Cellar, released by Maple Pictures I saw, was of poor quality. Dark and rinsed, it appears to be randomly out of a VHS band. It even jumps at one point due to a few missing frames. <br /> <br /> The good news: this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the DVD has little of my performances. This horror movie fails to build up tension and does not fear. This is a horrorless horror movie. While most scary movies have a limited dialogue, Beast In The Cellar is a gabfest, so much so that a character will repeat something we've only heard from two other characters. Presumably, all the chit chat serves as a filling for a very low budget, unimaginable movie. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not enough to make a watch worthwhile.
