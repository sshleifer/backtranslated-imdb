The Girl in Lovers Lane: 3 out of 10: Homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well-known phenomenon. There are numerous dissertations from film schools about the hidden subtext in films such as Top Gun and Spartacus. The Girl in Lover's Lane definitely fits in with the homoerotic tropics. In fact, it's so blatant and over the top, even MST3K, which rarely sees such things in their riffing, simply can't be avoided. <br /> <br /> The film is about two drifters. One is a rich kid (Lowell Brown) who runs away from home with a hundred dollars and has no street bangs, the other is a professional oboe (Brett Halsey). The Hobo saves the kid from a gang of villains and ends in a small town consisting of a dinner, a swimming pool and a whorehouse. Our trainer gets a second look from the waiter's waitress (Joyce Meadows as the title Meisie in Lovers Lane). Clearly he is over and his only other prospect is Jack Elam's Steve Buscemi impression. <br /> <br /> On the surface, it looks like a strange movie for the MST3K treatment. While the role player is too old for the characters they play, the play is pretty good with both Brett Halsey and Jack Elam delivering solid achievements. The story is small, but the Robot vs Aztec Mummies and production values ​​are inexpensive but relatively competent. <br /> <br /> This is the strange Batman and his neighborhood, gay undercurrent that makes this movie. horrible and hilarious. Halsey's biggest objections to the children trying to be put in the whorehouse are hilarious, his inability to commit to the waitress (or at least go past the first base) and the dozens of cans between him and the child. a hand on the shoulder, the sleeping places, the dates with the girl so that he and the child can shave each other. You don't have to be Freud to determine this undercurrent.
