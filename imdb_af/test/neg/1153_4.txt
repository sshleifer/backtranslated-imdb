If good intentions were enough to produce a good movie, I would have appreciated the turgid, ponderous, "Focus" slightly higher than 4. Macy does his best, but, like a previous poster, Miller's parable asks us to suspend unbelief. too often. Perhaps the novel offers us a bit more background on Newman, so we can understand how someone who, of course, is not without intelligence, can be so intimate to view the attitudes of those around him. I agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how grown-up average citizens in America were during this period, then this movie may be an eye-opener. I grew up in the fifties and the "good" pastors of my Lutheran church had nothing wrong with having the church picnic at a commercial beach, the sign of which prominently indicated that no Jews or blacks would be allowed. It is difficult for young people today to understand that this is the norm, and not just in the South. Only in 1964, when I graduated from a somewhat racially integrated (but sexually segregated) public high school in Baltimore, my black classmates were unable to attend the traditional "father and son banquet" as it was held at a facility that did not recognize do not have blacks. Unfortunately, it was a business owned by a Jewish family. The subject of "Focus" is important, and we should never, in spite of the passing signs of racism in modern America, never forget how truly repulsive the attitudes of that previous generation were. (The "greatest generation"). So, maybe this movie is a bit valuable to counter the recent wave of sentimental crap over Steven Spielberg's and Tom Brokow's forties. But ultimately, as in "far from heaven", the filmmakers are undermining the good intentions of having a protagonist so ridiculously unaware of the social conventions of their time.
