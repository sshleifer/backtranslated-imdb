[POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT] <br /> <br /> Seagal is unlikely to once again scale the heights he did with * On Deadly Ground * (mainly because no one will ever lead him again), but he is sure try, didn't he? <br /> <br /> This is a typically brainless and poorly written little fantasy of how Indian folk is much more effective than Western medicine. Seagal actually believes this nonsense, though he never explains why life expectancy in the Americas and Europe is so much higher than in 1492. <br /> <br /> Just as he never explains how his supposed "water-powered engines" work in * At Deadly Ground *. <br /> <br /> Even the "action" in this one sucks.
