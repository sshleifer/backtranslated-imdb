"Tart" is a pathetic attempt to make film that wanders around and among a bunch of Manhattan teenagers who are investigating all the usual teenage stuff ... sex, drugs and classical music almost without story, focus or purpose. Griffith is in the film for about 2 minutes while Swain diligently works her way through another in her long list of dog flashes. Nothing in these movies works and Wayne should consider getting a job. Not recommended for anyone. PU! Ugh! (D)
