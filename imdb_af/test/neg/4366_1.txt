There is a fantastic song in Killjoy 2 about how clowns are usually really nice and fun, but Killjoy is a killer. I don't remember the song in the first movie, but when singer Olimpia Fernandez 'Singing', Joyjoy, yes, Killjoy 2 'sounds like the 2 that was added to this brave sequel. The movie is much worse than the first movie and it was really bad. This time, the movie, including the usually excellent Debbie Rochon, has given up and director Tammi Sutton creates no tension and simply offers a dim and steady movie. Full-time photos produced it during their 'urban' phase. None of these were very good, but not as bad as here.
