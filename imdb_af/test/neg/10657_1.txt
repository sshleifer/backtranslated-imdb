... without running away. This movie starts with scenes in China with the finding of a newborn child. While it's not a new concept, I'm not going to get up straight there. Then there is a flash for adolescence. The man's wife and biological child are brave with the father who neglected them. While it was not culturally accurate, and the film made no move to develop these characters or the purpose for the dedicated father's dedication, I printed. <br /> <br /> Next we are in Malibu where we are bombarded by poorly constructed classroom interaction and terribly low budget (fill in the empty: work / camera work / lighting). <br /> <br /> I will no longer give away the plot, because I suppose the synopsis is accurate: the movie is meant to show how a Malibu girl (although she seems to be indifferently compassion and interest helping others when she immediately asks her teacher for the trip to China) is spoiled and inconsiderate, finds herself a healer and helper of body and mind. <br /> <br /> Lame. LAME, LAME, LAME. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a tough critic, so maybe one of those LAME's is gone and you'll be on the point.
