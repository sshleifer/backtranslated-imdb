I know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the full story - but I do go anyway! I waited for a laugh, I tried to give it time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait for a comedy for a laugh. My laughter never came, so I gave up. <br /> <br /> It's stupid humor, not so stupid that you have to laugh. It's not anywhere near that high grade. Let me fix it, it's just * stupid * - not stupid humor. They may have meant for some scenes to be funny, but they weren't. If you were really bored, you could somehow fuse the movie with a hallucination and end up with a generously entertaining experience. <br /> <br /> A very pathetic effort.
