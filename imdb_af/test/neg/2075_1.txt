This movie was promoted throughout Spain with a huge publicity campaign. After watching it, you realize that someone stole your money. Paz Vega is horrible like Carmen, she is not natural and she looks as if she is making a fashion magazine cover in all the shots ("best" is when she, as an Andalusian woman ... can be Basque, Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her, but the story is very slow, the plot doesn't work and the script is really bad, I think Penelope Cruz (the film was written for her) would have been a much more credible and sexy Carmen. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time and money
