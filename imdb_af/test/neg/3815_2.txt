A horrible movie almost amateurish at every level - a boring and distracted script full of stereotypical characters played by sham actors for a director who lacks the most rudimentary understanding of his craft. The whole thing stinks. It plays from the early eighties, such as a slasher movie, to the crappy score and ketchup SFX, but without the childhood nostalgia needed to look so carefully. One of the worst horror movies I have ever seen - definitely the worst that received a mainstream theater release. I have never been out of a movie in my life - I was unhappy enough to see 'Hatchet' at the theater, it would have been the first. Avoid at all costs.
