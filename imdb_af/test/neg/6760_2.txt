This movie is the standard goofy sci-fi rate from the 50's. In his favor, the plot succeeds in drawing an alien invasion without producing the aliens themselves. But come on, if strangers need energy and can absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to earth? Why wouldn't they just suck it out of a STAR!?!? The only credible reason for the presence of Kronos is a direct attack on Earth's society, not the mere collection of energy. Nothing like that is even testified; Kronos can be built by a better breed, but its activities on Earth are the most primitive. The end that the scientific heroes plan for Kronos is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific gibberish. It comes down to the "reverse polarity" gambit used so much in bad scifi, it has become a joke in itself. Low and low, this causes our unwanted visitors to release their collected energy. No one in power cares about the impact that the release of so much energy (including, among other things, the end of the movie, including the total yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the environment. And unfortunately, by the time the movie ends, the area is the suburbs of Los Angeles. Oops!
