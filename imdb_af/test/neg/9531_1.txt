I am one of those people who respects every filmmaker than he did. Every movie I see, I usually respect (though I admit I choose carefully) and define what it is. Not anymore. It's really one of the worst scripts I've seen as a movie ... so much so I have to warn others about it. The dialogue was truly incredible, the main protagonist was about the last person I would be interested in finding out more. A scene was an old school friend, "tell it as it is," just made me laugh because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of an already completed plot. The direction is at its best and in the worst movie making by numbers. Comparing this movie with the atmospheric majesty of a movie like Five Easy Pieces is a travesty.
