Warning, pioneers ahead (even if I doubt anyone hasn't seen it yet) <br /> <br /> The movie starts pretty well, but about halfway it crashes and becomes ripe, sweet, predictable and unrealistic 'harmony romance' mess. I mean, it's very clear that there are serious problems in the main characters' marriage, but these problems are never solved but just forgotten. <br /> <br /> Basically, once she decides to have a baby behind his back (without asking) all their troubles will disappear without a trace or explanation. Given what has happened so far, it would have been much more logical if the marriage were to fall apart rather than becoming the trite. A baby will change everything. <br /> <br /> The two main characters "Families and neighbors are also extremely one-dimensional and do not really seem to be an aim to annoy the viewer, and they also disappear mysteriously from the movie as soon as the" harmony moments "begin. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to rip this movie, but I expected from the start that I expected something more.
