I'm sorry, but I can't agree it was a good movie. Yes, it looks good visually, but that's the story the movie manages and I have to say the story sucks a lot of time. How in the world they managed to pass the plotters holes past the critics. Better story and I would have given it a higher voice, but I was impossible to do it and can still live with myself. I've always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews have really deceived me. All the scary scenes were shown in the preview. And why did the family being murdered stay ghosted? Why did the dad come back again? Why did he decide to kill first? Why were the children the only people to see the ghost first? For many questions, not enough answers. If I could give it a zero, I would have it.
