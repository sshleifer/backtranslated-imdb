If you are a fan of blow stick that has terrible writing, horrible acting and cliche to cliche, this one is for you. <br /> <br /> There is too much to list for the reasons why this movie sucks. In a brief summary, people with a combined IQ of 100 travel to New Mexico on a $ 200 million race. And yes, they are all superheroes, because they can do a lot of things like jumping on trains traveling on 80+ mph, surviving numerous car accidents, and endless cases of live cartoon roadrunner and coyote antics. <br /> <br /> If you're a teenager or don't want to think of a movie, this one is for you. Not one actor outside Lovitz is credible. Lovitz beats the movie of a 1 with the Hitler bit. <Br /> <br /> 2/10 (save yourself the 2 hour pain and $ 4)
