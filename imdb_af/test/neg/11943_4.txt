Yes, I spelled that right. This movie is so predictable, the real word needs additional letters to illustrate its predictability. From the moment the main characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers over where this plot will take us. The shadow was as subtle as a two-ton sledge hammer. You can adopt many pieces of dialogue and expect the role it will play in the end. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt played decent work in unobtrusive roles and Abigail Breslin played the nice role wonderfully. It's just that the movie has brought nothing new to the romantic comedy genre. The romance was tender and the laugh was weak and few. Sure, it's a good movie if you have nothing to look at, but you'll miss nothing by missing this one.
