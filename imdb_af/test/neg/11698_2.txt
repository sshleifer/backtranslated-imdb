This movie came too far from Straub's novel for me to enjoy. Hardly made it in the middle of the movie. In addition to Don Wanderly of Edwards's cousin in his son, most of the big scenes and a number of characters who gave the novel so much life changed. What remained was trash. Straub's version was much better than this poorly executed movie. I don't think casting has everything a big job choosing the Chowder Society members. Hopefully someone will come together and really fix this movie in my lifetime. I just hate when Hollywood strikes the work of talented writers because they think their version is so much better. Make me sick.
