ok we have a movie that some call one of the best movies ever. But I sit here thinking the hell the f!, The storys sux (which is no story), the diolouge is pretty clear, artistic nothing good! , and the acting is nothing really stand out, so if you want to pretend you're arty, you keep it, but if you have a right view, don't like it or if you explain why!
