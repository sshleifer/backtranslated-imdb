It's the worst movie of all time, no doubt, and Schindler's List, laughed more. It not only tells how unfunny this movie is and how big SL is, as it is heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet "Yahoo Serious" so that I could personally suffocate him, for this and all the very, very bad movies he ever was in. There are also very few things to say about Australia, as they keep it so stupid. Don't get me wrong people (Mel Gibson) from Australia, they brought us Mad Max. It makes me very misleading that people keep this garbage (a review I just read was "very funny," sickly, isn't it). I personally will boycott this movie and will launch a petition online to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious movies, and I emphasize it so RETARDED. <br /> <br /> These are just my personal thoughts, no doubt they are shared by everyone who watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Note: If you are forced to watch this movie, Clockwork Orange style, call me to do free euthanasia on you.
