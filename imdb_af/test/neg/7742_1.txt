Son, this movie is bad. And not in a good, cheesy, tasty way. Even MST3K couldn't prevent it from being boring, and it is also confusing when everyone comes out. But the most annoying part of this dull mess is Ireland's spectacular high speed that I was tired of listening in the first five minutes. Not to mention how really unattractive her character is. Even her father ran away and left her! I can see why, honestly. If he had to listen to her sound in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, he would have tempted her to hurt her. As I was, at the end of the movie. Plus, she is useless and annoying. When she dropped the long hole in the ground, she was already in Wonderland in the first ten minutes, as the inexplicable Australian accented miner did not keep her from all the various bodies she was invading. . He had just tied her to the Atlantic version of train tracks and finished it. And this Atlantis underground with the strange, confusing obsession with bone density, I have to ask - where does the light come from? Do they have generators that mimic the sun? Does not matter. There is no real plot anyway, just a bunch of oddly bought Goth Wannabees running around to catch Kathy (probably holding a gag in her mouth). Stupid, useless movie. Thank you Golan Globus for this cinematic horror. May you burn forever in the seventh ring of hell.
