I try to understand what people like MirrorMask. I am an avid movie viewer and hobbyist film maker. As I tell friends during my lunch, MirrorMask can be my biggest movie show of the year. Like the short Moongirl, the movie missed its points. Several times during the film, it made efforts to humor. It makes you laugh. Instead of letting you laugh, make it feel empty. The jokes were reminiscent of one of the recent Star Wars movies. They weren't funny unless you were five. And the acting also feels terrible. I have seen actors really appear in front of a blue screen. And I believed it. But not in this movie. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> This movie takes a formula and tries to apply it with nice artwork ?? And although the writing is completely workable and the special effects are pretty nice, it has no heart and fails. I left the movie and considered leaving the theater. I felt sanctified and miserable and still didn't get the sour taste from my mouth. I love independent film. I encourage people to watch independent movies to support them. But not this movie. This movie should not be made. At least, not like this. Why did the director miss the points so clearly? They were clearly set up? Not just humor. But the emotions. The play. Even the lines were weak and delivered. It was as if the movie was running on three legs instead of four. His steps are uncomfortable and time consuming. And it can get over with the slightest pressure? Don't see this movie. I don't care who you are. It's not worth your time.
