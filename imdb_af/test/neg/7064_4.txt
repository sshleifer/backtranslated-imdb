This is a cheap biography of a star of the black and white minstrel performances, a certain Dixie Boy Johnson. Whether this person ever really existed, I don't know, but in the light of the movie list, a certain Lee Lasses White and Roscoe Karns also played the character of the game. I assume that the man existed and that it is a money laundering (forgive the pun) version of his career. The plot, as it is, follows Dixie Boy from career height to depression at the death of his wife in childbirth, leaving the child to friends, and returning to his daughter's sixteenth birthday and stage debut for reconciliation. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. The man has a beautiful baritone voice, but no acting talent whatsoever and is a boring lump on the screen. Gladys George is trying her best to relieve the work. Judy Clark does the best impersonation of Betty Hutton I have ever seen, although I believe she thought she was herself. The scoring full of many musical numbers for his short duration of 70 minutes earned an earnings Oscar nom. A look was made.
