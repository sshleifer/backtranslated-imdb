In fact, I liked a lot. It had some interesting twists. But it just left me with a little there, seeing the feelings of all the SAW movies. Admittedly, the end was different from a typical Saw, but let's see it ... A group of guys who are unfamiliar to each other (or so believe them) flocked together in an abandoned chemical factory. <br /> <br /> But then it loses something. There is no intensity, there is a poor group dynamics. There is no speedy feeling. <br /> <br /> Some nice turns at the end, and definitely worth checking out if there is nothing else on your board, but it just left me empty. He passed the time, but it did not satisfy.
