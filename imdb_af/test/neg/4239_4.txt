First, a warning. "How to Marry a Millionaire" is represented by a seemingly random five-minute band performance from Street Scene, a Gershwin lite piece that is being treated with the full pump and ceremony of, well, Gershwin. To put it through requires patience. If you have the DVD, be assured you can skip ahead. You will not miss anything. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is one of the eternal disappointments of the Hollywood movie, a movie so amplified by great galaxy, cute mise-and-scene and perfect high concept that Failure seems unthinkable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation, however, is forced to ask themselves - how is it so limp? The script is an albatross over the neck of the production, a dead, smelling thing that smears everything and everyone before they can really sparkle. There are no comic situations, just isolated moments that play for the laugh. When a real comedy scene threatens to develop, the movie moves quickly to other, less interesting things. A case in point - the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date for the same fancy restaurant. One of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear her glasses out of vain. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce lineup, surely, with wrong identity, angry woman, and probably a tart in the face of someone? Well, no. Instead, we cut between the three dates when the ladies respond 'comically' to things their partners say. Save the punchline, and cut to the next limp joke. If in doubt, Marilyn walks into a wall. Where's Billy Wilder when you need him? <br /> <br /> The three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. It was one of Marilyn Monroe's outbreak movies, and the camera just eats her up, though the writing has nothing to do with her. She is so luminescent that she almost hatches new. Lauren Bacall, on the other hand, has been a big star for almost a full decade and she knows how to dominate the screen even when it's in Monroe's frame. She gets the only thing that is over for a real role, and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap - with the right material, she could have brought this thing to life. She is a peculiar timeless actress - if she lies in the film about her age claiming to be forty, it is not immediately ridiculous - and much less girlish than her fellow stars, giving her a convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from desperate and has a good eight years on her co-stars, which puts her near the end of her Hollywood career. There is an air of despair over her, sometimes stranded on the screen, with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few bits of comic timing. She can't play her right age, but no one as a contemporary of these new, sharper generation actresses relies on the same old sktick that served her during her career (for Marilyn doubters, as the two are juxtaposed in this movie Monroe's subtle and yes-intelligence helps in bright relief. She also kinked with dead wood as male co-stars (though all the men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy appearances); she can't get rid of comic sparks from them. Better to give her the under-utilized Monroe, who could be funny alone and Grable with the repetitive mr. Magoo routine leaves. <br /> <br /> That movie is as nice as it can be put down to the nice Hollywood production, the kind that even makes the two shots like "At the Light of the Silver Moon" visible. But somewhere, buried under the turbulent jokes and professionalism, lies the rough outline of a sharp, cynical comedy about the marriage activity that Bacall could sing - and new generations viewers sit down with "How to Marry a Millionaire" in anticipation of That movie, ready to be disappointed.
