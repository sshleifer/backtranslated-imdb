This movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain. It may be enjoyed by anyone who thinks it would be funny to see his / her mother in a full-fledged disco full of people who thought half of her age was a little ridiculous dance in a totally wrong attempt be (in the language of that age). To see Ingrid Bergman bumping on such an avid performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch. I was embarrassed. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the music in the disco wasn't realistic - it's the nasty idea of ​​a Hollywood director about what pop music was then. It's always a total embarrassment in most of the movies of the era - the ersatz music is canned and carries only a painful resemblance to the music actually popular in the 60's. <br /> <br /> Mathau is hopelessly mistaken as a kind of ladies man; He looks just grotesque. Hawn's wide eyebrow is just too stupid. The attractive neighbor in her apartment is portrayed too seriously and seriously. He looks like a Brady kid who's lost. Painful, pitiful mess.
