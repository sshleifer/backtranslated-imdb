This movie must have come out with a disclaimer that it was similar to the left back range. I didn't know it would be a bible drop movie. I expected it to be really a movie about UFOs and alien abduction for entertainment. Like previous reviewer comment, it would be good to show at a church, but not at a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of the assumption of the movie. I deceived me for paying for this movie because nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones. Going to church will probably be free there. Unlike the cover of his real subject, the film was good for plays and writers. But I have to say I walked into the movie for an hour when I saw the direction it was going and that I wouldn't be entertained, but preached.
