I don't get it! The teenager leads in "Horror Star", all of which are dedicated horror fans, but when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) passes by, they dig up his body and do all sorts of disrespectful things, like disco-dancing it around the house and throw food in it. It doesn't sound like something that real horror fans would do, now does it? I'm a big horror fan and I reject incredible icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it will never come to my mind to mock their memory. No wonder Conrad comes from the death ?? admittedly, after a look ?? to wipe them all from the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff was already not known for his kindness in life, as he sometimes murdered the directors who did not agree with his vision and even after his death he suffered from a tremendous ego. Even within his grave, there are video messages to disturb potential visitors and the group of teenagers will also experience enjoying the murder business outside his film sets. "Horror Star" (a "Frightmare" and "Body Snatchers") is a nice 80-year-old horror movie, but there are a handful of cheesy and lofty highlights to enjoy. The movie suffers mainly from its own stupid plot, since no one ?? Not even a film school student? is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually thinks he'll get away with it and there are too many boring moments to struggle. Conrad's video speeches across the grave are overly talkative and certainly undermine the tension, but on the other hand, his murder methods are pleasantly imaginative. One teenager enjoys the experience to get alive and another one (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) Lose his head in a beautiful cut. In the absolute toughest order, a poor girl is broken by a chest. Author / director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to pay tribute to the horror film of the vintage and of course he has made the film sinister. The sites and scenery are good, but Vane did not have the necessary funds to provide his film with proper continuity and editing work. The appearances are generally decent, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs performing the most memorable roles. "Horror Star" can hardly be called a must-see or even a good movie, but it's worth checking out if you are an admirer of B-horror made enthusiastic.
