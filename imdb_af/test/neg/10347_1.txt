Hard to believe - but it is! I shouldn't be surprised. Ads try to show how unique and "funny" a show can be. Yet not only the advertisements announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me, I didn't talk to anyone who found the ads amusing. <br /> <br /> I never remember. see a pilot, so without cleverness, cuteness or humor. The characters were largely unbearable. Especially Selma Blair (which is amazing that she would agree in a fake example of a show like this). The few moments where the characters were slightly redeemable were considerably hackneyed and trite. <br /> <br /> Rare is the show with no redeemable features. And that's not one of them. Kath and Kim have exactly ONE redeeming quality - and that is Selma Blair. Despite the addictive outfits and the actions of a pitiful, whiny fool excuse for a young woman who looks like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is still looking forward to. <br /> <br /> But if you want to look at Selma, Hellboy will rent. You will at least maintain some respect for her, instead of grinding this horrible character in your brain to associate with her. <br /> <br /> All in all, Kath and Kim are a waste and really the worst TV ever or ever. It sets a new low.
