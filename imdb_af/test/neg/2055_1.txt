Bled is a very suitable title for this. If you see it, you will feel that your life is being exposed to you. The cliches in horrors are about people doing exactly what they shouldn't do (going in the basement or going to the attic). Then the trouble comes out. Watch out, don't watch this movie. Show the brain that the victims of horror movies are never. Do Stay Clear Do not enter. And if you need more incentive. This movie? is as bad as the worst Your Boll movie I mean, The house of death is bad. I often thought about reviewing a movie on I.M.D.B. And after looking at some of the comments, I discovered that I think they were all trusted. Please trust me on mine
