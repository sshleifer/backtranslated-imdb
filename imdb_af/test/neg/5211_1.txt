How on earth were these guys given money to make this movie? The lack of writing is one thing, but the cinematography makes you want to weep. A handheld camera can be of great value to the appearance of a movie, but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. I am well aware that the actors are amateurs, but this is not defense, as the director may be the least talented one in Sweden. It will be a pity for the industry if he (or any other team in the case) gets money to make another movie. This movie merely argues that too many films are made every year in Sweden.
