This review is set for the British DVD three-disc. Slide one is caught in the law and contains model behavior, chasing Jamie and fast and curious. Slide two are known as Bedroom Fantasies and contain Blue Plates Special, Nice Loop and Love Potion No. 10. The final disk is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She is the boss and legal. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is probably enough space on the slides for much more material. <br /> <br /> Every episode opens with hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied client. We then see the story unfold as the guests look at the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception, because this story is of a waitress. The authors need to get credit for a good variety of story lines. For example, model behavior is about two models that come to the attention of the photo crew. Remembering, it's about a man and woman who separated and recognized their love when they met again at the hotel; She is the boss about a disabled male secretary / dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realized - much to her pleasure. All the episodes lead to much nudity and sex. <br /> <br /> It should not be so surprising that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and attractive hunters. Even the geeky secretaries are transformed when they remove their glasses and lower their hair. The sex action is plentiful, but for me it seems too French and false. The camera work can also be done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time and so moving to catch everything, and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. Finally, the end calls the Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida, although my Florida map does not show Singer Island. The scenery certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas which some people mentioned. This is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still waiting for a British DVD release. 4 stars.
