I saw a few Bible-based trash. This one holds it all. To make matters worse, it takes about three hours. A terrible waste of time, unless you want to match your child's biblical knowledge with the myriad of deviations. Do yourself a favor - rather go to the Sahara. As I have to give you a ten line explanation why I shouldn't watch this movie, just let me say there's absolutely no redeeming quality. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a stench of "let's bear the biblical account." The basic logic, if they spend the money on a Biblical film, why not make it worth it? Since the basic logic is not met, something is wrong. The movie begins with an indemnity over the poetic licenses taken ... this is the suppression of the century. Poetic rape. But then poetic would be an undeserved favor.
