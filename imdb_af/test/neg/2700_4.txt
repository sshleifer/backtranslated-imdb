Amnesiac women who remove their clothes from the drop of a hat (or a blouse?) Are about the only points of view in a movie that is otherwise slow and aimless. Although the basic premise of the story offers a great variety of possibilities, they are never developed to a satisfactory degree and exposure is virtually non-existent. A large part of the film is merely wandering through the corridors of a clinic / hospital. The overall effect is dark and sterile, a low THX-1138.
