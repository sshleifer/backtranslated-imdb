This film seeks to subscribe to the success of Richard Curtis movies, especially "Love Actually" (which I loved) - a series of diverse scenes that follow the love life of different couples. <br /> <br /> It's a good idea, poorly executed. The script tries to be a little too smart and simply doesn't resonate. Most of the acting is styled, reflecting more on the director than the actors. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (on a plane) was called "Scenes from a Park", which is a more appropriate title since not all screens were of a "sexual nature" . <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this movie, but in the end it is disappointing. Don't bother.
