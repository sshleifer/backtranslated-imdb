It's absolutely the most stupid movie ever produced in front of a camera. I can't believe I was lazy enough to rent this piece of junk. I saw some bad movies in my time, but it takes the cake .... Ice Cream ,,,, and Chips Too. Umg, I still can't figure out how bad this thing is. The play was a Joke .... The plot was not existent ... and the camera work had to be done by a 3 year old child. I have never seen a movie, so long to go nowhere. I mean the whole movie could have been shot is less than 30 minutes. I think this guy has a little extra time on his hands .... (Like 3 hours.) And an extra 60 dollars in his wallet, and decided one night ... (Hey .. Let's make the dumbest movie ever made.) And they did just that. Give me a break. I'm now going back to the video store to get my money back. Anyone who has watched this piece should do the same.
