Too broken to be pleasant, to lose interest and to photograph too clumsy to be acceptable. MAN LONELY is an interesting idea that is ruined by the bad movie show. Like a Ken Russell movie at its worst, or DAY OF THE LOCUST made by amateurs, Mr. LONELY might like a good idea on a few pieces of paper (no script, you see) and a free holiday somewhere, but in the end we have a widescreen movie that looks like it's been made by movie students whose parents tell them that everything they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I get the filmmaker right? MR LONELY is a waste of resources trying to be (gawd!) Strange and deliberately out of the basement. It eventually becomes irritating and lenient .. and useless. What is the point of going to a congregation in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this movie about Hollywood error. Maybe Korine wanted to remember God-play. Well, the result is GOD-DIFFERENT. Oh, and there are a few subplots like the remains of FITZCARRALDO, including Werner Herzog, nuns and a plane. Add slo-mo drift and violin music all capricious and melancholy, adds James Fox who hopes he can be considered daring (as in PERFORMANCE) and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen. It might be fun to film, but the result on the screen is a mess. Imagine your American PIE BAND CAMP with food poisoning.
