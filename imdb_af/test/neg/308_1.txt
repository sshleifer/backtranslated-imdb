It must be considered one of the worst movies of all time. The film is screened at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After the show I didn't just want to refund my money, I also wanted the 1.5 wasted hours of my life. I have a very broad level of tolerance when it comes to writing some European films, but this is one of the films chosen for festivals based on the reputation of the filmmaker alone. This film proves that such choices can satisfy the egos of the film maker and the screening panel, but there is absolutely no joy for the audience. There is no character development whatsoever, the plot is a junk, the style is stupid, the lap selection is terrible, and the editing is worse. By the end of the first line you will wonder if you have entered the wrong movie, and by the end of the third line you will beg to be out of your misery. This movie is an abomination.
