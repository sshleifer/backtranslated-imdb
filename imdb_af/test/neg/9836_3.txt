A young man named Danny ran away from home and met a driver named Bix, who agreed to look with Danny and look at him ... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy, naive girl working in her father's dinner. Bix starts to see Carrie, but he plans to leave soon (because he's a driver, see? He's not good!). Meanwhile, the village crawls, Jesse (played by a perfectly cast Jack Elam), arrives at night and bother Carrie. Danny accidentally holds horns and picks him up (because he is loaded with money? He has almost a hundred dollars!) Who needs to chase away Bix (there are many ambiguous gay overtones between Danny and Bix in this movie). Eventually Bix and Danny decide to leave town, but the problem is to brew, because of Jesse's creep. <br /> <br /> My review of the movie itself: a terrible, dated "Troubled Youth" flick from the 50's. <br /> <br /> My review of the MST3K version of the movie: I must say that this is one of the best episodes of MST3K ever. The riffing is dead all the time. Apart from the somewhat varied end, this movie is easy material for Joel and the Bots, especially Danny's constant screws that Bix has to save. The host segments are also pretty good, especially the segment with the "Train Song". Hopefully Rhino will release this episode once at home video.
