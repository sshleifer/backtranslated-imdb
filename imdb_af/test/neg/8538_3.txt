First, the editing of this movie consisted of one big mistake I didn't understand, how it was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones coming in and out of the movie. The first time I saw it, I just said, "Well, mistakes have happened" and brushed it out. After about the 10th time it became incredibly annoying and distractingly funny. If you haven't seen the movie yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone. can make for a nice interesting game. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie. This movie began with the creation of a pretty solid "ghost" story; However, the plot at the end just ruined it. You begin to watch the film under the assumption, which is indicated by the TV commercials, that the haunted house consists of ghosts that can only be seen by children; especially young children, who make it even more freaky because they cannot warn the family of the threatening danger. The opening scene deceived the audience that it would remain the forefront of the film. ** (SPOILER) ** The movie starts with the family's stalking and eventually killed by an "invisible" power in the home. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is put into operation when the daughter, at the beginning of the movie, asks her brother to tell her where "it" is right before "it" grabs her and shouts her in the basement . The young boy also testifies to this so-called "invisible force" that kills his mother after telling him to hide under the bed. After killing his family, the boy just tries to run away and hide to be chased away as well. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie started making a beautiful, ghostly movie in which the family would be stolen by an "invisible force" with their only hope of survival coming on a two year old rest. It devastated less than halfway in the film when the daughter also saw the ghosts; the disturbance of the "only children can see" the illusion presented by the advertising and opening rounds. <br /> <br /> Regardless of this, the movie doesn't really "ruin" until the plot ends. Where the man who helped the family grow, it seems that the man was responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the film. Suddenly, the man is snapped and trying to kill the mother, daughter and son while having a psychotic collapse in which he believes they are HIS family. what he killed at first. <br /> <br /> Turning the entire plot to the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me. First, why were the family's souls trapped in a house? If the director goes for a Ju-On (The Grudge) approach, after which the family, after sitting in a rage, would pursue the house and kill who enters, why has the ghost stop taken to the father? the ghosts of his family? If the spirits just wanted to kill the man they killed, why did they attack the new family? Here's another one for you. It takes a few months from the time you sow seed until the plants fully bloom during the harvest. It tells me that the man who initially killed his family, the man who resented the ghosts with the whole movie, lived on the property for months. During all this time, why didn't the ghosts just kill him? <br /> <br /> This movie included a couple of horror movie horror stories, as well as a clear combination of ideas from other horror movies. But I tell you, this movie could still have pulled out if it wasn't the end of the story. It's like they just ran out of their budget and just worked together for an end. For this movie was a success, they had to hold onto the prospect of the "only children" and ended with the fact that the family barely escaped or murdered like the family at first (would have opened the door for possible continued as well).
