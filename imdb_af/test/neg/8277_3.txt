This movie was pure, slow, pillaging torture. Not a fan of slasher movies, and prefer classic horror, I can't be the best judge. Slasher fans can enjoy it as an early entry into the slasher genre. I really want to look back at the 90 minutes I spent. The only reason for this is 1) a young Vanna White (pre Wheel of Fortune) that has about 3 minutes of total screen time. 2) An early role by the Queen Linnea Quigley (with nudity), and the legendary beauty EJ Peaker as the school secretary, who added some humor and sex appeal. Otherwise, an 80-year-old band named Felony makes an appearance, which is interesting, dragging on too long. Just like the movie ..... I had to watch how much time was left and couldn't wait for a better movie after a graduate.
