Before I sit down and watch this movie on HBO, I didn't expect anything, but a few laugh here and there and all together a stupid and general plot. Well, that's exactly what I got out of it, except that I was slightly satisfied at the end of the movie. I didn't expect it to be. I thought it was just another half an hour I had on my hands to waste. Well, it was, but it was worth it. The whole plot was very stupid, cheap, and some of the lines were very stupid. Other than that, it still has funny moments, though not many. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're going to rent it, don't do it. Watch it on television. I gave it a 4, I was generous because it made me laugh, but it was pretty stupid.
