Herman made his own northern drama with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula falls into this queue, flat and confronted story of two teenage attacks trying to get season tickets to see Newcastle. <br /> <br /> Truancy, minor smoking and drinking, underage sex, teenage abortion, school bullying, drug abuse, drug abuse, depression, child violence, child sexual abuse, shoplifting, housebreaking, automatic theft, violent assault and armed robbery everyone appears here. None of these issues are being investigated, they merely serve to convey the story from one imperishable situation to another. The film is not as sharp as Trainspotting, as horrible as The Full Monty, or as a reflection of the times as Wonderland (stealing shameful music in an overly manipulative manner). I suspect that not one of Newcastle's filmmakers is and has never experienced the social problems with regard to film referrals. I'm all for entertainment, and Herman's record shows that he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughter and tears. Quite simply, he appears incredibly short here. <br /> <br /> The movie has a nice ending, but there are too many flat, banal moments to get through. Beautifully shot, not very well done, and finally ending at three critical points: script, script, script.
