I don't remember, at least the last ten years or so, a movie I liked less than Mama Mia. Of the non-existent ones dealing with the horrible song, I was at least once a minute. I do not believe I can even remember one short segment that I have tolerated. I know I will never see this disaster again. I can't believe it with such high expectations because of the talent - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, that a movie can be such a flop. But to see the lack of acting skills, the apparently drug-induced dance, and then horrors of horror, to hear the song of Pierce Brosnan (!), I can't see how this movie won't make it into the hall of shame . . Definitely, a movie that never had to be made, and only if you missed it for the first time, one that I will never see again.
