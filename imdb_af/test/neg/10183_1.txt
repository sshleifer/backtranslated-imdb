I happened on this movie during channel surfing and it was another bad-made Christian movie about The End Times (which I find quite entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). To be honest, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed out on UFOs and Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough to categorize me as an embarrassment and terrible representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense. <br /> <br /> As a movie, the writing was terrible, the acting was mediocre and the pacing was poor. The cinematography and direction were sub-par: no interesting visual, no layered plot line, no creativity. Don't just blame it on the budget. The movies can still be interesting without special effects. It wasn't. Christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic field, just because of their message. And the message here was hardly "Christian." <br /> <br /> ** Disclaimer: The rest of this comment is aimed at Christians ** <br /> <br /> First, it is unethical in any business bait and link your customers. I don't like to tell. I can only win a free iPod to realize that I only have to spend $ 300 at participating stores. Non-Christians do not like to tell that they are watching a scientific film and then bombarding propaganda that has all the subtleties of a sledge hammer. Hidden agendas don't win you any friends, much less converts. <br /> <br /> Secondly, don't use open threats to convince people what your beliefs are. The actors who represented Christians came down as an unashamed, rude baboon when dealing with the skeptical "unbeliever". They even go as far as entering the rapture to scare him in faith. Representative Dialogue: "Turn to Jesus - OR GO TO HELL!" "Well, don't believe me- BUT YOU WILL BE SORRY!" "The day you die, I can guarantee that you would like to pay more attention to these Jesus things - when you are in the promise of hell! I may exaggerate, but it certainly came the same way. You think it's a "clear message for Christ," you're wrong. I don't remember Jesus with threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him. So, Christians Please do not use it as a "witness tool" for your "unsaved" friends, it is heavy-handed, offensive and inaccurate to portray a true Christian message. <br /> <br /> Third, theology was bad. In addition to characterizing Jesus as a means of hell insurance, it did not provide room for debate or discussion and did not attempt to address the issue of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. One pat replied: "UFOs are the devil's scheme to deceive people when they get away ping happens, "which is not biblically or widely accepted by most Christians. As the Bible does not call UFOs or strangers, you cannot use it as a source to somehow draw conclusions. The rapture is not necessarily even a generally acceptable, healthy biblical concept, but most evangelical Christians today appear to be a popular book series. If you do your research (as many supporting adjudicators suggest), the idea of ​​two coming of Christ (first as the rapture) is a relatively new phenomenon in the tradition of the Church, which by some traveling evangelists around turn of the 20th century. The majority of orthodox Christians will probably find the message of this film to be a fairly large racket based on many unsupported presuppositions. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie misses the point as a valuable entertainment piece and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I would not recommend it.
