I enjoyed the prequels, and previously found the relationship between Tucker and Chan hilaries. However, RH3 was a repeat of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was extremely annoying in this movie, and his character has no purpose but to hide everything in the most annoying way possible. Chan is always nice, but he was tired of this movie. I was able to predict ALL - who was the villain, who was the girl (SPOILER ALERT), who was the good old-turned-bad man, etc. I hope to see more movies from Tucker and Chan in their separate efforts, but not in any more Rush Hour sequels. It's just too tired. I recommend a rental, but not a purchase.
