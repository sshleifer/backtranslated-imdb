I enjoy movies of different kinds and qualities. Whether it's your ordinary Hollywood action movie, or your Oscar season tear, movies that meet a certain standard, will almost always be pleasant to me. <br /> <br /> In Soap Girl I received nothing but confusion. First, we meet Maya, a massage worker who puts all the customers in the storeroom. A virgin poet named Harry comes in one day and they fall in love. Then there were several twists and turns thrown into the plot that didn't seem to lead anywhere. Although many commented on the controversial issue of an Asian prostitute exploited by the white man, remember that this film was made by an Asian director who wanted to bring light. But whether he succeeds or not does not matter, because the problem is whether the movie is pleasant or not. <br /> <br /> For me, soap girl fails to meet the standard I expect of movies. It was hard for me to become emotionally involved with this movie, given the loose plot and mediocre acting. Worse, it seems the director wants to make a drama when the show comes in the direction of comedy. <br /> <br /> A movie like a soap girl who doesn't step into the magic of the theater will always leave me bored. Throughout the movie I couldn't help but think, "What is it really about?" A movie must answer that question before it is made. If not, you will end up with an empty pressure to enchant the audience. <br /> <br /> Degree: D + <br /> <br />
