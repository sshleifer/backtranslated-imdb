Cops Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon guide five black youthful criminals across the country and end up stranded in the vines when they break down. After a deadly run-in with a racist, white rubbish with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors take refuge in the home of a blind voodoo priestess. One of the teenagers uses senselessly a game to call Killjoy, who eventually appears halfway through this drill in a subpar make-up work and a bigger, louder little one that seems like it can be at any moment of his head. slipping. He then continues to kill the stupid characters while some of the worst one-liners of the Hee Haw are canceled. The acting of the teenagers is terrible, the dialogue is worse, the FX stinks and it looks much cheaper than the first movie. Although I enjoyed him in his earlier Troma films, Trent Haaga (trying to imitate Jim Carrey) is terrible and no match for Angel Vargas hyperactive overlapping in KILLJOY 1 (who at least had some dumb laughs) ). <br /> <br /> Another nail in the box for Full Moon studios, whose reputation as a fun direct-to-vid franchise has completely disappeared since the TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER days.
