Alleged "screaming queen" Debbie Rochon and her group border prostitutes travel west to the title spot and meet Greek murders that appear to be the work of a cult of ex-confederate psychopaths trying to stir up the south by a useless massacre . <Br /> <br /> Action and tension take a backdrop to very boring dialogue and uninteresting character development. <br /> <br /> Billy Drago is good at the ungrateful (non-sensible) role of village mortis, but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor, including the town and fort, both of which look modern made western tourist traps and costumes that seem to have been bought at Party City. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a great favor and look in the raven.
