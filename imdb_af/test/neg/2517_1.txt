Luchino Visconti, the artist with the sword. Courage must be the first word related to his entire opus. Film. Theater. Music. Revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. An inheritance with powerful consequences and endless consequences. He introduced neo-realism through the work of an American novelist James Cain in "Ossesione". He gave Anna Magnani the exceptionally beautiful closeness to her career. He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas. But the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain Adam Low and the voice of Helmut Berger. What a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> For those interested, there is a 61 minute documentary by director Carlo Lizzani (a man who really knows Visconti) named LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT. It is distributed on DVD by Image Entertainment
