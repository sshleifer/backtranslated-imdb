That's the answer. The question is: What is the only reason to watch this movie? I loved her in "My Name Is Julia Ross." It is one of the best movies of all time. Noir or whatever it may be, it's a very disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> She is delighted in one of the worst big studio versions of all time. It would be "The Guilt Of Janet Ames." This one has a haunting, promising title. It has a good role to play. It has a good director. I expected something dark. Maybe it's a bit tawdry. Instead, it's an uninspired, routine spying movie. That's pretty much a total drill. At least it was for me. Mrs. Foch is fascinating. And it's about it.
