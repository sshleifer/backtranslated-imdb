Let's start by acknowledging that there are probably three kinds of horror movies: good, bad and totally embarrassing roles that all the genre suffers from in all respects. Dark Harvest promises great with its Artisan DVD cover, but be sure it's the place where the show stops. After a bad opening montage, we soon discover that the film is a very poorly written script, highly qualified (even for a beginner movie), catastrophic lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, no one can afford anything more than a villain's mask, or have they just thought it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, so that's good enough for us? Well, it didn't work to create a terrifying villain. In any case, this is one of the movies with which you check your watch, sigh and curse your own happiness. The timing in each scene is painful, and the whole production has a middle school that feels about it (think of it, I've seen better middle school stage productions just below the special effects). I try to think somehow to end this review on a positive note, so let me suggest that all the copies of this train wreck be donated as drink coasters, Frisbees, wind chimes ....... I will say "see yourself", but it will only be cruel. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of the production company reviews and you'll find the same for each of their movies. They claim to respect the contract between film and audience (ie please the fans), but all they have done is plunging chuckle and a load on our heads for the cash (which I am sure they have seen very little for) . <br /> <br /> Sorry, the high ratings and favorable reviews are obviously uploaded by those directly or indirectly connected to this travesty. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 because it's the lowest possible rating. If I give it, I'm angry.
