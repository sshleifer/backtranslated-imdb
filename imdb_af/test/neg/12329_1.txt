Don't get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did it, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a lot of girls (different story for a different time). As I began to look, I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, there is Freddy vs Jason terrible, where you and your friends come back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. The cat in the hat didn't create an instant interest in me. While watching the first part of it, I was not only boring, but I felt as if I had somehow been violated by the horror of the movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didn't click. One of the things that the director / producers / writers / waters have changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to catch any of the original (and I hate to use this word but it fits) zaniness of the original. The book was like an Ice Cream Sunday, colorful and fun, and the movie was about as tiring and difficult to swallow as sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a leper prostitute.
