I watched this last night with an open mind. Sorry to say it's still bad. First, the movie is too noisy and you can't hear what people are saying. The accent is bad, especially Richard Masur. What is the French chick doing in this movie ??? Misc. At its worst. Walken's makeup is strange. The Harvard scene is useless and not necessary. Kristoferson's character is unlikeable and I wanted him to be killed and gone. Meanwhile, the Walken character is being murdered too early and easily (despite the make-up). The settlers are all stupid. CAN YOU ORGANIZE GREAT HICK, WHO COMES TO DEAD YOU !!!!! John Hurts character gives a little humor, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap. The only good thing is that it ruined the director's career and murdered United Artists. <br /> <br /> Still crap all these years.
