There is no "fun" fun on the desperate fate of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate fate of head-store owners, for the matter! That the richer-than-God Brian Glazer did not see the irony of having the "heroes" does exactly what the villain does - rob honest, hard-working people of their life savings - don't surprise me! Hell, how do you think he's richer than God? <br /> <br /> In this alleged satire about greed, these spiritual midgets reveal their own hypocrisy: the McMansions, McToys, the McChildren, the McIllegals who are paid peanuts to care for the McMansions, the McToys, and the McChildren! But the main problem (apart from the rebellious story) is the premise: as the former executive of a notorious company, Dick will be the Big Scalp for every corporate main hunter in the country! No soup kitchens for him! And, with high six figures, you'll think he won't be killed around a Gore / Lieberman poster!
