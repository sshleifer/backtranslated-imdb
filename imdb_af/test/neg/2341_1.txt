As I rented the most, I rented it after hearing the universal praise. And despite COUNTLESS bizarre, inexplicable moments on the go, I was very interested and entertained by 100 minutes of film. Then the two women went to the "show" late at night. The rest of the movie (which is another 40 minutes) is even WEIRDER as the first part AND completely contradicted and dumped what I have seen. Then the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Baffled, I walked to my computer to see if I could get an idea of ​​what just happened. Nothing made sense, and I'm a very clever man. None of the other users' comments made sense, even when they say "SPOILERS". I still have no idea what they say. Somebody's dream? Not real? Then, what is the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it's "not really?" Or is it really? I was forced to make a choice. Or: <br /> <br /> [a] The movie is a work of genius at a MENSA level and I'm just too stupid to understand it. <br /> <br /> [b] The movie is strange for the sake of strangers and just doesn't make sense. Everyone who loves it, tries to save face and pretends to "get it". <br /> <br /> I choose [b]. Screw you guys, I'm going home ...
