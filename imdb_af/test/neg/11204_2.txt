Gordon Scott made good Tarzan movies, but it's not one of them. <br /> <br /> As I watched it, the bad, of course, interior sets and the hollow wood cube listened as I thought about the so-called dirt roads, and in the bad dialogue and worse under the supporting role play ! It's TV level! " Then I find out that it is indeed three TV program kites that are in one piece. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Scott coming out alone (away from the lame sets) in some of the screens; and the battles do have some nice movements ... but oh ow and ouch in the dialogue. And did I mention the acting? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta" in this version) was a better actor than most of the people. <br /> <br /> And that doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> It's kind of a sting to see a younger Sherman (ie Scatman) Carothers acting as a native. But probably not worth the total time investment.
