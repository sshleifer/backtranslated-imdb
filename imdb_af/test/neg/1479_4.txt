You get so bored after the first 20 minutes of sleep. Sorry, Mr. Boutonnat, I admire your work (all these beautiful "movies" you have directed, such as "Tristana", "Sans logique" etc.)) But here's the plot very ... in vain! Besides the beautiful photography, it all seems silly and there is no envy to know what will happen to these "medium" actors. In addition, the dialogue is minimalist. The well-known question "where are the children" repeated so often, it looks like a farce. Believe me, this is a pure waste of time (with respect to the plot), and 3 hours is a long time. Certainly the real reason for this box's total mess!
