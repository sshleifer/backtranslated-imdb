I work in an office during the weekends, and there is a TV that only gets ONE channel. So, I don't have the option to change something better. However, I like it because it gives some background noise. Sometimes I get a decent movie / show. Not today. Today I found Breaker Breaker. The city looks like a third pace set (which of course it is). All the actors and bad guys look like they just graduated from stuntman school. I saw better dramatic regulations at a carnival. The special effects (flames at the end of the movie are more fake than Michael Jackson's masculinity). Even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor ... A bad, heavy shot, badly written movie.
