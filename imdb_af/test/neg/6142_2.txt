My ratings: Acting - 3/10 Suspension - 2/10 Character attachment - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character development - 2/10 Overall - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This performance is very officially sucked. For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th. I do not know, in the other CSIs you come to the episode you are watching. But in this one, you just can't get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so I think this show isn't worth watching. I know people have different opinions, and I respect them, but for me this CSI is not good enough. So if you want tension, real acting, good plot, direction, character development / attachment and you're an overall good performance, I suggest you watch CSI Miami.
