I went to see this movie about Matchstick Men, to buy the tickets for Matchstick Men and go to the other because it looks like a fun movie with action, romance, excitement, jungle and exotic places. They had everything, but it does a lot of movies with a concept of story. All I can say is WHY why they don't just make a straight story, instead of a juicy retrospective. <br /> <br /> Here are all the movies of what I've seen the movie derived from: Of course, Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone, but also True Lies, Proof of Life, the old 80's Tom Selleck movie, Bananas (Woody Allen) and Hero (from the use of digital extras). <br /> <br /> PS the only scene in the cool movie is when the central character inflated her room.
