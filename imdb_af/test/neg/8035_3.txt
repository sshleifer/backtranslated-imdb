On the way home from a day on the beach, four young people seek shelter from a gigantic precipitation at the home of Lord and Lady Alexander after their car runs out of gas. They do not know, but the house in which they live is the place of a satanic ritual. Jane (Camille Keaton), the only wife of the group, is offered. While her male companions soon walked to her aid, one of them accidentally killed Lady Alexander. Things are really getting out of hand and everyone who attends the black mass is also murdered. The four tried to escape, but soon discovered that there was no escape from what they had seen. One by one, they meet their destiny. <br /> <br /> Gong in Tragic ceremony, I was positive I would enjoy it. Slow-burn Gothic horror is right on my alley. I also love some of Riccardo Freda's other movies like The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, The Ghost, and I Vampiri. Tragic ceremony was a sure thing. Unfortunately, things don't always work the way they should. The biggest tragedy with regard to the tragic ceremony is the time I watched the mess of a movie. With a few minor exceptions, nothing about the movie addressed me or worked for me. The characters are unlikeable, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the pacing is terrible. There is a subplot about some cursed pearls that go nowhere and only serve to confuse things even further. In addition, nothing happens to most of the movies. By the time the four people realized that they were in danger, I was beyond the point of care. And I don't understand the reviews I read about Camille Keaton's acting. I suppose this is a great thing if you are considering an emotional fool. The three male leads are the definition of non-writing. They do nothing to stick out. The supporting film includes genre favorites such as Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi and Paul Muller, but nothing is given. In fact, Muller's main contribution is a two-minute monologue at the end of the movie that attempts to explain what happened in the past 80 or so minutes. It's a poor attempt to present a poor movie.
