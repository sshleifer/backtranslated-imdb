Wow! This movie is almost too bad for words. Clearly, the authors somehow wanted to link it to the Ghoulies franchise, so they had Pete Liapis of the first to represent Jonathan. Just now, he is a policeman and has no similar characteristics as he did in the first one. . The ghoulies in this one are not the ghoulies of the last. The cheapest dolls were replaced with even cheaper bought little ones. Instead of being any major antagonist or being angry, they are more like the comic enlightenment characters that didn't appear anywhere. <br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie, it felt like I had seen it before. Why was it? Because everything in this was stolen from another movie. All the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from Lethal Weapon. The ghoulies were almost like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, except that they were not amusing at all. Even scenes from the original Ghoulies movie were sprinkled by this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the target audience was adult, but the mix of black magic, cartoon patchwork, cop drama and bad acting didn't work at all. I hope they don't make a Ghoulies V because I don't want a movie studio to lose their money. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 78 minutes. R for violence.
