BLACK EYE (2 out of 5 stars) Incredibly-filmed '70s action movie looks like it's made for TV. Only the occasional cuss word and a subplot on lesbianism show you that the movie was actually made to appear in the theaters. Fred Williamson plays a tough old ex-cop who becomes a hard man's private eye. He stumbles on a few murders and tries to kill murders related to a mysterious cane. There are a few fist battles, a Bullit-inspired car hunt, a fairly original lift and even time for Williamson to confront the rich lesbian lover of his girlfriend (Teresa Graves). There is also a scene with Williamson who harasses a poor old man by tearing some priceless old autographs in his memorabilia store. Yeah, way to go, tough guy ... Maybe you can get a cripple to save later? Of course, it is meant to pay cash for the success of "Shaft" (these and about six thousand other films). This movie doesn't have enough edge or enough originality to make much of the impression.
