I didn't really get this movie, because I'm not a perv, like you, in lesbian stuff. <br /> <br /> The girl in the red wig is trying too hard to be funny (her lips are SO silicone!), but she is really lame and uncertain. She tries to come out like a surfer man (better than dressing but still strange and definitely impossible); The film does not explain why she is trying to overtake herself as a man. Oh, right, to "get" the poor, stupid girl. I forgot. She makes all those stupid inventions that aren't funny, and she's a great actress. Plus, that waif look is so out! <br /> <br /> This silly blonde girl from Melrose Place plays a stupid blonde. Surprise. <br /> <br /> She thinks the girl in the wig is an old one! They even make out! EWWW! I think the part was kind of funny.
