This movie came to an end - but it was meant to be in second place with an exaggerated mother, a witch of a rival, and a reluctant beauty queen. There were some foolish overwork, and some untrustworthy plot points (She comes in the second in every single competition? ALL of them?) Unfortunately, the movie suffers from the need to, well, a TV movie. Rather than ending up at the end of the movie, an amusing twist in which the killer (semi-plausible) is revealed, is the movie for another twenty minutes, just to make sure justice is done. Of course, now the killer is revealed, she is suddenly undergoing a complete personality shift - her character is being completely rewritten because the authors no longer have to keep her identity secret. The cheese is sinking completely which could otherwise be an entertaining amusing movie.
