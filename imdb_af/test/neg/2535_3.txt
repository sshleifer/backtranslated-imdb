I think the problem with a few reactions to this movie is that - with few exceptions - they do not focus on the main break, thus the main partition in the audience. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, there are those taken by the visual design, beautiful costumes and a variety of elements that go into the film. Some children's movie friends love the color and animation, and all the scary 'magical' effects, shapeshifting animals, and so on. Some cultural crops such as the complicated references, the interpretation of different folklore elements, and the fact that they can see Zhang Ziyi and quasi-miming, in two different languages, are actually meant to be children's comedy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are those who say that a children's film should have another point, that a mix of folk tales is not a story at all and that it's easier to get into magic believe when enough thought and care has been taken in the technical aspects to make it look real. <br /> <br /> In other words, the ideas can be nice; but when you place them on stage, they must save. Here they do not. <br /> <br /> A good folk story - from any country - has a clear story, a point and characters that interact strongly. They all miss them. A few over-sophisticated gestures for the opera, western and Japanese aren't replacing a solid theme. <br /> <br /> As a fantasy winner, I have to say that I have a few turkeys and loved a few, but this one really tries to do too many things - cheap. Sit in Zhang Ziyi to try to add a little glitter of exotic flower syndrome. The other problem is not that there is no plot; There is a half plot, which means that you are still retracted, and then fall again when another non-sharp-performing dance number kicks. <br /> <br /> The characters all seem to have their lead. in a movie. Unless you really like watching other people's amateur video, it's not good. I want to test it on real kids. I think they will drop it in Heaven after about 20 minutes for Uproar.
