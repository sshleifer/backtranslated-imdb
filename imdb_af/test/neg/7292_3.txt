When I put this movie in my DVD player and sat down with a coke and a few chips, I had some expectations. I was hoping that this movie will feature some of the first movie highlights: Awsome animation, good flowing story, excellent voice, funny comedy and a kick-ass soundtrack. But to my disappointment, nothing in this is in Atlantis: Milo's Return. Once I read a few reviews, I might not have been let down. The following paragraph will be addressed to those who have seen the first movie, and who have enjoyed it primarily for the mentioned points. <br /> <br /> When the first scene appears, it's a shock to you if you've just chosen Atlantis: Milo's return from the exhibition at your local video store (or whatever), and have the expectations what I had. The music feels like a bad imitation of the first movie, and the cast is replaced by a mismatched one. (With the exception of a few characters, like the voice of Sweet). The real drawings are not that bad, but especially the animation is a sad face. The storyline is also pretty poor, as it is more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the single adventurous story we've had last time. But don't misunderstand, it's not very good Schooby-Doo episodes. I didn't sleep once, even though I could snigger once or twice. <br /> <br /> For the audience who didn't see the first movie, or don't care about a similar successor, here is a quick review of this movie as a standalone product: -doo, you might like this movie. If you don't, you can still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else. And I suspect it might be a good kid's movie, but I won't know it. It might have been better if Milo's Return was a series of three episodes on a cartoon channel or on breakfast TV.
