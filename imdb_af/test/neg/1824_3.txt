On commitment in picturesque Italy, the beautiful lip syncing Lana Turner (as Fredda Barlo) meets older singer and prince Ezio Pinza (as Mr. Imperium). The two are in love while enjoying the beautiful Italian countryside. Unfortunately, Mr. Pinza called to his Queen's deathbed, which Lana abandoned. Twelve years later, me. Turner is an actress in Los Angeles, making a movie to fall in love with a King. Turner is ranked by co-star Barry Sullivan, who wants to marry her - then King Pinza is going back into her life? <br /> <br /> "Mr Empire" offers a tired story for sex symbol Turner and debut bass player Pinza, who has appeared with the New York Metropolitan Opera for a few decades. Pinza probably earned his MGM film career after appearing in the highly successful stage production of "South Pacific" (1949). The movie, and Pinza's golden "Some Enchanted Evening" night, has sold millions. Supporting rollers Marjorie Main, Cedric Hardwicke and Debbie Reynolds give the film an even greater sense of wasted resources. <br /> <br /> *** Mr Empire (1951) Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Barry Sullivan
