When I was 13, I was happy to find this movie. It was part of an endless Danish series of really cheesy things. However, it was the cutest thing I ever owned - but I rarely think I sold it. Well, what to write ... Better than "Manos: the hands of fate" and worse than "Critters 4". But it's definitely worth another one and a half, because it's made by people who wanted to make it. The play is not that terrible compared to a few other eighties trash. In fact, I'm like the old man, even though he didn't look at that Indian for me. But I don't think you can have everything ... Do yourself a favor and look it up ...
