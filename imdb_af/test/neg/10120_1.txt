This movie is really that bad, and I'm usually a sucker for bad movies, but it was too much. As it is, it's like a pure SUCK. Now you think you saw the bottom of the barrel. You might have waved through every title of Full Moon and Troma, all the movies by Edward D. Wood Jr., Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and direct to DVD flicks of faded men of action. You even saw Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a great variety of movies covered by MST3K, but in their original form. But you don't really know terrible movies until you see Darkhunters. And if you don't, you shouldn't. Don't bother. Not only was this movie incredibly poorly written, directed, shot, edited, acted, and splashed in rough cheap after-effects. First of all, this is a pretentious mess. But not good, Greenaway or Lynch style pretentious or hilariously messy in an Ittenbach or early Waters kind of fashion. It's the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone is incredibly stupid, thinking they did something special. Kind of like M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), Just that man looks like a freakin messiah when compared to this train wreck (and it comes from a turbulent Shaymalan hater). It's also boring. Not a heavy-going type of boring, that's right, if the movie gives you patience. Darkhunters don't do that. It is boring in a "Oh my fu (King God, if I see another shot of a cat sitting in an unpleasant soundtrack, I'm going to kill myself (king myself!") Similar. > <br /> VAT Anyone who claims this movie is a brave liar and anyone who claims this movie is complex or deeply aware of how their mother is like in bed.
