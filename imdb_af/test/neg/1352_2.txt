To say I was disappointed is an understatement. An amateur movie made by professionals. I was about to leave the theater on two or three occasions (something I've never done before). I'm really stopped by Cloris Leachman. She says true, the only one I have to say. These new women are less modern than the George Cukor women of the 30's. This is "acting" for us to try with, but their "conflict" is exactly the same as it has always been, in movies anyway. The pleasure of the original was based on a sharp, capricious and very funny writing. A masterful direction and an unbeatable role. All the elements missing here. TV actors who mix with models and Oscar nominees / winners. There was nothing organic about it. The whole thing felt like a tackle, improvised in the moment without a clear purpose. 10/02
