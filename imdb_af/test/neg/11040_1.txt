When one of my friends recommended it to me, I guess how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the overall magnitude of the movie, of course I expected a wonderful, at least entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The two hours I spent were a huge disappointing waste of time. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie is surrealistic, but even in surreal movies there is something that anchors it, even if only in the slightest. This movie, on the other hand, forced and felt false. Many of the shots were unnecessary and watch, it made me think the director was trying hard to be artistic. <br /> <br /> The acting was poor and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed. Maybe it's just me who misses something that others can see, but I didn't even realize that there was a kind of attraction between Dae su and Migo, before they started getting it like rabbits randomly halfway through the movie. Then again, maybe this movie is just bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not against violence in movies, but in this one almost everything was unnecessary. During all the battle scenes I curled myself about how painfully clich√© it was. <br /> <br /> And the plot? The word laggable occurs. I would be amused if I didn't waste two hours of my life following this bad thought and ridiculous plot. In spite of all the mistakes of the movie, I finally expected something interesting to finish. I will not discuss the end because I do not want to "spoil" the film for those who have not seen it. Just that metaphor: "It's a rock or a grain of sand, in the water they sink the same." cannot be used as an explanation for everything. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was made for shock value and shock value only. I hope sooner or later people will stop pretending to be so pretentious and acknowledge a bad movie for what it is. I have seen many other Korean films and it impresses me that people considered Oldboy the best.
