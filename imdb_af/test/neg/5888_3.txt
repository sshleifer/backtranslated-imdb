I have a loss. This whole movie made absolutely no sense. It was like a Soderburg movie for football. The camera cut, the pass, all copied so. I thought the subject was too serious for them to treat it as it was. Yes, we all know South Africans like soccer and beauty art. Should we be treated as audiences? I looked at Lee and Jay. I expected young talent to come together in the style of Dead Poet's Society or similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely dismissed by the film. You didn't get the characters. It was character-driven, but you didn't understand the people's motivation or actions for the most part. The one child's mother is obsessed with being a soccer player. Why is he so quiet? What is his deal? Did we need the scene with him to prove his heterosexuality? Why should we care? The film gave us insight into these children's lives and offered no care for caring. It just made no sense. <br /> <br /> And why show a movie about a lost team? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us a little pay for these guys who work so hard as they did with all their "imaginable" problems, darnit. We have nothing. We got a bit of a blast at the end of the film telling us that Mojo won the third stringer (Lee) next year. Why didn't you follow that story? What did we get from this one? The movie led you, but didn't lead you anywhere. I just felt like something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least these two movies led you somewhere. Friday night was about a loser team who lost their star player early in the movie. The actor who played him was wonderful. You were totally irritated by him, what was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but he couldn't play, so why do we make sure we get his problems? <br /> <br /> And the other team in the playoffs ... are we to believe it's high school teens? These men looked in their 30's like college seniors or professional players. Who tried to kid them? I know the other team would look intimidating, but it was a bit over the line. I like the gritty element of those who negotiate with the black team, but how did it fit the overall theme of the movie. Nothing merged. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and that made me strange. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was named. It was just a mess. Not a movie ticket or rental.
