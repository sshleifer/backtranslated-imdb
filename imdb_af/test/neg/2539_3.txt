On a flight back from London I watched She's the Man; Apparently Air Canada has a crap film policy. Maybe it's not the best way to get an overview of this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to come to the village at a boarding school in the residence. Even if you look at your mind (on a 6-hour flight), the story is impeccable and ridiculous. There are a few moments of humor, mostly of comedian David Cross as the principle, but the intricate love polygon does not stimulate emotion, although it is cleverly mixed (with the prudence of sensible credibility). The end is just as ridiculous as the rest. I think if I was a 12-year-old girl, I really enjoyed this one.
