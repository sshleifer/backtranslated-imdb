It was the stupidest movie I've ever seen in my life. This is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over, it wasn't a single person in the movie - not that there were many people watching this horrible movie. "Wow what a good movie." Someone actually walked out! It was absolutely horrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute of it. My friend put her head in my shoulder at the end, because after the scene with Rick was on the ceiling, she had had enough. It wasn't funny at all. Believe me, I went with 11 other girls and none of my friends kept it. It was ridiculous! I saw a lot of movies, but it was absolutely the worst! I mean a scene in the movie is with an old man who is dead in a coffin. I can't fix these things.
