It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. One must take something from Truffaut seriously; It's not just a B-movie shot by hacks. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Truffaut didn't decide whether to make a noir or sentimental chick. And also Deneuve, whose dozen (?) Character flip flops are simply not incredible - even acted badly; not done at all. Among other things, how a woman as beautiful as Deneuve can be a person like Julie / Marion is just beyond anyone's ability to suspend unbelief; The role absolutely requires someone who is not so beautiful. Belmondo's scene also suffers although his character is not as incredible as Deneuve. Unfortunately, the clich√© end (which I will not describe) is too appropriate for this complete error.
