It's probably the worst movie ever made. I know people are talking about how terrible Ed Wood movies (Plan 9) are, but this movie makes Plan 9 great. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris makes a cameo, so I have no idea. Maybe to destroy his film career. Apart from Chuck Norris, the movie is made up of extras in daycare and Mike Norris. That's right, Chuck's son. <br /> <br /> This director does not even have a resume and I have no idea where the plot or script is. It had to be green by a terrible South African minister who somehow had a 3rd cousin who owns a studio. I don't really know that. <br /> <br /> I don't really know. What to say about this movie. I'll give you a plot summary, but I'm lost. There is something about Jesus and Satan ... an eternal battle. Other than that, there are Indians. And a bunch of freaky kids who don't know how to act ... they're just uncomfortable and shouldn't be on camera. I don't know what goes on most of the time, but I know the movie was a good laugh. Mike Norris pushes his daughter (on her bike) in the street somehow ... but in the lap he is in the middle of the park. Somehow, she learns to ride her bike at speeds similar to those of The Flash and is hit by a car or bus. I do not know. But she's dead. This is actually the funniest scene in the movie. I know it sounds sick, but as soon as you see, Mike puts his hands in victory, and then holds his head and screams in terror ... you'll understand. It doesn't show the girl is hitting or anything. You just assume she was hit by a vehicle. But the movie isn't clear. So maybe it was completely unrelated and she died of cancer. Anyway ... then the movie becomes very confusing and I have no idea what really happens. I'm a Christian and I have no idea why this movie was made. I see no value for this movie in a religious or non-religious sector. This is probably the first thing their students show up in Film-up 101 ... that's what you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> Just look ... you hate it and I for what indicates you are seeing it.
