OK, first of all, who in their right mind will repeat Hitchcock and the second, who will shoot it for a shot? I admit I didn't intend to watch this movie for that reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite movies ever and it looks like a destructive photocopy of it. I watched it because my friend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes in this crap that it was terrible. First, as mentioned, they shot it for the shot. Where is originality? Why try a movie that is almost perfect, exactly as it did the first time? Why should you start such a movie again? If you are going to remake something, restart something that doesn't work and make it better! <br /> <br /> Second, they used exactly the same script from the 1960 version. The dialogue no longer works. It works well and sounds perfect for the 1960s, but looks strange and silly from modern actors. Why not update the dialogue? Hitch didn't write the script, you could rewrite. <br /> <br /> This movie had a very good talent and they were wasted by imitating the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman seemed to be playing John Anderson's performance as the car salesman in the original. All the actors seemed that the only direction they gave was the characters from the original movie. Vince Vaughn may have looked a little creepier than Anthony Perkins, but you lose the sympathy you should have for Norman. To masturbate Norman while Marion got out was too far and lost the innocence of the character I thought Tony Perkins had captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's emphasis was annoying and Rita Wilson was too old to play Caroline. Her lines came down as someone desperate rather than just young and fun like Patricia Hitchcock's performance. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I saw about the movie was that Gus Van Sant could open the movie with the shot that Hitch intended. Hitch wanted to open with one long shot going over Phoenix, but could not establish it at that time for a series of shots that were skipped together. This film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot entering the hotel window. After that, however, the film became a worthless waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> If you're curious about how to destroy a wonderful movie, watch it, but don't look at it under these circumstances. BEFORE you watch the original. It is a faded photocopy of the original and should never be greened. Stick to the master's movie, not the imitation.
