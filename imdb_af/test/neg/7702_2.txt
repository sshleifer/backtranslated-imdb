The problem with this movie, like so many other failed films, is the writing. <br /> <br /> The writing is so unfocused that it moves around the world. What's the story here? OK, it's a biopsy, but I think everyone will agree. There is no way that a whole life can be condensed in 100 or so minutes. Some selection and editing are needed, but this script just didn't select or edit enough. It did not make Hoffman's life one or two definable rotatable moments or themes with which the audience could identify, and by them "the bigger picture of the whole man". <br /> <br /> The movie wanders from a straight plodding 'troubled genius' biopsy, to semi-docu / mocumentary (using new shots billed to fit archive footage), to True Life Sob Stories movie of the week (the whole "I bring a boy who doesn't know I'm his father's shtick), political conspiracy theory, etc. etc. It just never makes sense what he wants, and half-hearted Citizen Kane likes narrative structure ( reporter interviewing Hoffman's past) will soon be leaving the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments and incidents that do not contribute to the story and could have been cut to leave room to make something more important. The whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio shouted the window shouted, "I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! "(" I'm acting! I'm acting! I'm acting! ") Can be cut easily. All that happens is that the psychiatrist says," You have bipolar disorder, here's a lithium. " And the two women in his life say, "We can see your weekends more often" and pop! That's it. No more mental health problems. It is such a legless infinite tokenist scene that can be easy, and must have been dumped before The scene where they all look high and Viet Nam and Hoffman news line material, calls GOD useless, tells us nothing about anything, yet when it comes to a major moment like the drug bust, it is movie production so hurry that the situation just comes out of the left field and it does not make sense to the audience. Suddenly he is trading in heroin? Where did it come from? Why? who is a middle-aged left man, would guess I am sitting well within the target audience for this movie k, but I even got the picture of The Man, The Pigs, The Fuzz etc. As brutal, fit, unthinking, hippy-hate androids. It may have been so in the 60's America, I don't know, I wasn't there, but in movie terms it was cheap clumsy polemics. <br /> <br /> After everything that Vincent D'Onofrio convincingly said was charismatic like the younger Hoffman and I could see Janeane Garofalo in everything and even read a bus timetable, though she just wasn't right for this part.
