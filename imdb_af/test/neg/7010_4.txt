*** SPOILERS *** A hot and sexy Linda Blair as the Witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset about her friend and rival Witch over the town of Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia gets her husband Hal, Edward Albert, to get a boost at his work at Giger & Greengrass law firm about the more deserving Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who married Erica, caused her a game on Hal caused him to lose control of his car and eventually kill himself. <br /> <br /> Finding out Erica's attempt on his best friend Larry's life has caused a violent battle with her, Erica falling from the balcony to her death. That's when Larry goes back to his ex-wife, Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things really start warming, emotionally and sexually. The wicked Amelia tries to take the deadly spirit of Erica over Carol's body and eventually murder Larry, who holds her responsible for her husband Hal's injury that permanently makes him remain a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> Not much of a story, but much of the cheese and soft core action with poor Larry is manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica. He plans to kill him for the first time turning his back on her. Amelia is a little outraged by herself, not exactly knowing who is and who is not a threat to her. Amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks, to first lose himself in a bloody home-burglary, then his mind, by accusing the police as the murderer, and ultimately life, by blowing Ameila itself. As he is in Reynolds' house under her control, it's as crazy as a guardian trying to kill both her and the lame Hal. <br /> <br /> Larry Parks looked so strange and acted that you felt that he had accidentally hit the "Sorceress" set and was finally in the movie playing his role as Stan. Without the help or benefit of a screenplay he improvised his way and then slowly realized how god-terribly the movie really was. Stan is killed early in the film. It was a big plus for him, as he didn't have to suffer as we watch the whole brainless and sensible movie. <br /> <br /> It is clear to you as well as to the creators of "Sorceress" that all these Shenanigan's must come to a kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and a trick ends up being set to finally ending the movie. The end is about the best thing, except me. Blair and the rest of the very good-natured woman being thrown can tell the film.
