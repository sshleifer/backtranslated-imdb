When a Killer Calls should be the biggest ripoff ever released by Asylum. It's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives ghostly calls from a creepy voice that repeatedly asks her: "Have you checked the girl?" Of course, she has the calls found by police (after having done some realistically unnecessary tasks - refurbish when he calls, waits ten seconds and dials the number 57). Sounds familiar? Yes, that's why I rented it too. <br /> <br /> Well, it must. And I hate to say that, but it could have been more entertaining than the big screen crapfest that was released simultaneously, if not for one fatal error. Instead of making B-movie ripoff glory, it tried to do something original. It tried to make the main character sympathetic, rather than having cliché, to camp with her. Note, it can work with a talented actress. But she wasn't. Sure, she looks good, and she screams and cries, but. . . Oh anyway. <br /> <br /> Then the horrible end came. Not scary, because it was terrible, scary because it HAS USED. The rhythm to that point (about an hour) was champion, cliché and fun. Then it's back in a different direction, and it just depends on another silly, funny treasure movie with a sexy "teen" throw to a hostel-esquire gore / drill party. <br /> <br /> I think it falls into the "Oh well, whatever" category. The main actress filled a line? Oh yes, whatever, I don't feel like reloading it again. We forgot to give the killer motivation? Oh yes, whatever, I don't feel like rewriting it. The pacing changes halfway completely? Oh yes, whatever, I don't feel like shaving off fifteen minutes. Continuity errors? Oh yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie (silly, cute, predictable, champion plow movie with sexy cast), then you'll be fine to the end. The end is stupid, it's not fun, it's not scary, it's not champion or cheesy or faster. In fact, there were almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up (and it's not a spoiler, because it's on the back of the DVD) and watching the stuff in the room and shout, and. . . whatever.
