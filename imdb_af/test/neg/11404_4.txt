Since 2002, the Dutch cinema has finally improved. This movie is still a part and a school book example of the bad period of the Dutch film. <br /> <br /> The story is unnecessarily told in the flashback style. All the 'present' sequences in France are completely redundant and do not add to the story, emotions or power. For some reason, European filmmakers often find it necessary not to tell the story chronologically. I never understood why, or what the appeal is. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also not the greatest. It is not always clear where the movie is trying and what it is trying to tell. The story of a young inexperienced boy who falls in love with a wild young girl who later appears to be very psychotic may sound good on paper and even show parallels with Paul Verhoeven's "Turkish fruit", to which this movie often compares is. until before and at the time of his release. However, the end result is far from comparable. The story fails to capture the right emotions, which is also due to the impressive performances of the actors. The way the story is told makes the film far from always interesting or compelling. In the film I lost about 40 minutes of interest. <br /> <br /> When the film was made, Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf were promising stars, with great potential and ambitions, but both their careers. almost dried up. Angela Disk seems to pay more attention to her family than her career (which is of course not bad), while Antonie Kamerling tried to start a career in Hollywood. He never played more than a few small pieces in 2 Renny Harlin flops. To be honest, I'm not surprised. It's not that he's a bad actor and he certainly had the right look, but his English is just not good enough to put it mildly. Just listen to him and speak English in the beginning of this movie and you will understand what I mean. They are not really bad actors, but for some reason they do not show up in this movie. This is probably also due to the poor dialogue. I loved Beau van Erven Dorens. He is very criticized, but his acting seems very natural. He always keeps the characters close to who he is. <br /> <br /> It's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not exactly what I would recommend. Bad and uninteresting storytelling makes it a bad movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
