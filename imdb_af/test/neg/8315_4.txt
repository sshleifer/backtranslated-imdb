Hello, Everyone, Oh, Boy ... This one is a lulu. It has really bad background music when it can print it. There are three bad guys who, I think, are the stars of this. They hit people and threw people up and pitched trucks and bulldozers in people. Ordinary things. <br /> <br /> The woman they send on their missions can't move her mouth when she speaks. It's like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. She walked as if she were balancing an egg on her head. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe is 70s recreation style for the men and blah for the female head who is supposed to be a good nurse. The bad Novocain mouthwife wears red. A Silk might be slamming, or maybe just a poplin windbreaker that's too big. <br /> <br /> I even liked the end, even though it didn't make much sense. It tells us about what happened earlier in the movie. <br /> <br /> Police officers are OK. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two bright ones could have worked in Hollywood again. <br /> <br /> The movie starts interesting enough and ends with a surprise. The drug sucks. The guy in the dinner who gives a free burger to the star does a good job. He is like a character actor of the 1940s. Big voice. <br /> <br /> This one is a bit too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could have had only a few lines and the rest could be said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. <br /> <br /> A sword could handle her scene with a trained woodpecker. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
