The Great War breaks out and Dad is a brave pilot who goes out to run an unsightly business to put Jerry in his place. Mommy does her bit as a nurse, so the five children are evacuated to their barmy uncle in the country, where a secret passage takes them to an unashamed sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure. <br /> <br /> Based on a book written the best of a century ago, they no longer make such stories. And there's a reason. The men fly planes and author books; the women change mortgages and clean house. The boys lead the way with their compasses and nightplanes; the girls do what they are told and play violin - bad. Fat children carrying species are nasty. All the children speak in the clipped, vowel-flattering accents that are sweet and primitive, but which cultivate a certain class of English people. On top of the snobbery and desire for Imperial Albion, there are plot holes that a five-year-old won't tolerate. I mean it literally - my son asked why the father had disappeared before sunset, why the compass didn't just fall out of his hand when he disappeared. At least, the film tries to strive for the kids, until a completely inappropriate and unsuitable monologue by Eddie Izzard (who wastes a real comic talent) plays the final credits. <br /> <br /> No doubt, the five percent of British schoolchildren going to affordable public schools in the UK will get it all a bit. For the other 95 percent of British families who no longer live in the 19th century, the good news is Wall-E, Ratatouille and Wallace and Gromit are all on DVD.
