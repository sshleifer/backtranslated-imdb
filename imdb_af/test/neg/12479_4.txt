There are some horror directors for whom I have built up so much respect and admiration over the years that they may not be disappointed, matter what waste to decide to put on film. Lucio Fulci is certainly one of them, but damned, he tries to disappoint me with his later efforts! You can easily afford to hit most movies directed or produced by Fulci in the late 80's and instead look at "Cat in the Brain" because that one title collects and repeats the best and absolute cutest footage of no less not as SEVEN other Fulci flicks, including the sickest killings in "When Alice Broke the Mirror". As a whole, this movie is definitely among our directors worst and most meaningful achievements. The writing is incoherent as hell, the basic point of departure is totally unrelenting and somewhat stupid and there is absolutely no tension to enjoy. I love the title, but it's actually meaningless. There is a character called Alice in the story, but it's just a supporting role and she definitely doesn't break any mirrors. I suppose she can just break things by using her voice, because she's an opera singer, but she doesn't. The plot turns on a middle-aged and gambling addicted playboy who spends his days deceiving rich widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson beats the ladies (as well as unwelcome witnesses) in horrible ways, making steaks from their finest body parts and feeding the reminders to his cat. There is also a silly psychological subplot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. The difference between "When Alice Broke the Mirror" and some of Fulci's biggest horror movies ("The Beyond", "City of the Living Dead", "?") Lie in the fact that he is not really bothering about a horrible Die characters, including Lester, are colorless and boring and the murders are usually portrayed, as it is the most common thing to put a woman's head in a microwave or run repeatedly over a human body with a car . The lighting is poor, the cinematography is super ugly, the editing clumsy and amateurish, and the scene performances are really miserable. If I didn't know better, I would think Lucio deliberately made a lousy film to protest against all the hard critics who didn't like his repertoire, no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it. The obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore and bloodshed, because even the attempt to mix in black comedy does not work properly. swing around his chain saw and cut off women's feet, "When Alice Broke the Mirror" is an indifferent piece of horror entertainment, but otherwise, not much is recommended.
