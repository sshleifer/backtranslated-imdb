After watching this movie, I didn't want my money back. I wanted my time back. I wanted to get back in my life that half and a half - it was the most wonderful, miserable torture to know that I had wasted precious minutes of my life on this drunk. I'm afraid of life, and since this "movie" came into my life, I had trouble sleeping. I'm trying to suppress the memories, I'm really. . . but they let me burn things. <br /> <br />
