What a waste of talent - although Crudup appears to be much more like the vague, self-absorbed, characterless character he portrays in this disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> In art, sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content. What this film reveals is the unconsciousness and contradictory / uncompromising, unresolved impulses / awareness of the film's director / writer. It constantly shows the lack of awareness that a truly developed, deeply conscious character must be and be tormented to earn obedient empathy or sympathy OR whose use is used to serve as a warning story to the audience. But this movie fails at any level in that respect. <br /> <br /> The fact that Cal, the main character (many an ANTagonist, not a protagonist in the true sense of the word), has no empathy for anyone, especially those who earn the most (that do not join him) and that he has such a residual, just, self-pitying, sympathy only for himself, combined with the characteristic lack of repentance and no sense of guilt or awareness of his impact on others - all come together in this film to make him the epitome of the self-involved, development-arrested narcissistic sociopath - somehow it is the gold standard for men on film and in the world at this time. <br /> <br /> One of his contrasts (James LeGros) says with a laser-real flash: "I bet you didn't do one good thing in life - and I bet you won't" . It captures the absolute essence of the Cal character. Something that the other characters he left in the movie looks pretty fast, despite the fact that the director walked the deck to manipulate Cal for sympathy. This is proof of the talent and skills of the supporting role. <br /> <br /> Cal's ultimate "return" has nothing to do with character development, transformation or consciousness evolution. It is only about the eventual capitulation that up to and including something better, he can also be back in his comfortable, comfortable status quo of justice where life is easy and no one will claim to grow up - something he is intentionally incompetent and unimportant to do so. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been to show the fall and the tragedies - the devastating effects of this lack of conscience / consciousness, but it is apologetic and it glorifies it instead - it flows into self-pity right along with the arrogant, selfish, emotional, handicapped main character. <br /> <br /> (and it certainly sent the cold chills on my spine when I thought of the recent revelations about convicted killer Scott Peterson). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Crudup on its nuances and full of exciting potential that has never really been realized, the underrated see Inventing the Abbots. ...
