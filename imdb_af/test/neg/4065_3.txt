I saw three other movies that are worse than this one, "Plan 9 from Outerspace", "Side Hackers" and the dreaded "Blair Witch Project". There are so many technical flaws in this movie that, regardless of a decent plot, the movie is just not credible. <br /> <br /> Let's start with an AMTRAK train without skirts or handrails between cars. The killer runs out of his victim when she drives from car to car and just pushes her off the train. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a killer sneaks into a woman's apartment. He wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her, so what does he do? He turns on her stereo! If I heard my stereo suddenly getting louder, I would worry. He killed the women by throwing an electric curl into the bath. I was amazed to see that an electric curler with a five-foot cord can be twisted and plugged. Plus the apartment looks modern enough to have bathroom faults and the victim is still exploding. <br /> <br /> The Boeing 747 is one of the best known commercial aircraft on the planet, so this part really surprised me. First, the cabin was not even close to a 747 right and the second was not on the top deck of the plane. I watched with great amazement as the pilot and co-pilot (where was the flight engineer?) Walked right over the spiral staircase and looked forward to the nose of the plane. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised that bullets would not penetrate an aluminum car (good thing for our hero) or bathroom doors, but would enter the ceiling and cause a fuel leak caused by a small hole in the hull. move. Huh? Looking at three guys, extending a 100 meter runway in less than a week, was also great. <br /> <br /> I didn't watch, was it a movie of the week or something? It was awful.
