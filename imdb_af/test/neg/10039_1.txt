I don't understand why people are praising this movie. I didn't like it at all. I see it with several people. Neither of them did it either. First. It's simply that another low-budget studio is trying to enter a big name story. The real filming looks like a live TV interview. The makeup is bad. If you watch the movie with the DVD extras. You will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and sketches added to it. I read several books and watched several shows on this story. What I have always caught on all the material about this is that it was a serious horror story. I really wish someone could really do a good movie on this one. It always fascinated me. The bad scene really ruined the story. The little boys situation really hammered it even more. If you watch this movie. The little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh. It doesn't make sense why his brothers laughed at what had happened to him. It was as if the witch had to be so threatened, but it was OK to throw her baby brother. This is a great story with him and his little problem. I can't come over the girl yet and say, "Mom said tobacco would ruin your teeth." Frank Fox's statement and facial expression are so bad. The scene in the garden with him to get food is quite stupid. The sound of parts of it is evident from the film psycho. Also, The girl hanging over the bed and her little "blowing problem" is from The Exorcist. This film lacks the talent of creativity. We took the film for a few minutes and knew immediately it was a bummer. I also noticed that they were mistakes in film quality. Parts of it look like a person can film on a home video. I noticed that many people in the credits had much more work. This is probably how this movie is composed. Someone said I liked this story. I'll get all my friends and make a movie with a video camera and a computer. No matter whether we know how to act. As long as we get it on film and say it's good. We prepared the family and food together. Then sit down and watch this failed attempt to make a movie.
