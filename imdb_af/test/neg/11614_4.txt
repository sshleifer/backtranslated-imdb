After an intriguing start, this little drama quickly falls into the ranks of pure mediocrity. The start of the movie sees two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meeting each other while waiting for their boyfriends to come home from their holidays. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a lovely actress, and she plays Louise; a cute girl whose beloved boyfriend is an everyday entertainer; music, movies you call it, he does it. While telling the other girl, Carla (Heather Graham) is all about her wonderful boyfriend, it soon becomes clear that the similarities between their two male friends are too much .... and it is clear that the two girls are the same man. Oh Dear. Type Robert Downey Jnr, the sleaze bag that has two girlfriends, while a poor guy has to go somewhere without one. Downey plays the kind of man the ladies like, but men are horribly annoying; He's basically a mummy's son. The worst kind too; on the phone of the phone that has been calling all the time, with his girlfriends constantly ambitious (albeit empty) promises, etc. It's enough to make a normal man sick. <br /> <br /> The movie is aware of better triangular love triangle movies like Jules et Jim. However, this film does not work; mostly due to the fact that his story is so incredible. Seriously, if two women only found that they were the same guy, they didn't stand to talk about it. Another reason it falls is that it is just as turgid. There is no end to possibilities for the outcome of the situation this movie offers, especially with the claustrophobia to put it all in a small apartment; but all the film is lost in the mass of the dialogue; poorly written and poorly delivered dialogue, that is. The film is also being massively transferred; It's just not credible that people will act as they do in this movie after they find themselves in this situation. Robert Downey Jnr is one of the many things wasted in the movie. With Natural Born Killers, he has proven brilliant entertaining performances, and this is something this movie can do. The two females are not wasted because no one expected them, but Downey could certainly be better utilized. Overall? Wasting time. Don't bother, see Jules et Jim or Natural Born Killers. That's my advice.
