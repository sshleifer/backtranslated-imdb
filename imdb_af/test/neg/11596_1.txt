So, Wynorski recovers the curse of the Komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of stupid environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a Cobra. Most of the movies are spent listening to the self-righteous characters, about the evil capitalist pigs, while complicated between this cavalcade of condescension, which has come back to what happened on the island before they arrived. DNA experiments were performed, people started talking to each other, but people talked to each other without coming down as morally superior jerks, etc. It would of course be a much better movie if they made the flashes movie and forgot about the saint cheaper. Let me forget, there are a few short scenes scattered here and there, where the more sacred than you have chosen one, but it probably makes up less than 2% of the movie. The main event that keeps our title characters together is about one minute and is so exciting to watch the latest Dino-Crisis video games. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty bad overall, even for this kind of movie. Half of the actors look like they are more concerned about expressing every last syllable of each word than speaking their dialogue in any credible way. <br /> <br /> I actually made it to the end, but it's one of those movies I wish I'd recorded and then watched later, because there are lots of things to pass quickly. Overall, I give this effort one star, it has absolutely none of the elements that make a B movie fun to watch. It is a sad day if you can say with sincerity that the makers of this movie could learn a thing or two about Boa vs. Python to watch.
