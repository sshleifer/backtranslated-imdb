I recently had the idea of ​​making a short movie with a man hit by a car and waking up and thinking he was Chuck Norris himself. This meant I had to do extensive Chuck research and find out as much as possible of the man. I later find that he is not actually a man, but sent an angel from heaven. With such a face, who can ever doubt it? I watched more Chuck Norris movies than anybody over the past four months. I'm proud to say that Bells of Innocence is pretty close to the top of the worst list. I wondered most of the movie if I could send my copy back to the local Wal-Mart without the receipt I was biting to devour me from my own tongue. The biggest reason I chose to buy this movie was that it didn't just have Chuck in it, but his son Mike. I was anxious to see if Mike was a chip from the old, non-day-out-of-a-law paper-bag block. I have come to the conclusion long ago; The Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in the film history for one simple reason. The only character he ever plays is himself, Chuck Norris. No matter what movie, no matter what situation he is always Chuck Norris. The one thing he likes about his son is that he is consistent. Mike doesn't look like human emotions work. In the scene where he talks to the girl about his dead daughter, he looks very happy! Maybe it's because he actually pushed his daughter into traffic, as depicted in one of the strangest flashbacks of all time. His behavior confused me through the movie, and it made me very difficult to focus on what little plot there was. The other two protagonists were just as painful to watch as Norris's son. The man who constantly wants to eat or tell about a stupid peacock joke was just one of the most annoying characters that the Direct-to-Video screen ever won. The only thing I remember being in the movie was the episode of Walker Texas Ranger, in which he played an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck is guilty of this man. The other guy, who is the only name I can think of, because he was so forgetful, was your average Christian fanatic. I have nothing against Christians, in fact I am one, but this man was just too much for me. To finish off the story, you have a lot of townspeople who like to call people's "friend" and some villains who can't decide which one is in control. Not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in movies. All in all, the movie may be one of the greatest failures of all time, at more levels than Chuck Norris, people's asses can kick. Despite being one of the worst actors of all time, I still can't get enough of Chuck. Maybe he's really sent out of heaven ...
