I think I can see why critics give this movie two out of five stars, it's not fantastic, but I think it's a look, from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by Box, Night at the Museum). Basically, 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm in Middle Frankie Muniz) is often to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he does not do his creative writing, he will fail his entire semester and must repeat the grade during the summer. So he completes his job, but he gets a lift from Hollywood manufacturer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) who is heading to school. He can leave his paper with the story "Big Fat Liar" in the car. He finds out a movie cart that Marty stole his paper and makes it into a big movie. He and his best friend, Kaylee (She's the Amanda Bynes), are on a mission to prove that Jason once told the truth. Of course, Marty is too sullen and ready to call Jason's father, Harry (Michael Bryan French), and he burns the "Big Fat Liar" paper. So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as clear as possible until he agrees to call Jason's father. They put blue color in his pool, and orange hair color in his shampoo, and many more naughty pranks create chaos for Marty's career. There is the obvious point when Jason seems to want to give up, but don't worry. All the characters Marty despises, help in the final operation, and come with Jason's parents, eventually he wants to prove his truth. He gives great style. Also with Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson, Sandra Oos as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie's John Cho as Dustin 'Dusty' Wong. . Muniz is welcome, Byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support, and even if he wastes his time and talent a little, Giamatti is great to be dirty. It's a children's movie, so if it looks corny, cheesy or predictable, keep that in mind, and try to enjoy the shows and slapstick. Okay!
