Punctuation means. This low budget action / horror vehicle for Don Wilson's ability to kick things off is the things that are made directly to video. <br /> <br /> The plot: Wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law enforcement after being forced to slaughter night creatures in the light of the public. The police are chasing him, vampires are chasing him, he is responding by kicking a lot. <br /> <br /> There's a bit more to the story, but it's so unimportant that I can't honestly remember it; I think people have actually talked to the movie, but are going to debate it. The plot is nothing but a set-up for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in running time, usually by kicking them. <br /> <br /> The technical specifications are in a word anemic. Small color treatment, amateurish use of lighting, simple use of camera and angle. Blood and gore are noticeably limited, foreign to this type of film. The most damaging of the filming is the frightening shift to every combat scene. If the camera starts to jump like a giant monkey on speed, then you know Don is starting to kick everything in sight. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the kind of bad movie that can be made. good with some friends and very cynical humor. Otherwise, do not look unless you really want to see how things are kicked. <br /> <br /> 3/10
