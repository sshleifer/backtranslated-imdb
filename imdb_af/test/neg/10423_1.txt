I saw this movie in the movie. I was at the class at the Second City Chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. It's a Woodward movie about one of the second city's native boys. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew about John's history. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that the lore did not make up for being especially for women in improv or comedy. <br /> <br /> But hey. The man led his life and he loved the people who were in his world intensively. And Lore also says he treated his good friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Good. Forget the idea of ​​poor Michael Chilklis (who is a very good actor) in an incredibly bad movie, and really just seduced to make a personification of the man. <br /> <br /> Forget about the idea that they couldn't get the rights to any of Belushi's work ... and all the SNL scenes never happened to them in the movie. <br /> <br /> Screw the idea that half of the historical information in the movie doesn't even follow Bob. Woodward works. Kinda says, "Okay ... we're going to fall over with Belushi ... Now we can also go to Woodward ..." They also decided to take the premise of It's a wonderful life and change it. It's a terrible life on cracks. <br /> <br /> Is he a guardian or the devil? Is the flash bar machine the devil's assistant electronic device ... how many different ends can you close to a movie? It's one of those movies after it's over ... you look at the person you're with and go into the incredible unbelief: "What was hell?" In some circles this movie is a kind of classical cult. But for good reason. <br /> <br /> A good cult class, you sit around the screen and make fun of (or throw a nice linen) to the screen. A cult film is never good. And most people will never see them in any serious context. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some classic bad late-80s fair stoned? Rent Wired. If you want to know about John Belushi ... you can get more information from the walls of Second City Chicago as this movie.
