Even my five-year-old was bored. <br /> <br /> Very predictable, and overworked. This movie couldn't imagine whether it was a slap stick, or a little comment on the state of the "pee-wee" sport. <br /> <br /> Characters were underdeveloped, could have done more with the relationship between father and son both coming from an orphanage. <br /> <br /> Not referring to the goalkeeper who suffered the laxative from his teammates ... very common to a child's movie. <br /> <br /> Typical "Mafia" behavior was boring and stereotypical. <br /> <br /> The dog was so nice though!
