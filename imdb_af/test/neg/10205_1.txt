A thin, veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the movie goes non-struggling fan. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? Bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this film both produced, as Tiny Lester was the mother of all promotional blunder the summer. See the dictionary under Oops. If a card pays a member of the stupid kids of the world to see it in theaters and when I get out, I immediately go to H.A. - Hulkamaniacs Annoynimous. I'm proud to say I've been away from the Hulk for 17 years and have never had a craving. As it was used to bring in more fans to the juggernaut that was the WWE in Hogans, one has to wonder if there were no fans like me who had changed to other past times, such as huffing gas or Russian Roulette.
