I usually love teen / high school genre movie, but this movie really lacks originality. The only assumption that this film has made is that four friends cheat their way through high school and the tension they put on their friendship. There's just not enough depth in the story or the characters to pay attention to the full length of the movie. The play is not that bad, although the actors don't really work much to work with, as the dialogue is tripe and clich√© ... After watching this movie, one has to wonder how a producer on the earth " a project like this and think, "I MUST make this movie." No wonder this can't get a theater release. Andrew Gurland is a hack, avoid or burn.
