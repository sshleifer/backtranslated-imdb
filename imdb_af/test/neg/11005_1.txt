I went into this movie with an open mind. I was too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie, and my friend returned with it. I promised him I would not laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes I told him I would have to take my pledge back. We kept looking, but hoped it would get better, but no; A sustained rape was followed. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was probably one of the worst ever devoted to film, and definitely earned a place on the IMDb Bottom 100. I really don't know how it spread. The lighting was poor. I performed better in elementary school play. There is really nothing positive to say about it.
