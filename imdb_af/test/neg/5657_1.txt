First of all I would like to say that I am a teenager, and it is all marketed to me, and I can safely say that iCarly is very poorly programmed, and the fact that it is accepted by both sexes is hampering me. It contains some of the worst attempts at comedy I've ever seen with mediocre acting. The supposed humor within the show is all based on the fact that someone's lines are again with poor sarcasm, poor sarcasm, bad one-liners, and you get the picture. I also have to mention that I'm still watching Spongebob, which I know will get a negative setback, but it's quality programming with a few honest funny moments in it, less we forget something that ICarly misses; WHITE. The show is about a young girl, Carly, who makes a web show with her friends, which I can say is without a doubt a more beautiful version of the internet. It's good, but the show is just ... well, not funny at all, as said before. If that's what children's programming came to this day, parents, show them something that's really funny; Spongebob or Rocco's Modern Life would work. <br /> <br /> Compared to his brother-in-law, Drake & Josh, it's terrible, which is implied. Look seriously at something worthwhile. Even for a children's program it is poor.
