The Motion Picture Association of America has seen fit to advise potential viewers. It is especially useful for parents and guardians that this film, entitled "Frostbite", is an "R" rating. The "R" rating has specific information that allows anyone who knows nothing about a movie to know something about what this movie provides. The "R" is set for sexual content, including nudity and perverse dialogue, language, sense of humor and drug use. There is no reward in reading such a movie although it would be helpful to know if it could be removed as a possibility, I will remove such a possibility as this reviewer. This is a movie where only 1 was not equal to a number, since it is not a movie to be counted, in fact, as this purpose is with this movie, such a purpose should be be. This is an unusual and unwanted offer that should be a much stricter interpretation, because at no point is behavior or language suitable for viewing and this kind of movie may prefer a blacklist rather than a more stringent definition of its content . It is suggested here that the tighter definition will allow it, it is a criminal charge. It may be any way unparalleled from its rating. It is an unashamed world that will damage any person who considers this film if its purpose is to commit an offense. This is an offense and it is offensive in its purpose. There is no sense of humor in the film, but a depraved and careless purpose with its unwanted substructure. With the exception of the discussion, it is not a list and it may not be necessary to tell any adult who is considering it, but whose interests do not allow the children to grow up. Also don't give a young person the performance of this movie. It's unfriendly. Sometimes the wrong message often sends out when this type of public domain problem is, don't let it be one of those times.
