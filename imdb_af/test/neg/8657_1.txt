Yash Raj movies are so funny, how do they work, but they are called the best production house? <br /> <br /> See Bhatt movies work they have copied the formula, bikini and everything, plus low actors like Uday and Tanishaa </ br> <br /> The movie is so terrible it makes you. <br /> <br /> The jokes are so bad and horny, it slaps you. Uday looks like a gay and a monkey. <br /> <br /> Tanishaa looks like an idiot <br /> <br /> The director thinks we're all idiots. Arjun Sablok takes the audience for granted. Music is preserving favor. Camera work is good. <br /> <br /> Uday Chopra blows like an idiot Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g if Kajol was annoying, then Tanishaa is worse, the rest is good
