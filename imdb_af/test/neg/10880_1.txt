Don't look at this movie under any circumstances. It is terrible for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> No plot No structure No direction No acting talk of No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In a word - no <br /> <br /> The best thing about this is the box and the fact that it eventually ends. Who would have thought that 85 minutes could feel that long. <br /> <br /> Again: Don't watch this movie. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> No plot No structure No direction No acting talk of No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In a word - no. <br /> <br /> Best thing about it, the box and the fact that it eventually ends. Who would have thought that 85 minutes could feel that long.
