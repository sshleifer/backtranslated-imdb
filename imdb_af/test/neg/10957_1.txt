Unreal !!!!!!!! After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers, I was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38, all evaluated this film a 10. Compared to other big movies, these reviewers felt that the Quick and Undead had a better movie than, The 6th Sense (8.2), Private Ryan (8.4), Lord of the Rings (8.7), Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8.1) and Dawn of the Dead (7.8) to name a few. Hopefully, these shills will use their next discounted checkout procedure, as it is quite obvious that these reviews are forged. <br /> <br /> I believe that this movie contains a unique concept in the genre. of Zombie movie. Unfortunately, it is clear that these reviews were generated by people who were either involved in the production or had a keen interest in the films' marketability / financial success. Nothing cements it in my mind more than hearing that part of this movie was shot in Texas, was coincidentally due to the early placement of the film whose movie is. The Zombie movie / Horror B movie culture on a whole is a forgiving group, but this movie is unfortunately over any salvation. The characters are recovered, and the plot is poor. The movie quality wasn't bad enough to name a video camera, and at least they used a movie quality camera. The play is horrible, the star unsuccessfully trying to get out if a Clint Eastwood wants clones. Christ on a bike !!!!!! Even the main actor's name is Clint. He was just terrible. The only deal with Clint Eastwood is that the head of the "wood" of Eastwood's name is used in his appearances. The Zombie makeup was above Halloween party quality, but didn't fully apply to the full-fledged members. Application of zombies was not made on their hands. The plot was so great that I had my hopes of a power failure, a gap on the DVD disc, or that the zombies would draw their attention to the director. Maybe the movie is worth watching for some viewers, but not for my hard-earned dollar. Luckily I used my free rental voucher to watch this DVD. Perhaps this movie will be saved by Nott Entertainment (appropriate name) who releases a special collector's DVD, which will fix loose errors and deliver the promised goods? Some how, I think, NOT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! Let's just hope their next version, The Flesh Keeper, is really a "guard" of a movie. And not a 5th generation recycled version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Fingers cross people here ... but only if you care.
