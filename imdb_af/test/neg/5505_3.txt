Generally, I am an admirer of Jess Franco's film production, but for some of these movies I really struggle to understand the motivation behind them or even their reason of existence. Like this sick puppy, for example. "Sadomania" has absolutely no film value, it is poorly made without any plot and contains some of the most uncomfortable sleaze footage ever captured on film. It's another filthy women-in-prison movie where rape, lesbian action and violent torture are daily routine. The guards are harder than the prisoners and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets sexually raised when he sees a girl with a dog (!). The girls are all pretty and naked throughout the film, but you can't really enjoy this view with all the perversion going on. The dubious highlights include a barbaric hunting game (you can guess what he prey on), a duel-to-death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl with a needle already through her nipple injected. Auch! Avoid this sick mess and you will save yourself the trouble of taking TWO baths to wash away the dirt.
