Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbeau) is a real estate agent that puts her at risk of killing a tangled maniac that kills people in her profession, which he believes are making house prices too high. As motives go, it's pretty damned. Lisa's boyfriend is a talk show host who calls on the murderer. Initially I was positive. It was supposed to be a comedy or satire of one kind or another, but when the endless minutes twisted together, I realized that it was not and the film was just inappropriate, shape and form in every way. I'm just surprised that something this isn't terribly directed by Jeff Lieberman (yes, email me again hate mail, Jeff you hack) Anyway, back to the movie, poor, poor Barbeau, you can know exactly when her film career fell into flames and it all started here. <br /> <br /> My Degree: F <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: The Movie Channel
