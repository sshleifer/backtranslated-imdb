Why did they release this movie to us? They seem to be looking to make this movie a total hit in the face for Anne Rice and every self-respecting Vampire Chronicles fan. It ignores the groundwork laid down by Maintenance with the Vampire, mutilating the plot of the novel and Stuart Townsend stumbling to drunk. <br /> <br /> Stuart is NOT our Lestat! Our brat prince, our adventurous rebel with the damneste sense of humor. Stuart IS a second course, boring secretion from Dracula in black leather. He didn't read the books or knew the character ... is he illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and still has made a point to read the books and to know and love Lestat. <br /> <br /> Don't bear yourself, it's not a "Stand Alone" vampire movie, it's simple and easy.
