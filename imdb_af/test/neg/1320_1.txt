As bad as they get. This movie does not link the fatal error to the viewer to see what happens to characters. The two women in this movie are so stupid that you start rooting for the bad guys so this thing will end. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few that was so bad that I had to turn to another channel. <br /> <br /> In high language, this movie is missing verisimilitude. People, not even people from Ohio, simply don't do that. Well, maybe the authors do. <br /> <br /> There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie bearable. <br /> <br /> F903
