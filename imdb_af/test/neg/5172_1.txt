Oh, dear, just what we need to try another Essex-Kockney garbage the rise of the British footy hooligan / rave gangster who obviously follows West 'am (East Londan / Essex style). Didn't anyone tell you they won the world cap? And then of course the inevitable decline in the British rave culture underworld. Blah blah blah. Why, how and who wants to afford a movie like this, I don't know, but let's pray that it was from Private Finance. (Let's see that drug dealers, merchants bankers all know what to call them, and the rest of the mockery) rather than publicly funded means. Hopefully we won't see such things again with the recession. If we do, we will call the death watch for British films and of course we will all be able to blame Britain's number one Mockney Country gent wannabe gangster Guy Ritchie.
