I get the impression that I watched another movie for the majority of other people I know who saw this movie. It's not really that I found the movie offensive or anything - just that the script was incredibly amateurish for a movie that apparently had some money for it. I highly respected Paul Haggis's work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was extremely disappointed to see how bad this writing was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of Traffic, but I don't think the traffic was really a movie that ripped off in the first place. <br /> <br /> The worst feature of this movie is the way it skameless rinses its audience. Do Haggisreally find that we are so stupid to need a shot of the spaces? Should it probably see the phonebook on Farhad's dashboard, with the black-text circle address? Can't we be left to make ourselves into logic for ourselves? <br /> <br /> I also had a big problem with the "nasal" dialogue. I heard that one critic says that the quality of the dialogue is misleadingly high, because although people cannot speak in this way, they certainly think so. This is irrelevant. It is the task of a script such as this to use dialogue in a way that contributes to the characterization and credibility of the (in this case, highly indescribable) situations being set up. These characters all speak with the same voice and all they ever speak is racism. <br /> <br /> The purpose of a movie like this must surely be to promote the fact that race should not really be a problem in these situations, but only by making it the focus of each scene. doesn't it become native racist itself? Characters run around spitting their philosophies and conveniently memorized race relations statistics as if they are repeating the excerpts from the research essay they just wrote. It is completely unconvincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> A movie should reveal its meaning gradually, not slamming it in the face with it and never let it go. I can see that Haggis's intentions with this film were honorable, but I dare suggest that he could not identify his own writing and thus overcome his mistakes. I really hope writers / directors will be very careful in the future when approaching this 'mosaic' style of narration. It's done quite a few times, but the balance between personal and political law is very difficult. And Robert Altman won't be in that department.
