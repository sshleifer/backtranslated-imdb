Beloved story of hero "Benji" ("Higgins" the dog) who are many different things to many different people. In his busy day, "Benji" grabs breakfast at the home of two young children, chats with a knowing officer, chases an old woman's cat and reminds an outdated cafe owner to start the day's special start. Helping some, entertaining others, he is companion to everyone. <br /> <br /> Problems arise when kidnapping young friends and bringing them to the deserted home that he calls home. From here we know that only "Benji" can save the day. <br /> <br /> Plot is routine of writer / producer / director Joe Camp, and he tends to do the slow motion effects. However, audiences will find it hard to resist the lovely little pooch, and children of all ages will surely worship him. Cast will never be anything but a background for "Benji". <br /> <br /> Not what you want to inspire, but fun family money. Academy Award for Benji's Theme, "I Feel Love". <br /> <br /> Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
