I've watched many TV over the years. So much, when I start with new shows that look like revival of old shows, I'm insulted. Fortunately, I'm not too sensitive, because all the "Hot Properties" are doing to update the cast (which means they are "sexist") of "Women's Design" and drop it in New York City instead of Georgia. <br /> <br /> The jokes are more TV-14-ish, but it doesn't make the show better. The only thing that proved this show is that Nicole Sullivan is so good that she could make a show like 'My Mother the Car' a classic. Her comic talents remind one of a modern Lucille Ball - just funny. Unfortunately, the rest of the slip is flashy and sexy which may be good for some brainless soap, but they are just not funny. <br /> <br /> Peace
