Wow, I just looked at one of them. <br /> <br /> How CRAPPY post production is on this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't have you, I could literally have done better work myself. <br /> <br /> ALL post production is wrong, everything. Those who cut the film should be banned from the film industry. <br /> <br /> It was a train track. absolute rubish. <br /> <br /> Not to mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy the Pirate in Spongebob accents. WTF is his character there? But for me, the biggest mistake of all was character development, interaction, dynamics, dialogue. WOW. I can't believe how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 2 out of 10. 1 for Samantha, a great actress, is the production made bad, everyone looks like amateurs out there. /> <br /> The other one goes to cinematography, which was indeed good. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is my friend, this is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I don't even feel like making an extensive message about this, it was just awful production. Poor actors, didn't know what they were coming in ...
