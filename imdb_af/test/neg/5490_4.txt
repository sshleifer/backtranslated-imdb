This film is based on a very well-known foundation - the confusion of art and reality in the lives of actors. It has nothing specific novel or interesting to say about this topic and is actually tough. The final scene in particular is undeniably annoying. To see the audience cry at the "moving" play they see on the screen, asked me, "Who do they think is joking?" <br /> <br /> However, there are some good performances and interesting scenes, especially of some of the minor characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor. He gets a whole series of policemen who complain about his performance if they arrest him. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken is playing a top wacko again. Remember his character "The Continental" on Saturday Night Live; an aging Eurotrash satire that chases a young woman around the furniture and tries to get her into bed? He does an identical turn in the movie, chases his young man in an antique table and bumps him with champagne. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was mesmerizing and annoying, but mostly annoying.
