Five guys who were in the cubs came together for years to camp. Were they running in their childhood nemeses as well as escaped prisoners in this highly unpredictable supposed comedy. Most of the movies are happy to call it simply, and don't really care about the movie. The authors were so lazy that the names of the characters were for the most part the names of the actors they played respectively. Richard Lewis's shtick gets really old, VERY fast. Even the late great character actor, Brion James, can't save this stinker. (Though he is one of the few actors in the film who does not make him totally embarrassed), I barely cracked a smile, anything that would reasonably even befall a laugh. Terrible. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
