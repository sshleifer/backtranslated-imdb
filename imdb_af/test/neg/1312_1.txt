This awful attempt is just about showing what happens when you not only use computers to generate the effects, but also to invent the plot and write the script. Someone apparently faced a new piece of software asking a few questions, then four hours of detached cliches, lousy dialogue and a collection of stock characters that you eventually drowned in the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtney won the prize for the worst performance. Saying that he was wood would be an insult to trees. It's hard to blame Robert Carlyle in almost everything he does, but the chance is even stacked against him, especially because he was inexplicably required to accept a white London accent. <br /> <br /> A full wash.
