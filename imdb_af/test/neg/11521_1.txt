Poorly acted, poorly written and poorly directed. Special effects are cheap. Best performance is by Yvette Napir, but it doesn't say much. Story is a confusing mess about corporate greed that leads to sabotage of a space station and an attempt to save those stranded on board. <br /> <br /> There is little tension and even less action. There is one car hunt that is not bad, but the rest of the movie is just a waste of everyone's time.
