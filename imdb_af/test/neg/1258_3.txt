For the most part, "Michael" is a disaster ?? ten minutes of charm and ninety's wrong steps. <br /> <br /> Travolta and MacDowell are doing their best, often higher than Nora Ephron's numbingly banal script. But the movie moves like a snail. And even within his fantasy context, the characters act indecently on a regular basis. (Reporters who often leave the story of a lifetime? An apparent angel living on earth?)? Someone forgot to tell romantic comedy Maestro Ephron that William Hurt, brilliantly in so many other films, is not Tom Hanks. The movie's "climax" redefines the word designed. Efron can shoot here for Heaven, but unfortunately Michael is a long, long ride through the theater.
