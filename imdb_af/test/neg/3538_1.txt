The only reason I saw this movie was because it had Giovanni Ribisi and it had to be "Horror". Don't be fooled, this movie has to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. It's about those people who go to a secret place that has a "Monster" in it. The monster is a man with a deformed face who walks around in blue sweatpants that have a craving for the brain. Some people die, some people do not. Eventually they throw the monster off an airplane and then fly away happily. BUT NO NO! THE SAMPLE NEVER MAKES A PLAN! Go spend 2 hours another way to see how paint is dry on a wall, trust me, it's more entertaining than this crap.
