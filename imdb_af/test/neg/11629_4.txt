Let's get things straight. I was a Catholic, and in a very religious family, spending so much time in church and talking to priests at home. It was helpful for two things: to make a convict atheist out of me and to give me deep, informative knowledge of the church and its dogmas. And I say, if a Catholic priest testifies to a murder and clearly sees the face of the murderer, he can report it to the police, even if the murderer confessed to him. He can't reveal what he said in confession, but he can talk about anything he sees outside, and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. So, here we have a movie that is completely sustained on a lie. And another lie is there is no absence for murder. According to the Catholic Church, there is absolute for any sin as long as there is genuine repentance. So far, the biggest plot in this poor thriller is. <br /> <br /> As people often say, this movie would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates changed roles. Of course, Hoskins is capable of playing gangsters (I will never regret that he has lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niro's worst performances in The Untouchables) and Bates's features would have been perfect as the gray-haired priest past. But above this, I think the movie would have been much better, the real Ulster native Liam Neeson (then mostly unknown to big audiences) played Mickey Rourke's role. Not only is his face perfect for playing painful characters, but he does let us believe the character as real, something Rourke can't do. Back in the 80's, Rourke was not a bad actor (then he lost his talent with his appearance), but he was one of those artists, such as Brad Dourif, who is as good as the director with whom he works. And as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke's play comes more like a pimp. It was unfortunate to think that this movie was made only three to six years later (when Neeson achieved a moderately well-known status in 1990 with Sam Raimi's enjoyable Darkman and superstream in 1993 with the "Schindler's List", while Rourke pretty much Liam and Mickey could have swapped parts more (Rourke would have been effective in Docherty's supporting role, but couldn't bear this movie as a head), another missed opportunity, and another movie with the potential to Being a classic, immediately became a forgotten prize. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the often-criticized score (by underrated composer Bill Conti) worked for me, I didn't get too melodramatic, but It was good and neat and beautiful, which reminded me of Howard Shore's score for "The Silence of the Lambs." Here is Mike Hodges' talent, which made "Get Carter", yes, but don't forget that he too has the "Flash Gordon" is not ... <br /> <br /> It looks like the movie murdered in the cutting room (it shows, as some parts are very bumpy and confusing and others just don't stick) and a director's cut is waiting to see the light. OK, but I seriously doubt that it will make a good movie because we will still have the bad casting and the false point of departure there. 10/04.
