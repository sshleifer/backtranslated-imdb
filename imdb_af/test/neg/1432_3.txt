The other night I watched this movie on video and I found myself during this unspoiled snooze test. First, one of my biggest pets is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies. It's a THRILLER! get it right! It has no samples or anything supernatural. It's just a movie about a twisted serial killer (Actually, there's a very small body count, so it's more of a serial torture movie and it did me well to torture me.) The basic premise of a man who teenagers are luring home. Online horror horrors could have made a good movie, but we only saw a couple of teenage girls in the internet at the start of the film. One of these girls seems to be a local detective's daughter and becomes emotionally involved in the case. The movie quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sado-masochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse match between the incredible boring detective and psychopathic captain Howdy / Carleton Hendricks, played by author / producer / Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider is. The occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one-liners on the positive effects of Snider's pain and the like are laughing. If he tries to get people to draw on these views through this film, he fails miserably and (inadvertently) makes them light. The director of John Pieplow (whose only previous attempt was Jurassic Women, which I will speak for himself) was uninspired and there was something wrong with the editing that led to the movie having some unrelated scenes keep up the plot unless the screenplay is at fault (which is quite possible.) This movie is a totally unsuccessful attempt to create a thrill of a horror movie that is the only achievement that makes me close to the eyes of some graphic bodily piercings. If you see it at your video store, don't waste your money, but if you need something to laugh one night and be on Strangeland, you might as well look. 3 out of 10
