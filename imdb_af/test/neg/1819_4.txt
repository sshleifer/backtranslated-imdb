This film wants to be the kind of shocking, cerebral and intense movie that many others in his genre were successful, but it is not. It is at best confusing and absurd. When the bend and turn finally revealed themselves, rather than saying, "Oh, I got it!" I mumbled something according to the lines of "Well ... whatever." In my opinion, when a movie reveals a great plot turn, it should not use a backlash sequence to prove it has given some tips that would allow the viewer to discern the truth itself. But this movie does have a look back; And here's the kicker: it flashes back on screens that weren't even in the movie! <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotypical, impersonal and completely ridiculous. I feel that the "steamy" love shows between the romantic leaders are the most untitillating and unsexy I ever had in a movie that is not porn. It seems the director was shocking and kinky with the love stories, but they were just stupid. <br /> <br /> Don't even start with the crappy accent and second time. I think the movie was set in New Orleans, but apart from the aforementioned accents and a few mere city shots, the movie could have been in Anytown, USA. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: Don't bother!
