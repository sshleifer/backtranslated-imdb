This show is rushing, and has largely placed on surprise differences in advertising. (When it came back from commercial, the noise or surprise was as simple as a mouse). This is a pure rip-off of Ghost Hunters and it attempts to "go beyond" them, and fail fails. Also, what's with the directors log thing? Are these stars drawing? It just ruins the novelty of this show, which has turned quickly. The only reason it is looked at is that people want to laugh at their pure anti-climate. They get nothing and will probably never. Funnily enough, they always show something that is the thing they "hunt" and guess what? It's the local radio station's tower light that flashes red!
