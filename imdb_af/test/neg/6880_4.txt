I don't call it a good movie, but it may be a bad one. <br /> <br /> BUT there are at least 2 good reasons to watch this movie, these are the shows of AGNES BRUCKNER (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric), both of which deliver solid performances. <br /> <br /> They are much better than the rest of the bad role, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). <br /> <br /> BIJOU PHILIPS was excellent in the "suburban kids going to the hood" drama HAVOC, but here she is far from good on the edge to annoying. <br /> <br /> THE STORY is decent enough, though nothing special, BUT it would have been much better as it is in LOUSIANNA that one of the kids actually included a south-accent, but they didn't! ! <br /> <br /> Especially in a movie where "the monster" is bounded so deeply in the Lousianna folk lore, with voodoo and so it is just stupid not to include that accent in the characters. <br /> <br /> The only one w ho, it's rapper METHOD MAN, he plays Deputy Turner and puts a pretty good accent in his few scenes, and I mean if a rapper can do that, why should the "professional" actors don't the same? Mister Tical aka Meth is very pleasant in his very small role. Who knows the Ticallion Stallion will ever be a cop? Even if it's just on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a bit stupid, but pretty nice Slasher movie, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the rest of the young role, it really could have been. bad, fortunately it is good as usual. <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10, decent BUT there are hundreds of better slasher movies out there.
