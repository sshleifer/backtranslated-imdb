Let's start saying I didn't even remember this comedy. From the opening scene, our protagonist Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) shows that he is a self-absorbed, weak and neurotic loser who is totally incapable of dealing with the smallest responsibilities, such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word or form a coherent thought. I think we should be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and roll up the process of climbing his way out of a deep depression. I think we should be sympathetic if he stumbles through a series of misadventures that are apparently caused by his purchase of a dog, but actually argued by his own trivial nature. I didn't get the slightest hint at any time that Solo had ever had a redeeming character, which became alarmingly clear when he didn't feed his dog for a few days. No spark of humanity or conscience of conscience has given me hope that he will ever realize that his life is so miserable, because he is a self-absorbed, self-pitying life. I didn't develop a connection with this character. He didn't care, nor did he. I actually wanted him to get his knees at one point. <br /> <br /> The dog was not a character in the movie. It was merely a prop to be used, neglected, messed up, abused, sought after, and overhauled. So be warned. Although "dog" is the title, this movie is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. <br /> <br /> Scott Caan's role is amusing and credible as the well-known best friend. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I always want to see more of him on the screen. Mena Suvari was wonderfully repulsive. Lynn Collins's role of a "stripper with a heart" was well acted upon, but the character was simultaneously absurd and cleaved, not to mention zero chemistry between her and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romantic? Rare. Comedy? If you say so.
