This movie was so terrible I couldn't even describe it. I was surprised that I even put this heap of waste. I couldn't believe a movie like this was even thought. It was a serial killer slamming like a chicken. He doesn't just hit a few times, he knocks through the whole movie without stopping. He even flaps his arms like a chicken that is even stupid than I have ever seen. I couldn't believe it came out in 1990. I thought it came out early in the 80s or something. Then the daughter is not very clever, either because she protects the geek or man's chicken. The end just gets worse and is the worse end I've ever seen. This movie is just chicken s ** t. I laughed more than I was scared and I strongly suggest going out and getting a bucket of fried chicken instead of seeing this movie.
