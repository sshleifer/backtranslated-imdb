"Nero" as the title of the movie in Germany is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least attempted to show a more historical, accurate Nero than the amusing, but totally fictional Nero Peter Ustinov, Quo Vadis played. It is still a great failure. And for the IMDb commentators who still believe Sueton and Tacitus propaganda are true, please read a book about Nero published less than 20 years ago. Nero didn't burn Rome, it's proven! He didn't kill Britannicus. He did not torture, murder and mutilate pleasure, he was the first emperor to ban the gladiatorial fights. The movie still shows a lot of bugs, bugs, and has been made in a very inexpensive style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing. The palace looks like a villa, the city itself looks like a cheap set. The play was between good and sub-par, the music almost insignificant and the film soon deteriorated after Nero became emperor after a rushed, badly edited mess without any clear narrative structure. So there is the potential for an epic biography of Nero showing the true Nero, which was one of the best emperors ruled by Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.
