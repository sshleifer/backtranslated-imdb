Pretty, stereotyped, beautiful looking, the story loops in a wide and confusing arc, leading you a number of garden paths (without servants fairies), before you come to an end that feels like leaving - hollow. <br /> <br /> Going to a movie or ending up with a satisfying dip, it will be a disappointment. Despite the main character's ideological ears of sexuality, I felt he was ignorant, without a clear male person, rather than his lack of a clear French persona. Although lying close to the end of the film, nakedness (or rather baldness), the viewer is so oblivious to the character of motivation - that little thing called plot. Probably a stereotypical English-speaking point of view, at least if you take the side of the movie.
