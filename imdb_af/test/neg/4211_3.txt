I've always been a fan of Chuck Norris for what he has achieved and his movies. Because while I was meant to watch this movie, but for whatever reason, I had no chance. Apparently I didn't miss much. It must be one of Chuck's worst movies. The truck, Billy Dawes (Augenstein), gets the opportunity to deliver his service, but on the way he is overturned and forced into a dam city where a foolish, locally corrupted right wing (Murdock) who runs the entire town has arrested him. and false charges brought him. He denied the charges and made a run for it. The local hockey police beat him and he disappeared. But now his brother, JD John Dawes (Norris) is going to take another trucker to him. He soon finds the town running, buys the loser judge and his brother is nowhere to be found. Not long after that, he just started knocking over everyone in town. Meanwhile, the film's wife has called on local truck drivers on a CB radio, and they all come out in the village to destroy it. LOL with there big rigs. Eventually Norris finds his brother and strikes more thugs. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. It actually starts well and you feel good when Norris starts smashing some of this local corrupt police, as there are such losers. But there is virtually no story, the acting is bad, and the end? Well, it doesn't really have one. The judge pushed his house through a big rig and you never know what happened. Does he live? Norris never gets him down. In the meantime, Norris takes an evil cop at the end. Who cares? Norris also manages to pick up everyone in the village, broken his hand and shot in the side and continues to fight. Come on! This movie is apparently made cash on the Certification Body of the time, why there is one outside me. Their barley even uses the certification body in the movie. In addition, it seems that the movie moves near the end and you wonder why it's not over yet. This movie is bad, but if you are bored and need something to watch it, it will pass away. As far as Norris, he made much better movies than this. 3 out of 10.
