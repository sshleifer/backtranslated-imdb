Where to start with 'Speck' the true story of Richard Speck, a murderer of eight nurses in the 1960s. Director Keith Walley has worked on some of the extremely low-budget Full-Release movies (such as Birth Rite) and works here from a screenplay by (then) Full Moon-regular Don Adams. Unfortunately, while the movie looks like an accurate portrayal of the terrible crime, the writing isn't good, maybe because the real Speck's ramblings were not very interesting! Despite the care taken to make these authentic, it comes from a cheap entry from the well-known movie series killers of the same period (such as 'Ed Gein'). Filmed in a dirty brown, not quite sepia, and mostly told by star Doug Cole. The film fails to portray the horror of crime because the narrative is annoying, the color distracting from the story and the crime, though horrible and disturbing. to look at is simply that and there is no editorial work on what is almost a poor quality video camera that looks at the events. There is no investigation of the motivation or of Speck's life really, just a cheap shot against an abominable crime. Rendered by Full Moon there is little evidence of Full Moon's better output here, Charles Band ignores his own rule that his films contain fantasy murders (eg, pops, monsters, etc.) and don't quite know what to do with this new reality. Incidentally, Band introduced a special label for these films called 'Shadow Entertainment'. Band said he regretted the period of Full Moon output next to Tempe Entertainment (of which Creator J.R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven also talked a lot about Charles Band). The Tempe era features uniform Apple Mac editing and brutal hand-camera filming, much like a home movie. Speck retains these qualities and while Witchouse 3 has managed to use it well, Speck is just boring and rough.
