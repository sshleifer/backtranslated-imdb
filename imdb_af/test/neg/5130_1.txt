I just registered at IMDb.com so I could comment on this movie. My God, who was a steaming heap of horses, was it! It should not even be considered a real movie, it is very misleading. it is at best a 15-year-old movie project. The acting is terrible. But even good actors couldn't save it. The dialogue is probably the worst part of this movie. Who the hell wrote this crap? And that constant joke comes from the chubby lesbian about Kaye as a "girl in distress", old man, has really become fast. God, I'd rather take a camel in my ear, as if I see this shit again. Don't rent this movie. If they gave you the movie for free, don't watch it. break it with a hammer. Even if this video is destroyed, you lost your Hollywood video or a blocking video account, it would be worth it. it is an abomination. I think I said everything I could, without being superfluous. any questions .... email me.
