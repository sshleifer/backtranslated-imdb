I did research on Ed Gien, and I found some interesting things. Like the fact that Ed Gien was silent and a lonely, not a little bothered about the carriers as in this movie. I'll say I didn't finish this movie, but I will. I will cringe by the fact that we all, Wisconsinites, speak as we are of Kentucy. You know the funny, but oh so sad factor in this movie, Wisconsin isn't as hot as it did. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just an insult to Wisconsin people, it's itself a Wisdom site. but it is a complete insult to a man who seems to be a mad, lonely man. He killed two people and the movie couldn't get it right. Ed didn't get so close and personal and scared, he shot the two and only people, he killed. So, why do these movies say "BASED ON A VALUE STORY"? It is not based on anything, but the lies have arisen in his dirty head. <br /> <br /> A joke and nothing more! <br /> <br /> OK, I'd like to add to this. I finished this oh so sad movie, and I personally like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when making a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin) and oh there is no desert! As for hell, there were more pine trees and snow in Ravenous and it was supposed to be shot in Kaliforna. <br /> <br /> OK, for those who don't know Ed Gein, I want to give you, your history lesson. Ed Gein presumably killed his family, but it was never proven. He killed a barman, she was hit near the shot when no one was there. He took the DEAD bartender back to his house. 10 years later he shot the shop clerk, he put up the cash register and the shopping cart. He was caught because of this murder, he said the day before the day her son was there and asked about antifreeze. The day he killed her, he was buying it in the antifreeze, and the reception that had only antif ..... was the only proof that they had to start a global men's hunt. He robbed graves, actually robbing 56 graves. He hates the people he dug up and made furrows; lamp shades, sofas, chairs and other things. <br /> <br /> He had a family he at one time or another had eaten and they threw all the meat he had ever given them when he was caught as he was caught at their home. He was arrested and hid in the back of a policeman, fearing what might happen to him. How do I know all this? I read the book that tried to write him. <br /> <br /> After this movie was over, after seeing the whole horrible thing, I was not only offended by the director's terrible view of what Wisconsin women look like. I mean, it was hard to tell who this guy on the disk half had, because you know Wisconsin women are all BLONDS. Please! I was insulted by the lack of homework this man did and the poor work he did to make this movie. I have no idea who this Kane man is and I think he might be in something else, but he had an awful job playing Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> After all, I'm so sad I wasted the 3.99 on the movie. <br /> <br /> Movie afterwards was completely untrue, this movie is like I say the world is flat and George Washington was not our first president. Come on people, that's your history, and that's Wisconsin's history. To end this rant, how would you all feel if I made a movie and George Washington looks like Brad Pitt (some of you think it's good, but it won't be true) and he lived and wasn't the president and whatever. You can't rewrite history.
