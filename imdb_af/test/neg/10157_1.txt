There are lots of movies, mostly from the 80's, which are so terrible that you can't help but love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of those. I hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. I watched it many times and got a big laugh from it every time. This is the first example of how any films can be released in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Our killer name is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles is an escaped psychopathic killer walking in doctor's scrubs and a doctor's jacket hooks people off with a skull as he goes. He ends up with a home of girls who have a slumber party. One of the girls is the daughter of the doctor trying to work on Randle's, and Randle eventually hit him in some sexual position. (I'm just looking at the movie to know what I'm talking about.) Now I know what to think now: It must be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like Slumber Party Massacre, or Valentine's Day Massacre, right? NO! This movie is surprising! First, the quality of the movie changes from and to the whole movie. Sometimes it looks like it could be filmed this year, but other times it's so granular and vague that it's not even viewable. The funny thing is that some specific camera angles will be vague and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and proves they don't care at all. <br /> <br /> The director played the killer (as if it wasn't funny enough), but because he wasn't talented enough to act and register at the same time, he just one shot of him on the camera with his scum. then the clip repeated over and over every time someone is killed. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unlikely, and these people who are supposed to be 16-18 years old look more like they are 25-45. I know slasher movies usually use adults as teenagers, but I've never seen a movie where this was obvious. My guess is that the reason why none of them are still in the film industry is because they have all died from old age. Or maybe it was just because this movie was so terrible that they never wanted to show their faces again, and this is a good thing, because I have a lot of doubt that they could get more movies, even if they tried. All I can do is hope Tyler will one day make the last slum party part 2: The Final Conflict and return all the original actors. I'm sure everyone will love it. <br /> <br /> The movie was directed by Stephen Tyler, (No, not the singer), who never led directly, and released by B & S (which I'm sure stand for bull and ****) Productions. Bull & S released another movie, Forever Evil, but not as bad as Last Slumber Party. <br /> <br /> A horrible, horrible, horrible movie ... highly recommended.
