This movie misses the mark on most fronts. The accents are laughably weak, the acting amateur and the comedy are poor in the best. <br /> <br /> They had a good idea, it could have been especially enjoyable, but for the reasons mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The author seems to think by inserting the word f * ck into every sentence, making it more beautiful and the main character just seems a little too difficult. He's not a Brick-top. <br /> <br /> Next time you'll get at least a role that can keep the accent for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's a crime to compare it to movies like The Business, Lock Stock and Snatch.
