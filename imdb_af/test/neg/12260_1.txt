I don't understand why this movie was released. It looks like something you show your friends after borrowing your mother handycam she bought in 1987. I am Australian and work for a video store in the UK and thought that as an Aussie movie it is in our store, it can't be bad ... boy was I wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone writes a good comment about this movie, they lie or lie the creators of the movie. /> <br /> The picture was BAD, the sound was terrible and the acting, o acting, it was the WORST acting in the HISTORY OF FILM. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing and insulting that they used the word "Aussie" in the title because I am proud of Australia and this movie is seen in other countries and may give people the wrong idea. /> <br /> Everyone who reads this movie and watched this movie takes time to watch other Aussie movies, because you can choose any one and it will be better than the one. <br /> <br /> I could have made a better movie if I took a camera, filmed me, but for an hour the movie had eaten and waited to go through my body and then threw it on television came out ... no offense. <Br /> <br /> DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!
