It's hard to believe that a movie can be bad, but you live and learn. What is more surprising is the fact that the people who put this thing together probably had university education. Meanwhile, the fruit of their labor bears the appearance of something that a group of five eighth graders can emerge. On the bright side (if there is one), the soundtrack has some nice moments. It's another reason to question how the rest of the movie can be so bad.
