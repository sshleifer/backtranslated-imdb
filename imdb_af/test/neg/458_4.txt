After NIGHT MUST FALL's turning point, Robert Montgomery (for the most part) came in his best films and performances: HERE COMES JORDAN, they were released, the guy in the lake, riding the red horse, the saxon charm, june bride. Even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to still be viewable (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and government work. In 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance. He played a selfish movie star Collier Lang, who was dragged to help the authorities do an investigation into a young girl's boyfriend. Apparently, my view of this movie is a minority view. Most of the views are favorable. I thought it was a dull, silly script, with Ann Blyth's heroine group not very appealing as a character. She admires Montgomery as a star and it helps when he is called to help the authorities, but after a while I found there was no chemistry between them. The writing was also fun, although Montgomery and Roland Winters tried. The only thing I remember today as a joke is that Taylor Holmes is the rich father of Blyth and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dressed as Churchill, and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat, smoking a big cigar, and painting (Holmes's bald head in disguise). It was the most memorable joke in this movie - not much of a real memory. <br /> <br /> Early on, Montgomery won television and eventually won the attention and respect he always earned in movies. His last contact with the movies was his direction from THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, with his friend Jimmy Cagney. It's a much better movie than that. For his overall film and television career, I will give this mediocre movie a "4". It seems so generous to me.
