So, it's Friday night and you want to watch a movie. All you want is something entertaining, not too artificial, or something that can require a long night of philosophical discussions. So, you pay $ 10 to watch the Mod Squad. The trailer to this movie had to cut me off, but come on ... it's three of Hollywood's most beautiful people - eyeball. But it's about ... a series of moving Prada ads. And what did Hollywood producers forget? A plot. Why are these kids running around in the streets to an unknown enemy? Where are they? But, don't worry, after a while you'll just stop caring. I was about to leave this movie because I was thinking of sitting in my room and staring at the wall, it could have been more productive (and free), but by then it was over (90 minutes) - this does not save mercy). So, still willing to waste $ 10? Go, get yourself a nice hot meal.
