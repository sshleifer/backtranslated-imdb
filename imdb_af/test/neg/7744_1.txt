Kathy Ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of a Smurf. <br /> <br /> And the acting talent of a digger full of calcite. If you don't believe me, read it: "Alien van L.A." actually depends on her to act 9/10 throughout the movie! Sure, she ends up in a nice red bikini top and a sheath dress near the end, but it's too late (so to speak) too late. <br /> <br /> Think Ireland is playing the daughter of a famous scientist who falls in the middle of the earth to find him. Along the way she falls for a man named Charmin (yes, like the toilet paper - make your own jokes) and find out how "Mad Max" rejects life. Did you know that people living deep in the earth have eastern accent? It didn't. <br /> <br /> It's bad (after all, it was MST'd) and also a Golan Globus production, but at the same time Ireland is just getting lost, as she tries to find where the photographers are, she can instead, make a photo shoot. <br /> <br /> And I don't blame her. <br /> <br /> A star. And if you insist on watching it, do it with the sound turned off - save your thrombosis.
