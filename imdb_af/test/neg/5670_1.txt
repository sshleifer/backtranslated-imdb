I ... No words. No words can describe it. For the sake of the few brave people I will try to keep the knees in their toasters ... after watching this show. <br /> <br /> This ... Cosgrove person ... Her actions are like watching a female gorilla. dance on the nest of highly agitated insects. Maybe I'm exaggerating. However, I have a feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this show. <br /> <br /> The characters in this repulsive heap of raw sewage are just as useless as a small piece of space rock flying in the sun on any day of the week. Although heart attacks have not been experienced as they look foolish on the cheapest sets, I have no doubt that it will eventually happen. <br /> <br /> The main plot of this * belches hard in the faces of the actors * is that of a foolish girl recruiting a live weekly webcast on the creative title iCarly.com with her brainless friends, of which one has the equipment that the producers of this show are unlikely to afford. Her legal guardian is a kind of moron who believes her older brother is. <br /> <br /> I have not seen all this preview, fearing cancer development, or perhaps a cold, but some of the plot points The brother got stuck in a lift, the doorman of the apartment almost died and the world's fatest priest came for a visit. No, really. <br /> <br /> Avoid it if you are unborn or have a history of attending mysterious cults because of spiritual trauma. If you decide to watch it, laugh as the laughing track tells you, as it will drown the repetitive noise that you eventually drown in a coma if you listen too long. <br /> <br /> The display gets a one-off account because the IMDb has inexplicably not adopted the use of negative numbers.
