On the opposite side of the spectrum of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, David Hemmings's totally inferior adventure rescue of World War II aircraft is a valuable cargo. Bates includes beautiful New Zealand institutions, Brian May's energetic music score and a few dandy helicopter planes and jet boat hunters. The bad, however, is far above good. Donald Pleasence never hangs as before; Half of his dialogue is almost incomprehensible. George Peppard tried an Australian (I think) accent, passing it halfway through. Lesley Ann Warren is at her most annoying. Ken Wahl is, well, Ken Wahl. The dialogue is painful to hear and Hemmings's direction is largely inactive. The writing is not just obvious but terrible. Jokes fall flat, scenes don't bother and continuity is virtually non-existent. According to the final credits, two men were shot dead while making the film. What a waste.
