If possible, try to see all five of the Universal "Mummy" movies, not so much for movie continuity, but for the very clear lack thereof. Of course it goes without saying that the original Boris Karloff classic "The Mummy" is not even called in the same breath, but the so-called "persecutors", who all come out as champion or cult. <br /> <br /> This time it was revealed that the mummified remains of Princess Ananka made their way to the United States. And again, as your eyes trick you, Kharis did not die for the second time for the second time in The Mummy's Tomb, but lived and searched for his lost love, Princess Ananka, with the help of the rhetorical nine tana leaves brewed during the full moon cycle. To complete the mythology, Kharis needs a caretaker, full of John Carradine, as Yousef Bey, filled with the task of George Zucco's Andoheb, high priest of Arkan. <br /> <br /> Kharis and Ananka are returned to their last resting place in the hills of Arkan in Egypt. But as we saw earlier, it is a definite race to be entrusted with a high priest's duty. Carradine's character falls for the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsouri (Ramsay Ames). It is shocking to see Yousef Bey and the PO'ed bandaged over the beautiful Amina. <br /> <br /> Touch me this - in both "Tomb" and "Curse", Lon Chaney describes the Mama with a poor right arm folded helplessly over his chest. When he meets the weakened Amina, he lifts her into both arms without problems; as soon as he sat her right, he returned to his lame position again. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is the most striking - the monster gets the girl! But this is a transient victory, as the mummy and his abducted bride succumb to a swampy tomb, an ancient Egyptian curse is fulfilled: "The fate of those who defend the will of ancient gods will be a cruel and violent be dead. "
