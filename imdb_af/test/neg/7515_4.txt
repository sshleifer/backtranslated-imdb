After reading the original book or not having seen the previous movie, and indeed hearing nothing from the storyline of one or the current movie, I came to this movie with an open mind. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to know where to start a comment on the movie because the whole thing looks so confused. There seems to be a point or message or something in the movie, but it is completely unclear. <br /> <br /> The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was rectified with the clear motivation for time travel. However, it was from here. <br /> <br /> All the time travel seems to have only the faintest connection to the quest that was in the beginning. There are some good ideas, but it seems as if isolated events are really not flowing, and the movie seems to be intact and lost. At one point one wonders if the main story in the movie is the fate of the moon. <br /> <br /> When Hartdegen arrives in AD 802,701, the film becomes very frustrating because he apparently can't find anything important about the Eloi, and while there seems to be something to find out, it remains annoyingly elusive . It's quite a strange change from previous travel and one wonders why it's all suddenly left for what looks like a completely new story. So many things happen that there must be an explanation, but there is no discovery. I really wanted to know what the movie was "to come to", which was there to uncover, but to no avail. After summarizing what is happening in this book, there seems to be a very half-hearted attempt to make it into the film, but it is so simplistic and immersed that its meaning and context are completely. lost. <br /> <br /> Just as we hope we'll finally discover where it all leads, the movie suddenly takes a significant change in direction, and becomes a sensible action movie without any real action. It is as if the director has just ceased to put any meaning in the film at this stage. By now, countless significant things happen without any explanation. Hartdegen fails to use the opportunity to return to the past twice, and then suddenly loses interest in time travel for no reason. The film comes to a sudden end when Hartdegen decides to stay with the Eloi. <br /> <br /> In summary, after a good start, the movie is very disappointing. Too much time is spent on Hartdegen's adventures before arriving at Eloi. But the worst part of the movie is what I think is the most important part: setting up the situation with the Eloi. The whole point is completely missed, and it undermines the rest of the movie. After this, the film focuses too much on effects and action and all efforts to return to the meaning and essence of the film seem forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation, the movie just seems lost and loses direction. However, the final that Hartdegen decides is no longer bothered by time travel. It is the most inexplicable of all. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the whole movie looks like a collection of unbound incidents. The meaning and context was lost, although the gaping hole where it should have been very clear. However, what was so frustrating was that there was so much potential here: it was not a bad movie at all, it could have been so much better. The start was very promising, the trip looked fantastic and would have worked if it was not on tangent and Hartdegen's experience with the Eloi could have worked so easily if there were still some of the right questions asked and there weren't do not have. such a temptation to "go stupid" and simplify. I just wish I had a time machine so I could come back early and advise me on the mistakes made.
