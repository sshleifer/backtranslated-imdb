Sometimes funny but usually boring. I recognized Robert Hegyes from Welkom back Carter (aka Epstein) as the ex-celebrity criminal. There is a knee-pad, a breast-breaker scene with the French woman who has a bad reaction to American food. S. Baio, S. Kellerman, and Tom Arnold are billed but have only minor roles. You never know the characters and it's hard to see what happens to them. Not recommended.
