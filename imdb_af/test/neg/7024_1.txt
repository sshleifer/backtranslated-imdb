I love Lucy, but this movie is so miserable that I get embarrassed in the first ten minutes for everyone involved. . . and it just got worse from there. Lucille Ball's "singing" is straightforward and the efforts to make her look more youthful by using soft focus have reached me for reading glasses. These are bombs like these that give bombs a bad name.
