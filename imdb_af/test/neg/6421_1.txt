Good Lord! This movie should have a new classification on the cover page. "Just look if you have absolutely nothing to do!" I'm disappointed. I watched a good horror movie this weekend ... needed an adrenaline storm and that wonderful tingling sensation goes off my spine. But this movie didn't. A pretty good story, but very terrible acting, dialogue and filming. It was incompatible and sometimes completely stupid. We watched the wrong direction of the camera, people talk aloud and tell what they feel and what is going to happen, shade of equipment in some shots, stupid complaints like: "I just need you to keep me" in total wrong places and situations. Thank you for letting go of me and sorry if I insulted someone, but it was a waste of time and money.
