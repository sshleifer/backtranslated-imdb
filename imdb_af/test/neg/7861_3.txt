During the 1990s, several attempts were made to revive the old Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive the old Yamato saga in the form of a nice bad "Yamato 2520", which was completely deserted after only two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and useless "Harlock Saga" while Galaxy Express suffered 999 to attach this bracket of a movie to his name. <br /> <br /> If you saw "Queen Millennia", you'll remember that it was a great movie in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to tell a follow-up to this already closed chapter, and also finds a way to suck it. <br /> <br /> This movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie, blends it with bad tempo melodrama, and to injure an injury, throw in some of the best known characters from Matsumoto's universe. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork, but the rest is so incredibly bad that it can't save this movie from a total loss. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this hack from a movie. You will thank me.
