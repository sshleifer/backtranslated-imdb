I'm the kind of person who never watches animated movies, but I make an exception to Thumbelina and the Swan Princess. I absolutely love the first installment of the series, I bought it and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I spent money buying it. I finished the movie, and all I can think is THE HORR !!! I wanted it, I really did. I tried a lot, very hard to keep it. But I couldn't enjoy a second of this horrible movie. The songs made me feel ripping my ears out of my head. The dialogue was so lame, I felt frustrated and annoyed every time someone opened his mouth. The villain was laughing and I felt myself Derek and Odette finally dying ... and I was absolutely in love with them from the first movie. <br /> <br /> I'm going to try to remind you of this movie because it almost destroyed me first. There is one song in the movie in which there is a series of flashbacks for the first movie. The difference in animation between the two has been made very clear, and I have begun to desire the first one and wish I would never put it on the third time. <br /> <br /> Do yourself and favor and do not waste your time.
