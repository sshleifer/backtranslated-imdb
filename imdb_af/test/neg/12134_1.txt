We all saw bad movies, but one took the cake. I saw that the Junior movie box often looked back from my trip to the horror section at the local video store, and I was a little interested. It seems it pays tribute to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I'd get it. Error! Junior sucks hard, long and with dedication. In other words, it's really bad. Although it wins my award for the most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID !!
