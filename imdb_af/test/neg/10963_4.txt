The Quick and the Undead are finally the first movie to make its own storyline completely. It's basically a giant plot hole. <br /> <br /> In addition, the play was very bad, character motivation non-existent or incredible and there was not a single character that was worth hanging on our hat. The most interesting role player (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) sniffed halfway through the proceedings. <br /> <br /> What the Fast and the Walking Goal means is an excellent example of how to do well. color-timing. It looks great if you consider budgetary considerations. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it plays out like a man has his hands on a hundred ground and has watched a few westerners (especially the good, the bad and the Ugly) and then just a bunch of elements in it threw a movie ... "You know, they have movies where characters do it! Customize it here? No, but who cares! They do it in other movies, so I have to do it here!" <br /> <br /> Perhaps a good view of emerging cinematographers and colorists (first-year film students). Otherwise, a must-miss.
