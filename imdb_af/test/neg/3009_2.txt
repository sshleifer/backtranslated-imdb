Most of the movies I really like are home-made money and rarely appear on the top ten lists. That said, I found "Northfork" totally incomprehensible. I have no idea how it was. Stephen Holden writes about another film in the New York Times that some people think they can just throw anything on the screen and work it as a fairy tale. I thought a few times while looking at "Northfork". <br /> <br /> On a scale of one to ten, I gave it a two.
