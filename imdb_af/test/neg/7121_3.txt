I loved the first resentment, I watched it in an empty theater, and in all honesty I was furious. Never before have I heard the unique sound of the cold sounds, but it was really gripping. <br /> <br /> However, the Grudge 2 had some good leaps, but the story line was really messy and not entirely credible, and all over the place, with a few scenes, like a woman who for fear of urinating, or another of a young woman drinking a jug of milk and then crawling everything again, which really made no sense and does not help to improve the crawl factor of the film. During these scenes and some others, people in the chosen audience actually laughed out loud. It was a good indicator to show how this movie lacks the excitement, cold fever or creep. The play was decent, the emotions portrayed were credible, so hats off to the actors, but the messy storyline and its lack of direction was something I couldn't shake throughout the movie. I was more than slightly annoyed, the same old grudge sounds, a few quick unexpected scenes to make me jump, but I was very disappointed.
