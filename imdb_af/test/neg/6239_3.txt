Don't see this movie, go see something else ... I was very disappointed. I can't rate this movie better than 3. The play was pretty good and I really loved William Dafoe as the villain but I can't see why this movie didn't make it on the big screen. The story was old and featured in 100+ other movies and 1000+ TV shows / movies. The biggest problem was basically: nothing happened. Take a kidnapping, let the villain deliver the abducted woman's money, make the dumb and dull police and extend it to 95 minutes, you have your "Clearing" movie. The only 2 reasons I didn't consider a 1 were a) Dafoe and b) the "plan B ending". There are not many endings that you can give a kidnapping movie. 75% of this type ends with A, 20% ends B and 1% ends with something unpredictable. Drill, boring, boring.
