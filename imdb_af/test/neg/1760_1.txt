I had to write a review for this movie after I saw it last night and read some of the comments by people trying to classify the dissatisfaction of this movie go to wfmitchell's post. I do not apply any of that classification. The other classification that should be on the list is 5) People don't like this movie because it wasn't good. I found the film drilled and forced. My wife chose it to see us because she is a great Kidman fan and she also loves Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Law, it took a long time and had a huge amount of faith belief to believe its southern accent. I can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less purposeful, so we won't have to hear so much tortured accent. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, it's been a long time to get interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then fall flat into it. What was interesting was that I didn't know that this movie was directed by Minghella. About 40 minutes into the movie, I asked my wife, "It's not going to be another English patient?" It was absolute. <br /> <br /> As far as the combat tones. I try to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene, but I think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply "stupid". It was forced, it was incredible, it was stupid and it was stupid. (After the fight I looked at my wife and asked, "Was it just stupid?" With which she cut her head vigorously.) <br /> <br /> The only bright point in the movie was the performance of Zellweger. The role was a bit more like any decent comedy enlightenment role, but it worked. From her speech pattern, her walks, her ways and especially. her little ones (my favorite: "If you want to get 3 feet on a bull's ass, all you have to do is listen to loved ones with each other"), she was able to create an almost cartoon character that did her job. very good. <br /> <br /> I just didn't like this movie and I have to wonder about the kind of people they say they like (or the English patient for that matter). I suspect you can categorize them in one category: 1) Soap opera supporters
