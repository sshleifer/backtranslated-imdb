Hand-over, heavy handed, full of speeches, sermon, on the nose and ear styled in a way that only MTV could be guilty, is Stop-Loss agit-plug-garbage. I expected much more with talented young actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but writer / director Kimberly Peirce does a hatchet job to portray the bad effects of war on American youth. I'm sure she did some work to investigate the Iraq war and the young men fighting in it, but you'd never guess watching Stop-Loss. In many ways, this mess reminded me of Catherine Hardwicke's Lord of Dogtown, an equally obscure, too-styled, TV-movie-based solid-topic waste. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
