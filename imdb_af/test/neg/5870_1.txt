It's often hard to decide what the best movie you've ever seen, as it can vary according to genre, actor / actress preferences, or even the mood you are on a particular day! In this opinion, this movie is by far the WORST movie I have ever seen !! I thought the scene was terrible (was there any?), The plot was just idiotic, and the props were completely fakey. Can lower budget production be created without being an amateur production? I do not think so. Even the friends I watched in the movie agreed that it was the worst video we ever rented, and to this day we are still joking about the night we watched this movie.
