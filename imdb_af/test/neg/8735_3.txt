First of all, I would like to say that it is incredibly stupid to mention your movie "Embryo" when the subject is exclusively devoted to scientific research conducted on fetuses (animal as well as human) between 12 and 16 weeks old. The embryo stage is over at the end of the eighth week of pregnancy, and from that moment the unborn baby comes into the fetal phase. Well, I didn't know, but I made the effort to look it up and that's the least thing the creators of "Embryo" could do. Do not worry; Not only do I bump over details or get overly bitter, because there are several reasons to explain why "Embryo" is a great failure. Real science can be considered boring and inaccessible, and therefore Science Fiction is a film genre that is especially created to make the otherwise boring but educational science topics more interesting and understandable to larger audiences. By portraying ambitious scientific experiments that go terribly wrong, or space missions experiencing evil strangers instead of light years of emptiness, they usually empower people to entertain spectacular special effects while learning their useful little trivia on science. In order to make a good or at least halfway decent Science Fiction movie, writers and directors have to follow just one basic rule: don't be boring! If they cannot meet this one condition, the viewer can also read a theoretically accurate book. Something should have gone wrong during Ralph Nelson's "Embryo" production. The basic premise is perhaps fascinating and even involved, as we are all sensitive to saving the lives of unborn babies. There were also many prominent names involved in the production, such as the main stars Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Diane Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alice Is Not Here And Not Yet.") And director Nelson himself was responsible. for the well-known classic "Soldier Blue" and "Charly". What went wrong? Simple. The script is irreparably boring, split and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab art and scientific equipment are clearly too primitive to achieve medical breakthroughs. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays in a very poor performance a doctor who has not played passion in his research work since his wife. When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion comes back and he does everything possible to save the dying animals' fetuses. He manages one fetus alive, impressively accelerates his growth process and exercises it to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because his procedure is so successful, dr. Paul Holliston's friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. However, the female subject is unexpectedly growing at a rapid rate and after a few weeks she is a mature, surprising and super-intelligent woman. The good doctor obviously falls in love with her, but the pioneering new growth treatment also begins to teach horrible side effects. Absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film, apart from very indisputable and excessive melodramatic mumbo jumbo and one or two deep dog tricks. The second half of the film has a bit of (grotesque) action and tension, but then the stupidity of the dialogues and the indisputable plot twists have already destroyed the potentially fabulous Sci-Fi idea. There are some very nice scenes, especially the chess show between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (in a highly memorable and ultra-unpleasant supporting role). The grand final is absurdly grotesque and literally on the brink of ridicule, and it almost feels like Ralph Nelson has put the final disastrous shot, as it was the general rule in today's thriller and Sci-Fi theater. The last order, including the horrible freeze shot at the end, definitely doesn't match the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the movie. But anyway, my sincere admiration and respect for the dog and its coaches. An animal with such intelligence and talent surely proved its tricks in a much better movie.
