I actually saw the evil on the big screen. I saw it as part of a dual function in the early 1980s (don't remember the other movie) when I was in my middle teen. The movie is bad, bad worthy. Indignant bad. The effects are horrible (you can clearly see the cable the black girl pulls over the floor). There is absolutely nothing about it. In fact, I laughed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> If we are supposed to finally see who is responsible for all the evil acts and we see greasy Victor Buono, who is as scary as an overcrowded twinkle. Seriously, what do they think? Buono, who was a villain on the Batman TV series, is one of the hammiest actors ever approaching the big screen, and I just can't imagine anyone frightening him from outside. <br /> <br /> The evil is all but forgotten Now (for good reason), but it's actually a very funny movie and I wish I could see this turkey again, just to see that the black girl with a very visible cable pulled over the room.
