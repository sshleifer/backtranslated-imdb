I bought this movie at Blockbuster for $ 3.00 because it was interesting (a little Ranma-esque, with the idea of ​​someone skulling), because there was a cute girl in a minute torso on the back, and because there was a limited look sticker on it. I thought it would be a lovely or at least sincere arrival of an age story with a strange indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> After looking at it, I have to wonder how it has the limited sticker, as there is hardly a false language, little violence and the closest nudity (Honestly, usually don't go around hoping for it not!) is when the girl is in her nagga and you see her panties (you see her briefs a lot in this movie because it doesn't matter what she is wearing). Even the anti-religious humor is soft (and lame, caricature, sincere, derivative, inexhaustible and worst of all is not funny in the slightest - it would be better to just listen to Ray Stevens. "Would Jesus raise a Rolex she carries television program "). It will hardly qualify as PG-13 (it has not been rated), but Blockbuster refuses to hire someone under the age of 17 - as if it were pornographic. Any little child can go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba are worse. <br /> <br /> It's not so. <br /> In a way, it worries me - the only thing people can offend is the start of suicide. If anyone sees movies with honest suicide (not this one, but better than the Virgin murderers), it's teenagers. If both movies were rated only because of the suicide aspect, I have little chance of making a story I wrote in a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the top three major causes of death in teenagers (I think it's number 2), so chances are that most teenagers will be affected or will be affected. <br /> <br /> Don't say no to this movie. , though. 10/02.
