I bought a DVD from this movie for a dollar at the big dept store. It's probably the best and sweetest comment I should make about it. At least it didn't cost me the food. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Chiller" is Craven's problem as director. The man has proved his excuses, claiming his travel documents, to be a very clever man and a sharp conceptualist. But it's no secret that he, as a director, never owned one of the visual and story-telling sense of a Hitchcock. As strongly testified by the "chiller", he is much closer to the legendary flatfoot Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven's director lacks is the main ingredient that will train him from director for rent to a higher level of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Let's be specific. The transition moments of this movie are slim. The solid shots give the feeling of quality production. The film looks professional in the way a film is shot by a TV commercial director. (Thinking: The movies are only visual distinctions, these transitions that are at least professionally handled can be the work of some second unit directors.) These are the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions - the drama - falling flat. <br /> <br /> The essence of the proceedings is always perfected. The critical shots (leaving the car driving to the well-positioned camera, then we cut to the night side of a hospital, then to the waiting room and hallway, then to the telephone bank in the corner which will come in the corner the next bit of action ) is quickly done away so we can move quickly and go to the next section. Craven never gets anywhere to explode the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. The net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts, and the turbulent speed of moving things, is a film that feels like the work of the excellent art student who makes all his pencils sharp, changes his ass and lighting, up, grind all his pigments, stretch and prick his cloth ... and then nothing has to say. Craven, like the art student, never gets the meat from the exercise. <br /> <br /> For Craven apologists who will show that this movie was made for TV, I will point to Spielberg's "Duel" and no more.
