The messengers are a bad, generic and boring horror movie. The movie has a big problem: it doesn't scare. The performances and the script are completely stupid. It uses old tricks to frighten and make all the supernatural events I won't call the messengers as a bad movie. I call it a casual comedy because it's so bad, it laughs. The only good thing about this movie is that it is short, so this shit won't stay with us. be told, while this crap is already a success in the box office. So, I do not recommend this poor and pathetic horror movie called the Messengers.
