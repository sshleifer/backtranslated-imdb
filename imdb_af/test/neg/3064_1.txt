As a Michigander, I joke the Michigan. Very funny - make fun of Pontiac, Ann Arbor, all the lame suburbs of Detroit. Yes, yes, I heard these jokes a million times. I will give them credit to accurately portray the greatness of Grosse Pointe. It couldn't get White anymore. Did you hear that beautiful Michigan nasal accent? Where the girls talk so fast, can't you understand one word coming from their mouth (nose) ...? As much as I like Michigan, I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> I've never met one person from Grosse Pointe I liked. Listen to that awesome live band and that annoying and horrible background music! What is it? One of your Gross Pointe homeboy's band? Probably. Wow, what a great "Detroit scene" you guys have there. Funny how Grosse Pointe's people always say they are from Detroit. They are so white and rich, they wish they had something to complain about. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is blowing. All the way of the lame jokes about girls in the hands of the terrible character development. Oh, wait a minute, you mean the whole basis for a character is that he says the f word a lot? What a deep personality. Great work, Grosse Pointers! And I love all the sexist lingo, like the narrator calls the first girl killed, who never even speaks a "naive b * tch". It's really lovely. <br /> <br /> And those homemade masks with the Marilyn Manson contact lenses are really great. And I love how it made perfect sense why the cyclists attended and killed people. And how did their narrator master have such a clear role in the movie? The main boyfriend was so boring, I fell asleep and looked at him. The three idiot guys (or was it two or four? How can I say, they all look and do the same!) Was so desperate to make me laugh, but Beavis and Butthead laughed in 1994 already. And what's with the gay jokes? No wonder this movie is sucked - everyone involved should have some minor problems with their masculinity, eh boys. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace for this movie was the head girl. Despite what the other people were saying here, she was actually a good actress. Teenage girls speak as she spoke. They really work as she did. Her acting was very natural and credible. I really thought she was a Grosse Pointe convenience store employee. .. maybe she is! And yes, she had big boobs, most of the women do it. Michigan is the coolest state in the union, you know. In all respects. <br /> <br /> So, those of you who think it's a representation of Detroit, it's not. It's the suburbs of Detroit. They are very white and full of aimless teenage fear. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP is one of our suburbs) and $ 75 baggy khaki pants all the way! Lame rich children who are angry because they have a lot of money and nothing to complain about. And they also make bad movies. <br /> <br />
