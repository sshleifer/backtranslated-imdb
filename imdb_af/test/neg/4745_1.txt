This film and the 1st AvP movie, both across the Aliens and Predator franchises. <br /> <br /> They are horrible movies, poorly acted, poorly written and terribly targeted. They look just like someone's desperate attempt to make money from the good name of the original aliens and predators, but instead of producing a thoughtful, quality production, they sustained the predator. <br /> <br /> The Original Alien / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 movies were great. They redefined the horror / thriller genre by developing these insane (and still credible) creatures that took the role of the 'serial killer' instead of one. <br /> <br /> These movies just mix the franchise and do nothing but obscure its name. <br /> <br /> The Aliens vs Predator comics were brilliant and had a wonderful story. They were true to the Alien / Predator mythology, didn't scratch all the original stories etc ... Why didn't they make the cartoon in a good movie? Because Hollywood is idiot, that's why.
