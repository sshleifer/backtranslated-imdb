As expected, there is a reasonably good reason why this film is so unclear and unknown, despite dealing with the ever-popular appearance of zombies and the leading role of 80-year-old B-movie queen Linda Blair, namely: ! "The Chilling" is trying very hard? far too difficult? to be a story with depth and factual background, while just being a light and agitated horrorflick about frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time for anything remotely interesting or significant. There is a lot of bravery about cryogenics, which I have learned in my physics class, is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. Of course, a lot of people in this film study the behavior of human bodies when frozen deep. Needless to say, it is extremely boring, until two dull night watchers decide during a power failure that it is a good idea to place the metal-constructed cells outside in the thunderstorm. The coolers are hit by lightning, of course, and the bodies spontaneously thaw and come to live on a murderous zombie rampage. "The Chilling" is a boring and surprising (for a late 80's effort, at least) gore-free horror movie that doesn't even use a quarter of its potential. All the painful efforts to build an atmosphere of tension and sincerity fail tremendously and I can't think of any reason why the bombings should be so bloodless. Even despite the low budget available, they could have done better. The set pieces, makeup effects and costumes are pitiable. For example, the research lab looks like a flat flat while the zombies can't seem any more dangerous with their green faces and foil-wrapped outfits. How Linda Blair managed to get involved in such a low budget embarrassment is a complete mystery. She is attracted to an evil B-movie like bees to honey.
