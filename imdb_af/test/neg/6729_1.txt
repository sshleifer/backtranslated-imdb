Steven Seagal's late-night movies were not exactly good, but it's by far the worst since The Patriot. The plot doesn't make sense like that; It is never clear what the relationships between the characters are, who works for whom or who is a double crossing that. The movie is completely unfounded, every scene looks rather confusing the story rather than continuing it. Even the action ranges are uninspired and difficult to follow. The bulk of the blame should lie with the directors' feet, not to even understand the basics of film making, but Seagal does not go out lightly. As one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. Oh, and I didn't even mention how terrible the acting is, even according to Seagal standards. Even so straight to video feeds, it's not a view, even for Seagal fans. Give it a wide cabin!
