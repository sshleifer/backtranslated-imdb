A root canal without anesthesia is more amusing. This movie is disturbing and useless. There is absolutely nothing credible about any of these characters or the plot line. What in God's name were these people thinking when they agreed to die in this movie? The play in this movie is so incredibly bad - even from actors who are usually pretty damned. "The In-Laws" is a funny movie. The Birdcage is a hilarious movie. The Big Lebowski is a humorous movie. This movie is not stupid. I can't even understand the kind of sick thought needed to write the "novel" on which this movie is based. I honestly can't even think of a nice thing to say about this movie. It just makes no sense. People please - I beg you - don't see this movie. You will regret it for the rest of your life. This movie isn't the worst ever made, but it's definitely right up there.
