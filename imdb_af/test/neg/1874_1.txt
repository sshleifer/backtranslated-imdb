You know, as you get older, you might somehow think of the movies you didn't like when you were younger, due to your youth and inexperience. Case in point, when I saw The Godfather at the age of 14, I thought it was boring. 20 years later, it's an incredible movie for me. In other words, I grew up and appreciated good movies. <br /> <br /> So I rented Dirty Dancing with her friend last night at her request, as she loved it at the age of 14 and I also hated it. age. But I was hoping, because I was 14 years old and young, it might be a new experience for me. So I sat down with her to look and hope to be relieved. <br /> <br /> Well, the night after watching Dirty Dancing, I feel an offense. I feel like someone has reached my soul and robbed me of this 2 o'clock of my life from this cheese party. <br /> <br /> First, Patrick Swayze plays a 20-year-old, but he looks like he's 35. And the assumption of the movie is that he seduces some minor teenagers and moves her with his dance. Actually creepy. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is the clich√© plot where the "wrong side of the songs" old and the "rich smart girl" accidentally fall in love with each other. Of course, their romance is fueled by the fact that the "rich girl" cannot dance a lick, so the "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the great end of the holiday program, or something like that. <br /> <br /> But you guessed it: The disapproving father is coming in shortly and forbids the two to see each other, and the movie progresses to secret encounters with dance lessons and love. It all culminates in the last scene where the whole resort rides around the two young lovers, while the one-time antagonistic father accepts the 35-year-old dancer as his teenage daughter's new husband. <br /> <br /> Even my friend whispered at the end of the movie as she acknowledged, was nothing like her. I didn't push her, but I smeared a little and put the Godfather part II in the DVD player.
