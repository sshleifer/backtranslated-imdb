If you're looking for a masochistic excitement, rent this movie and show it to a group of your friends newer. This movie is just airplanes, but it's not quite worthless. The short tits are nice, and there is one victim's death that is funny like hell. Other than that, it is straight rubbish. But it's even better than "Grim" or "Spookies"
