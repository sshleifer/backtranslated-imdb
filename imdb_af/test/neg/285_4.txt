Each James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has its own set of rules. And the fact that writers don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary plot turning, the integrity of both ocean films falls somewhere between aircraft 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon. <br /> <br /> Imagine what will happen while you are sitting on the rope bridge outside the Doom temple, if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry, because in the first two movies secretly had super powers and can both speed them up to safety. <br /> <br /> Entertainment? Sure, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done so, as it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would have designated the audience. They've been sitting on Indiana Jones movies for 3 hours on the side of their seats, and they went to Indiana to get them off the bridge in a credible way. If he were to fly? People would have walked out of the theaters as people did during Ocean's 12. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> 1. Julia Roberts'character, Tess, infiltrates a museum by disguising herself as ... Julia Roberts?!? A clever twist? Breaking the fourth wall three hours after launching these characters? Is it the Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? This is a handbook example of how a cheap laugh can destroy a whole movie. But wait ... just if you haven't walked out ... <br /> <br /> 2. Build the tension through the last hour of the movie - how are they going to pick up the elevator - there's just 10 .. 8 ... 5 ... 2 DAYS LEFT! And then in the last 12 minutes of the film, the only entertaining part of this movie, we see that the lift days were made earlier and Matt Damon took 30 seconds to pull off. The past 10 days? A complete waste of your time. <br /> <br /> BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE BRIDGE ... "Just relax, Willie! I stole the REAL stones a month ago! I also convinced you to be Kate Capshaw!" < br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, cut your losses and look at the Polar Express. I don't want to destroy the end for you, but there's really a Santa Claus. Most importantly, you won't feel cheated to leave the theater.
