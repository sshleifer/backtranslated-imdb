Someone has to teach the people who made this movie that there is a difference between "making multiple turns" and "exceeding the audience". They even use hypnosis as a tool to cover the plot holes; When they can't get their way in or out of a scene, they just say, "She's now registering her past" or "she is breaking it out now" and they think it explains everything. This movie is a dishonest dishonesty and has become a full-blown fiasco in the last 20 minutes. (* 1/2)
