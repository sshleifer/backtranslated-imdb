This is the first recorded attempt to place sound with a movie, and an oldest of course still exist. This historic piece of film is the opening segment in the DVD 'More Treasures Of The Natural Archives'. <br /> <br /> It's just a 15-second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a big recording cylinder. Next to him are two men dancing. Near the end another man walks on stage. William Dickson, the director of this experiment, is the violinist. This movie had several titles over the years, but the sound experiment was not really a success. It has taken more than 30 years from this point to synchronize the face and sound to the point where something for the public can be released for entertainment. However, it was a start, no matter how primitive it came. <br /> <br /> For more technical information and history of this movie process, see the other review here by "Boba Fett1138."
