I'm a fan of the paranormal and I love Ghost Hunters. When this exhibition came out for the first time, I decided to try it. I could barely sit through one episode. The performance is so natural. I mean come on, every episode involves someone being owned or demonic trying to kill the family. Another big mistake is that these guys never uncover anything. Looking at Ghost Hunters, they find evidence and try to try it and if they can't, it's proven. On this show they find a voice or piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost. It destroys their credibility completely differently from TAPS and Ghost Hunters who actually know what they are doing. Honestly, if you are interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it, watch Ghost Hunters.
