Let's cut everything in the first paragraph. "The Messengers," is the latest movie of the Pang Brothers (Danny and Oxide), as a horror movie, very bad. And just like a movie in general, it's a big disappointment. This is nothing but a sixth sentence, and as long as the photo is still available, there is no reason to pay a money on earth to see this turkey. <br /> <br /> Lately, horror / slasher movies like The Final Destination Series, Wrong Turn, Boogie Man, The Ring 2 and The Wrudge have become increasingly dependent of big shocks without pay (for example, something jumps out at the person on screen, sneaking out of the audience, but seems to be a cat or crow or something.) It's not just a sincere scary experience like " The Sixth Sense "or" Signs "or a classic horror. films from the 1940s, '50s and' 60s. <br /> <br /> The messengers rely on the same old, tired clich√©s as these newer, far-inferior movies, and are therefore old, tired and, to my surprise, ended as one of the most boring movies I have in a seen for a while. <br /> <br /> The plot still has a stupid family, led by dad Roy (Dylan McDermott, "The Practice"), mother Denise (Penel Ope Ann Miller, Awakenings, Kindergarten Cop, TV series Desperate Housewives , Big Sis Jess (Kristen Stewart, Zathura: A Space Adventure) and Toddler Ben (Evan Turner) Chicago. <br /> <br /> The reason for the move is never outlined here, but it has something to do with the father's inability to find work and Jess's drunken escape, we know that there will be problems immediately because they are moving in the middle of nowhere to a large Gothic house, a neighborhood that looks like the Munster's summer house. Oh, and the first five minutes of the movie shows something really awful there. <br /> <br /> Jess hates the place (hey, who can blame her), but optimistic doll hopes to make an impact on the increase of sunflowers (despite the unusually large number of crows moving around), but when he meets Burwell (John Corbet, "Raising Helen" And like Kevin Costner in the movie version of "My Name Is Earl", a travel daughter and expert to increase sunflowers, things start to pick up. <br /> <br /> But then strange things start to happen; Jess is being terrorized by a violent invisible power in the house (of course, no one but the two-year-old Ben can see it, so she's labeled a flake) and the crows are hanging around. Ben can also find the unearthly creatures, but since he is two, he cannot articulate it. Scene to the scene of people telling the little boy to tell them what he eventually saw, wanted to scream on the screen: "He can't tell you! He's two-freaking '- years old! "Yes, the only protagonist who can solve all these things is a dumb toddler and is really smart. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we need to consider Jess's common sense. when and when Ben will properly describe the paranormal visions he sees; if dad will work the sunflower thing; if the high plains are drifter is a good old or bad; what is the point of the George Plimpton search broker; how a lift dipped in the back can only be a flesh wound; what mother's role in the family is; and where do all the crows come from. <br /> <br /> All this is waiting for something - anything - to happen. The conclusion is also very lame, and once again the question asks how a spirit that has no bodily body can harm a living person. Very boring, useless and terrible of all, not least frightening. Oh, and there are many crows in this movie.
