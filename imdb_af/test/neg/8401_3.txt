It's hard to decide who or what the target audience is for this movie. Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had the chance to investigate the problems of amnesia at a serious level and chose to use it as an excuse to make a soft porn movie. His Souvenir des Belles has seen, loved, admired and respected, investigating the memory loss - although due to Alzheimer's - in a profound and heartbreaking way, especially in the light performance of Isabelle Carre, I find Novo an insult to She is. souvenirs. I have no problem with soft porn per se - and even if I had, I would almost have to give up on movies that are so common today - but I have a problem with writers / directors trying to do it by covering it as in the cover of medical research. The sad thing is that good actresses like Julie Gayet - so wonderful in Clara et Moi - and Anna Mouglalis - who look like a doubles after last week's Le Deluge and now - are wasting their time on such a thirst.
