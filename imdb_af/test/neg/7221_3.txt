Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> I hate this one, but it's better than the other after, they just get worse. I hope Gibson has the smart to stay out of the next. Very similar with humor, ie the toilet, children, etc. How much further we can see how their relationship develops. Drugs, bad guys, why South Africa! I found that incredible, perhaps South American, a Golden Triangle country would make the writing better. It looks as if the late 80s had the bad guys in the early 90s, eg. The Hard, the mighty Ducks play Iceland Gary Busey in the last weapon, etc. Hollywood repeats itself. This one with a similar story should go over it. The attack on the police, the beach complex and the battle at the end, and a way over the top Gibson's girlfriend murdered by the copper attack, was too much. Like many part 2's, they get worse, and 3 or 4 in this series makes speed down. 10/03
