It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the look of beautiful Lydie Denier in some of the screens. Despite her 42 years, she is a wonderful woman in every way. Her naked scene in the bathroom with Armand Assante is as hot as hell. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about the movie, nothing is really interesting to say, a Neonazi and a Turkish gang fighting over Berlin in scenes that include people who openly shoot on the street in daylight and in a club where 30-40 people with machine guns fire at a place no bigger than my home and die unbelievably after a few hours with only three and ten injured LOL. <br /> <br /> While the gangs are fighting over Berlin grounds, a ceremony kills young children and immerses them in various places in the town. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante appears as the Turkish detective who is now working for the police, a former leader for the Turkish gang and is now resolving the serial killings. <br /> <br /> The movie, of course, is a very bad ripe of the classic M film. The killing of the children, the involvement of the underworld, the character of the murderer. and the "scene" final scene of the serial killer was influenced by more than this classic movie. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible, the writing is just stupid, the production of the lowest standards is possible and generally it was a great waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Don't even rent this one.
