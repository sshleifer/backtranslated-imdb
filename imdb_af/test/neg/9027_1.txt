Vicente Aranda made a horrible historical film. It shows the poor sources of the Spanish theater. In the film, an irrational dissertation Juana just like a ninfomaniac, confronted by Felipe, only worried about sex ... but sex with others not with her. The technical flaws begin with the wedding ring shown by Isabel of Castilla. No one noticed it? Then the voice looks like a documentary, actor and actress in the movie sometimes - look at the order when Juana comes to the advice she wants to keep. The castles are almost broken when recorded in the recent movie, crowds are just "four" people, lights are badly placed. Compared to Amelie Poulain, the French movie for the oscars ... it has no sense to talk about a bad movie like Juana la loca.
