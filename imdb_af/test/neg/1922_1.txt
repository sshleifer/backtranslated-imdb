*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE ON EARTH / (2000) 1/2 * (out of four) <br /> <br /> Mark Piznarski's "Lord on Earth" keeps record for " a film containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes. Literally every contrivance, cliché and well-known plotting element is somewhere in here; there is simply nothing unique, original or fresh about it. God, a malicious film to go through; I wish I saw the movie last year during theater delivery, so it could earn on my year's worst list. This is the kind of movie where the story immediately makes him obvious and goes down the opening credit and the worst of it all takes him seriously. "Here on Earth" is clearly one of the most horrible, painful movies ever to come in the snoek. <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" is a teen heartthrob movie, so it must have some Hollywood's most valued young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to play a role in a movie so badly like this to accept. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett are fit to change the description, and take the lead in storm. Klein plays Kelley, an arrogant and insolent student with a rich father (Cliché number one). He is graduating as the valedictorian and attending Ivy League College follows in the footsteps of his father (Stuart Wilson). It sets the "I don't want your life", in which the father tries to control his son's life, while the boy resists. Throw Kelley's late mother who committed suicide a while. When his father brings another woman home, he viciously asks for his intentions (the "no one replaces mouse light counts as number two). <br /> <br /> Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character on the opposite side of the Society to Kelley His family owns a local dinner, giving his long-term love interest, Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski), a waitress at the dinner that covers her sister (who has no purpose, rather than the next scene control) when Jasper and Kelley act like childlike morons by racing their cars and (oh no) crashing into the meal, causing it to burst into flames. (Conflicts between the rich and poor will count as cliché number three.) /> <br /> The hidden car chase sets Kelley and Jasper up for a confronted and credible conflict, getting into trouble with the law, but because this movie needs to exist, the local judge recommends an alternative for serving t yd: they have to work together to help rebuild the dinner. <br /> <br /> The two boys work hard during the summer, and get a nice brown. Samantha's eye gets Kelley, and romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous, but wants what is best for his true love (cliché number four). Her parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disagree with her little romantic triangle (cliché number five), but she continues with Jasper twice without a second thought. Her father is also the local sheriff, surprisingly (we can count that melodramatic nugget cliché number six). <br /> <br /> The confronted romantic feelings between Kelley and Samantha count as cliché number seven. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper is never defined, so how can there be romantic tensions? If the film affects the involvement of Samantha's choice between the two young men, we should see both characters from both sides. The film shows Jasper as a distraction to her "rightful love," Kelley. Obviously Jasper really loves her, but it's also clear that she doesn't love him again. It kills the romantic tensions early in the story. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski does no harm here; However, her charm and good performance do not fit a bilingual character like Samantha. John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper, but the movie gives him nothing but Kelley. Chris Klein gets a hungry name for himself here; He spends a lot of the movie shirtless, sweating and overworking. Unfortunately, he doesn't show his acting ability, perhaps because he has very little. The supporting role is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood delivers the best performance in the film, but doesn't have enough screen time to save everything but a few short moments. I also enjoyed Stuart Wilson's performance, which perfectly matches the role of a rich, controlling father of high social status. <br /> <br /> Then we lean over Samantha's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes in the film (another spoiler for). What is it, she has a serious incurable disease (another controversy in the picture, about number eight). Her terminal illness brings the two competing young men together as friends. Well at least I think it's the movie that is meant to show that the loss of one loved by two nemeses can bring both together (cliché number nine). <Br /> <br /> Little rehearses his valedictic speech to prove that his character is more than a level stereotype, but we have seen it so many times before I prefer a rich character rather than a deep sentimental that hide real feelings (cliché number, um, was it ten)? The conflict between Kelley and Jasper is desperate and foolish; A "your mother" comment leads to a fist fight while rebuilding the foundation. There is a repetition of Armageddon, as Samantha and Kelley protrude in an open field, horny like hell, slowly moving his fingers around her body and calling areas to American cities (why not call the number eleven). The movie uses alcohol as a way to increase the romantic tension: A drunk Kelley fools himself after fighting in Samantha's date, Jasper, but the next day he just repeats desires for to dance (cliché number, oh no, I lost score).
