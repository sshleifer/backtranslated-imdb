I'm totally in this kind of story line, but once the movie fired, I honestly said out loud, "I just rented a two dollar budget Christian POS." The only thing I could find out about this movie is that it has a descent story, but it's terribly executed. Terrible actors, horrible direction and manufacture. <br /> <br /> The director and producer should watch the cube before trying to pull out a movie in a single room. There was absolutely nothing that kept you informed that you didn't notice that you were the whole movie in the same room. Awful! The two main actresses were very easy to spot and you could tell the director is counting on your attention. But these two and their bios can talk to it, is horrible for the camera. <br /> <br /> Don't rent it. Unless you are blind, it might light a few stars if you just listen.
