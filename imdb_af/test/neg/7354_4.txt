What could have been a great thing was uncomfortable, and it was an incomprehensible, compelling movie that even the filmmakers didn't even understand. If they saw more of the satanic ritual or whatever, it might have been nicer, but as it stands now, it's a waste of time and brain cells. Does anyone else get sick of the whole "little child who makes spectacular pictures with chalk"? Could there be a bigger horror clich√©? Probably not. I know I know it is from another country, and it is sophisticated and sophisticated to understand, so I should not expect the "plot" to be fed to my spoon, blah, blah, blah. Whatever. I still say the movie blows.
