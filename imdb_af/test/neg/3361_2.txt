Hi, this is I Derrick Cannon and I welcome you to the first Cannonite app. My movie for this week was debatable, which route which movie, what excellent four-star epic I would choose, guess what I decided to pull an eighty-one and go the other route, I decided to make a movie so horribly revisit that it completely killed what could have been a very unique concept. The movie I will review today is Jack Frost Two Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman. The stars in this movie include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney as Colonel and Scott MacDonald as the Killer Snowman himself. Jack Frost. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny Jack Frost (love the root scene), but it's even harder to believe that it is exactly same mold. . The movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and Captain Fun was launched. What was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie? The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was the total killer snowman. Sam Tiler looks more paranoid than he did in the original. His anti-freeze babbling was one of the most pathetic shows I've seen in a movie. However, his wife was one of the few shiny spots. She played her role as lead woman. She was a voice of reason in film of pure idiot. The scene where she finds out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie. Ray MacDonald once again did a good job as Jack Frost despite what he was given. If it wasn't for such poor characters, he could have been immortal like Chucky, Freddy and Jason. Laugh as you should, but when it comes, Jack Frost played, he had humor, and above all he had an undisputed evil streak. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been so much more a continuation of a good franchise, but any plans to make a Jack Frost three have been canceled. <br /> <br /> This movie gets me two out of ten and it is fortunate that it even gets one.
