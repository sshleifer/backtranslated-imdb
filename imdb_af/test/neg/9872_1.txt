Surely when the chance to see this terribly notorious legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. They were not low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow took possession of the rights to produce the Marvel comic book characters somewhere in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it to Oley Sassone, whose direct work is mainly in TV series like Hercules and "Viper. With a so-called total budget of $ 1.5 million, it was manufactured, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the desert of forgotten film. There it had to have remained. But, like a banana peel in a vaudeville act, this "Fantastic Four" sits in the eater and waits for the rare people who are unhappy and foolish enough to walk on it. <br /> <br /> If you've ever heard of these cartoon characters, you know what to expect. The people who made it were very loyal to the source material, and that is the only thing they deserve credit for in this fiasco. It provides the origin of the heroic group who develop superhuman powers when shielding on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch and become his body. Fantastic. His girlfriend, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) can become invisible, and her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood), can spontaneously cause fire to break out of his body. Finally, Ben Grimm ('credited' to both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin changes to a rocky heath and is referred to as The Thing. There is a prologue that a former classmate of Reed's, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) set up for their enemy, dr. Doom, who is orchestrating the sabotage of the Fantastic Four's space flight as an act of revenge for injuries he owes to Reed. There is the intent, then the discovery of powers, the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climatic battle. There is more detail to the poorly written writing, but it is insignificant. <br /> <br /> It's a movie made just because the creators (I use it in the technical sense of the word. There isn't 'There is a lot of creative imagination here at work.) has the legal rights to do so. The plot will undoubtedly be reflected in the expected large-scale collection that will be directed by Tim Story in 2005, but tackling a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors as an act of cinematic madness. What special effects are mostly hand-drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original 'The Great Train Robbery'. When half of the climax fights back to full-on-hand animation, you're almost relieved to watch a cartoon instead of the poor actors condemned to be in this project. There is also very little consistency of style in this mess. Most scenes are shot in the light or wild primary colors, and the only clad sets are the obvious sci-fi pieces. There is camera work, but it usually only holds the characters on the screen, and minimal information flows to the audience. Editing includes extra lines and use of clear wipes (at one point there is even a transition with the center of a number 4). To change spins is even used to supplement the bad special effects when The Thing changes. The one scene where the morphing technology was used was just shocking because it was such a positive leap in quality. <br /> <br /> Limited camera work is not unforgivable. In 'Clerks' only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style. It worked for that movie because it's about people whose lives had no style and that was consistent. Kevin Smith never let his reach exceed his grip. "The Blair Witch Project" helped some audiences suffer from motion sickness from the jerky handouts that made up that pseudo-documentary. When all was said and done, it was an effective work on terror to be lost and consumed by a frightening situation. There is no sense or story or theme here at a spoken or visual level. With this 'Fantastic Four' you will never be more than a coincidence laugh, because filmmakers and artists are actually trying to compete with other comic book movies with this poorly budgeted entry. <br /> <br /> Any movie involves a lot of time and work. It is just as sad that so many of both were thrown into such a project. If you were one of the people involved, it's probably done as a stepping stone on the path of a (hopefully improved) film career. Everyone knows about job opportunities to make the most of what seems to be an opportunity. For those who are curious about watching this movie, my advice is just to do it with a group of friends (so you can show everyone and say "you also watched it") who was warned about the experience (so nobody touches not hurting the shock), and maybe you can come up with a drinking match to relieve the pain between the casual laughs. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
