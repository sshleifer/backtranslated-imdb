Be warned, next time you see "Richard Kelly" involved in any production run away. Quick. <br /> <br /> After his last film, "Southland Tales", Kelly proved himself to be one predictive director. It was indulgent and complicated. <br /> <br /> I can see what his peak should have been to Warner Bros, and I bet studio executives have eaten it upright: a full movie based on one of Richard's Twilight Zone Matheson's old short stories. <br /> <br /> Big mistake! Don't read further unless you want this movie totally spoiled for you: <br /> <br /> Norma (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button. <br /> <br /> It seems that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an alien who uses his body as a vessel to do experiments in which the fate of mankind rests. His face was shaken because he was hit by Alien Lighting, who killed him, but then brought him back to do all those red test tests. Of course, as Norma pushes the button, knowing that someone can die, she must have the consequences for failing to consider someone's life instead of her own. In the end, she and her husband, James Marsden, choose to kill Norma instead of their son being deaf and blind. <br /> <br /> Kelly is dancing around his movie's message, trying to figure out the audience. what the moral of the story is. Obviously any person with a brain at first says, "What if I am the person who dies?" Richard Kelly doesn't even have his character's ordinary human conversation. In fact, they avoid it all together. They seem to be both educated, working at a prestigious school and also for NASA, so why won't they both have a better ability to look outside the box ??? <br /> <br /> If he was in charge of characters this conversation actually had, the whole movie could have ended up there! Instead, we need to watch weddings last forever, NASA and the NSA are confident of Arlington Stewart taking over these government programs, teleporting to show the Marsden life outside our world, so it's easier to kill his wife to make. Steward who can be anywhere and nowhere. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this movie is pacing. Nothing really happens. It's a confused mish-mash of ridiculous ideas. <br /> <br /> How this movie is marketed is impenetrable. The ads make it like "Saw," and even use the music of those movies to sell it. In fact, what you get is a slow, boring, lazy (yes, half the theater laughs at acting and visual effects), and messy film that isn't imaginative, interesting or coherent. At one stage, Cameron Diaz and her son are kidnapped and then suddenly back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on her way home. Where's she going? Why did they take her? Do we really care? No more will you. <br /> <br /> In the end, you really won't mind what happens to any of the characters. You will root for everyone to die so the movie will just end. Go see anything else that plays. Don't waste your time or money.
