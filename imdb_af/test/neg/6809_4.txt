Dustin Hoffman's debut feature is not as bad as it is claimed; A Spanish / Italian co-production filmed in Italy with the director with the pseudonym "Dan Ash" (!), is unreasonably but generally distracted and deals with a plethora of shady characters looking for $ 1,000,000 through gang Cesar Romero hidden. who, despite being third-billed - to Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expires before even the credit line has been cast!) <br /> <br /> Of course, Hoffman's performance is nowhere to be seen as in later movies, but manages to evade embarrassment by playing that basically amounts to an amusing klutz - an accident-susceptible US treasury agent of Sicilian descent (called Puzzu, who can't get anyone right!) who sent his firm for the money and said it remains "inconspicuous", but instead it gets in trouble forever - although it is ultimately surprisingly inventive by finding the prey, relieving the crooks and winning the girl (Martinelli as Romero's daughter, which is wasted a bit here !! <br /> <br /> However, the best moments of the movie are provided by suave gangster Riccardo Garrone. Except for his hard-boiled persona and the hilarious dialect use, he is flanked by a trio of nitwits who are more often than not an obstacle in fulfilling his various schemes! Also, in the light of the story set in Rome, it is strange that the police officer investigating the case is a Spaniard (undoubtedly an existence of the co-production agreement)! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've missed some of Hoffman's other Italian comedy - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - especially because Leonard Maltin just calculates it * 1/2 in his "Movies & Video Guide "... but then MADIGAN'S MILLION gets a BOMB!); With Pietro Germi director and co-starring of the nice Stefania Sandrelli, the credentials of the film are definitely more respectable, and I really hope it will appear on Italian TV soon ...
