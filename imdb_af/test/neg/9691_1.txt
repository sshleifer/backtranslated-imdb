This is the most inaccurate and shameful biblical film I ever had to watch. I want to know why anyone on earth can enjoy it. I'm so surprised that a big name like Jon Voight agrees to act in this shameful piece of garbage. Many people who may not have read the Bible will now be deceived by believing that this movie was accurate and the thought of it really bothered me. I think the makers have a lot to answer. The worst thing is that I believe no one can make such clear mistakes with a Biblical film, as they can investigate the Bible for the truth. So I believe the creators have deliberately turned what the Bible says and that is something no one has the right to do and I find it very offensive. There are no words strong enough to describe exactly how I feel about this.
