Hey, if people thought wood was a bad director, they didn't quite see this movie. I think there was gaping plot holes and under-used casting. Shoddy special effects. I mean, I can't believe this movie came from a Hollywood studio. A high school drama club is likely to come up with a better product. I mean they had Erika Eleniak who serves wonderful Casper and is among the actor. Their agents must be shot to ask them to sign up for this dribble. They don't read scripts. I still can't believe the little list was a survivor in the movie. I baked my head all the time, why he and not a descendant of salvation stand the last man. I'm a fan of vampire movies and it's by far the worst thing they have to put in so that it never sees the light of day.
