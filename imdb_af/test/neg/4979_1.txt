Only three words are really needed for this review: a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child, you will find this movie to fully waste your time and money. The best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will hold your feet on the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they all use the names and catches. The name calls the dog "Shoeshine" (in reference to the dog who is "Shoeshine Boy" in the cartoon). They call the love interest Polly, but she's not crazy about Sweet Polly Purebred. <br /> <br /> My wife and son drug me to see it. They had to tolerate me to see it. <br /> <br /> The original Underdog was pronounced by Wally Cox, the ultimate. This one is spoken by someone with a "smart teen who knows more than all adults". <br /> <br /> As a stand-alone movie, it's horrible. As a tribute to Underdog, it's even worse. It's not a tribute. It's not a story of the story. This is not an update of the story. It's purely an attempt to sign up for a well-known title and create merchandise. The next time I go to the store, I fear I'm underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothes, etc. Will see. McDonalds and Burger King probably argued about the child's meal rights. <br /> <br /> However, the worst part of this movie is the soundtrack. They do the subordinate theme song to fall (read it with a quiet "C" at the beginning)! Big, now that we are going to destroy something, we are completely gone. <br /> <br /> I knew it would probably be bad before I left. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local place and found that they opened it for the first day and were for the first time in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without a city seat). Even the theater people knew it would be rubbish! Save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on DVD. This will be more fun and have better production values.
