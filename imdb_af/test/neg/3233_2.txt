Corey Haim will never be known as one of the great actors of his time, but in films such as "Licensed To Drive" he was more in his element ... lowbrow humor. <br /> <br /> Dean Koontz's book Watchers was one of his previous works, and still probably the best. Unfortunately, this wonderful story of a brilliant dog, a common mutant and a genetic experiment that went wrong, was terribly tortured. The acting is so lifeless, you may think you are watching a zombie movie. Only the dog gives a good performance, and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog, you'll be better off watching "The Incredible Journey", "Cujo" or even "CHOMPS". CHOMPS "<br /> <br /> When reading the book, avoid this movie at all costs. If you haven't read the book, read it and avoid this movie. You will thank me later. <br /> <br /> A little better translation of a Dean Koontz book is the capable thriller, "Phantoms".
