How this character has ever been hired by the post office is far above me. The test that postal workers are taking is so difficult. There is no way a man can work this stupid at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and this is probably the point of the movie. How they can go their whole lives and not see a lift is also mysterious. I didn't take this movie too seriously, but it was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without his keys? Very horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all. It's just a sad mess. I already liked the mammograms. <br /> <br /> Send it back to the sender as soon as possible.
