As a true Canadian, I always avoid Canadian movies. But now and then I get caught watching one. This one is better than most, which is mediocre. It has many of the common mistakes of Canadian films ... self-conscious acting ... excess movie films and especially the self-governing Canadian habit of using Canadian cities as stand-ins for American people. I mean to use the historic metropolis of Montreal as a place for Harrisburg. Pennsylvania is just short of obscene. I was in a generous mood. I gave it a 4. <br /> <br />
