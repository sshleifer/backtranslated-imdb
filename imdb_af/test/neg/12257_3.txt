A really strange, surreal jumble of visual ideas that seem to be extremely mysterious on the printed page; Just what Robert Redford drew for the project, one can never know. Sidney J. Furie leads this knockout trip of a selfish motorcycle racer with a milquetoast youth under his wing; the child looks at this anti-hero, and eventually begins his amorality monkey. Disjointed and off-putting - although for some, the eyes of Redford disrobing, being frightened or disrupted, may be enough to pay attention. Lauren Hutton is also naked, but all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the prurient-minded; there is simply no story. Perhaps Furie made an esoteric remark about fearless cyclists and their herds in 1970. If that were true, this Pre-Blank Generation approach returned, as the film was not a success. * 1/2 of ****
