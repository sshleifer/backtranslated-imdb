There is nothing mean or angry about this movie. It's just dull. Dust is photography --- the film stock looks old and fades and is washed out. Maybe it was even 16mm inflated to 35mm, and not. Deaf is the writing, which is boring and 'Jules Pfeiffer' ish. This is sort of 1960's bossa-nova cocktail party cool. Like our Beatnik, grandparents may have talked if they really wanted to appear straight. The slice-of-life characters were mostly irritating. True, they really were to life, but hey, if I want to see ordinary people really do everyday and ordinary things, I just want to see. I won't quite walk to a theater and blow up five chicks, and an evening to see if anyone else is doing it. <br /> <br /> I expected a funny, bright rom com. What I got was more like two intelligent and moderately talented 19 or 20 year olds could have produced a new video camera on their first day. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 4 out of 10 because it seems someone was trying at least.
