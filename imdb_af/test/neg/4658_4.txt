I have to say that I had low expectations for the movie before I watched it. All the people around said it was great, but I knew perfectly what they wanted. They love Aerosmith's song that is really big, they love the amazing special effects that have cost a lot, they love the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love Affleck who, in my opinion, is a very bad actor who didn't try. to be one, fail and now he is nothing. And all these things plus the reviews and ratings I've read on the internet have given me an idea that the movie would be a great disappointment, because I'm a big disaster kind of movie fan. Well, I was right, but at least I was prepared. <br /> <br /> The movie is really commercial. That is said, but I'll say it again. We have more than $ 100m in budget, we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors. They are popular with the fact that they rarely agree to become part of the movie of a commercial movie if their names are not written with large letters on the screen. Like Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi who are highly respected actors I also love. They can play many characters in many different kinds of movies. They can improvise, they can change tasteless lines into hilarious jokes. In general, their little movies can turn into really interesting, funny or dramatic movies, people love and always love. Like Fargo in Buscemi's case or a simple plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I'm very disappointed that they took part in Armageddon. Thornton plays a clever and refined man involved in politics if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drill crew that is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid that disappears. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like - well, I think I'm already understanding. I've pointed out bad factors. The story is boring, artless and stupid. It is so obvious that the film depends on the effects and the dramatic end that it is ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that can be considered art. At least it's not so obvious that the film is made for financial purposes. Other than that, bad acts of all the great stars. The jokes aren't funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes they don't make sense. In fact, I recently read that Ben Affleck Bay asked if it would be easier if their astronauts were learning to drill, if drillers became astronauts and Bay's answer was simply "Shut up!" which is a very funny story that perfectly shows the creators' despair. <br /> <br /> Surrounded, I give an explanation why I give 4 to the movie. Well, I like "Don't miss a thing" and I was impressed by the special effects that are of course the only good thing in the movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the only 2 good things I like about the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and Both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon who were and will always be one big bad movie.
