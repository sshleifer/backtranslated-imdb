This movie starts out as if it were a comedy. It seems almost the actors are reading cue cards, especially in the airport order. William Smith plays the role of "Caribe," a hunter who is quite distorted and confused. Smith apparently always plays villains like The Ultimate Warrior (1975) and The Frisco Kid (1979) to name a few, though the rogue in this movie looks ridiculous. It's one of those movies where senseless things just happen to fill screen time, like the girl who's been chasing and the long, foolish motorcycle race. I give this movie 1/10. I would like to see this movie at Mystery Science Theater. It would be hilarious.
