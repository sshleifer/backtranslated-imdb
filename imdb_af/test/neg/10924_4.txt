Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice function was perfect for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> I laughed aloud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. Then the joke behaved thinly. If a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that takes too long. <br /> <br /> Weathers, pronounced by Ludicrous, have several rough and funny one-liners. Unfortunately, it's all the boy's pet, because he doesn't carry anything else. Eventually I got so bored with his remarks as I did the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of South Park, and other adult-based animations. I also play several online pimp games, so I'm partly into pimps stories. The transition from little boy to pimp was brilliant; But then both the story and dialogue are redundant and predictable. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a five. It is worth looking for the great concept and voice work. Just don't expect much else, or you'll be disappointed.
