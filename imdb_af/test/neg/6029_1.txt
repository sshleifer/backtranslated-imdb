It's the worst war movie I've ever seen, possibly the worst ever made. I find it incredible that some people rated it as a 10. It has an incredible lack of even rudimentary traces of realism. Almost every clique of clique appears in this movie and is done badly. On the other hand, I wouldn't have watched it to the end if it wasn't so remarkably bad that it was amusing me.
