The operative rule in making this movie seems to be "never a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene." It was a principle that was beginning from the beginning, with an imperishable long presentation of the Harvard class graduation ceremony of 1870. The point of the scene was supposed to be some of the primary figures in the story before. set and give them some background - which is slightly effective when comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation with the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it just keeps going and sets it up The stage for a film that has repeated thoughts contains nothing worse, because I have found a considerable amount of dialogue to be almost incoherent. Eventually I couldn't even see it in one meeting. I got about half of it and had to put it aside for a few days before I could drag myself back to see how it turned out. <br /> <br /> My reaction to this movie is in many ways a shame. because there are positive here. The performances are generally of high quality, especially by Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - as it is about everyday mindless nothing - may be interesting, with the emphasis on immigrant efforts to establish themselves in Johnson County and a local livestock industry's efforts to reverse them through a number of them to bring life to life. cooperation with the government and the army. There are also some breathtaking scenery. Having said that, the whole thing can be honestly done in half the time - and should have been. In the end, all the potential positive ones are wiped out by - again - the mental nothing that the film seems to turn around. Serious - 2/10.
