This Spaghetti Western uses three American protagonists who take away some of the typical spaghetti aura. The plot is about an amnesty that gives the New Mexico governor all the willing criminals to give them the opportunity to start a new life. Usually this kind of event is limited to past events, but in this movie it seems more like a license to kill because even new crimes (such as the governor threaten) are forgiven. The story is an endless chain of murders where almost every character has the sole purpose of delivering more carcasses. Only the pair lead the stamina. Clay McCord is haunted by nightmares associated with a childhood event where he killed incredibly many people. In the midst of the eternal tribulation, this kind of reflection is lacking in credibility. Compared to similar films such as e.g. BANDIDOS Not one of the characters in this movie was nice to me. <br /> <br /> Apart from the poor content targeting some clients, this movie is well shot, sets are somewhat detailed and the acting is average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
