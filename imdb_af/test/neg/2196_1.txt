[As a new decision for this year 2005, I decide to write a comment for every movie I've seen in the theater (10%) or in DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I have to admit that DVD has relived this habit. For example, I can hear the true voice of the cast, which is an essential feature of the personality. In my country non-French movies are baptized and we end up with aberrations: French voice is terrible, very far from its original tone! same voice for different people or the same people with different voices !! <br /> <br /> And if everyone found my comment unusable, well, in 2006, I'll stop my reviews ... Oh, Ah ... So enjoy it now !! ] <br /> <br /> My summary means the story, places, cast are not very pleasant. <br /> <br /> Only .... <br /> <br /> Sandra bull is there. She is a talented actress who can get the viewer on the film. <br /> <br /> It is reminiscent of a female "refugee" .... So if you, after a moment to escape your life, watch this movie, make it worse because Sandra's life is a mess. <br /> <br /> She has nothing more to hold on to, just her poor mother (what is Alzheimer's disease: again the touch for depression) .... <br /> <br /> In fact, she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie, has a sad life throughout it, to finally get back to it. .. what a happy ending !! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the authors wanted to make a point about a nerd's life .... <br /> <br /> Far away from the best computer movie of all time: * WARGAMES *
