Soft and light Edward G. Robinson (like Wilbert Winkle) decides to end his banking and do what he wants, open a "fix-it" repair shop behind his house. Mr Robinson is married, but childless; He is friends with the local orphanage resident Ted Donaldson (like Barry). Young Donaldson is a zealous workshop assistant and sees Robinson as a father figure. Robinson's creepy wife, Ruth Warwick (like Amy), is unhappy with Robinson's career choice, and convinces to return business to her idea of ​​normal. Their lives are further disrupted when Robinson is set up. <br /> <br /> The war also disrupts what an interesting story could be, as Robinson's character fights against a dominant, uncontrollable woman. Possibly, filmmakers show how war can save marriages and positively lead life. Robinson and Donaldson are a nice team. Robert Mitchum has a relentless part. The finite "trick" by Mrs. Warwick and Donaldson are predictable.
