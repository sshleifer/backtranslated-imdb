Sorry this movie was made bad for TV movie. Are the rest of you on drugs when you watched them? I thought the hair, makeup and characters were poor 2-dimensional types. The story is doubtful, especially since all the main characters are dead or nearly dead. I don't think it's done well either ... what was the hair on the captain in the tortoises? It looked, and the sideburns seemed to fall at any moment. It didn't feel like something new in the story of the band was revealed and how the members met other bands, and people. I laughed all the way, Frank Zappa looked silly, so did Mama Cass, and so did the Beatles. They were made up to look stupid and ridiculous. Also the other group of people like Jim Morrison, Donovan also had a big hit to look stupid as well. Kind of terrible, if that's how you remember these people. It's a poor history lesson on music, it's fictitious as it was made.
