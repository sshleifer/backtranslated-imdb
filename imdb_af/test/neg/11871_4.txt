Let's get one thing straight: I love Snipes' work. In contrast to his other high-kick contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme) he can actually act. However, this film does little to improve its reputation; It's not exactly incompatible - but I can't see it again. In fact, if I never saw it again, it wouldn't bother me - there are just a lot better movies out there to waste me! It is a pity that it could be a valuable film with a little imagination and somewhat subtle changes. Instead, the director opted to almost scramble his audience with too much violence and very little characterization. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have is with Snipes's co-star, Silvia Colloca. It surprises me that the makers of this film have all made the effort to rent a beautiful (for my money anyway) and talented actress like Miss Colloca and give her such a pathetic one-dimensional character. If she is hired to add a little "glare" to the movie, she doesn't do it so well; There is no nudity in the movie and no sex scene is worth mentioning either. Strange, really. Given the amount of violence in this movie, it surprised me why producers took such a conservative attitude towards sex and nudity. Do we live in 2007 or in 1957? What the manufacturers of this garbage (and probably also the actors) have forgotten is that films are meant to be fantasies. Like most of the inhabitants of this planet, my real life is very boring. I want to chase terrorists, handle me like Mr. Snipes and a beautiful young thing like me. Colloca hook. This film doesn't fit any of those fantasies very well. That's exactly why I give it such a bad review!
