There is potential with 'Tell No-one'. A quirky and intriguing plot, and a French take a very American story. But for me, the opportunities were not exercised here. <br /> <br /> Although I had aspects of this movie, there were three prominent shortcomings that reached it to four out of ten. <br /> <br /> First, it's a stupid, cleaved murder mystery. A specific Murder She Wrote or Bergerac. Being French doesn't eliminate this problem - it's just stupid and in French at the same time. It is full of indisputable coincidences. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the US-to-France transition seems chronic. This French doctor hangs on the "streets" of a French city with its new "homies" and their blingin 'SUVs ... and then there's the car chase ... <br /> <br /> But third and third Usually, this is not too long to kill. For me, a movie is a good reason to be significant over 90 minutes, and more than two hours take a serious justification. This time it didn't.
