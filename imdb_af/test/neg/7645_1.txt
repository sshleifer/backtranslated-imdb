This movie was terrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story had a call on the far left hand. I consider myself a moderate, so I could see this movie as the stack of garbage it was. While I'm not a Bush fan, your aversion to GW is not enough to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> To start, the movie was shot at such a low-grade movie that it came down as cheap, rather than artsy. In addition, the characters are seriously lacking in depth. Chris Cooper's character was a poor parody of George Bush; better suited for Saturday Night Live than a dramatic movie. The rest of the characters are clich√©s and are poorly fasimile to other characters from much better movies. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
