It's the worst movie I've seen since a long time. Historical accuracy is completely non-existent. For example, James Wolfe, who was portrayed as an anti-French Canadian, was shown in London in the summer of 1759. Indigenous people are like Indians of a bad Hollywood movie of the 60's: They wear skinny clothes and ride horses (The Montagnais never ride horses). The film takes place in Quebec City, but footage is in Louisbourg, which shows the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The original scenario was supposed to include the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, but the producers dropped this idea. say the cost for uniforms and participants will be over $ 4 million! I think they never heard of reselling. <br /> <br /> All the movie is planned to be a new Titanic: an impossible love during a historic tragedy (the fall of New France). There's even a song performed by Celine Dion at the end of the movie (Yeah, I've stayed to the end of the movie, but I'm very sorry). But the worst of all is that this movie costs 30 million dollars. I just don't know how to spend all this money. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my anger, but I'm just too irritated.
