Italian filmmakers like to snatch American movies. All our movies, and as often as possible. <br /> <br /> I do not call it a trunk against Italy as a whole, but I would also like to note that the Italian film industry itself is causing great damage by allowing such types of overseas to be seen by the world in general. That's all I say. <br /> <br /> And no more serious injury, the Italian people are exposing themselves to not being a harsh punishment for those who made the world watch "Shark rosso nell'oceano" - which is indeed a ripoff of the much better "Jaws" (as if you didn't know). <br /> <br /> Let's dive into the plot (Get it? Haw-haw ...): this great monstrous swim that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and Steven Tyler, falls a lot innocent Americans (ie Italians) on the coast of Florida (ie: Italy) and the fearless Peter-Sopkiw with his anorexic, beer-swilling girlfriend and other beer-swilling people whose main goals must be eaten by the essence by mysterious powers that want the being left alone or just turn around and otherwise be useless (and swill beer). .We are the doctor in this movie who repeatedly dying patients (20, maybe 30 times in a row) without waiting for his panel to recharge (must be There is a good battery there, doc.) /> Then there's the monster ... brother, if you thought the Shark's Shark was fake, look here and change your mind IMMEDIATELY. /> <br /> This is a movie directed as a memory (by a Bava!), edited with an onion hacker, written by ambulatory (beer-swilling) pieces of driftwood and written by (PRESUMABLY beer-swilling) people Who should never be left near a typewriter, movie theater or big city in the world. If that is how the people who made this movie act real people in such a situation, they obviously made too many of their zombie films. Or too much beer filled. <br /> <br /> Should I say this movie is bad? It's: bad like green cottage cheese; bad like a Hawaiian shirt at a formal wedding; bad as the "Bad Theater" sketch Dan Aykroyd was used to put on "Saturday Night Live"; bad like Calista Flockhart Weight Gain Tablets - get it? Good. <br /> <br /> Mike and the SOL gang bang this beer-drunk beauty repeatedly on the head and show this horror movie as it is: horrible. Although, with a certain European charm, it is charming, when viewed through a European - preferably a beer-swilling. <br /> <br /> No stars for the waterfall, dead fish known as "Shark rosso nell'oceano"; six stars for the MST3K version. ... and now, someone for a beer? <br /> <br />
