Yes Pigeon and Coburn are wonderful, and it is interesting to watch them, though Coburn is rather let down. It is a pleasure to see the Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City in the 1970s, and the period cars and clothing. It's all good in this boring movie. The dialogue is incredibly bad, just like most of the acting. Ray and Sandy are motivated and unlikely. I've had this "training to pickpocket" routine a few times before. There is a long build up that does not lead to anything. Better catching an episode of "Streets of San Francisco", or one of many great crime / hijacking films. To name a few, there are Bedtime Story, redesigned as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Sting, and Best of All, House of Games.
