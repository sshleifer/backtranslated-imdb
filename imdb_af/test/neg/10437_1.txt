Have you ever read a book, then seen the movie and wondered? How did they screw it so badly? This is one of those. The book by Huffaker, "Nobody Likes a Drunken Indian" was great, selfless, funny ... this movie is not. It seems as if nobody cares enough to move the direction together, so we care about the characters. This movie, which touches on the real concern about Indians, makes you wonder why we no longer saw comedies about the holocaust or slavery. Not done well.
