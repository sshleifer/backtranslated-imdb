I'm going to play this game and that's fine, I guess. I just expected a little more. The biggest problem with this is that the hacking is extremely difficult, even if you read the instructions you can't find. The graphics are also not as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game can do with a few improvements, it says that if guards fall into the water and you shoot a tough shocker in the water, the guard will pick up, but nothing will happen. I think it's the worst of the three. I didn't play the first one, but played Pandora Tomorrow, this and Double agent. However, this game deserves a 4/10. Can do with some improvements.
