I think "Category 6: Day of Destruction" was very unrealistic. The digital effects are like a children's picture. <br /> <br /> The actors did not act realistically. For example, when the girl was shot, she acted that she had plundered her tomato sauce. <br /> <br /> The movie was boring, but I watched it because it was on. <br /> <br /> The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, he was funny! <br /> <br /> Keep the special effects real. <br /> <br /> I like the comment: "What did we do to piss-off the Mother Nature?" <br /> <br /> I don't know what to write to fill the 10 lines no. What else can I say the movie is so boring, I think my comment will be equally boring.
