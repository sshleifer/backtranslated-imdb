Wow, even American Idol and you think you can dance, now has more adult stuff than WWE (at least the auditions have a number of people who have abused the judges) and here is WWE, plodding with one of the worst moves in TV history, by changing himself into PG. Now that I sometimes switch over to see what's going on, that's what I get: <br /> <br /> 1) Hornswoggle, the ugly midweek, shares its space with the main events for apparently no reason, except excite the young fans and of course Chavo Guerrero, a capable wrestler, beats every game <br /> <br /> 2) A host (arghh ....!) every week to enjoy the teaspoon of the fun was to spoil. All this host is cheap B-grade celebs who are trying to make giraffe again, by making horrible 5-year jokes and making stupid references. 3) Cryme Time and a female wrestler (forget her name, probably Eve) give lessons on various "street" words (sob) that are not street or cool. They were nice, stealing things and noises. <br /> <br /> 4) The divas are dressed in irreconcilable outfits, tied their best to look sexy, smart and powerful (incidentally, I hate this catch) Remember when Torrie, Trish and Sable were there? It was the times. These divas are also bad wrestlers, who collect the misery. I saw some old WWE games in the Vintage Collection and the divas above were "professional". amateur. <br /> <br /> 5) PG moves to limit so many things: almost no blood during matches, DX is very annoying, John Cena even does more about his patriotic act, crowds containing many children (which is so annoying), almost no "heels" etc <br /> <br /> 6) And yes, why do PPVs so often. One in every month, did they lose it? No real feud or rivalry has ever been created and the one being done looks at counterfeiting and only at the PPV get-over-one. <br /> <br /> 7) Vintage Michael Cole and some of his quotes: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, you're what <br /> <br />" assault (he does not use it for anyone else). Randy Orton / Legacy "<br /> <br />" An evil attack on Stephanie McMohan, Triple-H's man !!! ??? "<br /> <br /> WWE is now almost in the direction of its downfall. Hope Vince stands up from his sleep and does something (brings back the TV-14 or posture). 2 out of 10 for the current state of WWE.
