This television program is stereotypical and far-fetched in many of its aspects. <br /> <br /> First of all, the institution. All the characters attend PCA, this amazing boarding school with painted, stylish dormitories. The campus has no reasonable rules - for example, the boys are often seen in the girls' dorms, and vice versa. But it can be simple because the sleep advisor, a stupid character who basically aggravates the viewer instead of entertaining them, as I assume her purpose is supposed to be, sits down and does nothing. I have friends in residences, and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show. <br /> <br /> Next, the characters. I was so disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon was not creative at all with the personalities in this show. They are all representative of extreme features: Zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does (look, degrees, sports, guys, judgment, creativity, etc.) Michael is the jock, Logan is the arrogant joke that basically does nothing. In addition to aggravating all the characters as well as our poor viewers, Nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow keeps straight. A, Dana was the tough girl, Quinn is the unrealistic 'smart kid', who makes them consistently fun, Chase is the man who is afraid to confess his 'true feelings', which really aggravates me if the performance continues, and new girl Lola or something is just another clone of Nicole. <br /> <br /> The most important two characters that make me worse are Zoey and Quinn. First, I don't understand Zoey's character. She was apparently created to be the "perfect" character as I said above, but she seems to be the most flawed of them all. In most episodes she creates a problem, then it needs to be fixed. What is frustrating is that we have to keep her and think she's great if they haven't even created a very realistic character. <br /> <br /> Quinn, on the other hand, bothered me because she was exaggerated to the point where her character was absolutely offensive. The impression I get from Nick about her character is that 'geeks' and 'nerds' are people to laugh, to criticize, to mock. In the spring-ending episode, they did a year ago, they launched two more nerds, which made the characters cool. I found it very offensive and stereotypical. What kind of message was Nick sent to these kids? Is it: Don't do well in school, don't get good grades, don't study hard - you'll be a geek and we'll mock your profession in the future television series! Because this is definitely the message I get from these poorly constructed characters, and this is a terrible message through and through. <br /> <br /> All I can do is hope Nick realizes one day by intelligent people in our world they don't do any good.
