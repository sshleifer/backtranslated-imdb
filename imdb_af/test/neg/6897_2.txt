... I usually hate words, but it seems the only appropriate summary for "Barnyard". I guess I'm not the first. And I'm sure many, many comments focus on the idiot of bulls with udders. It really bothered me from the bat. But there is much more wrong with this movie as a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work. <br /> <br /> Personally, if I was a parent, I would be irritated by the violent turn that made it near the end in revealing the coyotes. (Though it was a small action for me, I inspired it anyway.) And from a conventional screenwriting perspective, you can expect the coyote to play a bigger role in the conflict (Give you a widow cow. .. Maybe her "husband" was killed by coyotes? No ... this is a very dull explanation.) And what is a farm here? Otis vows to protect all animals from damage, but there is definitely no threat to humans. They refer to the farmer who is a vegan, but why does he make pigs? In all the children's animal stories - Babe, Charlotte's Web, you call it ... the reality of farm life is at least touched. Perhaps our friendly farmer is offering some kind of rescue shelter (there is a reference to this, but this is never explained.) But all the farmer in return is abusing a horse in a scene that supposed to be funny, but left me. seriously wondering if he would be buried in a shallow grave behind the shed. And what is the deal with Wild Mike? It was like the Gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without the gum. <br /> <br /> Add some real awful efforts to emotional scenes, an almost complete lack of laughter and THAT OUTDOORS, and you've the worst child movie I've ever seen. I usually only give a message to IMDb to highlight a film that is not so well known - not to relax the current # 2 checkout hit. But this movie ignored me. There was room in my local theater, space that could be used to show something worthwhile. There was very good family entertainment in the summer. In fact, there were at least 2 more children's films playing on the same multiplex. But I can't see something like "Little Miss Sunshine", so Viacom can cheat families from an extra $ 30. I had at least a free pass. <br /> <br /> I know that if a 35 year old without kids, this movie isn't designed for me. But there's just no excuse for such a lazy, horrible child movie as "Barnyard" at Pixar's age. I was bored by the "Ice Age" movies, but they certainly didn't make me angry like "Barnyard". "Shark Tale" was a poor attempt at street hitching, but it has quite a few laughs. For that reason, you can turn on Nickelodeon anytime of the day and see something more entertaining and intelligent. Therefore, they should be ashamed to put their name on this garbage. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 2 out of 10, just because Pip The Mouse was sporadically amusing, and Maria Bamford has some entertaining lines as the farmer's wife. Well, not the farmer's wife. Other farmers. They didn't really explain who she was. They didn't explain many things. Especially not why Sam Elliot - the ultimate "man's man" - has an udder that was walking around there. Creepy.
