I watched this movie about six years ago and I did it recently. If I remember correctly, I didn't like it for the first time and I appreciated it again for the second time. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is on a big budget. The effects are mostly upper side (except for one or two "impacts") and the casting is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show. <br /> <br /> First, who decided that Peter Stormare should act as a crazy Russian astronaut, should be discharged. As a Sweden and a fan of Peter, I'm pretty sure he can play a Russian character well. But his performance in this case is simply silly, both with respect for the lines spoken and the acting. So ... something should be wrong with the writing. I would like to see Petrus as a professional Russian astronaut. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the action scenes taking place on the surface are so intense that it is almost unbearable to watch. It's a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes, with too few moments to catch your breath. In addition, the events that unfold simply aren't credible. I would like to see a much more meaningful and stripped version of this part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the screens that include flying spacecraft are biased. The shutters move as if they were a few MIGs, at zero safety distance, while shooting large-sized ice cubes like ping pong balls. The director has to watch Apollo 13 to learn the spacecraft's limitations like this. <br /> <br /> I like the music score, because it is dramatic to some extent. The overall performance of the actors is wonderful. Apart from the above, the story is interesting and fairly easy to follow. <br /> <br /> With a few small changes it would be an 8/10 movie. I'm sorry it's not!
