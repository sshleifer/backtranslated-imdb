This is one of those movies you watch because it's bad. Such a movie you just watch to see it is spectacular craftsmanship. It's probably an abomination, I can't imagine how someone can fear a clay bath, especially one that is transparent in nature where you can see the actor's legs behind him. <br /> <br /> Even without any budget, a bit of attention to detail and even an attempt to make this movie credible, the fun would have sucked straight out because they had to put all the actors and the whole story replaced it. If I had nothing to do while playing, I would have stopped it after 10 minutes and have some quality art like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAVE HAVE). <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend Brett Piper get to Quintin Terrantino and really a few stools. <br /> <br /> :)
