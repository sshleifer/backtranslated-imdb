Oh, dear gods, it's terrible. Stay away, just stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never before has my brain done so much as I did when I watched this movie. The acting, if allowed to be called, is enough to cause internal bleeding in your head. The story is so thin it's just barely there ... no wait, scratch it. There is not a complete story there, but a few times there are a few thin lines coming from all the horrors, and believe me, those few lines had to be shot. The best way to enjoy this movie is to drop napalm and watch the precious fire from afar. Some may call me sarcastic in this review, but I'm just trying to save some of you. of a serious headache. However, if you are, what I would like to call a visual masochist (like me), please go straight ahead and look at this monstrosity.
