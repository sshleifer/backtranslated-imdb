First, I take issue with the title of this movie. "Chupacabra" is not a Spanish word. The name they refer to is 'Chupacabras'. I think they dropped the 's' because it sounds plural so, but I assure you, this is singular in Spanish. Next, I thought this movie was done years ago. It came down as one of those B horror flakes I watched when I was an early teenager at home when my stepfather was out of town. Then it would have been so frightened. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the special effects. The most important 'effect' is the costume used for the Chupacabras. As it is the main character, you would think there would be serious money, but it is not. The shape, color and texture were all goofies like a silly haunted house at Disney World. <br /> <br /> There were times when the Chupacabras walk where no one could walk. His movement was shocking and strange at these times, but moving on the floor, looked like any normal man. <br /> <br /> Another thing I pay attention to is that there is no animal in the world that doesn't kill everything around it with no regard for eating it. The Chupacrabas would kill one, then the next, but it never seemed as if the victim had actually eaten. You say, "It's just a movie," and I agree. But the idea is so far there that it's stupid. <br /> <br /> Which country is Dr. Pena van? He sounds kind of Jamaincan / Hawaiian / British / Something-Else, but I think he's supposed to be Latino. The problem is, his accent is so bad that even a Russian can say he's not Latino. <br /> <br /> The soldiers fired after this round and did not make a dive but continued to fire. I'm not a military man, but don't have soldiers, especially the special tactical forces like this, a bit of them to perform their duties? Won't they find out that it's time to shoot and try something new? They didn't. They just kept away while the Chupacabras continued to kill and not eat. <br /> <br /> Did they kill the puppy? :) Anyway, my voice was 3 for this movie because it was bad. Why did I watch the whole thing? I'm sure you did the opportunity simultaneously, so don't give me a flack. ;)
