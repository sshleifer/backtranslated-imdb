As a fan of the old series, I have to say that it is at best a parody of a beloved series. First, the old series would at least try to follow a military structure. I know in this P.C. world, it's not the thing to do, but hey, don't wear it in the care. In the old series, Beachead was a tough soldier, now he's a teenage mutant turtle. Another thing is the flying tank, and it flies out of the cobra base and knocks off the copter and they are both good ???? Let's see if the next one is not better, it can end the G.I.joe game.
