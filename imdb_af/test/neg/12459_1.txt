It was so rude - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the "thief" was obvious. It was a poor man (not called high school) "Less than Zero". I will surrender this movie as it adds very little. So many problems are left unresolved, and it is good - but the fact that it is jumping to the point where you are wondering exactly what is happening is terrible. The voice ear is needed because the movie does not work alone. Avoid this movie, and watch something about rich teenage anxiety. I'm sure there are many others to look at. Don't waste your time on this.
