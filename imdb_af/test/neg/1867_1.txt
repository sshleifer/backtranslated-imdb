All movies containing "goofy sound effects" must be shot. If there is one thing I HAT, it should be the use of a Whoop Whoop Whoo when someone touches one's head. The only movies I've seen are Ghoulies IV and Hobgoblins when they're in the bar, and Pixie hits the man in the red suit with a beer bottle ... or rather with a beer bottle for him. Never really touch him. Yes Ghoulies IV suck. But I have to wonder, did they mean not to let go of the so-called "Ghoulies" monks when they apparently spoke? Their faces are almost as static as the masks used in Trolls 2. Hell, I can make a better mask from construction paper, some rubber cement and a handful of glitter. It sucked.
