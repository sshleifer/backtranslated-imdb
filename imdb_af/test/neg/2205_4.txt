I'm a great Randolph Scott fan, so I was surprised and disappointed to find he's scarce in this movie! The movie really belongs to Robert Ryan, who is the hero in the jam, and one caught up in the love triangle. Good sadness, Gabby Hayes gets more screen time than Mr. Scott in this movie !! For many viewers this is not a problem, but I'm from the Walter Brennan school of sidekicks, not Gabby Hayes. Although I would say his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this movie than in many of his films with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. <br /> <br /> Personally, I saw the movie very slowly, with a complicated plot that was even more disrupted by the unnecessary romance subplot. With the complexity I do not mean impossible to understand or find out, I just mean too messy for his own good. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfactory coming - at the end. The whole movie comes across as fake, unrealistic and poorly filmed. <br /> <br /> Likewise, you don't think I can find anything good here. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her short parts of this movie. Not sure if it was her song or someone else, but whoever was, had a very nice voice. Mrs. Jeffreys also had some nice plays. The writing needs either much more of her, or to completely remove her character. As it was, her beautiful moments were not enough to help the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Mr. Scott. He looks fantastic in this movie and is the no-nonsense legal representative to fix things. Some people complain that his characters were too good before 1950, but it never bothered me. I will do well or good before the year 1950, or eagerly and violently after 1950 ... Randolph Scott was actually a true Western hero. <br /> <br /> It's my sadness to say that, but I'd recommend passing this movie over unless you're a hard fan ... there are so many better Scott movies out there that this one will not be missed.
