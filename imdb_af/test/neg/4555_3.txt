Dean Cain, once Superman, plays the superdiff Max Hooper. He can break into any company and steal something for the right price. Unfortunately, his last lift ends in a rise in which someone else has put a fire to hide their own efforts to steal the product. Now the thief finds that he has to save the hero who saves everyone in the building. Unfortunately, the other thief is still in the building and the V.B.I. & C.I.A. Outside waiting for Max. <br /> <br /> The movie is hardly negotiable. Dean Kain is a fun actor and has done much better with more improved material, but here he is with poor writing and very poor direction.
