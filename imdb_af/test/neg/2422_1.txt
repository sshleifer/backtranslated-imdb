This movie is probably the worst movie I've watched in a very long time. The acting is so wood a door could have done a better job. The plot is lazy and shallow and the actual "rugby" shown is far from reality. I still don't get the "haka" as depicted in this poor entertainment excuse. I'm not a Kiwi, but I know that the Haka can only be performed by someone from Maori's origin and not by an American white boy. <br /> <br /> I suppose it's made for the American audience. So the independence and the "Disney end" are excusable, but the basic rules of the game except the prison team, where the main character suddenly takes control of an American football game, are not being used. The only good thing about this movie was the final credits. Spending ninety minutes to place toothpicks in your eyeballs will be less painful.
