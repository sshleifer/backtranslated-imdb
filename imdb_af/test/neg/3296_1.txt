A stupid performance in the style of the rest of them with horrible music and a laugh track from Lucy. I got rid of the TV because of such shows, but picked up the first season on big parties for $ 3.00. I would have bought the Van Damme movie. <br /> <br /> If I was a conspiracy theorist who believed that a small group of people work against real families and continue with this fool / propaganda to undermine family values ​​I would point out on this show, married to children, family old, etc. but I am not so I will not. <br /> <br /> VAT I'm not Christian, like the Simpsons and Peep show. I watched two episodes and thought that if such shows were popular, with whom were they popular? Then I remember all the photos of the people of Walmart walking around the web and thought ah ha!. It's no wonder our culture is a joke around the world when it's the first time.
