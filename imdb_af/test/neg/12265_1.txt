This film proves a theory I've had for some time - in Australia, as long as a movie deals with the right topic, it will be a success, no matter how terrible it is. Aussie Park Boyz may not be worse - the play is over, the plot is basically a poor Warriors beat, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea of ​​ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in the 21st century Sydney! The last time any Irish gang was in Australia was about a hundred years ago at the thinkers!) But because of ethnic rivalry, one of four topics is guaranteed to be a success in Australian theater ( Along with struggling families, minority groups, and the biography of a well-known Australian, he has won several academic awards. I have always suspected that Australian critics would pick up any junk about these issues, but some of me thought, or at least hoped they had their limits. This film proves otherwise. So, for all of your Australian aspiring filmmakers out there, don't put your mind in your movie or pick people who can actually act or even get your facts done - just write a script about a poor family trying to meet ends or someone from a strange race who comes to Australia and has to deal with racial prejudice and stereotypes, or if you want to take a leaf out of these people's book, some ethnic gangs are fighting another ethnic gang that is not likely in the period the movie is set, and your movie will win five academic awards, no matter how pathetic it is!
