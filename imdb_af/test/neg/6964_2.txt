Bela Lugosi as God? Transvestites discussed in a movie in the straight 1950s? By golly, this must be an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I felt a combination of guilt, pleasure and nausea at the same time. The story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his cross-decoration ego Glenda. Somehow, if this movie was made now, I could see Kevin Kline playing Glen / Glenda. Notice how all the cross decorators' alter egos are versions of their masculine name (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). It attempts to depict it as sympathetic as the mental disorder it is, rather than as a graphic perversion. <br /> <br /> In one way or another, Wood manages to sneak into slavery and S&M rows in his original story of Glen / Glenda. Along with these racial scenes, Satan shows himself, which of course has a bad day. The dialogue and pace are inconsistent, but the film is pleasing in the context - the strange world of Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Sterno says on your favorite pants for this one.
