I've seen several stage and movie adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. My family unknowingly bought the DVD and couldn't even make it through the first half. I went back later and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it was a Christmas gift for me) and was just terrified. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor (and it's hardly enough to save the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker's Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken a bit seriously. Other than that, the songs are half-songs, the melodies are half-melodies and even Meryl Streep can't look this way well.
