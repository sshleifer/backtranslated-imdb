No idea how high it is (5.8 at the time of writing), but this movie was absolutely horrible. The acting wasn't bad, but it didn't really matter and the overall quality was poor. Of course, this is a B-movie (or a C if such a thing exists) and it looks like it's been made over a weekend at a friend's house or something. I'm all for low budget movies and I usually look at any one I come across, but this one is really very bad. I mean, like "The Fanglys" bad. I don't know what to say yet, but trust this because I have indeed sat through this horrible horrible movie and I can spare you the trouble ... Don't bother. Seriously ... Just not.
