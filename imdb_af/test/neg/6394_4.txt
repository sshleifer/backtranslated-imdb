I saw it in the theater a few decades ago, and unclear reminder indicates that I liked it. However, to see it for a second time, two things stand out: (1) very poor of Michelle Johnson, and (2) very poor music throughout. <br /> <br /> It's not that all the music wasn't bad. Some of the Brazilian music was good, but the theme song and others who climbed their way were reminiscent of the worst 80-year-old pop music. <br /> <br /> Johnson's voice was all wrong, possibly called. This is distracting. <br /> <br /> On the positive side: (1) The story is not bad, (2) It is interesting to see such a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper never looked better, and (4) Johnson looked at various disattire stages.
