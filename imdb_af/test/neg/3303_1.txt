Above all, you shouldn't take this movie seriously. It takes itself seriously, unfortunately, but it can't be helped. This anime ninja movie should be the crown performance in the pampering, which is an engaging, indestructible, storyline with bad plot twists, ridiculous time-killing scenes and a shameful guest look that will make you laugh or groan (or both, like me ). <br /> <br /> While usually a fan of ninja / samurai anime (Ninja Scroll and Rurouni Kenshin to name a few), this one should be the exception. For the record, from a technical point of view, this movie was very well animated and built. It's just the plot that has hit. The authors of this movie have clearly decided (for what rational reason I do not know) that they could somehow make up for the lack of a script if the character halfway across the world is looking for a treasure she father learned and died. In the process he hit a black slave named Sam, met a French girl living in an Apache village, making friends with a ninja clan whose members then tried to kill him, met more family members, then he knew he had the strangest places and circumstances (and which all die later at one time or another in the movie). <br /> <br /> So far, these ridiculous plot moves can be excused, but then the two "guest appearances" come. # 1: After a ridiculous cliche performance with two cowboys, Jiro meets a man who introduces himself as Mark Twain. At this point you probably say, "What is the ****?" This "meeting" serves one purpose: it condemns a movie that tries to add an educated historical background. I have found it disappointing that the authors have made every effort to investigate the 1860s in the US and did not realize that Mark Twain's real name was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally gets the treasure, it seems it belongs to Captain Kidd. I can now hear the horror of horror. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are the current scenes. These scenes show different characters, with the landscape static behind them for a few minutes, and there are plenty of them. These are the scenes that make this movie, 2 hours 12 minutes, to look like a week and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a bad caption movie just asking for fun, this is it. Feel free to have fun on every aspect of it, and have fun. Don't take it seriously. 10/03
