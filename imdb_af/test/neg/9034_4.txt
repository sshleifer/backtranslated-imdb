Labeled for Death (1990) spends more time on action series than it does with the focus on its characters. After his first two impressive attempts, Bo the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third Steven Seagal picture makes the idea clear: anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool; The bad guys are just there to make him look good. <br /> <br /> Seagal constantly built an audience that was slightly larger than those following the kicks of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> In Marked for Death, Seagal throws any pretext on style and head full acceleration in exploitation. This film contains numerous graphical violence, gore and nudity that seem to be no other reason than to use beloved movie-goers, who cannot distinguish between action-workers who tell a story and those who just throw on the excitement without rhyme or reason . And he deserves a real blame for this decay in taste as a producer of 'Market for Death.' <br /> <br /> Seagal plays John Hatcher, a retired DEA agent who comes home to Chicago, where his family is attacked. by a Jamaican street gang, attacking his sister's house and proving that it is not squeam when Hatcher's cousin (Danielle Harris) is shot in the crossfire. Hatcher gets angry, and he decides to work with his old friend, Max (Keith David), a school gym teacher and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican policeman. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hatcher declares war On the worst bad guy, a frightened Jamaican voodoo priest, called Screwface (Basil Wallace) a nickname that apparently means "far-fetched". <br /> <br /> And it's almost incredible in the way Seagal picks up a number of gang members: he throws a man's eyeball, breaks a man's back and breaks numerous arms and limbs. <br /> All logic for this movie is thrown out of the window - through the glass, that is. Why is Hatcher and friends not being charged for all the damage they cause or the accumulation of the body? And how did they get their cabinet of automatic weapons from Illinois to Jamaica by plane without being traced? <br /> <br /> Seagal has a Clint Eastwood stoicism about him who once looked fans to enjoy, and despite the three different characters he played in so many movies, they each wear Oriental black bathrobes and carry a ponytail. One of the problems I have with Seagal's films is that the main characters are never in serious danger, and because he is the star, no one can, of course, put a glove on him, except the bad man. </ br /> <br /> Seagal's heroes are all interchangeable, just like most plot lines and action sequences. Regardless of whether he is a cook, a firefighter, or a L.A. cop with love beads, Seagal, Seagal is always wanting his fans. In fact, the gathering of these films is such that, if I wanted, I could take an old review, change the names and have a fairly accurate version of the new movie. Not that I would really do it.
