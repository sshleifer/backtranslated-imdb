Of course I disappeared into the movies. The Neil Young concert film 'Heart of Gold'. <br /> <br /> Over the years there have been very good concert films. The best is Martin Scorsese's "The Last Waltz" who filmed the band's last concert at Filmore West. A phenomenal concert and a phenomenal movie, that is, if you love rock and roll and feel like you were born in it and were part of the music and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone you would show the chords and that with a few chords and a lyric or two that you can change the world ... as you can guess, I have felt five to the bottom of my twenty-four year old soul. <br /> <br /> Neil Young was in "The Last Waltz." They had to digitally, digitally, scrape them manually a large hanging cocaine rock that had squeezed out of his nose, so in the movie there was a bright light that didn't hang the star of Bethlehem over his lip and under his nose no. It's a well-known piece of rock and roll history. <br /> <br /> But "The Last Waltz" was made when the band and Neil and everyone else were in their thirties and "Heart of Gold" was filmed last year when Neil was in his sixties and his band looked like they is in their late nineties and the entire film can be used visually by Christian Law and the DEA in the same way that the Ohio State Patrol films were used by the dangers of drunken driving when I was in high school and that dead teenagers were asleep affected. front windows or hanging from trees or bloody in a ditch. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes and it's a fantastic concert, open it and watch Dorian Gray's hidden portrait. The eternally beautiful Emmylou Harris literally comes out of the darkness to sing with Neil and from dark to light, which seems to be a ring wind, jumped the full front of Rivendale out of the river. Strange, haunting, a nasal that does not occur in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery. The eyes that look like buttons on dolls are lifelike, and the ability to express any emotion, human or not, limited by unobstructed hearing in Botox. . My thoughts reeled ... porcupine ... Peru ... Jack Daniels ... live hard for decades ... my god ... sweet Emmylou Harris I saw for free at Fred's in Boulder, a 2000 year face Dead Pharoah didn't want to accept. But the voice, as pure as a thick, bottled beer beer, from the waters of Boulder Creek brewed and I closed my eyes and ammmmmbbberrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrn Fred's hamburgers in Boulder Mall and Steve Martin Pink Panther movie). <br /> <br /> It would have been a huge concert in the dark in the Ryman auditorium, maybe twenty rows back. But close, close, it was a medieval morality pattern depicting the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life. <br /> <br /> The concert theme, in the countryside, a Prairie Wind ..., the last song, massaged guitars (I counted eight) and I wondered if irony was going on. I do not think so. A native American basic player, a lead guitarist who watched and dressed like Buffalo Bill, a piano player whose face looks like the scream's face in Munch's The Scream, the chick singers (actually matron singers, one of the lost ones) senior United youth reminds flight screens that still enter the friendly clouds dressed in matching the full length of the experienced denim dresses ... no this is played straight. <br /> <br /> None of them saw, I would bet, a Mighty Wind. <br /> <br /> It'll be a great CD, and will be delighted to tell stories of hippie dippy Boulder when Neil was a long-haired Canadian crown farmer, whose fearless lyrics reflected sadness and loss, feelings as universal as now. <br /> <br /> But just in a dark bar.
