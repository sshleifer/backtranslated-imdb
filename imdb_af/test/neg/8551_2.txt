Many actors have many good roles in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe some. <br /> <br /> Then there's Linda Blair. "The Devil Exporter". This is it. <br /> <br /> If you see 'Chained Heat' and Linda Blair looks at it, wonder what, anything, runs through her mind. <br /> <br /> Certainly not "Oh, boy: Oscar for best actress, here I come!" <br /> <br /> Just another woman in the prison movie, as they made cheap in the 70s, actually has one name you recognize. John Vernon plays the dean ... I mean, the governor (with a hot bath in his office wondering what he said to the contractor?), Stella Stevens appears, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how bad they work required. <br /> <br /> Specific mention, of course, for our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner who places the movements on poor Blair. To paraphrase, Sybil is like Sybil and everything Sybil does is done perfectly. Forget what a horrible movie you are watching. <br /> <br /> Nearly. <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil and another to pass Linda Blair as a gender symbol. What could they have (get it?)?
