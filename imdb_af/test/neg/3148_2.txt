As a child of the 1980s, I grew up with many educational as well as distraction programs (or both), and continue to learn so many of them, admiring the wisdom of those who worked on them. Having learned Sesame Street to be the best example, not only was I able to read on adult level before I could walk, but it only increased the level of aversion, which I was not only facing the Lyons corporation and its product feel, but those who defend them too. As if I had faith in those who assigned us to protect us or our children, the fact that Barney & Friends polluted our airwaves more than a decade later began not only for the FCC, US trade and its makers. , it is a discredit for all mankind. In a world where I can be harassed by police, welfare services and child protection agencies, it's just different from those in power, but broadcasters may pump this bump into my home unchallenged, you have to ask what's wrong with people. <br /> <br /> You see in a world where we are expected to behave like adults and count on ourselves. What we say to our boys and girls is important because it will often have consequences long after we are gone. Not only are our efforts to make our children more normal, more alike, more imaginable, potentially devastating, which we eventually learn to be normal, also play a major role. So the question becomes one of what Barney teaches our children to be normal. Apart from lessons like this, we are not good if we do not have good feelings or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we fall short. Other shocking things we see on the Barney show include Barney to molest children. The issue of child abduction and child molestation is a big one in our society. Since then we have begun to pretend that it was not, but it would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways to present the subject. /> <br /> So far, I have just mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaged lessons that Barney himself offers. At the problem the children are shown at the show. I use the word children loosely here, as the age group shown is as low as three years and as high as fourteen. Yet, no difference in emotional response is shown at both extreme. Fourteen-year-olds respond to Barney and his proposed situations in exactly the same way as five-year-olds. Experts in child and adolescent autism regard it as an unbelievably dirty thing to expose children. Adults in the autistic spectrum who are having difficulty meeting their needs are not only not met but ignored without exception, have a tendency to see it and an urge to do the kind of thing with Barney as 14-year-olds. would cry out. If disrespectful and sick as exhibits aimed at the parent-child market, as you can't do it on television, they bump into Barney by proving that not only different ages react in the same way in different ways. different people. <br /> <br /> So, in response to mdmireles1295, I have to say I hope they don't have children. For every time I see a parent showing their child this drift, it gives me an overwhelming urge to report to the child abuse police. And I speak as a man whose entire education is dominated by abuse. They can sing about, love, care or share ways, but the examples they show are not only so impressed that they are the opposite of educators, they are so exposed to realism as to becoming dangerous, as The Light Triton already has pointed out. The kind of lessons that children learn from Barney is that people do not change, feelings must be suppressed at all costs and rules are completely arbitrary. Compared to the lessons of variation that make the world move and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television has taught me as a boy, it is still the idea that the authorities should not go in and waste from the air. If a parent did to their child doing Barney around the world, they would face criminal charges. <br /> <br /> So I gave Barney my favorite two out of ten points that I give to all rubbish, with absolutely no salvation value. In a world of adults who know how to properly respond to their children, it has no place.
