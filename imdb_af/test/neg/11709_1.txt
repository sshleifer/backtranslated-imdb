This movie is included in the six women of Henry VIII BBC miniseries DVD. I loved those six movies. They were well behaved, well written and historically accurate. I actually read Gregory's book and kept it well enough, despite his great historical inaccuracies (I mean the entire false homosexuality especially with George Boleyn), but this movie didn't even mention it. The corner was one of the main points of the book. <br /> <br /> Above all, this movie leaves me "WHY?" Why do we see "The Real World: Tudor England" as someone else put it? Why are the camera angles so bad in general? <br /> <br /> Why is the writing so bad? I mean, I know it was improv, but come on! The actors on time bump and knock over their lines and it is clear that they are building them as they go. <br /> <br /> Why are the sex scenes so uncomfortable? The way they were done in the book at least made them somewhat interesting. In the movie they are just bad, about to be absolutely hilarious. At one stage, the actress playing Mary Boleyn was sex with the actor playing Henry VIII. He pushes away and she has this look on her face that says, "Hm .... I have to go to the store. Is he still done? Perhaps when he's done, I can get a little cheese soon. "Not bad. <br /> <br /> Why does Catherine of Aragon play such a small role in this movie? Her refusal to get divorce was one of the leading causes of the scandal that Christandom shattered. She is the reason why Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn could not be married immediately. Why is she not here? Over all, this movie is just bad.
