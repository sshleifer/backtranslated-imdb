Here's the spoiler: At the end of the movie a piece of you dies. You will seek the rest of your life in vain for that missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. You will wander the streets at night in your neighbors' windows as they sit down for dinner. Friends and family will try to find out when you have become exactly in the undead. You will void their questions and concerns and answer a few mumblings about a runaway testicle. When AMC inevitably makes Tomcats the "movie of the month," a series of mysterious killings will take place in your city. The next morning you will wake up on the kitchen floor, with a faint taste of brain in your mouth. Then you will crawl into the lounge and on the couch. You will be staring at the wall, watering yourself a bit and then maniacally laughing. Because once your death is inside, Jake Busey is actually pretty, funny in a thong.
