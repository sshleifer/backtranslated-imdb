After a while I realized it was just my IQ that fell slowly. Frostbite is one of those pathetic movies where nobody, and I mean nobody, even try. I rooted for the brave hero to die in that bin (how did he even manage to fit in there?), Traci Lords, the queen of B-movies, was terribly unfriendly and cut me and my friends through her boobs do not show a single time. <br /> <br /> Although the "characters", although I prefer to use that term, people are so exaggerated and one-dimensional that they may have used cardboard cuttings as well. The "jokes" (I also use this term rather) are simply hilaries. A man's fart causes an earthquake. ROFLcopter! Our "hero" gets a butt acupuncture through Traci Lords. Oh God, I can't breathe! The blind man uses the F word repeatedly! This is too much !!! <br /> <br /> Say what you want from the acting, but I thought Adam Grimes did a pretty good job of playing a mentally challenged snowboarder. In addition, the only source of entertainment here is boobs. I think I counted three, perhaps four pairs, throughout the film, scattered over five minutes of screen time. It is worth five minutes to look out of 83 minutes of garbage can. Don't look at this. Watch Barb Wire with Pamela Anderson - there was at least a lot of nudity and action in that trashy flick!
