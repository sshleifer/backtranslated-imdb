Made cheap, poorly acted and unpredictably, Flight to Mars is still entertaining, despite what it does. A flight to Mars is planned with five people (three older gentleman, Cameron Mitchell as a newspaper man and one female scientific / obvious love interest). The spacecraft gets there and finds that many human Martians live there and have technological advances that blast the earth. But everything is not rosy in the underground cities of the Martians (here are some caves and some rooms called). The Martians are a dying planet and one fraction wants the Earth alone to fix the ship. to take it off at the last moment and then mobilize for an attack on the Earth and another fraction wants to talk peace and see if they can't convince the Earth to give their living space. The special effects here are pretty lame, even for the 50-slide standards Complete with a slow-moving rocket, pastel / neon alien clothing where the women wear shorts, which will blush (except of course, the men) little less offered. Cameron Mitchell is the journalist and is pleasant as nothing else. Ite Chapman is beautiful in very short pants, but adds little acting. The rest of the film is filled with some older scientific veterans such as Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum to do serviceable work. It is not a premiere sci-fi movie from the Golden Age by any standard, but it is many watches and fast-paced watches.
