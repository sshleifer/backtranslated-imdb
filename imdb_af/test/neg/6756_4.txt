How many disaster movies can be before we get tired of them. Let's see the Discovery channel all day. <br /> <br /> I agree with the remark that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera. The Grand Foreman's grandson makes a prediction and everyone starts moaning about how to destroy the family name. The evil mother-in-law convinces the woman to throw him into the arms of his mistress, whom she wants to meet. Can you believe it? The woman wants to approve the new woman! At the same time, the mistress loves someone who does not have a wife, but she sends him the suit. <br /> <br /> Now that the soap operation is over, the earthquake appears. /> <br /> The special effects are really good, but the dubbing is bad. That's why I like subtitles movies. The actors are all very experienced and have won many awards, so you can see some of Japan's best in a repeated story. <br /> <br /> But the soap opera story returns with a kitchy end.
