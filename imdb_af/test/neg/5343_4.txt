As a writing teacher, there are two ends I never allow to use my students: "Then I woke up" and "Then I ran over a truck." I'm going to add, "Then I got a bump on the head." I feel it is totally unfair to use these tricks to cover up a lack of imagination. The whole issue of transmigration could be handled with intelligence and craftsmanship, but neither in this movie nor in it. I'm not saying it's totally worthless, but it's so predictable in its progress, except for the stupid end. There are even gang members going to the police to get help from this man. They had to do it right away. It's just a forgettable, border / slide movie, with nothing new to offer.
