I heard this Japanese movie is edgy, creatively interesting, a cool new thang on the Asian movie scene ... maybe even as innovative as Hideo Nakata's "Oldboy" or especially Chan-wook Park's "Oldboy" , especially the latter. <br /> <br /> If I filmed the film, confidential as well as kinematic (though not in a way that appreciates a film aficionado), you can imagine my disappointment, clich√©-driven, even unhappy stupid of funny --- generally, a very bad beat of the "pulp fiction" style. <br /> <br /> I stopped watching after 30 minutes, when I gave up getting something more than it was.
