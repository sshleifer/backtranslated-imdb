How can any of you call this propaganda a family movie. It's nothing but a computer, insensitive insult to small town churchgoers. The film portrays a woman as the great white savior of a small Midwestern town, and everyone in town (mostly men) is merely naked ladies in need who are unable to humble themselves and rely on the main character for redemption. This film is just a love affair that the producer has with an undisciplined, arrogant, intrusive little muscle, which he expects the audience to admire. <br /> <br /> The person who made this movie probably has his entire life in a search-sensitive church, and has the freedom to dump rubbish on small church members as wacky lunatics and not the majority. The same people who give money to the Salvation Army during Christian times collect donations to help missionaries, the poor and the homeless, sing, co-send, and make friends with each other. What is wrong with this humble group who offends these self-righteous traitors? Most Christians in this world will walk in front of a train and give their lives to anyone, even if they disagree. Most Christians would not care if the pastor, or any church worker, took a church from his or her dress (or outer shirt). They will not condemn her. This movie is ridiculous!
