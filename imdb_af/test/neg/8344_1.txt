I saw this movie and I thought it was a silly movie. What is even more stupid is it that has an idea that there must be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is, there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it must be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes that are a real fact that this movie has to be made in Hawaii's state capital. This movie has to be filmed in Hawaii because it's the right idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but there are no volcanoes. To be honest with you, it's incredible nonsense and very foolish. Finally, I won't save this movie because a Los Angeles volcano is nothing but nonsense.
