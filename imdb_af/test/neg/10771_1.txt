Before I start tearing this movie, you notice - I love the Scarlet Pimp. The story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The movie Jane Gray is very good and the music on Broadway is the hottest thing there. So, I thought when I heard that this movie came out that it would be great as it was a BBC movie. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it was a bad, totally stupid story that EXACTLY failed to capture the beautiful story. <br /> <br /> There was no exciting escape with brave disguise. There was no deep love that fluttered your heart, because Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed when her husband left her. <br /> <br /> All it had was a confusing plot and lots of outside blue sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Sink me! What a terrible movie! <br /> <br />
