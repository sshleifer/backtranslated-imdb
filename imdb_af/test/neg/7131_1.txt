It was a $ 9 waste. The movie was terrible. all the scary parts were useless and unfortunately repetitive. It seems that all the tense parts could be completely predicted, and apparently not a bit of the audience's attention. The plot line did not progress at all during the whole movie and it was just a big set-up for the resentment. 3. If the movie seems to be about to make a big plot promotion, it just seems to be a useless scene. these directors must follow Hitchcock's example: every scene has a point. Especially 90% of the screens in this movie could be left out without changing the plot. Final opinion: Don't waste your time, energy or money!
