As a big fan of Disney, I was really disappointed when I looked at this garbage. The animation was beautiful, and the backgrounds were great, but I believe that good animation does not make for a bad script and a bad story. I'm not going to agree with the people who say it's not suitable for children. Yes, there are some deaths in the movie, but is it not the death that children should at least be exposed to? But I deviated. The screenplay was beaten with bad words and lame jokes ... the kind I could expect from most dream works. The music was soup, the moral forced (and without any charm.) And the characters would burst into songs in totally inappropriate times. The characters were also cold, and I really couldn't raise any kind of emotion to them (irritation). I'm a big fan of the jungle book, Aladdin, and the emperor's new groove, but this Disney movie was a total and total waste of time ..... don't watch it !!!
