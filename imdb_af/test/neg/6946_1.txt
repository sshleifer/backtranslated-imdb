This movie isn't even good enough for the grocery store's $ 1 bin. <br /> <br /> I just bought it because Terrence Howard was in it. Guess he couldn't be too picky about his roles at this time. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was difficult to go through. It seemed as if they were trapped in straws with a storyline. The "guys night out" had to be the most boring I have ever seen. One minute do they talk and the next reciting poetry? Even the arguments were difficult to follow. Most of the acting had no depth. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they wanted to do with this one, but they definitely missed the point.
