There is an endless supply of trashy horror movies. It seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and excitement. Unfortunately, these efforts are very rare. This unfortunate movie has almost no loss of value. The story is highly predictable, most of the actors are very uninspired, or simply missed, special effects of very low quality. It didn't take much trouble to turn off the DVD and went to bed. With such a limited number of foreign films released in the US, why in the world does anyone want to import this drift. To emphasize all this, it is clear that there is an "Anatomy 2" for those who can do nothing better. I'd rather look at the paint.
