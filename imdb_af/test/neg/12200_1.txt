A complete and utter waster of my precious two hours. The whole movie could be made in less than 60 seconds by merely showing that people are being heaped up, crashing a car, people rushing up, people having sex, people crying and people rushing up. The tagline for this movie must have read: "See how our characters have cut! They are stoned! They are cook addicts! They are a mess! Who are these people? Did you really care? Just give us your money, because We're probably not caring for anything else! "An absolutely horrible movie. It never went anywhere, you never got the characters (they never even said what these people did to make such a big house, and so much money and cars and coke), and it was just boring . You may be the movie a little more if you are a stoner yourself, but for the vast majority of us who are not, this movie is a waste of film and time.
