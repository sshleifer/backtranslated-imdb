I don't understand how this garbage came on the shelves of the movie shop, it's not even a real movie! It was incredible, a group of friends and I decided to watch this one night and it was just the dumbest thing we ever saw, I couldn't believe it! We watched the first 15 minutes in full respect that someone actually thought about it and then made it into a movie. Are they on crack? My guess is yes, in large doses. I doubt anyone can ever keep this trash. Is it supposed to be sci-fi or comedy or what? I don't do the idiots who even care about it, they just decided to make a movie about nothing and to see how many suckers they can deceive to watch it. Well, we put something on the film. Let's take it to the movie store and see if they actually put it on the shelf. No, no no. It's not movie making. The play is to watch wooden puppets move around and read from a book, that's how bad it is. I feel like going to the movie shop and complaining and getting my money back, no one has to endure this crap. So I'm here to warn you - DO NOT RENT THIS FILY, that's the stupid thing you've never seen before!
