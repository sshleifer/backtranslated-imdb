This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. From the opening of 10 minutes I was ready to leave. The cliches there hit you, and the plot was not only predictable, but full of more holes than Swiss cheese. I'm considering begging for the lost 2 hours, and $ 6.25 along with the fact that I'm stupid now to watch this waste of movie. The T-Rex's must be in their graves.
