Because it came from HBO and based on the IMDb rating, I watched the first season of this series, which is a waste. The characters are sometimes interesting, but mostly cartoon-like. The actor ranges from good to mediocre talent with a S T R O N G emphasis on the latter. Not only prisoners, but also viewers must leave all hope in the cell door, that this story is credible, it is such a burden that you have unusually strong testicular courage to watch. The violence, as with most of the developments in the story, is stimulating and whatever morality is meant to be of the small variety. If your idea of ​​excellent television includes writing, acting and overall production quality in THE SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD or SIX FEET, you should avoid OZ. If you want to see a Disneyland for illiterate Jerks, watch OZ. Stuff like this gives edgy a bad name.
