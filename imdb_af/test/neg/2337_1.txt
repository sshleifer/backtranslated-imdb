Some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story, David Lynch takes 2 and a half hours to make plays with 'clues' and his trademark strange, but there's never a story. No plot. No progress on the characters (unless you find a "progression"). It amazes me how someone can call Lynch's garbage "art", but if beauty is in the eye of the boyfriend, it must be so. Lynch's film and TV work in the 1980s came down as "avant garde" and "alternative", well. 20 years later, working like "Mulholland Drive" comes off as a 2.5 hour David Lynch masturbation piece. This is embarrassing. I finally saw the movie taking my top spot as the worst ever. At least the people who left "Godzilla" and "Rodan" did not leave them as "art".
