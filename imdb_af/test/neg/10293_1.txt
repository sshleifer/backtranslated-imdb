I went to the theater to watch a movie of this movie without knowing it. Recognizing Jennifer Lynch's name and seeing the 18 certificate I realize it can be disturbing. In fact, I found the movie a farce. I giggled through parts of it in disbelief. The play is horrible, Bill Pullman and his ridiculous face. I almost regret the actors although the writing does not give them any chance of any credible character interaction. After a shocking incident (there is plenty to try "and shock the viewer in this movie), 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather. Everything was over-stressed or thought it was smart The show of the girl character, Stephanie, was the best of the movie, silent and intense, I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone, his violent no-point, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad writing and simple stupid.
