Playing the Clare Booth Luce plays and the 1939 movie is a huge disappointment. The role of women is excellent, but most of the individual scenes work but nothing is related. There is no connection from scene to scene, almost as if the film was manufactured in parts and then mounted in a vacuum. Giving the story of a woman who deals with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age where divorce is so common, but at the same time it is just as timely as always. wish they could have managed to tie all the pieces together, because as it stands now, you don't really feel drawn by the plot. Waiting for cable.
