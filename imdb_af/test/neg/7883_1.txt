This film is about two female killers going on a tour to kill random men they meet. <br /> <br /> "Wow," Baise-moi "has just become the worst movie of all time in my list. The plot is crazy, useless and unnecessary. The whole movie is full of violence and sex, and I'm sure no healthy parents will show this movie to their children. I don't understand what people come up with by making this movie or watching this movie. Maybe someone somewhere fulfilled their distorted desires. There is simply no excuse or reason for the existence of this distorted and depraved work. <br /> <br /> The only consolation I give myself is that I looked ahead of time so I didn't have that much time.
