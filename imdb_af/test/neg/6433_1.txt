"War is in your blood" Rambo said early in the film, "Don't fight it". What do you say? Is the screenwriter going to the Mickey out of Slye? It is impossible for anyone with primary school education to miss the joke here. Yet Stallone stole it without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor applies to the movie. Rambo IV is an exaggerated, idiotic action that would have been funny without intent if it wasn't sick. A redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so shameful is not enough to just kill them ?? you have to suffocate them with pleasure. Stallone does not stop at a blue band clich√© to make his point. It's not enough for the main villain to feed-them-to-the-pigs, throwing babies into the fire kind of sadistic. He is also a homosexual pedophile. <br /> <br /> What happens to IMDb? Is it taken over by the Rifle Society? How can this ominous excuse for gross exploitation be so high? I like a good action movie as much as the next man, but it's not fun? it is pornography of violence that trivializes and eventually unleashes the real tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly doesn't take out his shirt. For this I will give it one star ...
