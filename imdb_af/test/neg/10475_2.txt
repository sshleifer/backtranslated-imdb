This movie wasn't very well aimed. they almost ignored the book. I think they were trying to save 2 times. the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played Finny was cute. The dialogue between the main characters appeared a bit gay, which was not the case in the book. Large parts of the book were cut out again. You have lost the overall effect, it was not as haunting as the book and made me lack it. Even the strong language, although short, was very unnecessary. I was also surprised (not pleasant) by a new character who was not in the book. One of my favorite characters (leprosy) was poorly interpreted and portrayed. He was more sinister in the movie than the real leper in the book. About all the disappointing ones.
