Despite being a Made-For-TV movie (and an obvious one: it was cheap), CLASS WARFARE left me because I could get my money back, and considering this lamp production is partly funded by Canadian dollars, I may just be entitled. <br /> <br /> What made me sit was, in the first place, actress Lindsey McKeon, who I took in the role of "goody-goody" Mara Lewis on the soap opera GUIDING LIGHT for the past few years a turn to play the "bad girl" for a change. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, she's doing pretty well, like Kristen, a spoiled b * tch rich, who suddenly finds her dirty arm, but with a cut and a twist of fate, making her prosperity possible will change. back to. The distortion of fate is provided by Richard (Robin Dunne), a social-radical publisher who discovers that he has just lost nothing to win $ 23 million on a lottery ticket. Now, Richard, Kristen, her Jock boyfriend Jason (Wade Carpenter), and their companion-obsessed mutual friend Graham (Dave McGowan) sit for a weekend in a remote cabin cut off from the world by storms and just think what unfold. <br /> <br /> The movie suffers from obstructing the story and character personnel and motives. Everyone is pretty one-dimensional and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to find out that some things, and some people, are going very fast. I don't think it's the original plot and it's not his way of making himself more. The play is OK, McKeon is a stainless as well as the manipulative female head, and Dunne is very good, maybe a little too good, but no one else is worth writing over the house. The only other real credit I can give the movie is the one turn I didn't see, but the end, but one is so obvious that it hurts. Regardless, I put it through and told the story so I couldn't say it was a complete write off. <br /> <br /> 4/10. A "something-to-watch-when-nothing-else-on" type movie.
