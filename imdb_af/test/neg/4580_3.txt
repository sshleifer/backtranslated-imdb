Just watched the movie tonight in a preview and it's just a movie for kids. It doesn't improve or add to the original Disney movie in any way. There is a critical Scottish Pastiche style throughout, not helped by poor writing (where motifs are caught by the spit-free) and acting uneven and often inconsistent (despite reading like a decent casting). I have no problem with the beautiful dog - although there is some "Skippy the Bush Kangaroo" (see below) quality over his shots. <br /> <br /> * For those who don't know, "Skippy" was an Australian children's TV series from the 1960s where the kangaroo was an essential part of all the stories. It is said that, to get poor old Skippy to "act", they held an elastic band around his mouth, which he then tried to get off his feet - like communicating with human actors! Bobby has a similar series and you don't buy his heroic range. <br /> <br /> Advice will be given to children aged 8-12. They may be scared below. In addition, if they like you, congratulate you, but it is a strict cardboard enlargement for the unashamed. This is a missed opportunity because there is real pathos and gift in the story of Bobby and this movie fails to deliver it.
