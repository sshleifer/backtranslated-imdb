Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can see the same movie with one of them who likes it and the other one hates it. As for 'Halloween: the curse of Michael Myers' I fall into the latter category. <br /> <br /> In 1978, I believe John Carpenter made one of those decade's best scary movies, which, despite his shortcomings, remains good in the 21st century. It reused many of the old horror movie devices, but used them in original and effective ways. It had no preview that it was something other than a movie about an escaped spiritual patient who had childhood on Halloween night. And yet there were 'ideas' in the film, but they were subtly introduced and not hammered into your skull. It placed the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what happened in the story and it did it with a wonderful ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The 'filmmakers' of this 'movie' will probably not even understand the previous paragraph. Therefore, we are satisfied with this miserable and improper piece of disposable celluloid. Direction, writing, acting are the lowest strata imaginable. It's the kind of movie that's so sensible, lethal and obscene to make you crawl back into the womb and die. It is also really sad to see veteran British actor Donald Pleasence wasting his acting on that toy pool of a movie. He has been drained of all his energy and thanked him for being his last movie. Maybe that's what killed him.
