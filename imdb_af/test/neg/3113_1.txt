I had to read, I know why the caged birds are singing in my English class and we watched the movie after it's finished. After watching the movie, I was sorry to see. It completely removed the impact the book had. The scenes had no meaning in their sequences, the acting was terrible, and the author seemed to have never picked up the book, but rather chose the stone notes. I was furious about how the movie ended. Almost half of the book was cut out and some aspects were extremely important to Maya's growth as a person. If you read ... Caged Birds, this movie will ruin the experience of the book so I warn you not to see it.
