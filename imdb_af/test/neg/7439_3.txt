A useless cash in with nothing to contribute except nastiness, this is a definite case of messy seconds for Robocop. Irvin Kershner's deadly, plot less and tired mess of a successor is vigilant and even slightly entertaining in a dubious, unpleasant boring way, but it has virtually none of the original's flair, emotion, intelligence or excitement. Instead, we have just another empty spectacle of a hobby whose only reason to exist seems to be the observer with unrelenting violence, which is far more brainless than anything in the original. Omni Consumer Products, which made the original Robocop cyborg, changed to more than a totalitarian power than ever the second time, rented with suspicious Nazi esquire banners, storm trooper guards and tanks; As for the Anonymous Old Man (Daniel O 'Herlihy), he is less of a benevolent protector and more of an abominable Mr. Burns type, which surrounds itself with moronic mangoes who truly believe the brain of a murderous psychopath in the body of the all-new Robocop 2 is a good idea. Oh, and the first Robocop looks somewhere in all this mess, but you're wondering what on Earth has seen a good actor like Peter Weller in the screenplay. Threshold Tom Noonan has nothing to work with as the villain, while Nancy Allen is bad as Robocop's partner wastes. There are a few hilarious moments; the opening of 'Magnavolt' commercial, for example, but it is a poor follow-up to the truly great original.
