It's the most annoying and frustrating game I've ever experienced. Each time you turn around, the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you cannot pass through. The cut scenes let you control your character's movements, but only to a small extent. Also, you have to play the game for about 2 hours just to pass the intro / tutorials. It's awful! I'm afraid if I play this game further, I'll finally break something. This game sucks. The graphics are good, but nothing special, but the game is terrible. To say I hate this game will be a great understatement. I sold it, but I want $ 20 back. What a waste!
