This documentary was boring, and quite stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... the documentary author doesn't even know how Darwinian evolution works? This is a theory, and the name is just stupid. If you read a textbook of college biology, the documentary author could tell it what Darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory, but evil if it is done politically. <br /> <br /> Also, there was no real evidence in this documentary, but an interview with some people ... no expert testimonies, and shadow leads ... <br /> <br /> documentary was also boring. I mean it could have been up to 35 minutes, and then it would have been much better. <br /> <br /> There is a much better documentary than this ... it wasn't worth watching ... you can get better information from Wikipedia = D don't waste your money and time!
