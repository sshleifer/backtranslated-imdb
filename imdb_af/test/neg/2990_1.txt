Bad, ambient sound. Very shuffled. Loooing useless scenes. Eg: man sees interesting woman in the lobby. Manage there to stay and see her under the prospect of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package. Say nothing. Stares creepily. More fluctuating and other annoying environmental noise. Wait. Wait. Wait. Guy says nothing. Woman looks scared or at least slightly disturbed and rightly so. Driver comes back with package. Guy goes to the apartment with the package. <br /> <br /> Another example: the man and his host are sitting around watching bad TV. More environmental noise and shuffling. Waiting wait waiting. Guy wandering in bed. If you can stand by watching more of this movie, you'll see them watching TV later. <br /> <br /> If you want a story, have some dialogue, entertainment or a well-crafted movie look elsewhere.
