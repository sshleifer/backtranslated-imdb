Of all the movies in the history of movies, I can't imagine anyone sitting down and saying, "I want to spend X dollars (or pounds) to repeal the defective classic movie" Breeders ". Many stories have been turned into movies about meteors coming to Earth with something that is sinister inside. Why not make your money instead of making a spectacular 3D remake of "It Came from Outer Space"? Why search a little nudie movie that just existed to point out a rubbery set of monsters and some naked cows? Was the writing for the 1986 version of "Breeders" so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and done correctly this time? When you get there, the only reason this movie is, is to show Britcom candy Samantha Janus. But if you are going to make a skin patch and use Sam Janus in it, you can only be naked and naked if you want to. <br /> <br /> Meteor land. .. Escape ... Cow Duff their clothes ... Monster eat people ... and another "what if?" ends ensues. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I never thought I'd ever recommend the original "Breeders" over any other movie, but it will be the one that comes second.
