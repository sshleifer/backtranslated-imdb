I just attended a preview of this movie. A masterpiece of the documentary film was not. Completely absorbed with its subject, the film does not allow any kind of critical comment on me. Faye to level. Cloying and sappy, the only redeeming quality of the film was the use of dolls in an attempt (though a failed one) to structure a kind of story. But the most beautiful experience took place when the closing credits rolled. The audience got up and cheered. Like moths to flame, Americans were still drawn to freak shows in the 21st century. The story of the misunderstood monster becomes rather tired.
