I read the recent comments and couldn't wait to see the movie. But having put 80 minutes of predictable "surprises" that didn't even make me jump and were unrealistic, I was very disappointed. I thought cartoons were the only movies that were only 80 minutes long. I thought it might be because of the changes to make it 'R' rated, but the original only contains ten minutes of 'Kill Bill' type of blood. When blood sprays like snakes, reality loses the appeal. Add in the killer who is supposed to be a "ghost" but can tear off someone's head from the shit (ala King Kong with the T-Rex), live by everything and end up similar to that of the soprano final and you may well have the most filmed movie in the past year. After watching the movie, I felt that I saw countless movies with the same plot and method and felt greatly dissatisfied. I don't know what everyone else saw, but if you want a good horror movie this weekend, see Halloween, it's definitely worth $ 10. When it comes to Hatchet, let's hope the next one is based on the book.
