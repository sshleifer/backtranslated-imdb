If you watched Pulp Fiction, you don't see this movie. This movie is not funny. This is the worst parody movie ever. This is a poor attempt by parody films. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad. The movie is bad. This is one of the worst photos ever made. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend plump fiction. I prefer the original Pulp Fiction by the great Quentin Tarantino. This is one of the worst parody movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Plump fiction is not a good movie. It's not funny. It's so stupid and vulgar.
