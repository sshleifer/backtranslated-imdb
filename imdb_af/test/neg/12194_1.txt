What is the point of this movie? It starts out as one movie, then changes the track, cheats us from a resolution on that movie and ends up as another movie that is nothing but pale, pale imitation of so many other sklock-horror flicks you've ever seen do not have. The overall impression is confusion in every way and lots of hubris. Screen game by Tarantino, direction Rodriguez, two guys who previously showed talent but who now believe their own hype and accept that everything they do should be good just because they did it. But it doesn't work out that way. You're just fine while you are doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: What is George Clooney and Harvey Keitel getting involved with such useless liquor? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy? totally relentless and effective ?? and it would have been interesting to see where it was going. But of course we never do it. And the Clooney of the vampire movie turns into a completely different character. It's not smart or witty, it's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks very sick and comfortable, and no wonder. Didn't anyone in the studio get a look at the script before this project started? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual devil (and why he assumed that we would find the rape, abominable murder and victims of an unbiased hostage-funny). On each level ?? except the technical? this movie stinks. Avoid.
