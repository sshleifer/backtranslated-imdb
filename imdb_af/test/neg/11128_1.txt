When I drove home, I bought movies for my four-year-old twins. I bought this movie that my kids will enjoy. I looked at my children. My 10 and 17 year olds were about to throw up. In this movie the father looks like a tard. My little ones will see it every day. One day they threw away all our movies. I am selling the Omosis Jones movie on Ebay. My Grade: F ++++++++++++++++ I'd rather look at the worst dress list. <br /> <br /> My kids hate this dumb movie now. Give the idea that germs can talk to each other. I wonder how the silly movie sounds in Japenese. I broke the CD in half when I was annoyed to see it again and again. No offense, but Brandy and Elena's scene was the best
