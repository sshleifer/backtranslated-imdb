The film is nothing but a nudity outline. Did anyone notice that all three main female characters are naked? It seems the only winning match for Portuguese filmmakers is to include the nudity of the local stars, along with the snake, who is horrified by the contemporary Portuguese society. If you watch Portuguese movies on Portuguese TVs, they all included a "hot" scene from the movie. I'm not saying that Portuguese society is alienated in any way; just that the film industry is unable to find other ways of success. Go back to the movie ... There is nothing more about the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. The film could have been a good one, if the real idea of ​​the book (of actuality at any time) is emphasized and not the strict erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients ... but the "chef" was terrible ...
