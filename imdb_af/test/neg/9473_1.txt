I saw Roger Moore hoffing it on the screens that required walking or exercise. He was a James Bond who would sit most comfortably at a bar telling stories with his fellow British knights. Nothing against the elderly in age groups, but how realistic is it to a 58-year-old man who is weak on the wings of aircraft, hanging on the side of a train, swimming in a swamp with crocodiles , etc. ? Apart from the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly stupid, deadly and moron, the fact that a weakened parent who was involved in many death-defying stunts made it so much easier to laugh at James Bond. By 1983, Roger Moore was clearly at his age, and he had long passed the time he seemed to be fighting with younger men. I saw this movie in the theater, and the weeping of the laugh was very and very often. Any credibility James Bond built was after OCTOPUSSY. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing from OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his supporting role. Another low point was that the amazing lame Louis Jordan was half the ashes of the evil. Jordan helped to make the whole concept even more fussy. And the Russian general was a total goof. OCTOPUSSY works better than a comedy ghost similar to SPIES like us. <br /> <br /> Even the battle scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train stations that were performed by many better actors in many other films. Take the North Emperor (1972) where Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine fought over the top and bottom of the train and looked exciting and real. <br /> <br /> In 1983, Roger Moore had a thin, fragile body. And yet, his stunt was clearly a younger, higher, athletic and muscular man. Even the hair color did not match. It just made his fighting scenes more comedies. The Moore stunts look like the old low-budget Chop-Socky Kung-Fu movies, especially with the bad editing. The director tried to make the bad acting and bad stunts better by providing several views of the same stunt. This only double the differences between Moore and his stunt. The fact that the train tones were shot with Moore in a studio, can be noticed from the lighting when Moore was in the lap, over double the outside of the stunt on a real train. Although many of the Bond Movies have to be the worst ever when it comes to editing their stunt battles. You can usually see clearly that the Bond actor is not actually fighting. Overall OCTOPUSSY should be ranked as one of the worst movies ever made, and easily the worst of the worst Bond movies.
