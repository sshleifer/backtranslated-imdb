No, I'm not a radical female who bases the hentai and yaoi genre. I just find it really boring and useless. My God, I was able to see it for the initiation of some dumb punk and me, even a MST3K movie has a storyline, not to mention that this HENTAI crap is what Anime is a bad name worldwide (look out for the Sailor Moon!). Unfortunately, people do not realize that not all Anime (or any other Asian style) is messy porn. after the stereotype !!! <br /> <br /> * Begin Ultima *
