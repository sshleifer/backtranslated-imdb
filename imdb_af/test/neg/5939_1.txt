If Andrei Tarkovsky was a hack, he would have targeted Mother and Son instead of Mirror. It's the most pretentious movie ever made in the world, I'm convinced. A boy, without a name, cares for his mother without a name. They love each other, I think. No, they don't know, I'm sure. These are not characters. They're not even actors playing characters. Anyway, it might be nice, but even nature looks ridiculously touched and changed where it was needed with a Macintosh computer. And can Sokurov act with a technique as a distorted aspect ration? You had to be born yesterday to buy this garbage. 10/01.
