Simply awful. I include a fairy tale warning here, just because there are a few jokes in the movie. There is nothing else to spoil, because it is already rotten. This froth was made during one of the vendors' "For a few bucks more" periods, if he'd been out for a few bucks. I saw it as a 15-year-old high school student in 1972, and then scared it off. No need to see it again; After 35 years I remember it now as one of the top five worst movies I saw as a child. As I recall, sellers had more of a continuous cameo role as a lead over here, but even his presence could not make the annoying jokes, lame plot and child reform easier. One continuous theme revolves around the use of his fingers by the salesman: In one scene, he holds his open hand to a group of medications. By folding his fingers, the groups for which a hospital exists - the interns, the nurses, the administrators, etc. until his only middle finger got up, then he said ... and the patients! She has. In another scene, to avoid expensive laboratory tests, he puts a finger in a urine sample and puts it in his mouth to look at sugar, and then exhorts the interns who are gathered around him to do the same, they do. He then advises them to place his middle finger in the urine, but sucked the index finger, and advised them to pay attention. Hey, Hey. (The only reason I remember this, and this movie, and I write this review, is that a friend told me an even thicker version of this "joke" today). If you want to do that, you're really going to move. If not, see "Hospital," with George C. Scott (from the same year 1972) for a truly wonderful black medical humor. Better still, read "The House of God," by Samuel Shem, and if you can, see its movie release, which has never been released (please make a copy and send it to me - I'll finally see It) .
