The brands in this movie, such as Suit Supply, get away from the story because it's supposed to be eighty in the years. It's not a very exciting movie. Also one of Intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus that is repeated repeatedly, like "I'm a cruel man, I take everything away, I'm a cruel man I'm here to stay .. "Jeeez couldn't have achieved that better? I think they wrote it in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It's really annoying, just like the product placement in this movie, which is cash in controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity. as he is now made to be, but should be forgotten as rats should be.
