I bought this movie at a garage sale when I was like 15. Then I hated it and looked again, just for hell, it's even worse. You can scream the director and cameraman in the background commands like "Zoom, Zoom, Zoom !!!". It's no special effects, just a raw piece of meat that is supposed to be a brain. It's absolutely crazy, and I originally thought it was one of some kind of home movie or something I bought. But it has been distributed elsewhere and it is very strange to know that others have seen it. Who do I need 10 lines .... Well, it might be an interesting thing to see how non-budget movies were made for the invention of digital cameras. It sucks. Actually, yes, just look to see if you can get the worst. If you can make it through this, you can make it through anything.
