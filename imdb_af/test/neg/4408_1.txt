I wasted my time. This is very pretentious movie. In the beginning you will think there's something going on, but by the time about 30 minutes you realize nothing happens. I waited another 20 minutes and then I was so frustrated that I started reading reviews on IMDb and realized that the director wasted precious time on so many people. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring sensible movie. Stay away. So very good soundtracks. I'll give one point to the police inspector joke because it worked for me. I laughed for a long time, but otherwise a very bad movie. Stay away.1 at 10.
