I can predict the authors of this story thinking this script: <br /> 1.Let's make a serial killer movie such as Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat, and Silence of the Lambs. People love serial killers. It will sell ... 2. The killer needs to adopt a kind of pattern. I know; he will copy it from a series of killer story novel. It hasn't been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3. Now, we need somehow to make this movie unique; Of course, the good man can be in the back window. 4. Finally, we need a turning end that will give the movie the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. <br /> <br /> Well, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so don't waste your money. One thing I really hate about filmmakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and run them completely in the ground. I had better stories than this when I was in Junior High. I just checked my watch every five minutes. When the turn finally came, I was not shocked, I just said, "O. Who cares?" The characters are two-dimensional. They have your typical movie personalities. This movie is only evidence that the elements of other successful movies steal are no excuse for a bad writing. I give this movie 1 out of 10. Normally, it would earn at least 2 or 3, but I'm so sick of the unoriginal. When will they learn? 10/01
