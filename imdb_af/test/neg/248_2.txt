I saw it at Mystery Science Theater 3000, and even that show couldn't really make this movie. I can make a better movie with a broken video camera and action figures. Of course, you expect terrible special effects with a movie this guy, but I saw silence that was better. The storyline has huge gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even on some scenes. The cameraman obviously doesn't know what a tripod is, and has too much coffee, or something louder, because the camera is ALWAYS shaking. I couldn't even follow the plot, but that's enough to say, it's the absolute worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I've seen an "Epic Movie" for a while and have decided to give this movie a 2. It's NOT the worst movie I've ever seen!
