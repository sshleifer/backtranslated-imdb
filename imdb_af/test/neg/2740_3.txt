I just looked at descent. Gawds being a horrible movie. To the right of the bats they portrayed a lava geyser and a note states that it is miles below the surface of the Washington state. People, there are no geysers deep in the earth. They thought it looked neat and in typical Hollywood style they threw it in. And then there's so much mirror lava. He dropped a stone and I heard a splash. Steam would have broken out before an explosion of lava, if ever. <br /> <br /> And the acting was also bad. Micheal Dorn sank to a new layer in work. <br /> <br /> What a movie dog. I'm sure the voice does not go higher than a 3.5 <br /> <br /> It didn't look like the SciFi channel spent much too much on having a beautiful sign from Perry.
