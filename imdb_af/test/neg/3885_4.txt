Okay, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss. Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (England's backbone.) She was killed in the first scene - that's right, people; This show has no backbone! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Ol 'Colonel Cricket of the First War and now the decorated Lord of the Manor. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own, but still glamorous (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to make a toy have the side. It's good, they have spotlight. Cricket's full knowledge and consent (they even come around for Christmas!) Yet she is considerate for the colonel enough to tell her son's toy boy (what a gall!) <br /> <br /> David McCallum said toy boy, just as aimlessly glamorous as his knee. Pilcher couldn't get a cover for him within the story, and she gave him a beautiful job at the Circus. <br /> <br /> and finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire as Miss. Polonia Teacups, Friendly Chief of the Friendly Girl Room, serving tea in her office, with a little deep, gripping advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best piece of advice: "I once went to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England). I thought it was very beautiful, but somehow, not part of the real world." Well, we can't say they didn't warn us. <br /> <br /> Oh, Susan - time was, your character would be the whole show. They don't write them any more. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - with a role and setting like this, are you rebuilding "Brideshead Revisited" right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. At the same time, play is one of the oldest tempo work out there. (You call another!) <br /> <br /> First warning sign: lots and lots of background. They get to shoot it outside - "Hey, it's just the sunlight!" <br /> <br /> Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. If she didn't cry, her eyes were damp. This is the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is "dewy-eyed." <br /> <br /> From now on Leading Lady will be known as LL <br /> <br /> Third warning sign: LL actually has stars in her eyes when she is in love. Yet I will give Emily Mortimer an award just because she has to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder. Did they use contacts?) And lastly, fourth warning sign: no screen female character is "ma'am" She's either "Miss. " Or "Lady." <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, I couldn't tell you who followed who and why. I couldn't even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> Summarizing: They all live through World War II without anything happening to them. <br /> <br /> OK, at the end, LL finds her losing her parents to the Japanese prison camps and babies come to the cats. Meanwhile (there is always a "meanwhile") a young man, LL, had a loved one (when I didn't know) of a difficult time coming home and being found on the street by Lady of the Manor. Street as SHE will find him there.) Both war crimes are being driven away to recover at Nancherrow. Some must be turned away in these novels!) Great drama.
