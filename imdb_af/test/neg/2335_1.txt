seriously, if I want to make a movie that makes zero sense, never, and with lesbian scenes as the only high point I can have. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is the worst, like this movie. anyone could have made a better movie in which at least some answers were given and the story was not so slow and long lasting. the story means nothing but the end but the credits. what a waste of time. I will never get the 147 minutes of my life back and hope others can learn from my fault.
