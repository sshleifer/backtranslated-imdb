Yes, it's me again! Sir, I'm sitting by crap so you don't have to. <br /> <br /> What do you think it is about? Could it be possible for a woman who calls a sex line and arranges to meet babies in a secluded area? Then her crossed boyfriend comes along and shaves his throat with a razor before saving with his cash? Wow, what a guess! And if I tell you that the policeman on the case is forced to work with a sexy assistant DA to nail these suckers, what conclusion do you come to? Do you think the sexy DA will be wearing a thin red dress for an attempt to meet the queen of the draw, but eventually be kidnapped and saved by the maverick officer? (who has already handed in his gun and weapon) ZING! You get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie bored me to tears. Why do people insist on making this kind of garbage? This is a waste of our time, their time and yet they still do, regardless. A movie that nobody gives is filmed. If it has any redeeming qualities, it's the fact that it has been some of the most beautiful ladies I've seen in a movie for a while. I hope they have saved wages on many botox and colon irrigations. They will look good on Vogue's front page, or sit at the top of a car in a bikini. They just have to leave with the professionals (like Shannon Tweed). <br /> <br /> Talk about future careers, I ran the director today. He probably makes a nice chicken burger meal. I also have to say that the uniform really suits him. I asked him about 'Party Line', and his eyes went to the floor before mumbling over extra fries. Oh yes, don't think it really worked out. Remember, they let him take the ride tomorrow! Hurray !! 10/01
