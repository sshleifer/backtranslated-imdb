This movie is so bad, it's worth seeing. This movie will expire viewers inside and outside a coma within the first 10 minutes. It all started when a bunch of writers got the idea that a plane was hijacked and a passenger who could fly a plane had to land the animal. However, they know it's been done many times to make it different, let's do it very badly! Major Masters has its name pirate from the 80 movie "Live and Die in L.A." from character played by Willem Dafoe. It saved 10 minutes in writing and production time. The plane is supposed to be a Boieng 747. The plane has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic forward bump at the top. Just ask the late Ronald Reagan who complained about this point when they fired Ruskies in the 1980s KAL 007. However, if the plane drops it, it is not clear that a 747 looks more like a 767. This well-researched movie also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cabin and replaces it with two comfortable rumbling seats. No need for a flight engineer on this complex plane! Heroine is played by constantly shouting Gloria Lynn Berg. After the hijacker was trapped, despite several buses carrying people on this jumbo jet, no one was disturbing to see this man who had almost killed them all. He was just forced to entertain himself. <br /> <br /> The liner, which leaks fuel from all the hijacking grounds, won't make it back to Hawaii, so Masters will try to land at an air force base located on an island. Only the runway's 300 feet are too short! Four lower guys with a bit of Bobcats (the kind you hire to ride a load of horse all day) will clear a 200 foot and 300 foot long swing through the jungle in 20 minutes! No need for a bulldozer here! Where can you get those guys? These guys can make a highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours that are just fitted with tablespoons, a compass and a duck! <br /> <br /> Then the clear obstacle will be fixed. Masters will try to land the plane as a heroine. pouts away. Hijacker giggles for itself and without supervision gets free to make more trouble. He is eventually muted in a most delayed way that I can't tell you. But, can you say Moby Dick? <br /> <br /> There are so many delayed scenes in this movie. The wounded captain tends to be placed on the bar on the plane, while Masters, who are thought to be barely able to fly, drop the plane into 60-degree banks and 20,000 feet per minute. The pilot must be French to kiss the ceiling during these challenging stunts, but do not open an inch. <br /> <br /> I think if they chose different actors to play the parts, this movement could have been better. If we need a rogue heroine in the movie, why not choose better-known actress Bernadette Peters who also looks equally stubborn? Besides, she can sing and the bitter, well-aging Peters can contain some free rock shots. Now with the sanghoek it can be a hijacking, let's fly the plane MUSICAL! Cast Luciano Pavarotti as the pilot. They can sing a duet in the cockpit before the hijacking and there is no way the tumble tower will fly to the ceiling, as Masters works his magic on that big bird. In line with the music theme, Masters can then be played by Andrei Bocelli, that Peters can sing while landing the plane. He is not only completely blind, but knows only a few words of English. Now it's a plot! Think of the edge of your seat conversation between Masters (Bocelli) and the Air Traffic Control: <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, please turn back to 180, folds up to 25 degrees. Keep 230 heading" <br /> <br /> Bocelli: "What?" ATC: "Sir, poor spoilers now, confirm brake pressure at 250 psi. Maintain descent at 500 fpm" <br /> <br /> Bocelli: "What?" <br /> <br /> The hijacker could be played by the late big Rodney Dangerfield who can spray an abundance of one linen while tied up and unattended: wife is in group sex. Yes, she screwed me in front of the judge and the jury! "Get the idea? <br /> <br /> UNSTANDED OPPORTUNITIES The movie has your standard of crying and groaning, which never develops. Woody Allen could be one of his neurotic monologues on the back:" She said I was nice in the bed. I told her I practice a lot myself ... "Now it's a movie! <br /> <br /> According to a similar movie" Executive Decision ", lazy eyes are mercilessly killed by Steven Segal, giving 747's" a great opportunity to give the movie a chance. The plane was introduced in 1969, so who knows what has accumulated up there in nearly 40 years? My uncle has old clothes, a sleigh, magazines and all kinds of stuff in her. it was not cool if Masters opened the trap and saw a teary Eyed Chevy Chase in a woman's living room while watching old Super 8 films of his childhood? Just a recommendation. <br /> < So it gives a chance, and if you fall into and out of consciousness, think how big this movie could have been if I had my hand in it ...
