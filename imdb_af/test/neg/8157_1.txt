Although I am a fan of Heather Thomas and I have some of her old bikini posters, I can honestly say that if the only movie I ever saw her was "Cyclone", I would never guess why <br /> <br /> Directed by Fred Olen Ray (see almost as a man like a buzzards circle over head in the desert), this story of a woman (Thomas) who is a high-tech motorcycle Protect from unscrupulous types is about like a B movie like it (or in Fred Olen's case, "B minus"). <br /> <br /> The casting itself should tell you something. . It's not every movie that Thomas combines with actors the caliber of Beswick, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblyn and Landau (!!). If you're lucky, do very little movies. And even if they seem to have fun, shouldn't that fun be conveyed to the audience? I agree yes, they do not seem to have voted. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you ever wanted to see Heather see an uppercut to another woman, use the F word and get stuck on battery cables, I'm probably looking for this one. Myself, I'll be happy with the old "Fall Guy" reruns. <br /> <br /> One star, given in the hope that when another "Cyclone" town hits, Heather runs for shelter. I know I will.
