It does not surprise me that the creators of this hopeless movie could not find a British distributor and then released it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. The distributors could clearly see what the filmmakers and the Sunday newspaper couldn't do, it was one movie that would not recover its costs. <br /> <br /> As it is a thrill about puzzles, it would have helped if they chose a lead actor who could properly declare rather than the mumble Vinnie Jones who "riddled" as "riell" invented it. And it would have helped if the dialogue was not flooded with noisy places or scenes with distracting and inappropriate music. The plot is ridiculous: the lost Charles Dickens story helps our hero to solve a series of modern murders, but it would also be a copy of Herge's Adventures of Tintin, as the link between Dickens and Jones more than non-existent is. And we have the ridiculous point of view that an investigative journalist who is laying his hands on a former undiscovered Dickens manuscript will take a few days to read it, just so the flashbacks of Dickens can be played by the movie as if they have had some connection with it. What they don't do. I mean, if you got a new Dickens manuscript, wouldn't you just go and read somewhere? The movie ends with one of those surprise revelations that has become mandatory since The Sixth Sense, but in this case it doesn't surprise you so much to insult your intelligence. If the movie suddenly turns on the twelve o'clock, then it is clear that Vinnie Jones is a robot that would be acceptable. It may not look as if the movie was stylish, but it is not. And in many places it certainly seems amateur: There is a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump-cut technique, but they did not make sure that the person actually lying the table is completely out of the frame between the cuts. As a result, you can see things changing at the edge of the frame, if you are really supposed to see how things change in the center of the frame. A good rule in making movies is: If you don't understand how to do a technique, try something else. <br /> <br /> The real riddle is why someone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie. in the first place.
