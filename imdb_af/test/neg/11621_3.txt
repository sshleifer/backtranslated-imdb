I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and couldn't really understand it. But I can't defend this nonsense. Spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that characters often do inexplicably stupid things: <br /> <br /> So if Starbuck thinks she knows where the Earth is, why not send her out in a raptor ? Would the Admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Will the quorum prefer its newest member, the non-elected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks of political experience under his belt, and is the son of a man who distrusts them. Will Adama send to Gaeta and Halo, along with Starbuck, who leaves himself short of senior officials? Would Adama have a man to have sex with silon prisoners in charge of the fleet? <br /> <br /> I don't buy anything from this. <br /> <br /> Secondly, while I was there, there were miracles and references to God until the end of season 3, now it's all over. I started looking at BG because I thought it was Sci Fi, not a biblical epic. I expected the characters to continue to act fairly intelligently, and wanted to have satisfactory explanations about some of the ear developments in the series. <br /> <br /> Baltar was the best character in the show, but now he looks completely insane. Not unreasonably considering what he was through, but very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> All the characters just seem to be dolls dancing to an unknown third party's request (some divine entity). It's not a good drama, it's annoying and a writer out. <br /> <br /> OK, so, what are the good points? Nice battle at the beginning of 4.1. Some good dramatic scenes (well done) when seen in isolation. A good final scene, a nice wreath-curved ball of development. <br /> <br /> But it's not Sci Fi, it's in Fantasy. I can't imagine how the authors can fix this one.
