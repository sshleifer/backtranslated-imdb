From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw it here in my Media Studies class, and I recognized the leading actress. I did this, despite the criticism of the critics. The basic cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) team to kill a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away without finding the police. The investigation into the murder is murderer, Mr. Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock), along with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who is quite astonished by the evidence found on the scene. unrelated hair. The plan doesn't look very good, because Cassie and Sam have very quickly Richard or Justin as suspects, it's just a question whether they can erase them. Also with Agnes Bruckner and Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can now see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murder of a challenge, but this movie does it in a very stupid way, and not even a pretty good Bullock can make it dumb and predictable. Sufficient!
