I had to watch it recently for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I ever had to go through. It was like a bad, bad cinemax movie with all the good bits. Bad acting, the fake documentary essay, unbeatable plot, and motionless direction, all combine to make a terrible, horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The female characters are basically just there to be sex objects. Consider this exchange: "He's hot." "He has a girl." "Do you have a girl?" "None." * Meisie takes hands and leads him behind some bushes. boy coming out and sitting next to other boy, girl saunters * "Did you hit it?" "No, I didn't want my pants off." 'You are stupid.' Another girl appears when the boys go to Beverly Hills, come in the drum with one of the boys, and when they are pulled by a police, you see the car on and off. <br /> <br /> A homosexual pervert, a trigger-happy Clint Eastwood looks alike, and what seems to be a luchador mask all adds to the weakness. One of the boys is caught by a policeman, no one cares. One of the boys is shot, no one cares. <br /> <br /> Someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised, and it shows. Not terrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
