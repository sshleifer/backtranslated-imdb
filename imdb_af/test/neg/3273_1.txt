It's really the worst movie I've ever seen. For a while, I had a habit of watching crazy movies, including "Battlefield Earth", "Delta Force Commando" and "Starship". All these movies are movie-like jewelery compared to Ironheart. <br /> <br /> There is not much of the summary of this piece of junk; I think it is more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie, which is: I get angry and I want to rip the tape out of the video recorder and burn it after about 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie a 0, but IMDb doesn't allow one movie to rate less than 1. I give it a 0 to know well that I say a movie that is any score above 0 is infinitely (indefinitely) much better than this one - it's really how bad it is.
