The back of the DVD for this movie raves, "Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films." It's not so much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film was poorly written, performed tightly and edited with a deliberate intensity. The plays play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are played with some good time photography. Flashbacks, blurred to gray, freeze frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story) are done without any reason other than to give the film more film credibility. The camera is haphazard, some beautiful crane cutters are cut with ridiculous settings that have no meaning. Poor blocking and lighting makes the viewer wonder about who is talking in many scenes. Oh and the sound is terrible. The special effects were properly and thankfully limited. But it's all just technical. The movie fails to get involved on an emotional level. The dialogue sounds so fake and the actors seem to just read it for a moment before the camera rolls. The story ... the things that happen sequentially have no motivation behind them. The characters struggle to tackle one dimensionality. And the characters must take a stand on Christianity and faith in every single scene. Take a queue of M. Night, to engage Christian films, do not have to give the characters the name of Jesus Christ in every scene because the movie is Christian. Goodness! Don't try to show it to your unsaved friends with any expectations other than laughter.
