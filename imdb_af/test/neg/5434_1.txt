I love bad movies: Showgirls, Outerspace Plan 9, and so on. And this movie fits right in. Don't believe anyone who tells you it's good movie. It's horrible. Tim Curry's accent moves from German to Portuguese to Hungarian. There is a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the monkey's sign language. There is a scene with a killer hippo moving around a river like a Big White Shark. There are people on and off mountain. Kilimanjaro as if escalators were installed. This thing is ridiculously ridiculous. So ridiculously, I roll on the floor. This is totally unquestionable. I loved it every minute.
