The opening scene makes you feel like you're playing a high school. But I saw high school games with better acting! Each line was rendered so natural that I felt I was watching actress's work instead of seeing characters. I have found that character development is poor and the acting is forced! I found 25 minutes in the movie, I didn't really care what happened anymore because the plot was too exaggerated and I was bored. I was hanging there waiting for the movie to leave, but it never happened. Sister Theresa was too sweet, even for a nun, but appeared impulsive and slightly manipulative. All in all, I was very disappointed.
