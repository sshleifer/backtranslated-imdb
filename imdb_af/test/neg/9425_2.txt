First, let me make it clear that I love aircraft, and usually any movie is worth watching with them - and I have been shocked by some. However, this does not apply to this movie. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he has been wasted in this Strategic Air Command promotional film. The acting is mediocre and the direction is poor. I had to stop looking at this awful mess about halfway through. This was despite some very good, perhaps even the best aerial photography. The problem is, even for an aviation note like me, about anything from the shocking planes portrayed (B-36 and B-47) just make too much of the nerves. It is a pity that the movie was not made when the B-52 appeared, then the superlatives used for the plane would be valid in this movie. Then I could sit through it. Maybe I miss the point of the movie, which can suffer the beloved of loved ones while their loved ones are active. Anyway, this can be done much better. Recommendation? Well worth the miss.
