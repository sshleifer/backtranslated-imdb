Was Vanessa Redgrave filming mogadon? It was as if she had read a motorcycle. I saw more life in a wooden spoon. Or maybe it was all part of the character? Whatever, it was very annoying, I still wanted to shake the screen to make her hurry. I've read the book a long time ago and didn't like it much, except that Septimus's descent in madness did very well - but I don't think Rupert Graves showed it very well. His play was all on the surface. The relationship between his life and Clarissa's was also not well done, but I suspect the attempt is to show the soldiers who were acting to enable people like Clarissa to continue their fleeting lives. The film is very bitter and has no real unity. Hated this.
