Cult began 20 years ago at the Quinling Mountain Range, South China, as a man named Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) finds that an ancient amulet has magical powers, cut off to California where Quinlin set up a cult. The members are about to sacrifice themselves when one of them (Cazzy Golomb) pursues his evil scheme ... Jump to the present day as five college students, Mindy (Rachel Miner), Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk) ), Alex Michaely) & Morgan (Victoria Venegas) investigate the events of twenty years ago that became known as the 'Quinling Massacre' for a school project. Unfortunately, Morgan decides to kill herself, loosing the evil spirit of Owen Quinlin for reasons that are quite disappointing. He is about completing what he has started years ago by claiming souls, so he can eventually use the magical powers of the amulet for his own evil ... <br /> <br /> Edited, co-produced and directed by Joe Knee, it's not a good movie and it's good at it. The writing by Benjamin Oren, who takes him very seriously, is a supernatural story about a cult leader who comes back to death to complete what he started a few years ago. As you would expect the character to be involved, links to what happened now. all those years ago and it's as dull as it sounds. The character is bare and forgetful, the dialogue just as much, there is no proper horror or exploitation in it, it is slow, sometimes it is predictable, it is clich√©, it goes completely off the rails and does not make much sense when you think about it. The story never touches or touches you, it is never exciting or particularly interesting and I struggle to even name it. There is very little here where I can recommend Cult, don't save this one. <br /> <br /> Director Knee is good, but the movie made that mere shot-to-video for watching TV over it is completely forgotten and flatten things throughout. There is no fear, there is no atmosphere and there is no tension. There are also no gore, sure there is a fair amount of bloodshed, but no proper real-life makeup effects scenes. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 950,000, Cult looks cheap, though it's not made so badly as some low budget horror movies I've seen recently. The acting is not even worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Kult is a poor film that has done nothing to me. I'm struggling to name this average. There are much better horror movies out there.
