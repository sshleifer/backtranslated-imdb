Yikes. <br /> <br /> I saw quite a few bad movies in my days, many of them in the company of Mike, Tom, Crow and the other of MST3k. So was the case with this one and although I found the movie quite funny in itself, it wouldn't have been so much fun without the MST3k comment. <br /> <br /> The movie is an excellent example of really bad movies coming from Europe in the eighties. Horrific music, horrible acting, horrible plot (which is little there), terrible dialogue and really, really, VERY, terrible editing. Cripes. <br /> <br /> It may be called a turkey if it isn't for the fact that it's not unique in any way. It's almost the same kind of movie that almost every Italian hack came from a director. <br /> <br /> So try to get the MST3k version. It's a very funny episode with Mike and gang in pretty good shape.
