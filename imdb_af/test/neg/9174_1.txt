"First Snow" started a plot. A traveling salesman has told his prosperity by an old man, whose predictions seem to be incredibly accurate. From this point on, the movie plays like a bloated "Twilight Zone" section. I mean nothing but carriage, calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is all but a sympathetic character, ignoring the welfare of other people for his own paranoia. The end is particularly poor, with absolutely no payout for the long-suffering audience. Do yourself a great favor and avoid this one. Not recommended. - NOTE
