I know when you buy a used (oops, excuse, previously watched) DVD for $ 5.99, you shouldn't have very high expectations, but even that was a steep price for this poor boxing disc. <br /> <br /> I will give the producers credit for a complex viewer challenge. . . To determine what's the worst, the acting, the mini-dissertation, the camera work, the special effects. . . They are all pretty much bad for just awful. Oh, it has used the absolutely TRUE car accident ever in a movie everywhere. <br /> <br /> Now it's all pretty ridiculous for a movie fan who is proud of 'Police Academy', 'Naked Gun' a national lampoon's loaded weapon 'and a lot of other championship slides in his collection. At least, however, people know that the tongue should be planted firmly in the cheek, throwing PW, unfortunately, use their tongue to make an effort dialogue. And while it is almost beyond my belief, the movie characters seem to think they can do something valuable. A back room pornographer will be ashamed to leave this mess. <br /> <br /> Oh, fortunately I bought the worst video ever made. .. "Brotherhood Demon" ... Maybe the name should have given me a hint.
