Another eli roth in the making. self-promotion, bad writing that apologizes to a horror director. victory is so far from the new horror icon as mary poppins (reference to the Disney score). Whats going on here? you have Marilyn Manson opening and closing this piece of crap and chitty chitty bang bang all through it. can it even be called abomination? horrible, yes, but horror is a stretch. David Lynch has to sue them for the stable of elephant prostheses. Please stop this fan boy now wants to be directors. the video directors already have enough competition in the film industry. get online and talk about how good your movie is, don't make it true. stop the insanity. I work in the industry and yes these movies are nice to work on, but rarely never entertaining to actually watch.
