OK, when I was little (and I mean 2 or 3, not 6 and 7), Barney was one of my favorite shows. Then I grew out and threw away all my old Barney tapes. One day when I flip through channels, I see that Barney is now in a caboose, and I thought "Um huh is this the real show?" Once I realized it was, I was frustrated. Why did they change the performance of a school to a CABOOSE? Since then, the show is absolutely horrible, and the only reason I give it 2 is a) because I'm nice, b) because of Riff, and c) because the show was acceptable in the old times. Now I don't hate it. HATE IT. <br /> <br /> 2/10
