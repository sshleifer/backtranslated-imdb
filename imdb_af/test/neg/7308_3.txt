In fact, this happened: the royal mother-in-law and father-in-law searched the day after the wedding with the couple and gave her the money in public. It has so much Elisabeth upset that she never forgot the problem. We must remember that she was only 16. She was so embarrassed that she feared having sex all her life. Perhaps it started to appear as a trauma. Also, the constant interference of her aunt and mother-in-law. As you say, she kept all her children away, criticized her teeth and ways (which she considered inappropriate for an emperor), and when Sissi finally went to Venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter died and the mother in law she was guilty of the unfortunate and premature death. She never recovered.
