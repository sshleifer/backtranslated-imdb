I watched this movie and all I can say is ... I'm not a film student, nor am I an artificial intellect trying to find a deeper meaning in everything I don't understand . However, if I were to do this with this movie, my mind would be ... <br /> <br /> Yep! He's on drugs and I can picture it now ... he slept one night and slept with his friends and slept, and said things like, hey ... wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly? As if you had just dropped out of an airplane and escaped for a moment, did he knock to the ground and get up and walk away? * tiles * or if buckwheat gave the father a bath? Oh my god, I just crack to think about it! Dude! We have to make a movie about it! And then he says to his friend as he laughs. Oh, and wouldn't it be hilarious if people loved it and called me a genius for it? So for me, that's what happens when an old one makes too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie. Could I have LSD to understand what this man thinks so, could I laugh too? Because I have to tell you, I didn't laugh. I knew and checked the time. <br /> <br /> I think everyone who tries their best to find a deeper meaning is hysterical. I have never heard of this director until I read the reviews, which I did because I was crazy that I lost the last 2 hours or how long it was (it felt like 12 hours of my life) and I can never get it back anyway ... I read that this man is a heroine addict and he wanted to die for art? What is it? So my point is kind of proof. This man is not all there, he is a drug addict, and his movie is proof of such ... Please stop finding a deeper meaning for it. If you really want to understand everything in this movie, go loose LSD and sit back and relax, it can actually make sense. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of the time I watched Gus Van Sant's Last Days, Another movie, I was crazy about watching. I can't help but wonder what the ratings for that movie would be, if the same people reviewed what this one reviewed. It seems the director of the movie is completely out of his rocker, or if it is a French movie with sex and subtitles, or if it is a cartoon, it will get good reviews, hands off, anything else is boring and is already done. BLAH, don't be boring!
