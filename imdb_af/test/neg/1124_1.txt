** WARNING ** MISERABLE MOVIE ** WARNING ** The day before Christmas, a nut case decided he would entertain us by sending this movie as "entertainment" on TV. What in God's name did he think? <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with horrible humor, despicable acting, fun jokes and a plot line disaster. Randy Quaid plays the idiotic role as cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a brain-dead person who can't even do the simplest tasks. He was dismissed because he was dumb, but the company he worked for was sorry for that and they sent him and his family on vacation. But he was as stupid as he was. He managed to make the holiday a disaster. <br /> <br /> All-in-all this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I still have nightmares about the miserable acting and the even more miserable jokes in this movie. It's so sad you just have to see it ... But don't do it. The nightmares I have are much worse than any other nightmares you will ever have. Trust me ... I hate this movie so much because it acts, the humor, the "jokes" and the story. The only good thing was the beautiful landscape. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my opinion, and I hope everyone agrees with me ...
