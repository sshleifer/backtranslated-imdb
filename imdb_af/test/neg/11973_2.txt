Wow! Here is another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the movie masochists happy. If the cheap opening points don't tell you, you're quite a ride, then the deadly tragic "writing" will certainly. <br /> <br /> A diabetic child is tied to a legendary scarecrow as part of his baseball team initiation. Then the scarecrow goes out and starts with people. Should I say more? This movie is made up of cheap effects that make it appear to have been modified with iMovie (note the haunting color invasions) and actors who apparently were not good enough to appear at a late-night Cinemax specialist. Actually, it is not fair, as the actors did not have much space to work to work on the abysmal writing. Parts of this movie really look like parody, especially when one character picks up his guitar and begins to play the worst song ever conceived by people, with the worst lip sync ever performed to go with it. The "gore" here is also a great disappointment. In most B-movies like this, there is a thick layer of cheap Gore FX to compensate for what the story and acting are lacking. Here's the stuff so cheap that it's not even fun. This movie actually makes "Jack Frost 2" look great fun compared. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is the "worst one you've ever seen" then you're probably not deep in the world of straight-to-video B horror. Regardless, this movie will cause you a great deal of spiritual anxiety, no matter what your background.
