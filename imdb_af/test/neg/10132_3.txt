Natalie Wood portrays Courtney Patterson, a polio-disabled songwriter who tries to avoid being involved with her first love affair. Her partner is lawyer Marcus Simon, who was haunted by Woods' real husband Robert Wagner. The movie is heavily cut, but most of the remaining plays show a very poor hand by the director who makes Wagner look consistent, leading to a solid and nuanced view of Wood, which also produces a fine soprano. The script is somewhat thin, but the persistent nature of Wagner's dramatic shortcoming is unfortunately in place, as he has given a free hand to enforce his devastating stare at Wood, who must discourage an actress. The progression of their relationship is unfairly offered, and that, along with sounding editing, leads the viewer to be less than convincing, and the motivation is almost completely ignored in writing. While largely incomprehensible, cinematography shines in a short scene when Wood is placed in a patio and the sound of a closing door stays in the middle, while the camera's eye goes steadily and shows her helplessness and weakness. More controlled direction would have allowed the artists, even the slack Wagner, to scale their acting according to the impressive relationship; As it has been released, there is a large lack of commitment for the most part.
