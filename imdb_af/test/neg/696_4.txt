If you want to see movies because it's beautiful, you should be good with this one. If you want to see movies starting with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, point out the motives of each one through the movie, skip it. At the end of the film, I didn't know why Stargher killed the women as he did. Creating such a ritualistic serial killer would be good to know where the rituals came. In Dreams, a similarly beautiful movie featuring a serial killer was also not the best, but at least explained to the girls how he killed the girls. They also showed in a dark background for Vaughn's character, but did not explain, did not really say why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited to this task than the rest of the people they questioned did not have much given an explanation. for the small child's problem, etc. If the rest of the story is compelling, I don't give details like how Stargher affords all the fancy electronic equipment and underground rooms, or why the FBI hasn't checked out any possession. other property or access to the road occurred while waiting to see if the whole of the killer's mindset would work, but I would like to have a feel for what the serial killer motivates in a serial killer movie when he kills such a complex way.
