It's unique in Hitchcock's movies I've seen, because I didn't really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found it very predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newly married couple. He is the kind of "dearest villain" character you have seen in many movies, without ever having such love! <br /> <br /> In fact, it was indeed a scarcely credible relationship, and at times it was especially fake and indescribable. <br /> <br /> Unable to keep a job and try to live an abundant lifestyle, but Grant has led to borrowing money he doesn't repay. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is convinced he is trying to kill her to get the money she is insured for; and presumably what her old father was worth. <br /> <br /> On average and rather uninteresting, but as usual you can see the influence on movies that came later.
