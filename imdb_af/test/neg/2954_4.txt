The best-known thing about this movie is that it was Garbo's first talk in a movie. Apart from that "milestone" (if you want to call it), it's a movie that doesn't go beyond a creaking melodrama. Garbo tries her best not to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The plot involves Greta Garbo back to her father after 15 years abroad. Her father, who is a captain on a boat, is happy to see her, although she does a little cagey. She soon fell in love with a grizzled sailor, who also noticed that something, a barrier if you wanted, was holding her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two girls don't like each other much and soon blow up Garbo, when she diffuses the situation by revealing her Big Secret, which we don't surprise, if you read the video box. (Damn your MGM !!) Garbo is nothing but arms in this movie, she steps up and acts on her arms, and quickly hurries. The two male leads are good. Probably the best thing comes from the classic silent actress Marie Dressler, who plays the drunken captain's equally drunk girlfriend. What a show! It's too bad that the tagline couldn't read, "Dressler Talks!"
