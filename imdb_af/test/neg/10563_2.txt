If you really want to experience the magic (?) Of Don Dohler, watch "Alien Factor" or maybe "Fiend", but not it. Alien Factor is actually quite imaginative because of the low budget and it's pretty creepy, but "Nightbeast", which I guess is an update of Alien Factor, is just stupid. The actors sleep through their roles, especially Mr. Monotone sheriff, and the monster is a stupid Halloween mask-type thing, rather than the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) Alien Factor seekers. A spacecraft falls on Earth and there is, of course, a butter that naturally walks around evaporating people. And finishing arms, etc. And he has a cool shotgun he uses to vaporize people until it's shot out of his hand. And it's really about it. "Alien Factor" knocks off this mess of hands, if you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie, it rather goes out. And RIP Don Dohler, 12/2/06.
