I saw this movie on a show showing bad B movies and trying to get you to buy it. It was basically just a long trailer, but gave you a very good idea of ​​what the movie was about. After watching the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looks dumb and generic, but can still entertain in the wrong way. It is not entertaining in any sense of the word. The movie has two (or should I say four) things go for it and it's not the number of deaths, that's the women. They are warm and naked, and Mrs. Lovell can be a legitimate actress, but not in a movie where the emphasis is on T&A and corny dialogues. It's not even a horror movie or scary, unless you're talking about watching the actors try to act. The production value is pathetic, the acting is worse and the writing is the worst. What was the point of making this movie? To frighten people? To cut off "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"? Trying to be funny? To point out the women's breasts? To put someone's head in a delayed outfit, with false hands and legs? Having a character just says the word "Snow" over and over? To have no real violence, but to have enough nudity in an effort to cover the fact, is there no real plot? To make a sequel to a movie no one has ever seen or ever seen? I made a mistake to pick up this movie, nor made this mistake. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
