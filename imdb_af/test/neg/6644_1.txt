Until today I have never seen Elizabeth Shue again because of the stench of this movie. Poorly performed, poorly planned and racial Neanderthal, it took place in a Chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . SPOILER AHEAD. . . . . .. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: Her "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro in it - "Don't leave anyone without singing the blues" - was as stupid as a post. The kids were babysitting her character was impenetrable and well before the end of the movie I wanted to do something terrible for everyone. <br /> <br /> However, I have to say there is one special thing about this movie; it takes a lot for a movie to offend me, but this smoldering piece did what Chopper, the Phantom Menace and Catwoman couldn't do - I got sick of my stomach.
