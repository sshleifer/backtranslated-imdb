I barely managed to see the whole movie ... Just after about 85 minutes from the movie's 110min, the journey to Mars started, and then there was 5min left for the closure. These 85 long minutes were VERY boring and didn't add anything to the movie. When Mars was finally reached, it didn't show much better plot. It could be all equipped in shorter time and nothing could be missed. <br /> <br /> What I can't understand is the piece of trivia to say the result of the new Baby's movie is called "Aelita" ... Why would anyone have his / her baby? wanted to call a villain, which, despite just one eyebrow, has 3 breasts ??? <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing here is the sets and costumes for the Mars screens. They are an interesting experiment in Constructivism, just like "Dr. Caligari's cabinet" was for expressionism, five years earlier. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 for the wonderful design ...
