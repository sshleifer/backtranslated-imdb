I get the feeling that many people like this movie (not all, but many of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. People of mediocre intelligence, if you like, who pretend to be ever avant-garde and trendy, think Lynch is a genius. <br /> <br /> Lynch, for me, is like Tarantino. They are both big, but not one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe. No director can change the world, so relax. And both make sucky flicks sometimes, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day. And clearly, as this movie is actually designed as a pilot first and then hack job in a feature film, it's not made with all the passion and thought that one should put in a movie. See, much of the movie is incomprehensible, which cannot be understood. We can all make intentions, Lynch may have his own view, but none of this matters. It is scattered all over the screen. Admittedly, the first part had the appearance of a deliberately complicated, appropriately interesting story, but then it fell. <br /> <br /> The cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phonebooks, the lawyers ... come on. I can almost scream a picture of David Lynch forcing the crew to disassemble him and explaining to them: "Look how crazy and strange I am! Isn't it nice? It's so weird and crazy!" Weird and crazy working if it's a by-product of your style. However, it is pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing else. It's like all the half-ass pulp-fiction cast-yaws that came out to Pulpfiks. It's just not cool.
