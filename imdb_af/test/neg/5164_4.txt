I saw this movie today on the big screen and I honestly can't believe some of the comments people made here. I really hope to be touched by this movie, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I'm a former Army and very patriotic to this great country, but I feel this movie is not right for us and that soldier fighting in this battle. <br /> <br /> The film is poorly filmed. I thought the scene was terrible, they weren't credible and they didn't give me a reason to care about them. People say this movie is graphical, there were some graphic scenes, but I found most of them very poor. The war styles were very short and lasted only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall a poor movie that doesn't justify these soldiers.
