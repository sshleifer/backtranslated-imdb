After major disaster films in America such as The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like Flood. <br /> <br /> Using mainly unfamiliar actors and actresses and focusing on England was a welcome change at the pace to see the Empire State Building demolished. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a strong film on any basis. While it's pretty shocking because all your favorite London landmarks are being demolished by a very fake CGI storm survey, Flood doesn't really deliver anything else. <br /> <br /> The performances are vague, saved from the pit of hell by David Suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as the Deputy Minister. He might be a bit too calm for what goes on in the movie. All that fake water walking around in London must have been very annoying. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that the effects won't be as good as TDAT and DI, but the CGI was at its best, average. <br /> <br /> Mix, disappointing and sometimes even tiring. Watch it if you need to, but then look straight again.
