I watched this movie with no idea what it was before. I was intrigued for the first whole hour. It was a big thriller. A very talented throw and good dialogue. Then it all broke apart when I saw the first vampire. I could not believe my eyes. A huge thriller was flushed in the toilet. The rest of the movie of that point was totally awful. <br /> <br /> I gave it 4 stars for the brilliant start alone. I think it's a bit generous, but I was entertained for a while. I'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at all. If you are, you cannot agree with my opinion.
