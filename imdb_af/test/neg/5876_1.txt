The only good thing this movie created was that it made me hungry for ice cream, less the dead body parts in it. The movie is one of the most cheesy I've seen in a long time. When the "Ice Cream King" dies in the beginning, I laughed so loudly because the child took the ice from him and started eating it. His mother asked him to say something and had to say, "Leave me alone and let me eat the free ice so I can see my play run down at a young age." It seems to be right for a line. Then I wondered why the yprins were behind the bars of his truck. Will anyone rob him of his twenty cents? I have never seen bars on an iron truck window. It was pretty stupid. You can just as well forget about the acting because it's just awful. Forget about this movie and go down to the dairy queen and get an ice cream.
