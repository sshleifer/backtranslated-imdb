What is the handling of all these ethnic crime groups that copy Italian mafia-related films? We all know the Godfather as in Don Vito Corleone, now we have this Mexican one who is just a vast copy. I can't see why other ethnic groups are mimicking and imitating Italian people, but they certainly seem stupid. They certainly look like Italian. I would like to see Mexicans exercise their own ideas and like to see their own culture and the way they do it, instead of copying ideas from The Godfather trilogy. In addition, the film was disappointing, as Mexicans acting and trying to be Italians are not my thing. After watching it, I'm going to look at the "right" godfather, so this movie can be deleted from my memory.
