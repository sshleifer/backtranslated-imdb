and generally you will eventually have to investigate this jeweler. When I changed my gender, or Glen or Glenda as it is better known, I must reflect on Andrew Smith's thoughts. He hit the nail when he wrote: "If you didn't see any of Ed Wood's other movies, this one is a devastating experience. If you saw any of Ed Wood's movies, it's still "The movie is hilarious and tragic, but it moves with a strange rhythm that doesn't leave without a doubt. The author knows and understands every word he says during his length of life. Wood, blessing him, had some of the lofty ambitions as a director, who wanted to promote peace, understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s. When Tim Burton reviewed a glimpse of Glen Or Glenda through studio executives for his movie, he laughed the executives and said it had to be a plant. More than fifty years later, there are still people fighting just to give the kind of respect that the "normal" take for granted, so I say it's definitely not. <br /> <br /> No, the real comedy in Glen of Glenda is the mere ineffectiveness of Wood in compiling his message. Directors regularly use inventory requirements when they can find some that fit their purpose, and can be edited to suit their own material. Ed Wood used unconditional stock, and Tim Burton's cinema celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood played through Johnny Depp's bets that he could make a whole movie out of stock. Unfortunately, true Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen of Glenda was the closest he ever came to. The IMDb states that twenty percent of this sixty-something-minute movie stock is stockpile, and it's never difficult to determine which imagery. Footage of busy highways, airplanes flying overhead, poor lightning effects, soldiers doing their thing, they are all used in a random way, sometimes repeatedly, and they often only have a loose connection to the story. Wood tries to tell. If Wood could look back and think about what he was trying to do for a while, there was no telling of the heights he could have achieved. <br /> <br /> Makes himself appear in the film as the titular character, a confused transvestite suggesting him as a woman named Glenda. Aside from the daring way he tries to make his point, Wood makes a dishonest woman. Having found myself on the brink of a society that I think is "disabled" and I have to be healed myself, I honestly found that I got the best outcome for Wood's character. However, in order to make its point, Wood weaves into short stories of two other transvestites. One of them takes the extreme step to keep a gender change to become a woman, the other finds himself so upset that he fears he will be arrested so much that he commits suicide. The frightening thing about this movie is that if you worked out transvestism and replaced such disenfranchisations as my position on the autistic spectrum or schizophrenia, much of the movie would have to be changed. This is how small society has learned since Ed Wood was a boy. <br /> <br /> The other important personality in Glen or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, who made Wood the movie. Speculation varies from Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood Lugosi's career would help revive, and will do anything to achieve it. With the exception of his time to carefully compile a good movie, it is. In Glen of Glenda, Wood uses Lugosi, best described in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood as "bizarre". Lugosi plays a character as a scientist, but comes from more than a ubiquitous puppet master. People who haven't seen Ed Wood movies before the biopic product, will think Tim Burton has set the "beware of the big green dragon sitting on your doorstep". As something, Burton is determined about what bizarre speech to use to portray Wood-Ian dialogue. Nothing can prepare you to see the speeches in their original context, not even Criswell's hilarious ranting at Plan 9 from outer space. <br /> <br /> Remarkable types will also notice the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at the moment. Burton again dramatized her response to see the screenplay for the first time, while the film regarded her as acceptance and forward thinking. I can't help but feel that Burton's depiction is more accurate, as Fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in her role. She only appears about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless that she somehow looks less talented than her companions, if that is possible. Whether Wood's direction in this case was better focused is difficult to determine, but if the ability of the support to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the material being a guide, then it should be no surprise Verras that Fuller would only appear in a very small role within another Wood Film. That she continues to write a number of hit songs tells you that she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood would appear in front of the camera, it was never more than a cameo, a walk-on or a bit of sharing. <br /> <br /> I gave Glen Or Glenda one in ten. I usually just give this rating to movies that are so bad that they are entertained as a result. Fat and well-meant as it was, Glen Or Glenda fits the description to a T.
