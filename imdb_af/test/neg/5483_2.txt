The comments already made for this show are much more fun than the show itself and they are all accurate. I feel exactly the same, that I am very disappointed with how far Rick Mercer fell when he did some very good things. This hour has 22 minutes, but now he just climbs around to sit down and talk to people. He does a bit in the studio about things going on in the news, but they are never funny, just really sad and predictable jokes about news. Most of his performances are that he goes somewhere to talk to people. For example, this week he goes to a rodeo and the video pieces are all from him who makes funny faces and frightens the wild horses, etc. He was funny, but has become less funny since leaving this hour has 22 minutes and the show is no longer funny either. Now the Air Farce is off the air (finally thank you!) Mercer and this hour has 22 minutes the next in line for the ax, just old tired predictable comedy that almost no one finds funny. It's sad because Rick Mercer was the funniest man on Canadian TV!
