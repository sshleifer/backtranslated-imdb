Apart from Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), an appearance of Henny Youngman and the last seconds of the movie, there really was nothing special about this movie. Why it is currently rated 5.3 and adored by some reviewers is beyond me - the film is 99.44% crap ... and exactly what I expected from director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the 1960s and 70s, Lewis was renowned for making a series of incredibly low budget mining films, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. But in the past year he was "the father of gore" and he has many, many supporters, who ignore the inefficiency of his work and focus only on how pioneering some of his films were. But apart from the liberal use of false blood and real intestines, his films are pure crap - and do not believe scores of 9 and 10 for his films. It will be like putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre! <br /> <br /> The movie is about a string of Greek murders that happen to strippers. If I am cruel, it is very bloody and sick for 1972 - but according to today's standards, the special effects look incredibly lame. So, while some are deviant and cruel murders in the movie (I'd rather not explain it - they are of a pretty sick spirit and show a particularly disgusting dislike for women), they will at least not mislead you because they was done so badly. It is clear that in many cases they are disassembling rubber dolls and mannequins. But to make them do the sick, even if it is unrealistic, is very nasty and shows a lot of misogyny. <br /> <br /> The only hope in the movie, like police, is all idiots, is a man named Abraham Gentry - whose ways and style of speech are very close to the stock actor, David Lochary, of the early John Waters movies. While his play is bad, he is so flamboyant and funny that he likes my interest. He can be pretty funny and strange, it's the only movie he ever made !! It was also strange that so many women wanted him - especially because they didn't look like his kind. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the people in the movie, they are criminals and idiots who can't act. In fact, I was kind of hoping more would be killed - they really got it! Neither of their plays was the least credible and apparently the director never shot a single scene - as most of the scenes in the movie were worse than any of those in Ed Wood's masterpiece, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. In fact, for many of the women in the film, the only prerequisite for their appearance in the film is that they are prepared to undress their clothes. Now I know it sounds pretty mean, but most of them are incredibly unattractive and look like drug addicts who are ready to get their next right. When these ladies get their clothes off, men in the crowd give their money to put it back on (wow - Henny Youngman had to say it in the movie)! But, given Lewis's budgets, it was probably the best "actresses" he could get. <br /> <br /> Overall, a messy bucket of gall that gets worse than most other directors' other movies ... and it says a lot! It's violent (though stupid), anti-women (treat them like meat and things that must be mutilated) and is thoroughly incompetent from beginning to end.
