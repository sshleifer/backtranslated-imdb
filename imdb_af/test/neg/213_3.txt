OK, I thought the trailer was pretty good, so hopeful for this movie, and with the payline I was sure it couldn't find a 6 in my books. But I got irritated in the story for half an hour ... just where normal movies are going well, this movie hit rock bottom. <br /> <br /> SPOILER * The man who's trying to help everyone is so caring for other people in the midst of the pressure he turns on his colleagues to hit a bump and then put himself in one of those block blocks. armored trucks. Not only that, he is constantly trying to get other people's attention, which ultimately puts more people in danger and a long story short. The result is that he is responsible for not only the pounding death, but also a police officer shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother ... oh and all 5 of his colleagues are dying of shame. <br /> <br /> But in the end, he is fortunate because he has come halfway through the pursuit, so if all his colleagues are dead, rather than holding on to the plan and being a millionaire. This film has tried to be politically correct, it makes me sick! Ruins a good story. Shame really.
