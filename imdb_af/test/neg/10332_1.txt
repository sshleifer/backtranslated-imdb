I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work. It only took a few scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! The only pleasure I got from this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the background "car sounds" sound just disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). Production shows a total lack of imagination (example - slow-motion machine gun repeated many times). Sandra Bullock basically plays a bit, quite unnecessarily after the plot. To say that this movie actually has a plot, more justice is writing than it deserves. The antique computer hardware is so interesting. This movie was released in 1982 (not 1987 as the IMDb database indicates) and then the current "high tech" is an amber screen on a 4.8 MHz IBM PC with floppy drives. Perhaps the PC was the real star of the movie. At least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> We've put it on DVD for a few bucks at WalMart. As the other reviewer notes, we pay too much!
