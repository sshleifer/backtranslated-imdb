It's a frequently used line, but it's really a summary of this movie ... "If it's the current state of gay theater, we're in real trouble." I saw this movie at SIFF because of the high IMDb rating (7.6) and if there was ever a stack stack on IMDb, then it is. Just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the movie. <br /> <br /> Easy plot ... Boy finds out that his high school ex (boyfriend) will marry a female friend of theirs, so he goes back to his old hometown (still a 10-year-old torch to see what happened. <br /> <br /> First, I like "Last Days", the director's last feature, despite his cookie cutting characters and plot contrivances, but you have to be a better director with every subsequent release. I don't know how to get terribly supportive performances from so many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but somehow he succeeded. The writing was Lifetime Network Quality (backwards when they were VERY bad) and the situations were incredible and uncomfortably difficult to watch. I kept looking for a non-existent remote to move forward, but eventually I stayed to the end, hoping for a decent end. Ugh ... no. Even the free male nudity that appeared during the movie was so blatantly free that it seems to be there to keep people in their seats. <br /> <br /> To be honest ... the 2 leaders, especially in the free nude scenes, were beautiful. There was also a real sweetness between them during their restorative friendship, as they discovered how they went in different ways. And the movie looks good ... good quality and color saturation for an independent movie. How is it that network weekends can give weekend of great, entertaining weekly episodes (such as "Ugly Betty" "Desp. Housewives", etc.), but so many feature releases in similar genres can be as bad as this?
