I just thought a selected number of audience members really had an interest in watching a male hustler work in New York, but I would be willing to even turn off these brave souls by the annoying patchwork technique and deliberately muted sound recording on display here; the fact that these inherent 'deficiencies' are a direct result of the film's low-budget / underground / experimental nature, I say, along the point. Anyway, for those who are so inclined, has the movie become extensive male nudity and Joe Dallesandro, understandable, has become an underground? and gay? icon! <br /> <br /> The episodic structure depicting the day-to-day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a few rare interesting scenes: his encounter with (and ultimately set for) an eccentric elderly artist; The one where Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and outlines his specific modus operandi to some prospective 'colleagues', including the most unlikely hustlers? a special nerd! Maybe the movie was only 89 minutes against the IMDb's claim that its full length is 105 (but the latter may be a mistake)! <br /> <br /> I watched a few others from Warhol's movies and this one is certainly not as satisfying as the most tolerant example I haven't had yet, BAD (1977), and slightly better than the love of MY HUSTLER (1965), which was mostly a strain to go through. The fact that it was just the first part of a trilogy did not go well, but as the saying goes, you have to do what you have to do and the other two chapters must follow fast ... <br /> <br /> Despite my overall negative reaction to it, FLESH is still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the Underground scene of that era, both kinies and real-life. For the record, an image of Dallesandro from this movie adorns the sleeves of The Smiths' self-titled 1984 debut album and transsexual Candy Darling (who is rather relentless here) is immortal in "Candy Says", the opening of The Velvet Underground's eponymous 1969 album. Although the latter band is my all-time favorite, and one of the reasons is that, through their completely unique and pioneering music, they describe a lifestyle as completely different from my own, which is truly a case where I experience D something rather aurally rather than visual!
