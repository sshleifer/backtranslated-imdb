I must say I was very excited about this movie before renting it because it was a Adam Sandler "Happy Madison" production and I am usually attracted to that kind of silly humor. <br /> <br /> There were a few funny moments. at the beginning of the movie, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many movie states aren't realistic, can be quite funny, but this movie was unrealistic and not funny at all. The acting was horrible, cinematography was very poor, the plot didn't feel at all. I can't think of the fact that 3 classic older ladies will even work for such poor writing. Overall I was very unpleasant with this movie and I do not recommend renting $ 5 to rent it.
