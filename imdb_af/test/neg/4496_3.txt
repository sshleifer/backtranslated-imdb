I saw the Greek Tycoon when it only came out in 1978. I found it very boring. I thought it was no better than a travel report except for one thing. For the first time in my life I realized why it would be good to be rich. The view of Aristotle's Onassis hunting and my first real glimpse into the living wealth of the rich and famous opened my eyes. To paraphrase Martha Stewart: It was a good thing. Funny, I don't remember the sex scene. I didn't see the movie as it was on the big screen and the love session with the mistress was memorable. Maybe because I was young and alone it wasn't a big problem.
