With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making so-called funny scenes without any sense and depth. This movie is high on the story, but low on character. You never know one of the characters except superficial slapstick. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what slapstick is about. His style can be described by the hit and miss. Of course, some people laugh when they see someone hanging on a banana peel. Weber puts his humor on this lot. It's a pity how badly he uses good talent. Very good French comedians were discarded by mediocre directors.
