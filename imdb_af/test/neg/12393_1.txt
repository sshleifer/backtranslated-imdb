I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. It must be one of the worst movies, especially as it is recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie has made the worst of it because it was so difficult to be smart that it hurt me to see it. <br /> <br /> The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on US Idol. You look because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. How joking would it be to try to convince good singers that they shouldn't come close to an American Idol test? It would be senseless as this movie was. <br /> <br /> Using improv is overvalued. We are all in that area where a group of friends roll on a roll and all crack with tears in their eyes. I feel it is improv. Improvement cannot be turned on, just because the camera proves like this movie. If you like this show by Drew Carey, you'll probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the jokes were poor, the improvisation was sophomoric, and the overworking of guests and companies was champion. And these are my compliments of this drive. As a man playing a trumpet AND the boiler tube at the same time, it's good for you. For me, I prefer more crazy things like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". <br /> <br /> But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980s, so maybe you'll like this G-like humor. I was waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and told us that there was no zoo in town. This is the humor you can expect. <br /> <br /> My only wish was to give it a minuscule rating.
