I felt last night's episode was slow and sometimes boring. I honestly don't think it should do something about writing. Knowing that, the story performed well and tried to keep things in place. I thought it wasn't that bad, but I didn't enjoy it. Most of the debt relates to the director of the episode - Stephen Williams. I always hated Stephen Williams' direction. As Jack Bender continues this episode of the season, he would have kept it in a good fit and floating things to keep things interesting. I'm glad Jack Bender is next week's episode and it'll be much better and I'm glad he got the first Syaid episode and I'm curious what he'll be pulling off since Stephen Williams was too much Syaid. episodes for. <br /> <br /> I always think Stephen Williams should be thrown off the show. He doesn't even do something about the show. <br /> <br /> Why should the opening be done with a target thing while in the helicopter? It was so USED! Bad perspective of camera work too!
