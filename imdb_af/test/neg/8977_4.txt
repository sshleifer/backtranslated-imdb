Deep Sea 3D is a wonderful insight into an underwater world. Only a few had the opportunity to see first hand. <br /> <br /> From the opening time when a wave goes to the audience, we are short on the sea, the filmmakers make full use of the IMAX format. A jellyfish field seems to fill the whole theater, a shark forces us, predators jump behind the rocks and devour their prey. It is beautifully caught under the sea feast for the eyes. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, our ears are not given the same treatment. The film is told by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sounds are so ridiculous that it positively welcomes the enjoyment of the footage. Depp sounds a bit bored while Winslet sounds like she is reading a bedtime story at the village idiot. I was shocked that an actress of her status could play so wrong. The writing is pretty stupid and contains very little depth. The soundtrack is filled with strange, unrealistic sound effects that I think are meant to be funny, but in fact reflects the attention of the material to be admitted to itself. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman has an excellent score that has a lot of impact on the bottom and bottom of life under the sea, when allowed to play without the silly bubble sounds or pepper-footed footprints. <br /> <br /> The movie is a technical wonder, but with its childish writing, annoying narration and wrong sound effects, it can't be taken seriously.
