It was a very nice concert by the only MJ. The choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. The choir was okay. I must admit that his choir was on Human Nature and Billie Jean. You couldn't hear him half the time. The other songs make up the song. The highlights of the show are: Jam Smooth Criminal I just can't stop loving you. She's out of my life. Thriller Billie Jean (the dance doesn't sing). Black or white man in the mirror. The concert was almost perfect. If it were somebody, but me, it would have been a 9. This is a must see. I wish I was born then, so I could get a ticket to the best 1992 concert.
