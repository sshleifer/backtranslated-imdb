Another recent comedy that shows Hollywood can't even do the basics when it comes to making movies that have been in his sleep for decades. If the author / director had brain, they would have based the movie about Stamp's character of tyrants boss Jack Taylor. When he is early in the movie, it is nothing special, but it is softly promising and sometimes amusing. Once he goes to the majority of the movie and Kutcher has his 'hilarious' adventure home with the gas after the boring gas invades, completely dissolving the film. <br /> <br /> As a result, what had to be a suitable timewaster turned into a turbulent stinker.
