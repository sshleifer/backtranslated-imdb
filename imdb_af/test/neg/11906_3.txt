There is a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre that has changed into some claws of filmmakers. They also didn't know what the purpose of the story was, or just didn't mind. All the features of your average family movie are younger younger brothers and sisters, a grumpy teen who doesn't want to move, unsympathetic parents who can't see the look and of course a romantic subplot. The movie has little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to make fun of the melodramatic gothic novels that were all the rage. If Wilde sees this version, he'll probably laugh - and then of course write a parody. One can only hope that the children who watched this thin mass product finally discovered the white and glitter of the original version.
