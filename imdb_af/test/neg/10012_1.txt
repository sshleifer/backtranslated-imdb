This movie is absolutely horrible and terrible. It's not a low budget, it's a no budget movie that looks like Ed Wood's movies. The acting is uncomfortable, but sets and props are worse than I have ever seen. An ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, Woddy Strode has one bullet and the battle scenes are shot in an unused pit. There is sadism as you can expect from an 80-year-old Italian video. No talent was used to make this movie. And the female love interest has a giant bob Italian taste. Even for 80's Italian standards, this movie is pretty awful, but I think it came at a time when there weren't many movies available on video or viewers, wasn't really clear. This piece of crap has no entertainment and it is not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap. It's actually and insulting to the most stupid audience. I just wonder how on earth did an actor like Woody end up like a turkey?
