Well, I've been sitting with some friends to see this movie, we went an hour before the show started getting good seats. So if you can probably imagine where it is left to see this movie :). But the excitement soon turned into horror. This movie is a complete failure. It's just hard to be funny that it's sad, the writing is poorly written and rests on the actors to solve it. <Br /> <br /> The only good thing in the whole movie was Stefan C. Schaefer, who was good, the plot was poor and even the "funny" scenes forced and felt unnatural, as the lead actors of Iceland's best comedians are. it is very special ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone because it tries hard and never really delivers.
