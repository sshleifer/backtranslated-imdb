As a serious horror fan, I find that some marketing plows are used to sell movies, especially the bad ones. So I won't call it, but I accepted it as being a soft and abominable thing that crumbles the Cannibal / Zombi / Jungle Holocaust. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong as it was very difficult. I had to realize when I saw the strange "no real or identifiable minor use" warning. Notice the identifiable part as if he dared to catch him? A group of scientists, half of whom are beautiful women in bikinis, are led by a sea captain with a love of looking on the beach, looking for a mutated indigenous deadly village. Due to a nuclear bomb exploded on a so-called evacuated island, the radiation has this last man in a rapist / killer. <br /> <br /> Author / actor George Eastman is the only one who tries here and manages to keep his clothes on. . The sex scenes are wiped out. Women walk around naked and give a strange redundancy and one even asks for rape when her husband turns around. Well, two chicks that beat each other are obviously a lesbian scene because women are horndogs. I saw the chick throwing another chick and finger herself. <br /> <br /> If there is anything you need to know about this movie, it is. Because the rest of this crazy movie is just the same. Oh, who do I estimate? There is a ton more to tell here. Like the white "Duchess" who pays for two black guys to join her in a room. Or the "duchess" takes her top to use as a bond if the captain cuts himself. When he refuses her progress, she begins to cry. If he is the good man, then he is reluctant to introduce himself to the other crew members. I honestly waited for the pizza guy to show up and the "Duchess" to ask if there was any other way to pay him. <br /> <br /> And all this happens before they leave the island to do their island. research. Wait, I thought it was a zombie movie? But the zombie does not reach the 73min point, but by that time everyone else is "enrolled". I caught myself quickly forward a few scenes? Or some. This is my first flattering porn movie and I don't think that makes that subgenre any justice. I think it's the woman in me who speaks when I say I want more plot and less sweat, slobbery, hairy sex. Funny thing it could have been as a decent horror movie as the idea of ​​atomic bombing that killed a bitter man and murdered his family was a good one. Even Eastman's character shakes his head and walks away from some copulars. It makes me wonder if it was the character or writer himself who was disgusting. <br /> <br /> I don't feel like going into the sound or movie quality because you had to guess it was bad. This production was shot back with 3 other movies, including Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, which most of the same favor sports. Eastman said it was done because everyone wanted a holiday and a salary. Nevermind, I suddenly talk about the sound. The sound was strange during the sex scene, because while the role-player speaks Italian, they seem to have recorded English voting rights and played it over their dialogue. So while 2 people are boning, I can clearly hear someone in the background, say, "No! Yes, wonderful! Wait!" There was a slightly amusing Italian score that could not save this movie. The SFX was at its best minimal and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes. And I want to point out that there were no violent rapes scenes, as the shiny warning label on the DVD cover (ahem, another marketing pack) said, so there is no fear. Just be afraid of the bad movie. <br /> <br /> Offered in Widescreen 1.85: 1 aspect ratio. I watched the region. 1 Non-evaluated version released at 113min in 2005 by Exploitation Digital. There is apparently an XXX version by Alfa Digital, which is the same run time, so I doubt anything else. Prices vary, but you should not pay more than $ 25.00 for a copy. Or as I would recommend, pay nothing and pretend it doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: Shipmate, "Citizens are accident. Women are accident. They are also scientists? They really need to be monsters." as it is, Trailers for SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle, & ENOTLD, and a very informative interview with Eastman. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Lame porn, but even worse than a horror movie. Or get real pornography or watch real terror. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
