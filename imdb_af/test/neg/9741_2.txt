Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the lids and their feet on the pillows. They have two equally challenged children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid, their garbage is gone again. There must be someone stealing it from the edge. He goes to the truck in the blades. When he finally comes to the dump, he is shocked not only to learn that "other people's garbage" is also stolen, but that there is a secret organizational meeting at the landfill. He is determined to defeat the rags of the world, it looks. Meanwhile, Petunia and Buster are visiting the police station and a Chinese restaurant looking for their parents, as Joan is also missing. Will they bump their way through their problems? It's just a stupid, stupid movie, with the guilty scary writing. The books of Allard and Marshall are hysterical and just a few situations from the books end up in this movie. Arnold is actually quite nice as Mr. Stupid and the other role players are trying very, very hard to make the film work. The production values ​​are very high, with the dog and cat belonging to the Stupids, adding a little oomph to the film. But it is nothing for nothing, as the plot is wandering and weak. Perhaps somebody will take one more day to translate the very funny Allard books on the big screen. Therefore, if you love to laugh, rent something else while waiting for a new production and, anyway, will also get the books. But stay away from being stupid, as anyone who watches this movie can be called almost intelligent.
