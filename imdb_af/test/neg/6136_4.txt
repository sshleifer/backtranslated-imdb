Jumpin 'Butterballs, this movie stinks! It is a dull and listless dress that never comes up. It's a wonder anyone even bothered to make Groucho in his bizarre brand eyebrows and mustache, as he is not dirty or disgraceful to do or say during this drill. Chico had to be so disinterested that he forgot his Italian accent. <br /> <br /> Only Harpo offers a smile or two, and there is little to go here. Figure in a loud hotel manager and another unpleasant fellow comic in Frank Albertson, and the road even gets bumpy. <br /> <br /> A real misfire.
