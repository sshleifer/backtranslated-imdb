Mad Scientist Professor Tabani drinks a drink he has brewed in his lab, but changes into a blood-vampire vampire. When dr. Aqil's visit, Tabani sees a picture of Aqil's wife Shabnam, and after turning Aqil into a vampire, Shabnam makes her his bride. Aqil's brother discovers the grave of the vampire and his brother in Tabani's castle and kills his brother with a knife to free his soul. Tabani manages to make the bite on Shabnam. cousin away. Aqil's brother race against time to put an end to the vampire curse. "Zinda Laash" almost made me sleep. The plot is extremely slow but follows more or less Bram Stoker's famous novel. The tension is completely absent like gore and nakedness. The film is only recommended for curious horror fans who want to see the second horror movie in Pakistan (after "Madman" of 1964).
