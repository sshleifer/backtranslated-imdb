While this movie had some terrifying moments (great use of music and film corners to build suspension), it is clear that director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy did not subject their investigation to any time; who also made me think that the exorcist scenes were being supervised by a true Catholic bishop. <br /> <br /> Among the many contradictions: <br /> <br /> * Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first met him outside the church, wears an academic robe over his clergy rather than the typical alb, chasuble of surplice. Academic clothing is usually worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests. <br /> <br /> * Jacob the priest takes a few clear and disturbing scriptures about the angels who take up arms. He wrote it to St Paul. This verse does not come from the writings of St. Paul, nor is it in the Bible. I can't even find it in the Gnostic writings. <br /> <br /> * Jacob tells his bishop that he does not believe in pigeon proof and disables the request for exorcism, but does a full 180 (later that day?) within minutes to own Isabelle . Certainly this is possible; but a little unrealistic. See Father Damien as a priest / psychologist in the original THE EXORCIST for a little more realistic depiction of a skeptical-minded believer. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest, turned farm hand, is the first to try out an eruption on Isabelle. He took the writing, and she took it back. He says, "I see your Psalm 65" - she improves him "it is Psalm 67" - they are both wrong. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the past priest who has just finished performing an exorcism - the sign of the cross, the name of Christ, the use of holy water, etc. - tells Jacob that he does not believe in the church and he does not believe in God. (Perhaps he was just confronted?) Jacob begged him to put on homemade clothes and in any case go one more. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former Roman Catholic priest, crosses himself backwards (or Eastern Orthodox style). As a Spanish Roman Catholic who was used to being a priest, he had to cross himself in front of the chest of the breast, on the right side of the chest. <br /> <br /> I had to read stories on the small side to get the idea that satan was with the whole family, not just Isabelle; but even in the end, it was difficult to say whether someone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic fraud (except for the sheriff - it is quite clear that he was guilty). <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and I love the plot twist with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm just not sure if the movie was. intended to be serious or a spoof. <br /> <br /> Listen to the ongoing commentary with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I tend to believe it was a joke.
