When I saw on the voice panel that some people gave this movie, I got a score of 10. They didn't know the score was out of 100. This is a disaster movie in the right sense of the term. Poorly written and poorly directed by so-called actors who are unable to act but can grab when ordered. For the first 60 minutes it seems that the story goes in one direction, then it changes and becomes involved in a power struggle, with extremely poor special effects. Can't work out an intelligent way for the hero, with limited powers to hit the villain with superpowers, the author. Obviously, the father has been added to the so-called story line because it was easier than working out an acceptable denial. Not that the script would even know the word "disruption". Some movies go directly to DVD. This one had to go directly to the garbage.
