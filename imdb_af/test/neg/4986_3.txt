I didn't like Underdog! I mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big facial and maybe it was acceptable, but for the most part I didn't like it. It wasn't like any other child of those movies that parents wanted (who grew up to see the cartoon) to come with children to see it, I'm not one of them, so the movie didn't have me addressed the least. I had problems with it as I don't think Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog, it made him sound messy and really unintelligible. Then it was really predictable that made you feel tired and angry. The humor was really what made me angry, it was just to eat and somewhat pathetic. The one thing that most threatened me was how almost everything from Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude. The acting was sensible, but improved a little. If you have children, they can enjoy it, but if you are not a child, everything means that you may find it different from me. 3.4 stars out of 10
