1st watched 2/9/2008, 4 out of 10 (Dir. J. Cardone): Sexual political thriller who doesn't really succeed in any of these areas, but in time where there are some interesting softwares scenes. The movie begins with the portrayal of some who explore their sexual fantasies between their work environments or wherever they are and whatever they are. The couple take a trip to a retreat and bath house where they run into a woman who is willing to be part of a three-person and fulfill some of their fantasies. At this point we only know that this couple is well off, but we do not know until they return that the fiance is part of a good political family. The man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a congressional place after marriage. They then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit photos of their meeting at the bathhouse and start their anger with how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they wanted, and how to get them names clean. before any of these come out. This qwest becomes an obsession that brings them deeper into the world of the world and takes much of their time, to the point where their friends and family are wondering what they do all day and why they look all the time. This movie is sometimes interesting, but becomes ludicrous as they personally seek the problem, rather than getting involved in the police because of their pride. Of course, this error holds the movie. The performances are good, despite the no-name cast, but violating the insanity of the situation and the movie starts over halfway. And of course they are finally throwing a bunch of challenges and challenges that have happened before (as is the norm today when they don't know what to do more to spit the movie). However, this does not help this movie a bit.
