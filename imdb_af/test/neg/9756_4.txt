Going into the movie with the right expectations, I like this movie somewhat. Like most reviewers who saw this movie, I totally agree that the plot was razor thin, clich√©, and I could predict every plot turn from the start of the movie. But the dance sequence was very well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classic and hip-hop dancing (both of which I enjoy watching). The music / soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the drama screens more bearable. The prospects (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their dance through the movie was impressive and captivating. <br /> <br /> All in all, worth a movie to see if you want to see good dance sequence, and this movie is much better than you got in terms of plot and drama. Then again, it doesn't say much, does it? = P
