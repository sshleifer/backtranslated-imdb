I accidentally caught it in the middle channels. Immediately I recognized almost everyone in the thrown, groovy haircuts aside, wondering what kind of movie such a cast of both past and future stars could attract? If I didn't see the original, I suspect it could be the Poseidon Adventure, as it was, of course, on a ship in distress. Was I wrong! I can't imagine life why any of these big (or promising) actors and actresses will allow their name to be associated with such a trash. There is no story, the performances all forced, the characters a parody of the usual role-playing roles that are suddenly brought together at an event, and begin to start the real meaning of life at the level of the bumper sticker philosophy. <Br /> <br /> It's just worth seeing the extraordinarily awful performances by such sizes as Sally Field, Michael Caine, et al. They needed the money. Can we blame the director?
