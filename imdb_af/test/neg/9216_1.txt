I remember seeing this year. It had a pretty promising start, with an interesting prospect, but then it was fairly uprooted. Uninteresting characters, have failed attempts to add drama and tension, and a bit of the simplistic philosophy that is also thrown in, which leads to a terrible end. <br /> <br /> It's simply a trash. <br /> <br /> Before I watched this TV movie, I didn't think I'd ever have a movie I thought was the "worst" thing I saw, but when I watched it, I knew from then on, if someone asked me what the worst movie I ever saw was, I could say without hesitation, "The Second Coming". <br /> <br /> Avoid.
