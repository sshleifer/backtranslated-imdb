This is just the fourth attempt I have seen from this director (which I met and found geniuses at the 2004 film festival in Italy's B-movie story) and also the worst. As was the case with the BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, it is an excellent example of the tail end of the Euro-Cult era - prime because it shows the depths of the previously refreshing style at this time ! <br /> <br /> Here, in fact, we get a plot that turns around - I'm not joking, people - a killer! Pretty but among Charlotte Lewis - in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) - is a model that apparently just ended an affair; She expects her architect's girlfriend to call her back, but every time the phone rings, all she gets is statically accompanied by voices from outside (or a little bit). She is befriended by a new tenant at her apartment block, who, conveniently, knows of a paranormal activity authority (William Berger) - who hilariously states that the negative energy being triggered says during family arguments, through home appliances a lethal force (I swear I don't make it up) <br /> <br /> Among the highlights ... there ... lows of the movie is: the grumpy barman whose dingy place calls the heroine a few times (it seems like the chain of events can only is being broken by Lewis again by her steps, expanding the ANGEL style (1962)!), the sheer variety of striking phones exhibited, the apparatus of the heroine's photographer friend who kills her before death, the sarcastic policeman who greets Lewis to report the strange events ("And what is the toaster to, I wonder?"), killed the popular rapist by a collection of coins shot from a telephone and Berger's own bloody downfall (with the phone which affects the pacemaker he has equipped and causes the doctor's heart to explode! <br /> <br /> The film's climax is quite confusing and apparently sees all the "lost souls" who see a herd of pigeons and fly out of the window of the "owned" office (a lonely service). For what it is worth, the score - by ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti no less - is effective enough, despite the inclusion of dated heavy metal numbers on the soundtrack.
