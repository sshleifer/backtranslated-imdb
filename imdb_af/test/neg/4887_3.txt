I bought this one for a few dollars at the local video store, as they expressed their ties in favor of DVDs. I doubt whether this one will somehow replace it. <br /> <br /> I couldn't say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's very boring. No real cannibal scenes. Ms Me Lai is not naked enough of the time (only about 4 or 5 times). And she's not the Thai goddess I also expected. So two of my reasons for watching this movie have been knocked out. <br /> <br /> There is a serious animal violence here for those who enjoy such things. A big battle between a Mongoose and a big snake becomes pretty bloody. Animal torture, as well, some of which are actually fake. Fortunately, the fake is somewhat funny, but the real one is just a little sick. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a 70-year-old movie - too long, underdeveloped, not as deep as it would have been. But that's something else, right? ONE AND A HALF STAR!
