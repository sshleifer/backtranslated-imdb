Look at all 3 series again and don't watch this movie, the trailer is completely deceptive and the 3 worst characters in the series stretch a bad mind-out 25min TV episode in the toughest 2 hours of my life, really a terrible film. Tubbs and Edward are there for a few minutes, Micky has a rule, and her lips just roll the same tired old punk, also Mr Briss's accent just changes about 5 times in movie tons of poorly-trained extras, and really a few laughing that they look for 2 hours to recover I honestly feel this series is completely destroyed by this god-horrible piece of shit .......... Batman and Robin, everything is forgiven
