The worst movie I've seen in the past 12 months. The plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan. I always thought there was something really interesting afterwards. I knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the movie was playing had beautiful landscapes, but the movie did not benefit. The jokes where very poor. The narrator, Geshesh himself, could have told a little more about Mongolian history, traditions, etc. My fellow viewer didn't know anything, so he was a little lost. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, but was really disappointed. It was one of the 3 movies I have ever seen in the cinema where I saw before the end.
