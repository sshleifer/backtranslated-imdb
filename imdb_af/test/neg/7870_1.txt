This movie sucks. The acting is worse than in the movies we made when we were 10 years old with a video camera, the effects look like 80's computer game and the plot is worse than terrible. Even the worst Van Damme movies make it look. The accent and rhythm of the 'bad guys' is so bad, it's funny. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you're a big time by one of the actors. 1 out of 10.
