My husband wanted to see this movie because the newspaper review said it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not from Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I will have to agree. Not for conventional reasons. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that must be watched late in the night if you don't want to see something that really thought out, but don't want to go to sleep anyway. <br /> <br /> Yancy Butler is a very nice guy. She's not the best actress, but she's not even good, but she's perfect for this role in this movie. Everyone else in it ranges from pains to oaks, including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across the Pinocchio. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: The end goes a step or two too far, complete with the clich√©, not quite dead With a roar you get another moment and then there is a shot Pinocchio with his frozen wood decoration that makes you wonder if they will chew or just forget, there was botox in the makeup. <br /> Regardless, it is a hilarious eighty-minute minute and despite being a bad movie, you need the humor gene to not enjoy it a bit. Don't pay it, but if you're in the same apathetic mood, it's just right.
