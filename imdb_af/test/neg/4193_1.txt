Anyone can make a movie these days. Budget, production value, or experienced crew need not stop the self-described "director" of the "realization of their dream". <br /> <br /> Respect for the craft of filmmaking, or even just respect For any movie aesthetic is no longer prerequisites to actually perform a movie. <br /> <br /> Director Bill Cowell had thought he hit gold when Lion's Gate decided to market his original movie as a sequel to a movie he had nothing to do with. <br /> <br /> Personally, I find Lion's Gate far, much more accidentally than Cowell for Dark Harvest 2 made available to the public. Lion's Gate's fraudulent marketing of this film has to be investigated by the State Attorney General's office and Lion's Gate officials need to be brined in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their full negligence on film, film and good sense. <br /> <br /> As far as the film itself is concerned, it is not even worth commenting on.
