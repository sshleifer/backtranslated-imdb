The first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible play. The whole cast was so uniformly indifferent to making their lines that I started laughing at the terrible dialogue in the middle of the film. An even bigger problem with this movie is that we will never find out what motivates each character. The one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is Halfdan Hussey's innovative visual effects. But as much as they may be, they do little to make up for the gaping mistakes mentioned above. A horrible script mixed with community theater plays doesn't make for a pleasant view. I was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was.
