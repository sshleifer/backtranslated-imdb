"Dolemite" is the touch of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation movie titles), an ex-con that is likely to be in prison. He gets into trouble with policemen, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes and society in general. He's just not as nice as a man. The movie is also not hilarious and worth watching. <br /> <br /> The thin point of departure is that Dolemite (played with so much enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore can collect) is in prison for a crime he claims he did not commit. When a drug is hit or a drug image or drug is about to go off, the officer frees him or her to stop it, or help it, or just to see it. Not very clear. All I know is that I didn't know the judicial system liberated crimes so they could prove their own innocence. My ignorance, I think. <br /> <br /> The plot is intricate and unimportant. Dolemite is basically about to kill people (usually with very poor choreographic karate), having sex and curse people, sometimes even rhyme. The joys of the movie are his total incompetence and his total indifference in the matter. <br /> <br /> I stopped counting the number of times I saw as the boom after being in one stage for the whole duration (about two minutes of film). I stopped asking why the caretaker was looking at where Dolemite was sitting, even after he got up and walked around, when they returned to the founding lap and Dolomite sat inexplicably again. I stopped wondering why Dolemite was so dressed when he got naked on the street to change because he didn't want to get into the car with his ugly (read: normal) clothes. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he grabbed his hand on a man's stomach and somehow opened him. The only time I was ever nervous and tense was when the disgusting, white white mayor walked around naked, with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck just barely covering him. You keep saying, "Cut away ... cut away ... cut away" but by the time they do, you're already emotionally scarred. <br /> <br /> The movie is imaginable in every way. Moore as Dolemite, is funny, cool or both. If you're looking for a bad movie, you found it with "Dolemite".
