How do I describe the horrors? First, a few points: First, this review should be taken with a salt grain. I saw it more than 20 years ago when I was a boy at the New York Modern Art Museum. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I give a few scenes and points. However, it doesn't have much of a plot. <br /> <br /> In any case, I don't enjoy this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is by prototype Luis Bu√±uel. He was a surrealistic and dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements that were critically popular in the 1920s and early 1930s. Surealism was the art school that made things hyperreal, but often had Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is supposed to be the first word made by a baby - Dada, or father. <br /> <br /> Made in black and white, it is also made by a group of communists (or as they prefer term, socialists). Bunuel and his group of co-filmmakers and artists were busy with a number of symbolic ideas and problems in Spain and France between world wars. <br /> <br /> Dadaism and surrealism influenced many artists - Police (Doo doo doo da), poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (swaying hats in space), Salvador Dali ), and even Hitchcock (Psycho). No Norman Rockwell. <br /> <br /> Here's what I remember most about this movie: A girl meets a cow; her eye is cut by a razor; clownish men cavort in a meadow. There is not, as I have said, much of a plot, but then it must be the point again. <br /> <br /> It was again attacked as porn and will be back today. One of the brands of surrealism is significant anti-feminism.
