I saw a 12:45 m show last night, and I would run for 20 minutes. In, but there was nowhere to go! Blatant product placement, youth magazine, so much talent breakaway, gay-bashing ... what didn't they do? The movie is also bad (we got off at 3). As a person who rarely pays full price at the movie, my rogue thought about $ 22 for this self-sufficient, moderate nightmare (plus $ 2 parking). I woke up today and still feel depressed and couldn't shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he looked into this thing, as I was. If Cedric is the Entertainer the high watermark (a man so indefensible that he calls himself the "Entertainer", you'll understand what he thinks he's doing), you have a serious problem. Also, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli is right, suddenly, as he died almost a year ago (March 10). This should give you an idea of ​​how long they polish this maze powder. This movie is meant for the bitter end. We just stayed to make sure they didn't give Robert a reminder what they didn't do. Save yourself! Save Your Money! Save Your Soul!
