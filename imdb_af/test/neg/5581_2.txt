However, the kind of B-1950s movies that were shocking were pretty good, on which Predator Island paid tribute. Caught in Connecticut, Predator Island is called on an island with a Hell's Beacon lighthouse inhabited by only the couple who lean over the lighthouse. In the typical 1950s, after half a dozen young adults, the sci-fi fashion staged their boat in the island's rocky world, and the spectacular creatures of outer space invaded the island after a meteor came close. The creatures both occupy the bodies of their victims as well as consume them. Much cursed and lame return is the primary form of dialogue in this movie. It's so nice to just laugh. If you are looking for a movie that is stupid, but in a fun way, apply this one to the account. <br /> <br /> Interesting note: I appear in the film as a dead body in the distant background of the final scene. During the filming they needed about 50 extras, but about 300 people turned up for the event. They eventually used almost 200 of them.
