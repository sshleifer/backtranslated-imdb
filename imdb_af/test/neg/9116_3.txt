Personally, I saw it because of Lea Thompson's appearance, and I didn't really expect to enjoy the movie as such, but I saw surprisingly how I watched it to the end. <br /> <br /> Let's see it - it's just one of the saga-like stories and isn't particularly original or entertaining, but strangely it just keeps on the TV. My opinion of their own will be much better if there is not one point I just can't find. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful and very pleasant scene in which Lea Thompson's character is underway. The street holds baby in her arms, the snow falls, she is cold, scared and has no place to stay, she doesn't know what to do next. And then about 10-12 years later, when things are better for her, she just leaves the same child without any warning to accept the career she's dreamed of. <br /> <br /> I just don't get it - I don't see how it is possible that she would do such a thing. This was the opposite of everything she had done so far in her life when everything she did was aimed at the child's survival. After this character flip, I just couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie.
