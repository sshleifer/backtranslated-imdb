Based on the true story of two young Americans who sold national secrets to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, "Falcon And The Snowman" both wants to find and be philosophical and become striking in both divisions. This is less le Carré than caring. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton stars like Christopher Boyce, a former Watergate-dismissed seminar and the middle-class values ​​around him, are probably the wrong guy hired by a company operating spy satellites for the CIA. Sean Penn plays his drug dealer, Daulton Lee, who makes him Boyce's courier and delivers secret files to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. A proper syn-jazz score, lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for anyone, and many scenes of angry angels combine everything to have a decent moral dilemma thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really Penn's movie despite the second bill; his character gets turkey with the Russians to talk while Hutton plays with his pet falcon. Hutton looked like they woke up five minutes before they called "action". With Penn it is a crap shot whether you get a brilliant show or an over-the-one. Here it is a bit of both, but more the latter, especially in the second half when Lee switches from boiling to heroin. He shouted. He snares. He invaded Russian embassy parties. He is picked up with phonebooks. He spits on himself in a mirror, a big goober he has to save for a paparazzi. "I don't know who my friends are!" he cries. It is exhausting to just look at him. Penn looks a bit like Lee at Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo of "Midnight Cowboy". It is complete with excessive nasal line readings and constant eye shift. John Schlesinger directed this movie as well as 'Midnight Cowboy', but he had another Hoffman movie in mind, "The Graduate", who set the scene to Boyce and Lee's pool, trying to decide how to live their lives. their gilded loft. Bad nobody suggested plastic. <br /> <br /> Of the opening shots, the new footage of American decline, placed with Boyce and his bird, "Falcon" makes it clear that this is a message movie, although the message itself is far from clear, certainly because characters never come into focus. Is Boyce an Idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? Hutton and Schlesinger don't seem to know what makes it harder for us. Meanwhile, opportunities to set up some tension, such as Boyce stealing documents from the top secret "Black Vault" where he works or playing Lee with the Russians, are interrupted by jumping to the couple's screens with their families and friends. This is the normality of the story that Schlesinger finds interesting, but this is the least interesting aspect for us. <br /> <br /> Good things: It is interesting to see a movie that refers to the sphere of the seventies as early as this, refers to Maria Muldaur and Tang. Dorian Harewood, unforgettable in "Full Metal Jacket", has a good twist as Boyce's paranoid colleague Gene, who shows Boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder, but has some serious 'Nam problems under his party' outside. Macon McCalman is also in a totally different way to the no-nonsense boss that Boyce gives his high-security work. David Suchet as the Russian embassy official dealing with Lee makes for a fascinating acceleration of threat and friendliness. <br /> <br /> But "Falcon And The Snowman" stands or falls on the question of the two title characters, and also the actors or Schlesinger can't stand much in the way of answers. Worse, after more than two hours in their varied game and catatonic company, you don't really want answers. You just want those credits to roll.
