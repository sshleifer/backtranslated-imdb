If this movie was directed by a man, he would be captured. While Adrian Lyne was encumbered with a lawyer's attorney to oversee the slap of classical literature to saturate the sensors and prevent the 1996 Child Pornography Protection Act from being prevented, a woman rubs us on and all rejoice. Did I miss a meeting? Apart from the blatant pedophilia, this movie is completely ridiculous. Never put this woman on foot on an active military base? Did she never meet a soldier? Whose army is that? The uniforms must come from Uniforms-R-Us. Just throw a few dots, who cares? Make sure each one has a Big Red One. There is a bit of joke here, which undoubtedly went over the author's head, but could possibly have been thrown in by who made the military vehicles. Certainly there were no military advisers. The US Army does not operate slums. Temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner than this. The US Army does not employ 14-year-old girls to work on military bases, nor does it allow them to use the fire ranges or training courses. There are many drama exploited in the sexual age of teenage girls. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with it at all.
