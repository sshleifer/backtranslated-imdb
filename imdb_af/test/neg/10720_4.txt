Unfortunately, it's not as good as any of the other movies that Jim Carrey (producer and lead) and Brian Grazer worked together, but bits and pieces are definitely an eye-catcher. Dick Harper (Carrey) basically believes that he is being promoted to a better job. This is until the company of Dynocorpe sinks and closes. Now Dick and his wife, Jane (TÃ©a Leoni) and their son are in trouble with money. No matter what they try, they can't increase the kind of money they really want. So they start robbing a few places. And then they decide to rob the man Dick, his former boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the nicest bits are when Carrey sings in the elevator, "I believe I can fly" and the little bit when he joins someone in a robbery and speaks to a voter (he sounds like a crap robot). Okay!
