This is a pale imitation of "Officer and a Lord." There is NO chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialogue is timber, the situations are broken. It's too long and the climax is anti-climax (!). I love the USCG, its men and women are fearless and tough. The action scenes are great, but this movie doesn't make much of the recruitment, I fear. The writing is formative, but confusing. Kutcher's character is trying to save himself from an accident that wasn't his fault? Costner's is furious with the death of light, but why? His "conflict" with his wife is about such a mud pool. I saw this sneak preview for free and definitely felt I was worth my money.
