Well, I first read and thought of the book: Wow, it would be nice to see in a movie as I started looking and found that a movie has already been made. I bought the movie on DVD a week ago and watched it. They did it terribly wrong! Initially, this child Hapi, who is not a character in the book, then needs the mixture between the two books ('the river god' and 'the seventh scroll') as Nicolas while he himself is in the book, the Whole thing about the Hyksos is also wrong. Taila is supposed to design the lightweight wagon. The whole thing about the grave is also very wrong. It is supposed to be a channel that sucks some sort of vacuum. The grave itself is made in a maze with only a chance to succeed if you know the rules of the old boa game. There was nothing in the film about Nicolas that was English and Royan was a Coptic Christian in the book, not a Muslim. This list is endless. There were just a few things about the movie, the actors that Royan, Nahood played. Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well chosen, the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book. Rasfer was the worst, it didn't even close to the character in my head while I was writing the book. It is so sad that such a big book was mutilated in such a bad reproduction ... I wonder why Wilbur Smith ever gave permission for it.
