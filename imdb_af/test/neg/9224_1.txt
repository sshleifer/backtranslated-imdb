It is indeed a spectacular bad movie, but it is the rare kind of bad that is endlessly jaw entertaining! I want to add the other comments to this movie. <br /> <br /> The "rock band" on the plane looks like three thin drunks of casual labor wearing bad wigs. <br /> <br /> Look for the serious continuity problem with the child's filled tiger: it turns into a lion, a leopard, and back; It is dirty or clean depending on the lap. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! The filled tiger turns into a real animal to save the child (and the writers)! <br /> <br /> The face of little Jimmy floating in the Amazon in a coffin, clamped with his stuffed tiger and jammed, will permanently get stuck on your memory. <br /> <br /> Listen to one of the most ineffective sound effects ever: late in the story when the priest is looking for Jimmy, the guide looks for his monk's clothes as a payment - the priest falls on one knee in a moment of resignation and there is the sound of a bell, not the deep "BUNNNK" of a church bell, but the thing of a bell from a boxing match! <br /> <br /> It's an absolute must to watch.
