Okul "The School" is the result of a new trend in Turkish theater. With the same stories over and over, new generation directors eventually gained different ideas. Of course, that doesn't mean they are all big. I think Okul is one of them. It's supposed to be a scary movie, but it's not. It is also unsuccessful to be scary. So what is it? Actors are so average especially Deniz Akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role. I'm sure it could have been better if it was more difficult. Maybe focus on one topic like scary or vice versa. But directors missed this target. ** from *****
