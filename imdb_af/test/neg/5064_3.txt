I have to admit that I only selected this movie for the role, and while Sutherland, Scacchi and Prochnow - as usual - were great artists, the rest of the movie was such a lower. It feels like it was composed by a team of low-level scripts, that is, scripts have no depth, terrible photography and editing, and hilariously lousy score! I can't believe I could see this seemingly long film to the end. The sad thing is, it could have been a great political excitement that gave the interesting plot. All the potential was there to make it a hit; That is, two main ingredients are there: a great story of national conspiracies, and a major cast (though many other actors have quite a lot of soap opera quality). But maybe I miss something; until then it is still worth more than a 3 in my opinion.
