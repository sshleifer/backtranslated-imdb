A formal story with all the tired cliches. I was shocked that the horrible script became a movie! What a waste! How many original scripts have been distributed without being produced? <br /> <br /> At the climax I could predict what would happen in each shot. <br /> <br /> Oh, and don't even start with the idiotic sexual tension between the beautiful female policeman and the paralyzed policeman who can barely move a finger. YEAH REG. I can buy it. What next? Fingers Porn?
