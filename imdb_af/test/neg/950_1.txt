I saw this movie a while ago and I'm looking forward to it. My biggest problem was seeing the trailer. I expected a very attractive Marshal art movie with lots of action and maybe a little plot to think about. I was very disappointed as it looked as if one had seen the trailer, there was nothing else worth looking at (than you expected as described above). My girlfriend halfway through then and while I continue to look in the hope that something interesting can happen, nothing has done. I didn't find any attachment or real interest in any of the characters. I just won't bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you don't really care to lose.
