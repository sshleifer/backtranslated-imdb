HANA-BI has very quiet moments and fairly slow pace. Unfortunately, during the very thoughtful interludes, the viewer is examined about the recent scenes that have just been watched and many questions are superficial and annoying. For example, why did the wheelchair not drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came around him? No salvation was seen. It may be true that Japanese police are so improper and unskilled to arrest procedures not even to remove the suspect's ability to reach a weapon. This Japanese police at police level seemed to have no experience with a suspect. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't the main eye look like this? To blink an eye was distracting and this was inexplicable. <br /> <br /> What exactly was the main character who spent all his money borrowing so much from loan sharks? He's not seen gambling. To be a non-governmental agency, his wife must have a full health insurance. <br /> <br /> What was the single man all in himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park? What was his reason for being there? <br /> <br /> How in the world can gangsters find the main character and his wife in the distant nature reserve? It does not make sense. <br /> <br /> And how can gangsters later become the main character and his wife in the remote Mt. Feed the resort? There were absolutely no clues for these gangsters to even know which country was the main character and his wife, let alone the right place at the right time! <br /> <br /> And a third same question how can the junior detectives know what feet of the Japanese coastline find the main character and his wife? The Japanese coastline needs to be big. Were all these characters supposed to have psychic powers? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: The cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach - WHERE does she come from? She had no transport or companions with her. And why in the world did she still try to fly what was left of her kite after being torn in pieces? It was strange. Unconsciously Python-esque. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I loved the background music. It was dramatic and flowing and added a lot to this movie. Photography, imagery and art were pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> One last point, the woman was pleasing to the eye. Not once did she ever come close like a dying sick person. She looks very healthy. If anything, these people were depressed and mentally ill and not physically ill. The man treated his wife if perhaps a newborn gay man, a respected woman would treat ... a love of friendship, but not closeness. <br /> <br /> A mixed movie for sure.
