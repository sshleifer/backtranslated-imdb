GOLD RAIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> A deaf western / comedy feature with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard, which I've always enjoyed as the "Third Stooge") Targeted by the normally reliable Edward Bernds , who also did their funniest classic shorts - so one has to wonder, what went wrong this time? The most likely answer is that what has worked well as a 15-minute two-reel is too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike so many of their classic short subjects, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth returning to. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
