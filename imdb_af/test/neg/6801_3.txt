As an early representation of the turmoil of the 1960s that followed, Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) as early flower child can be excused. The film itself does not deserve such a latitude. The lack of character development, motivation and justification for the character's behavior make the movie very disappointing. I sat down and waited for an explanation of the bizarre actions just to find out that Shainberg had made me look at a story someone had to be in the joke. The fact that the few facts presented did not look much like Diane Arbus's life also did not help explain things. <br /> <br /> The washed-out Art Direction in Diane's 'normal' life was nicely confronted with the brilliant colors in her 'wake up' life with Lionel. And the staircase was a good proof of Diane's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family. But I don't see how the trap in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect to Lionel's two-flight apartment. from stairs off her). <br /> <br /> Perhaps my analysis is a bit too literal in looking for a character development and relationship concept that goes beyond one sentence or one comment. I would also like to see one of Diane's photos. I won't wait for the successor.
