This movie is all but the true story of Phoolan Devi. Director Shekhar Kapoor's claims are backed up by the fact that he made the whole movie without even meeting Phoolan Devi, on whose life this film is supposed to be based! The excuse to meet the woman would interfere with the director's view of the story! The film wastes the opportunity to sensitize and end the society of the fate of the poorest women in Indian society as a stereotype that Phoolan Devi portrays as an evil woman whose only motivation is revenge. No wonder this Shekhar Kapoor movie was successful in the west, as it is equipped with their non-bollywood taste!
