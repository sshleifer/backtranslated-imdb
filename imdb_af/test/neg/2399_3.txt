I am sure the people who made this movie think they are doing something wonderful politically correct because they can criticize the American wars in Afghanistan and especially Iraq by stating that the US is doing good, but not later cleaning, so the seed seed for future problems. In addition, they do this without making the enemies of the Islamists and without making the Republicans the enemy, as it is the Republicans who are in office and do this so-called big thing, the USSR is abandoned by a war in Afghanistan. <br /> But seriously now. . . Do we really want a movie that repeatedly says, "Let's kill some Russians!" Like this is the biggest thing a red-blooded American can do? And are we supposed to worship this congressman because he reveals himself with women with great hair and clothing? Even his so-called smart assistant, who is always professionally dressed, keeps an eye on Charlie, just as he is just the nicest, most handsome and best man. As if she were Nancy Reagan to his Ronnie. Julia Roberts does a revamp in her role, but basically women are really harassed in this movie, and it was really annoying.
