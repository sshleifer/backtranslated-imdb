This follow-up to the above - and the final entry in the Kharis series - is a little more enjoyable, but it is also more adapted (hell, we even get a singing barmaid / hostess!): Peter Coe is easily the least charismatic of the various Egyptian high priests we saw in the course of these films, and Martin Kosleck as his accomplice in the proceedings seem unimportant; Kurt Katch is then saturated with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the new reincarnation Princess Ananka: the latter, in the form of Virginia Christine (later a widely used character actress), gets her most important role and indeed, the order of Her resurrection from the swamps is not just a highlight of this movie, but the whole series. Unfortunately, Chaney also has little to do here, as the emphasis falls again on Ananka, as I said; his mummy (with which he came back most to Universal - of course, from his signature role of The Wolf Man!) remains undoubtedly his least memorable monster for the studio.
