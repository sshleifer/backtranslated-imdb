I'm usually a fan of Bruce Willis, and despite the fact that he plays the cold murderer, I saw him the most pleasant character here. That said, his character makes such a mess of his professional activity, it's incredible that he wasn't caught before. The plot is thin to the point of being stupid. The end was no less annoying and insulting to the fact that it could be predicted for about 20 minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> ** spoilers follow ** In Hollywood morality, the good guys always win with a few casualties along the way, and the bad guys die, or at least are on the verge of justice by the end . The breathtaking insult to the movie is the way our IRA terrorist, who has somehow become a cuddly, sensitive character, goes to a new life. Just like his former terrorist playmate (who is now a loving woman and mother). <br /> <br /> Who is the bigger villain? The former (and, as far as we can say, irregular) terrorists, or the assassin? I don't see much to choose between - in real life or in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is the poorest movie I've seen this year.
