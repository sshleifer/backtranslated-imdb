The first 2/3 of this movie was not so different from the American mummy films of the 30's and 40's. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to deceive the law and were doomed to die. One became an Aztec mummy, whose job it was to love the sacred treasure and his lady. And the woman is in the present reincarnation and the mummy is naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all the typical mummy movie ... even though it's slower and duller than American versions. Oh, and of course the Aztec mummy really looked really crazy. <br /> <br /> But in this standard but boring movie there is a super villain. Why? I didn't know - it certainly had no sense to have one. This villain seems to want the treasure and he drives the woman to hypnotize and show her where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need the treasure? Well, to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots, dumb! But first he has to build a single mummy to defeat the mummy, as the mummy is unstoppable so far. <br /> <br /> You should see these "human robots" as they look like the huge clunky robots of Flash Gordon and other series BUT they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! They look really hilariously funny and see the conclusion if there is a big battle between the deadly mummy and the equally slow robot is worth the rest of the dull film. Both struggle in a super-slow motion, as they are bathed in tachy ... and so done in a relentless and foolish way that it is based on the elicitation of chuckles - certainly not excited. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is terribly dull and a devastated mess - especially at the end. However, for bad movie lovers it is a must-see - it's bad but unintentionally funny and fun to watch and laugh with friends.
