This movie is in my "Worst Movies Ever Ever" file. I have a copy of this movie I watch if I want a good laugh, and it's not even a comedy. I'm disappointed that such great actors agreed to be such a piece of garbage. This film is inaccurate (in his portrayal of hockey), offensive (for Canadians), and I wasn't even all impressed with the acting. Even the story was a little poor. If you've never seen this movie, you're happy. If you have, I'm sorry.
