I rarely laughed at a movie so hard. Note that I laughed at Iron Eagle, not with it, because it's probably the stupidest movie I've ever seen (with the obvious exception of the Sci-Fi monster CyberTracker). You should also remember that this movie is not a comedy. <br /> <br /> Even with the view of the preliminary plot (the idea that a 16-year-old can walk in an American Air Force Base, steals an F-16, flies to the Middle East and kills about a Thousands of people without anyone noticing that it is out of faith, the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense. For example, in different places, Doug Masters uses a machine gun on his plane to shoot a steel wire, a control tower, and a tent. All these things explode into a massive fireball. Why? The enemy planes also explode in a strange way reminiscent of a paper plane blown up by a firework. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I actually enjoyed this movie. Admittedly not in the way the creators probably wanted to enjoy it, but I also laughed and later bought the DVD. This is also enhanced by the incredible presence of David Suchet as the evil terrorist leader (perhaps you will remember him as Belgian detective Poirot?) In general, the film is a laugh and a light alternative to more serious fighter jets. movies like Top Gun. Even if it's just as subtle gay-erotic (look at the man-hug between Doug and Chappy. There's something in between!)
