So I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but then not much. I enjoyed his movie post (maybe I'm the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago, even before the match was even finsished. <br /> <br /> People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research laboratories located on a tropical island should be warned that it is not upset. This is something Mr. Boll joins with his legion of Schmucks. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his compatriots to play with. These players go through the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. <br /> <br /> Three names actually made them big in the movie biz. So the story goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German, everyone picks up the bratwurst eating dudes !!) But I find that Tils acting in this movie is very bad. People complained about how he didn't really stay true to the whole Carver agenda, but we just saw a carrier in a first-person perspective, so we didn't really know how he looked when he kicked a **. <br /> <br /> The storyline in this movie is staggering. We see the malicious crazy scientist dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier. Genetically-mutated soldiers or GMS make them known. Performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of "SPOILER" Vancouver. It's really no palm trees here. Instead, we have some nice, rich timber lumber. We haven't even gone before I start CRY (mehehe). I can't go any further. If you want to keep Bolls shenanigans, go look and see this movie, you won't be disappointed, it delivers the real Boll experience, which means most of it will suck. <br /> <br /> There are a few things that matter, which means that Boll did some good work on some parts of the movie, like some nice boats and fighting scenes. Until the whole Cromed / Albino GMS group comes in and everything just makes me laugh. The movie Far Cry series of skewers (it's a bat for your simpletons) of a fa, if you want to make a twist. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick that lets you shoot him the first three minutes.
