This movie is overheated !! I'm sad to say that I can watch this movie for the first 15 minutes and anything out there, I really have to force myself to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. It's completely stupid and very fake. The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing the steel suit and the play is really bad, especially the one who plays the character Alien. He is totally annoying! Don't waste your money and watch the successor of the popular Gen-X Cops. I'd rather sleep or spend my money on some other things than watching this movie. 1 out of 10. If possible, I give 0.
