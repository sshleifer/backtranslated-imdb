Bad, bad movie. When I saw the synopsis, I expected something like Ring with video game instead of band. None of these things happened. I will admit that the idea is interesting and can be turned into a good movie, but that is not the case. <br /> <br /> First of all, choose a real-life person, Countess Bathory, is stupidly moving, adding nothing more to the story. . Anyone who is even vaguely familiar with her story will start wondering why and how did this Hungarian nobleman end up in this movie. Choosing a generic inventive spirit will be much, much better. <br /> <br /> Then there's a whole-you-in-the-real-as-you-in-the-game concept. As I said before, Ring-like story. But instead of developing it into a good story line, it's just a flow along with no explanation given why this game became as it is, why it was created and so on. Waste of a good idea. <br /> <br /> And finally, this movie doesn't even have greed of funny parts that, if not at least, can save horror movies. Screenshots are too fast and acting is too timid to be funny. <br /> <br /> Avoid as possible.
