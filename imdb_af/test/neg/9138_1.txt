I've seen 3 already. I just can't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison with others, but merely on its own merits, or lack. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were constantly challenging and beautifully done. I gave this movie a score of 1. If a 0 or negative number were available, I'd rather give it the score. What a total waste of time it was to watch this movie. I thought after the first 30 minutes I had to turn it off, but then I thought it was just a (very) slow start movie. I thought the same thing after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. Then I realized it wasn't going better. <br /> <br /> It is very boring to watch and without any redeeming features. Don't take my word for it, look it yourself. Make sure you see the first two movies in front of this one. Once you see this one, I can only make sure you never want to see the first two, but it's definitely much, much better than this "piece of work". <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is when the credits roll at the end. This is when your penance on this earth is complete and you can leave 89 minutes in purgatory, for the suffering you have endured to watch this "movie". If God is really merciful, he will be more generous.
