The best thing about this movie was that Bryan played Dick Rafe and made me. Rafe and all his beauty have made the movie worth going through, although I look forward to getting up and shouting. I have never seen a warmer man. <br /> <br /> But that's not the point. <br /> <br /> The title? It is indeed what it is. They wrote the beautiful story by Annette Curtis Klause and threw it out. I will show glory in all my anal-retention glory, which has changed, and everything else is wrong with the movie. <br /> <br /> Sit and go here: <br /> <br /> -Apply, RAFE is the son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and apparently ULF is no longer ASTRID's child, as in the book. AND, as I remember from the book, RAFE and ASTRID were lovers. <br /> <br /> -ASTRID is apparently BLOND, unlike the especially RED HAIR described in the book. I believe the book said she looked more like a FOX than a WOLF. And the movie also shows that ASTRID is VIVIAN's aunt. <br /> <br /> GOING THE AXLE? <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN is 19. In the book she was 16. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN and AIDEN met IN HOÃ‹RSKOOL they both attend in the book. VIVIAN will see AIDEN because of his poem 'Wolf Change'. But according to the film, AIDEN beat his father, escaped, and now lives in Romania, and draws graphic novels. It made me go 'What the F ** K.' <br /> <br /> There is no "Kelly" in the movie. WHERE was the Kellie in the movie. However, the KELLY in the book hated VIVIAN. And she also dated AIDEN after they broke. Vivian even becomes firm in the book and rubs her room. <br /> <br /> -GABRIEL shares a striking deal with a Columbian Drug Lord in the movie. And he also sounds like one. His play was very good, but his appearance threw me off. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN had NO parents in the movie. Her father and mother and 2 other brothers and sisters died in the movie. But in the book, when she comes home one evening, her mother, ESME, sits on the couch after struggling with ASTRID over GABRIEL. And VIVIAN has no brothers and sisters. Only her father died in the book. <br /> <br /> -AIDS accepts VIVAN for what she is. It really got me. He kills RAFE in the creepy church, confronts VIVIAN, and saves him from the other wolves, except when AIDEN shoots her so they look down to get medicine and then they try to leave the city. WTF?! In the book, AIDEN flashes when she becomes a wolf, crying like a chick, throwing things at her, and panicking, and jumping out of the window. Then he made a story that he was trying to break with her, and she threw a chair out of the window. It doesn't sound to me to accept. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN wants her to run away with him. In the book he wants nothing to do with VIVAN, because she turns to him. He also doesn't love her face and says she can control it. He cried like a woman because he was cut from her. <br /> <br /> And the final indignation ... the one who almost gave me three best friends and I HEART ATTACK IN OUR SEATS: <br /> <br /> - In the movie AIDEN and VIVIAN run away together, and VIVAN killed GABRIEL. Like in his SHOE him. GABRIEL dies. In the * BOOK * not only VIVIAN kills GABRIEL, I believe they end up together. As in, she doesn't end up with AIDEN, she ends up with GABRIEL. WHAT THE HELL. <br /> <br /> Little things have also been noticed: Ulf's red hair he gets from Astrid has changed into the movie, and Vivian works at a chocolate shop. <br /> <br /> A horrible shock; I'm ashamed. The book wasn't really hard to follow. If Disney is a random H! School can use, why couldn't the director have a random H! School found? <br /> <br /> * Suck * I really looked forward to this movie, I loved the book, it's sad that it didn't follow one thing. I give it a 2, just because (as the highlight of this review is), Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was dead, and Agnes Bruckner did a wonderful job. AND, they kept the poem of Steppenwolf <br /> <br /> With love, <br /> <br /> Caitlin
