Adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. She must be the center of attention and she will act foolishly to make it so. With her attitude she is sent to charming school. <br /> <br /> There she meets the typical characters in today's cinema; the nerd, the clumsy, the stepford housewife and the sexual minority. Things happen and Adela teaches her lesson. The plot tries to give a deeper meaning to the state. Adela is in, but completely failing to deliver (at least I didn't buy it). So what you're left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies before. Plus, the director has a breast fiction, Adela flashes her boobies a few times too much. At least I can't see it being relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> So the movie is OK, but if you are like me and don't like watching a teenager pissing a teenager and making a U-turn in a moment, I love found incredible, think twice before I look.
