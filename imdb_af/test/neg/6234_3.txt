I'm sorry, but I don't understand how the studio gets away. The movie is just not worth it. Maybe as a play, but definitely not as a movie! And why do they call it a thriller ??? Offcource the play is good, but I didn't expect anything from these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is convincing enough as the gentle "bad man". Helen Mirren can hardly play any role and always (still) looks beautiful;). I'm also a fan of her British detectives. Yet they can't save this ow so boring movie, I'm sorry. I hope we no longer come to many movies from this director "Pieter Jan Brugge", because of course he does not have the meaning of the words "suspension and excitement".
