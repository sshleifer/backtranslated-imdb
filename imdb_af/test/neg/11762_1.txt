The few scenes that are actually trying to look like a revolutionary battle depiction seem like a spectacular Boy Scout troop that is for the time being between swimming holes. When Sharif or, please, God, Palance tries their hand against fiery destruction, they sound like Kurtz swallows a mistake. The strategic brilliance exhibits contain a map of Cuba filled with smiling visions in the sea, and a positive Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Pigs Bay passed. What is leaving us with that? A comic dental scene; an abundance of open Hollywood farmers addressing the camera as if it were a moving train; and just for kicks, a passion for homurothism, which is not limited to Castro's manic and inexorable cigar fellatio. Never trust a Medved, but even a blocked clock is right twice a day: it's a HISTORICAL horrible movie.
