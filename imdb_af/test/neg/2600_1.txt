Words cannot describe how asinine, youthful and repetitive is this steaming pole of a series. It relies on 3 things: 1. Constant 80's pop culture references 2. The tired a joke sticking to the point of discomfort, and 3. At least 3 or 4 pointless flashbacks per episode. The only reason I can see is that it is as popular as it is for the constant pop culture references that I supposedly evoke an "OMG LOL, THIS FROM SUPERFRIENDS. It's so completely ironic and I'm so edgy and smart to come THAT !! " response from the viewer. The writing is too lazy and panders to his viewers, mostly in their 20s and 30s. In addition, there is the character design consisting of the same three characters, with the same bored expressions repeated over and over, but with different skin color and sometimes another hairline. Offensive crap.
