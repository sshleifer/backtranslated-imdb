While watching and enjoying similar movies to this one who was silent films about the Russian Revolution, such as POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS the world has, I didn't really enjoy this one. This was mainly due to the annoying and "artificial" way in which the director chose to shoot the film. While POTEMKIN excelled in its editing style, this movie used similar techniques with much less finesse. In some cases, editing was very bracketed and amateur. Plus, and it was really annoying, the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the movie and late in the movie was really on top. What I mean by "zombies" is to illustrate just how depressed and suppressed the Ukrainian farmers were. The people are like mannequins in many scenes. And they stand for a very long time, while the "evil" capitalists and exploiters walk the masses. Go A Break! This movie is a wonderful example of style over fabric - and it's just a movie for those who enjoy or can overdo it. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD for this movie has been improved, somewhat, if you comment on the sound. This makes the movie easier to follow and gives some interesting insights.
