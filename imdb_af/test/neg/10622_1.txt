This movie made me hit my head against the wall. It is difficult to compare such a bad thing as that to something, but some say this movie is similar to bleeding under your nails. And the comment comes from the author's cousin. This movie was so bad, it made Hulk (the second worst movie ever) look like "The Departed" (One of the greatest films in film history). If you like boring family flies with predictable plot lines, you'll love this movie absolutely. If you have a brain then you will definitely not. When I rented this movie, I actually fell asleep while I watched it. The next day I finished it from where I left off, and that was the worst decision of my life.
