I am a big fan of the original Assault On Precinct 13. The ice-scene boasts me to this day. I'm 33 now and I still remember it's shocked as a kid. When I heard that they were rebuilding it, I thought it might be good, but when I watch the movie, it's not 100% the same movie. It's not a remake. This is a badly stolen idea. It was completely destroyed. The movie, Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are all good actors, but even they can't save this movie. It was just wrong. Even the environment was completely opposite. And how did no one in that city notice that there was a war next door? Why didn't it happen sooner? Stupid. No sense.
