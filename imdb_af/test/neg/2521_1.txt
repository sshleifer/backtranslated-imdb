It's hard to criticize a movie titled "Deathbed: The Bed that Eats" and a ghost tracker trapped behind a two-way painting he covered and a snorkeling bed? If I'm not wrong, masturbate. (Now it comes back to its human companions!) It also foams (in orange, for whatever reason) foods lying on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and of course humans. Again, it's enough to say, what doesn't expect too much if you see what I think is stomach acid? The final remnants of anything that takes orange socks? solve only certain things. It will drink the wine, but the bottle is okay and it will eat at the chicken leg, but the bucket is not good. Heck, the bed even replaces the unused containers. Nice, at one point, this Pepto Bismol falls off. I had to laugh about it. I don't think they really wanted you to take it seriously. It's a low budget, and it's extremely easy to see where they cost and save money. I thought, in a world where there could be a murderer "Hysbak" and "Bloodstrand", this "Deathbed" could be amusing to watch. For reasons that can cost, 90% of the movie is voice-over, nobody screams or shows extremely low signs of fright or confusion as to why a bed would attack (I can think of one and I was never one of those children who jumped on the bed) and you will have to suspend your unbelief beyond belief. (A victim lost all flesh on his hands, barely saying "ow.") Only one scene, which has gone too long, was meticulous? A woman just tries to crawl away to be dragged back with a sheet. Where are the MST3k guys?
