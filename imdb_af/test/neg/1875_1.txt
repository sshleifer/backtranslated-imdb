Stripes, an army training camp comedy with Bill Murray and director of Ivan Reitman, is a favorite of mine. Meatballs, a summer camp 'skirt' with Bill Murray and director of Ivan Reitman, are a total waste of time. It takes a lot of work for four screenwriters to produce a movie (the word 'comedy' leads a work with joy in the mind) as unnecessary, anemic and sowing like that. <br /> <br /> Murray apparently reached the same conclusion during filming, but his usually reliable powers of improvisation escaped him and his flailing efforts to inject life into the proceedings just add to the embarrassment - the "It really doesn't matter ". It does not help that the supporting throwing talent is robbed - the funniest thing about them is their hair, but then Meatballs were made in 1979. ("And the launch of Chris Makepeace as Rudy" announces the opening credits. No, not the Chris not Makepeace?!). <br /> <br /> Two years later, Reitman corrected his mistake for Stripes. Murray's shtick is so much nicer when he walks around with John Candy, Warren Oates and John Larroquette. Ditch it and see what.
