However, while the prominent and overwhelming use of the playful format throughout the operation is in total operation, this does not allow this picture. On the contrary, these are the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious writing that the film relies on a little too much. With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is still being reduced by Graham's failure to declare the destruction of her character, which is so claiming to be. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies of this privilege could make use. As Downey Jr shows, as usual, what a talented actor is, he shades the two actresses together in their constantly striking scenes. The useless but intense sex scene just seems to exist to prevent the film from being verbally expressive, and giving actors a lot of merit to speak. With an unsatisfactory conclusion, Two Girls and a Guy have very little to command it than Downey Jr's formidable, if not out of place, show.
