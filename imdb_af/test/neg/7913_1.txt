This movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses Gabriel's horn to open Heaven and pull out the good angel dogs and express them on Alkatraz. The devil sings and dances for a few songs about the joy of being bad, and at one point eats a living rat. <br /> <br /> We have this movie for free with a pizza. You get what you pay for.
