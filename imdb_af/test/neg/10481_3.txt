Rivalry between brothers leads to main story. Navy commander Chuck Prescott (Marshall Thompson) developed the Y12 aircraft to test how far mankind can act in the atmosphere. His brother, Lt. Dan Prescott (Bill Edwards) seems to be the best test pilot and is chosen to go into the Y12. Then, of course, has a problem with taking orders and is also a redundant daring devil. <br /> <br /> On Dan's second flight, he spends 300 miles on comfort zone and his vessel goes through a meteor storm. Then the earth gets back, then a monster that looks like 200 pounds becomes poor asphalt. He also has a demanding urge for blood, be it farm animals or fellow humans. <br /> <br /> Short time of an hour and seventeen minutes; black and white with nearby stoic acting ... typical of low budget sci-fi. <br /> <br /> The film's finalization is Marla Landi, Robert Ayers and Carl Jaffe. Notable trivia: about two months after this film was released; the Russians placed the right first man in space.
