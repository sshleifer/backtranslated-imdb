"Marathon" has a very interesting prospect, excellent ambient sounds and good scenery. Unfortunately, apart from these aspects, the movie falls flat on his face. For a woman trying to complete so many crosswords in a day, she spends a lot of time standing around, struggling and not doing puzzles. I believe there is more going in the movie than her work on these puzzles. Also, while I understand the point of displaying so much scenery, there's just too much of it. The movie is incredibly boring and unfocused. It is not worth buying, renting, watching television or looking at any imaginable way. I lost interest so quickly that I was not sure why I had been through the whole movie for the first time.
