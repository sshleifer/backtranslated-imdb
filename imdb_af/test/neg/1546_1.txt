I have already responded to this film (called TheLegendaryWD). But I see there are others who have commented since. All I can say is: WHAT THE F ** K! "I can't believe a whole 16 people have spoken to this movie or even seen this movie, adding that some give good reviews (probably the creators of the movie in one of the places) went a strip template that provided internet service and wrote a good review - see how they could or would not pay for their own internet provider ... just look at their movie) although i still admit that i am a soft got a place for this movie, I thought some of the other people writing about this one might confuse it with another ... until I read the reviews ... especially the person who tagged the line on the front of the box: "The Ultimate in Frontal Lobotomy" (which is the f ** k meant anyway? "Frontal" lobotomy?) ... I completely forgot to read it in the review People, we're a few selections ... I say we meet once a year to watch this movie ... wait, have someone else this? If anyone does, please contact me ... I'm at least getting drunk.
