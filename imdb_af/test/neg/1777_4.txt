Stinger started 3 months ago on the submarine SS Newark where genetic experiments went wrong, and the crew member was brutally slaughtered by assassins. Jump to 'Camp Pendleton' a few months later where General Ashford (James Cagnard), Lieutenant Williams (John Miranda) on his mission to the Newark and the genetic scientist dr. Consulting Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows) before knowing it is a group of corporate scientists and marines aboard the Newark and is shocked to discover. He avoids crew bodies apart from dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark) doesn't make much sense. It's not long before the Scorpions attack, but the first time Lt falls. Williams. Sgt. Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) is promoted and takes the responsibility of making everyone safe and ending the threat of the giant scorpions. <br /> <br /> This Swedish America's co-production was directed by Martin Munthe and he also handled cinematography. I thought it was a strictly at-the-number uninspiring creature. It is early in the new year and Stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster / creature / insect type movie I saw in 2007. Hopefully things can only get better ... Mat Nastos's writing is incredibly clicked and gets all the ideas from other films, especially Aliens (1986), seeing that the remote place in this case is a submarine. There is the hasty team of marines, including one who chews the whole movie on a cigar, there are the scientists who have a blonde Swedish one to try and explain everything and the evil money grabs corporate villain who is the mighty dollar above placing one's life and the final ingredient is the monster / alien / insect or whatever. In this case, there are many large scorpions running around, but they have not been used in some unique or imaginative way, so they may also be murderers locusts. Yes, that's all here, unfortunately, Stinger is not a stranger if you get what I mean. It is a touch of over 100 minutes and is well predictable, though moving at a reasonable pace. As a stupid creature, you can make worse despite what many say on the IMDb ... <br /> <br /> Director Munthe doesn't stand out, it's not scary, there's a lack of atmosphere and action Scenes are boring and unaware. There are not many scorpions and it is almost an hour before any significant action takes place. The special effects are at the bottom of the scale, but I've seen it worse. I mean that's not to say the effects in Stinger are good, but I've seen worse. There is not much blood or gore, there are a few mutilated bodies, some decomposed heads and someone is half-torn. The only clever and amusing moment in the whole movie is when the naked Swedish female scientist asks her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money they will make from the scorpions. But there was a moment that drowned me & tore my hair into his stupidity as a block trying to repair the submarine's taps and get the light work by hitting the power supply / computer boards and hitting it too. .. <br /> <br /> Technically Stinger is at its best average and there is the usual endless amount of dark passages that become monotonous. Stinger was shot in Stockholm in Sweden if you are interested. The acting was poor and there was nothing else to say. <br /> <br /> Stinger is not a good movie, nor is it a big horror movie, I can't recommend it at all, but I've seen. worse. If you like Stinger (unlikely), you might have the similar theme 'giant scorpions on loose films', Tail Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006) (just as unlikely).
