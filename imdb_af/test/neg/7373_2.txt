This is the one major problem with this movie, along with much of Quebec's greatest movies: pretentious by pretentious people. <br /> <br /> It's really sad, but "big shot" filmmakers (row Dodge Stratus ...) of this province believe they have the truth, they know what the little ones are. <br /> <br /> We are not a rich province, every time a big movie like this (30 million? !!?) is made, it cuts many others who will not see their movies as a result of lack of government aid. It therefore generates mediocrity; only movies of "friends of the family" will be made. <br /> <br /> I sound angry and I'm. I thought Nouvelle France was expecting a trip in the ancestors' lives, but I caught myself in a puddle of contradictions: French accent (please our cousins, our quebec language) and a Lack of historical research is just a few. Add a love story and the same music party is playing again and again and stupid qu√©becois viewer opens and asks for more. I'm glad this pretentious piece of *** didn't do as planned by the Dodge Stratus Big Shots. It will help filmmakers who are not in the determined "movie business" of Quebec. <Br /> <br /> Hire Cruiser Bar instead and enjoy a good time. <br /> <br /> PS: I will never forgive them for destroying such an immense title.
