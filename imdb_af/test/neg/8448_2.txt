It's just one of those movies that can't justify much of anything. These people go for a ride: the young girl wants to photograph animals. There is really no Piranhas, but I think the psychotic hunter is the real piranha. Anyway, there are many animals and there is a lot of driving. There are considerable anti-rifles, but we all know where it goes. By the end there was a lot of action and a rape cast. Someone has to pay and they do. It would have been nice to have a few piranhas to fill out the thing. There were many monkeys. If you move forward through the dull parts, you have a little less than five minutes.
