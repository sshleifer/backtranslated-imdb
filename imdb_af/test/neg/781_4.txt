It's a movie you can safely avoid. childish plot and poor people from Cameron (she should not really accept these serious roles - they do not suit her). In addition, she seems to be the most ominous. Let's see it in the Charlies Angels and she's wonderful. There is something about Maria ... The Pope would not be a good US president and vice versa, my point is that there are a few actors / actresses suited to a particular kind of character and Cameron is the most suitable for this serious housewife type - there are a dozen other actress' would have done a much better job. The movie itself is quite incredible and youthful in its plot (did I play Juvinile right?) I noticed a comment from another reviewer who gave The Box a 10 rating. He was notable in his comments on other judges who rated the movie a 1 or 2 rating and could not play. I mean what spelling has to do with a movie review? Does he mean that people who play perfectly can appreciate this movie more than those who couldn't? C'mon 'professor.
