Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs trying to disrupt the American war effort from within. It's pretty hard to figure out first, because while we know these guys are something, their way of working is not very clear. I won't spoil it, but the end in pretty wonderful. There is a series of murders committed by our hero. A police force who doesn't know what's going on. What a coincidence that all the victims apparently come from the same home. There are comments like: A true patriot would do it or that. "It is obvious while suspicions are abundant, most of the world will not know a spy or a subversion if it jumps and bites. I was also surprised to see Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I never realized he had ever done anything other than sitting on a horse. There is, of course, the smugness of the criminals because they think they are immune to the murderer's guest list. Anyway, Bela is kind of a good guy and a bad guy in one role. The best scene in the movie is over, but I won't spoil it. As a curiosity, and for a time, it may be fun to watch some people.
