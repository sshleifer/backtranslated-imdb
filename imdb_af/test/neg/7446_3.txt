Recently, I bought three Robocop movies in one set, rather cheap and the only reason I did that was for the special edition of the wonderful first one. I've seen Robocop 2 before, but not for 17 years, this year it came out. I never watched it, because I still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how terrible it really was. It's really a mess, it has all the signs of a turbulent production with so many sub-plots at the same time. It also has a very uneven tone and it is also one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. I don't mind a little violence, the first one was incredibly violent, but this one is just nasty. Also the SFX is terrible even for 1990, say hello for bad stop motion. Also with a drug trade, child curse as a villain is just a little too much. Peter Weller has at least the common sense not to return for the next one. The only positive thing I can say for this movie is that it has some nice gags, like the thank you for not smoking one and the kiddie baseball team robbing an electricity store. To quote the child playing the villain "It sucks"
