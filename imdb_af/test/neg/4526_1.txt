Don't believe the hype. If you have high expectations or expected this movie to any extent, you may be disappointed. Even the hilarious and talented Steve Carrell can't save this poorly written, exaggerated, messy spy spot. For the purists (fans of the original TV series), this movie has little resemblance to the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except their names) are simply not the same characters. There are several isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is slightly more than a poor shadow of the TV version. For those who are not familiar with the original TV series, you may not be disappointed, but chances are you will be bored. There are also some cheap Hollywood political shots (really pathetic and o so typical for an election year). We left for the first hour and were not alone. Some left after 20 minutes.
