I only registered with IMDb to warn others about this movie. Hwo does anyone ever get funding for projects like this? That's the mystery. Goodbye to Harry could be the worst movie ever, except I tried to sweep the others competing with this blatant idiocy. Bad plot, non-credible logic runs throughout. I can't spoil this movie for you by revealing something that would make your experience less enjoyable. There is nothing nice about this movie. I have the CD and will send it to you for free, it's so bad. First, just serve. If I know you, this offer is void because I won't apply this movie to anyone, not intentionally. YOU ARE WARNING.
