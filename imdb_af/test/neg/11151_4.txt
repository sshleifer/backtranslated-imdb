I love Arnold and I love the subject, but it was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the previews, they were dark and ominous, and Arnold's name wasn't even mentioned. But I recognized him, which led me to believe he made a movie that was more of a serious, exciting mood. That it wasn't just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (although I admit, most of them are pretty good!). He has hitherto avoided films with any true religious theme. And I was excited. I was wrong. It's just another action, explosion, firearm. And it's a very bad one.
