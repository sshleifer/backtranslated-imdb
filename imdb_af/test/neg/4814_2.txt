With No Dead Heroes you get dull lines like this, as this deadly deadly action movie has to be seen to be believed. William Sanders was rescued by his friend Harry Cotter during a withdrawal in Vietnam, but found himself captured by the enemy. Fast forward ten years and Harry is now a brain-free Russian operation with a microchip implied in his brain. His new Russian superintendent is Ivan, who is played by Nick Nicholson's obscene hilt, which I can add, not only trying to speak with a Russian accent, but looks more like a gas station servant in Kentucky with its colored teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialogue coach for this film. Soon, William will be re-appointed by the CIA to hunt Harry down. He boasts Barbara, a freedom fighter who has rooted Ivan's El Salvador camp and soon they both inflated half of South America. Some scenes are so dreadfully dreadful that it is a wonder why this film no longer follows a cult. One such scene is the sudden love in the jungle by William and Barbara, accompanied by the most inappropriate cattery background music I've ever heard. Who would be completely naked in the midst of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that also uses the end theme of Blood on Satan's Claw. No Dead Heroes is the magical dot champion of all time, as one shot leads to multiple killings. In one scene, Harry sheds his gun from behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind and count it. Hard to find film that recently received full HD treatment by MGM. Follow this movie and watch it for the mere folly that follows.
