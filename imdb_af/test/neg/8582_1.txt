I have always found the dilettant Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be profoundly prosperous, and I have never understood why his work attracts so much attention. In addition to his Rayographs (which he accidentally found out, and which is only direct contact photos), she was one real contribution to culture that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way rather than art accepted as pornography. But it certainly had to happen, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> "L'Ã‰toile de merde" ... who's, "de mer" ... has a very vague photography and a repetitive visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained . Starfishes have the fascinating ability to repair lost limbs. And even to regenerate dual bodies, but if it has something to do with the movie's theme, then Ray confuses it. I was much more impressed with the title cards of this movie, which include rhymes, puns ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux. <br /> <br /> As so often in Ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. Unfortunately, photography (largely) is so vague that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. I'll judge this mess one point out of 10.
