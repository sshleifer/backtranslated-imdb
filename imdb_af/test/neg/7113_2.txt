Live action version of Dragon Ball via Taiwan. <br /> <br /> Evil Lord comes to earth to get the seven magic dragon balls. There are pearls that come together to make a dragon appear and give you your wish. Many action and bad comedy follow. <br /> <br /> What can I say "the best way to watch this movie is with very drunk but witty friends"? I do not know. It's really bad but funny about the way really bad movies can be. Come on, this is one of the few martial arts movies I've ever seen where you actually see the threads. It's a lively action cartoon and not so far removed from what I've seen the show, it scares me to the big US budget now being filmed. <br /> <br /> If you have drunk friends and feel like picking up a movie see this movie. If you see it sober (like me), avoid it.
