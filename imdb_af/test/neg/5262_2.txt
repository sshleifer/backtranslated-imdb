This movie has a very strange mix of genres - toilet humor and action in one. It didn't really pull it off - it had to be fixed on one genre. The best thing I can say about the movie is that the dog is cute in it. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing row is in the middle of the movie when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop at a hunting lodge / motel. I'm not quite sure what the point of this row is - it just seems gratuitous in the extreme. The owner of the hunting house ("Charlie") is a very northern man. For some reason, Moses starts talking to Charlie about porn, jacking off, homosexual sex, sex in a threesome. Charlie's picture of his wife looks like Charlie's dress. There is no reason for this really youthful dialogue and scene. Anyway, the whole scene looks set to the moment a naked Moses comes with Carter's gun on his butt and Charlie sees them through the window. The whole series of school boy humor about homosexuality - shocked and titillated at the same time - which I don't find funny at all. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who is always raving about Adam Sandler movies. This is the first one I've seen. After that I no longer know if I want to see. <br /> <br /> VAT, that's my husband's account - he saw Gilmore happy and he tells me It's pretty good. Maybe I'll just give Sandler one more chance. <br /> <br /> Countess Skog
