Although Charlie Chaplin made some big short comedies in the late 1910s, others didn't make it right. Examples such as His New Job and Shanghaied come in mind and I will also include The Floorwalker in this category. <br /> <br /> Charlie is mistaken for a shopping mall manager (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it, and Charlie is just an honest client but is accused of some missing items stolen by other customers. <br /> <br /> There isn't much laughter in it, except for the last few minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator. For the rest, quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
