It looks nice from the movie sleeve, but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual Western story documentary without any female interest. The film quality was poor, and there was hardly enough gang-gang action to keep even the drunken person's interest long enough to watch the whole movie. May God be merciful about the souls of both the actors and filmmakers responsible for what I can only describe as my new one and the only reason I never see or trust an Australian movie again. I have to write more, so I'll say the actors were so bad I was positive. I can make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a Trojans box. Please do not see this movie for your sake.
