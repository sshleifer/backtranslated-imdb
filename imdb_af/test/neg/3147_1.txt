I didn't watch this show so much when I was little. And I think I just watched one episode about Railroads, I believe because I like trains and still do. Even then I thought it was a baby show. I mostly looked at Arthur. The songs are also weird. And I don't think it's so educational either. They just sing a few dumb nurseries. It's a stupid show, any adult who loves to love it! If you want some good children's shows, look something like Arthur, Mister Rogers Neighborhood or even better Pee-wee's Playhouse. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little, but even better than Barney. Trust me, this show is pretty stupid, there are other children's shows that are better than this one. I can see many reviews here that many people don't like this show. Now there are some mature people. I hope they will soon be leaving this show of air.
