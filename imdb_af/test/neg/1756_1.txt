The two lead, an Englishman and an Aussie who filmed an American Civil War story in Romania, did not have the slightest spark between them, are absolutely incredible lovers and totally unsympathetic. There is no story, no characterization, almost nothing to separate the eyelids during this intermittent drill. Ren√© Zelwegger, also desperately overlooked, visits the fence posts practically, but embarrasses her to some degree of comic relief. Nicole Kidman is a decade too old for the role and does not have the slightest idea. Jude Law's moron role can be played equally well by any of the Romanian extras. The only requirement is to venture into the forest and watch a parade of gas stars stealing the shows. Not that it matters, because all the guest star roles were completely unnecessary because they didn't progress the so-called plot by one iota. And as if everything wasn't enough, the author found it necessary to turn in a twist, wirling, kung fu jumps off horses. What was it about?
