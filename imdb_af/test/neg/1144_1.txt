I have been sitting for 2 hours. I don't know what was worse, the horrible plot, the lame characters or the Hawaiian hottie that Eddie's 11-year-old and 80-year-old grandfather made sexual progress. The money spent on this was just rinsed on the throne. Matty Simmons should be ashamed. The original idea for this movie was "a Swiss family Griswold" and it has changed somehow in this mess. The only light spot is that it's ratings were so bad, we'll never see it on TV again. UNDERSTAND ALL COSTS ... RENTAL PROTECTIONS XMAS or something else.
