If you like me, you will see it in a movie history class or something at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, anything is better than this movie. It's slow, confusing, boring, poorly built, stingy, gringy, should I go on? The message is good, but I've seen them treated better in several other movies. The acting isn't even good. This movie is even more uncomfortable, as it starts out as funny (not intensive) because of its surreal story, but in the end, it just becomes uncomfortable to watch. I honestly feel deprived of 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life. Why would anyone want to see a girl describing a trio for 10 minutes, as if driving through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listening to a hippie who can make sheep, seeing a kind of rape, or having the female lead see eating her husband. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie doesn't deserve anything but a 1/10. And if you're not happy with my preview, I'm serious and I like movies that symbolize symbolism, but this movie was just awful. make any excuse you can to avoid this movie.
