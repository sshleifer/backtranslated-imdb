It is sad to say that a movie is really awful and one tries to find ways to say it. However, this is a terrible movie. Gene Hackman is wasting time (and one suspicious, many dollars) to play his most famous, and often reclaimed, role as "Gene Hackman" again. Otherwise, television actors are given the chance to become movie stars, and successfully, resist the temptation. Patrick Swayze has a small portion and has gone on to bigger things for which he must be eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie following someone else's review and I felt that was another point of view. served. You may not agree with my review, but at least you have been warned.
