This performance can best be described as TV Bubble-Gum: It chews, it has a good taste and it lasts a long time. But, like Bubble-Gum, it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after some too much cold. <br /> <br /> This show contains many simple questions that are in the form of just games, such as Hangman, suggest simple phrase or guess items on a short list. Callers are the participants, and anyone can play. <br /> <br /> However, the questions are very easy. There are some techno music pumped into the background that are formed into a continuous loop. It never looks like it's getting old, but it never adds much to it. The hostess, however, whatever it is, is extremely comfortable, pleasant enough to watch and can make a few very amusing facial expressions. I rather enjoy the British woman. <br /> <br /> But there is nothing about this show. It's simplistic and uncompelling, though it can be entertaining if there is absolutely nothing else.
