42/100. Often referred to as "Tarzan with clothes on", but it is not in the same league as his distant Tarzan series. Basically, The Jungle Jim Series has become a Tarzan replacement for Johnny Weismuller, after he began to shape a loincloth. In Jungle Jim he is fully dressed. It cannot be compared to the Tarzan series in any way, not in acting, screen or production quality. This is nice hokey stuff. This one is the first best in the series, and it doesn't say much. Too much stock is used, and it is so obvious. The score is exaggerated, and the plot is lame and the production is so poor that it is sometimes difficult to watch.
