By far this must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I watch virtually every movie that goes on at night (either showtime, high school, cinemax, etc.). "Three" AKA "Survivor Island" puts you in so much stress if you just keep the paint dry to make you fall even more unhappy. If you want to feel like you've just wasted what looks like an eternity on the worst movie ever created, then you should look at this movie in all respects. I had to shout at least 900 times of idiotic twists. If I had 4 hands, I would put this movie 4 inches. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I believe the only people who want this movie are those with terrible morals.
