It's hard to make it through this movie without choking on your own vomit, to be honest. The clumsy animation doesn't help because it looks like a decade-old video you find in Morrisons' 99p bin. Nevertheless, it is better than the horrible script, which spends about a third of its length on redundant extras, such as Belle's contemporary problems, things about Scrooge's father, and many scary troubles with - choking - TWO ANTROPOMORPHIC MUSIC. These bizarre additions include screen time at the expense of elements you would think would be very important, such as Dickens's dialogue and key points of his plot. For example, the movie buggers play twenty-one questions, and at times fail to set scenes in the right order. Absolutely hopeless.
