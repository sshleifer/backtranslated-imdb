The Midnight Hour AKA: Tell Me No Lies (as found in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. One is Merritt as a movie, complete with a plot (no holes), good story and credible conclusion and the other is through the skin spot it tries. It's definitely no more than a B-Movie flip-flop, the sole purpose of which is to show every girl in the movie at least once in an excessively long sex scene. <br /> <br /> If you're a regular movie then it's at the bottom of the line game. HUGE plot holes ruin any storyline that goes for it. For example, if a co-worker is killed, will you call the police or go home and hit the bubble? To judge this movie by its skin content, it's watch ... rare. The girls, for the most part, are all pretty, but of course improved. The sex scene has been long and redo, and it has just done it to lose quality. <br /> <br /> Amber Smith can probably be a decent actress if she wants to. She wasn't as horrible as you could think, or maybe next to the rest of the role. She was much better than she was. <br /> <br /> Zoe Anderson, who played detective Arraya, should not even have a movie, much less in one. She looked good, so we know why she was there. <br /> Overall, I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even if you are looking for a good skin spot, there is much better there. I rate this 4 out of 10
