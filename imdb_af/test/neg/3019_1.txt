It's probably the worst thing I've ever seen on television. First of all, I'm pretty sure it takes itself quite seriously, and I tend to be pretty good at recognizing satire. Second, it shows Aristotelian levels of chauvinism; In one of the advertisements it describes one of the "playas" women in terms of "quality". Thirdly, every participant I saw on it (six, I think) was a dull beef of the variety that a Facebook with "BONING YOU" or "WOMEN" could have under "Lord For". To paraphrase Roger Ebert, it does not scrape the bottom of the barrel and does not deserve it in the same sense as barrels. The closest thing to a redeeming feature I experienced with regard to the key to the VIP was to be a female friend who assured me that the male cast was definitely the opposite of attractive, both physical and spiritual.
