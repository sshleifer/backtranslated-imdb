It takes place on Fire Island in the 1970s. A couple Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) throw a 4th of July party at their home. Unfortunately, their relationship falls apart and they have to prepare for a house full of strange guests. The rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy. <br /> <br /> OK - I'm a gay man, but I was back 8 when it was made. If it's a true view of gay life in the 1970s, I'm glad I wasn't there. From the mysterious opening credits that show children play in the sand (???), this movie rolls slowly into the accident. There is a guru (Robert Case) who talks about nothing of any interest. I wanted to enter the man halfway into his first LONG speech. There is the young child Danny who is there for his first time. There is the lesbian couple (who do nothing - except one strip without reason). There is the queen of learning. Worst of all is the eternal man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We are introduced to him and his friend (whose name I never got) when they get a flat tire. They shout and shout basically for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix an apartment. I know some people find it funny, but I found it offensive and pretty sad. The party itself is full of people you will never want to know. It's as if it's being plunged into a party, full of bad actors playing stupid people. With the only exception to Dudley no one can act. <br /> <br /> It can be valuable as a portrait of what Fire Island was like in the 1970s ... but it's pretty boring. It gets a 2 just for the regular male nudity of some very nice bodies.
