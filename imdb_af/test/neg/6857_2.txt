I don't really know why, but I saw it with a reasonable sense of anticipation. Unfortunately, it is misplaced. First, it is not horrific, it does not frighten and (unless it was even worse than I credited it - what is possible) did not try. It's a trashy comedy and the fact that I once smiled means I didn't give it a 2 a 1. This movie ripples on Gremlins in a very special way, I can't claim to have ever seen a movie she uses more herself. Very, very bad - avoid.
