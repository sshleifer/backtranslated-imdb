This movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay at home to get money by renovating it and then finding out that the house has a wife. Diamon in it and there is a portal to hell. In this movie there are lots of thin scenes like at the beginning of the movie how they clean the house and they start dancing to a cheesy song and some of the Demons at the end of the movie are just a few guys in the bad costumes trying to make terrible sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the professor tears his face. I just rented this movie because I'm a big fan of horror movies and it's just worth checking out if you're a fan of horror movies. The play in this movie is really bad the only good actor is Roy Scheider from the big movie Jaws and over all this movie has many flaws and my score is 4 out of 10.
