So many people loved this movie, but there are a few of our IMDb judges who got Mirrormask awfully uncomfortable to watch and sow selfishly. I fall into the latter of these two camps, and I will try to explain what it was that curled my teens. <br /> <br /> First, to straighten the record, I like Neil Gaiman's books. Sometimes I find his sarcastic, sarcastic, humorous humor somewhat geeky, and I actually prefer his work if he plays it straight and leaves the jokes alone - but even with his occasional fallacy his creativity and imagination find something extraordinary . <br /> <br /> Interestingly, one of Gaiman's strongest works is Coraline, a Gothic fairy tale story for kids who love jokes and high tensions and creepiness. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) redo the funnies, and tends to read at times like Terry Pratchett the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns but the band). Mirrormask occupies similar territory to Coraline, and when I saw the incredible footage in the trailer, I was a little excited that someone managed to convey Gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination. <br /> <br /> Praise of the movie, some series look great. However, the visual effects are sometimes ruined by CGI animation that resembles a Media Studies student project. Background and scenery are often incredible, but some of the character animation looks clumsy, amateur and cheap. In an early dream sequence, the spider is beautifully animated, but the bouquet animal seems poorly rendered and very 'computer-generated'. Compared to the standard of animation appearing in productions such as 'The Corpse Bride', Mirrormask sometimes looks very much amateur. In Mirrormask's defense, however, the budget was small for such a great vision, and some cracks in the effects can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What cannot be forgiven is the stilted, stagy, cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors are desperately struggling with the dialogue - and there is so much that they constantly stumble and stumble. Conversation is rendered completely unnatural, the jokes fall time and time again, and the turgid speeches seem to be the author's only way of plot interpretation. Combined with the fact that the actors work against a blue screen (which always adds an element of 'Phantom Menace') - this makes the film almost unshakable. In such an unreal environment, the actors have to work twice as hard to believe, and in the main they fail terribly. The starring girl puts a brave battle against the impossible stage-school dialogue, and sometimes shows a real promise, but it's never enough. The god-like cod'Oirish of the Valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend an excessive amount of screen time) pays any chance of this young actress rising over the material. Valentine's work seems to explain the plot to younger viewers, and to add some light. Personally, I don't want him near my 15-year-old daughter at all. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong with this movie? Answer .... Rob Brydon. What's annoying (for us Brits, anyway) we are known to be Rob Brydon! We watched him keep the screen for half an hour on his own (do the 'Marion & Geoff' monologues), and in the first 'real world' of the movie he is right. However, hold him in front of a blue screen and lose all sense of character and become the worst am-dramham I've seen for years. A real shame. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? Answer ... the mischievous bang-bark, sub-Courtney Pine saxing and inexplicable, too-high-in-the-mix soundtrack that never closes. God, the music is unceasing, loud, distracting, irrelevant and, if not enough, a shaky slap of bass has slipped over it. This makes the dialogue very difficult to hear, but it can be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? Answer .... That whistling mime artist. In modern society there should be no place for mime, apart from certain secret places in France. Every moment the camera goes on, whistling, mosquito, yogurt, I understand why the Edinburgh residents get a little anxious and fractious when the festive season comes again. <br /> <br /> My last criticism is that the movie is pretty boring. Surrealism is often boring ?? It also requires his audience to slip into a dreamy, Zen, accepting state, or that the audience is constantly raging through bigger and bigger surprises. A story that fits a little with characters we can think of and care about would have been a lot to give this emotional center unfortunately lacking, while the eyelids break down the hair. <br /> <br /> Finally, excuses to everyone who found depth, meaning and wonder in this movie. You've managed to suspend your unbelief, you've seen the creaking CGI, the crappy dialogue, and the turbulent actions that ignored and understand the creator's great imaginative vision. I wanted to, but I couldn't see beyond the real failures it dragged on. <br /> <br /> I hope Neil Gaiman will get it next time, if he gets the opportunity (or even wants).
