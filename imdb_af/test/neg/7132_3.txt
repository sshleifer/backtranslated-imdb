Let me start by saying that I loved the original Grudge. It was not one of the most frightening, hair-raising experiences I ever had in a full theater. I'm not joking. Being a self-proclaimed japanophile also made the movie look better in my eyes (if the environment changed to an American suburb, I'd probably hate the movie.) <br /> <br /> That said . This movie is a complete mess! I won't say it sucks because A) the movie has some good points, B) "it sucks" is the lame down in the history of lame put-downs. So how's the movie going for it? Well, to start with it has a nice cool look: through filters and the use of dark, washed-out colors, Takashi Shimizu almost makes the fearless, fearful atmosphere of the original. A few scenes are truly shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just bad. Period. <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere, telling the Tarantino style unnecessarily, ie the screens are out of chronological order. This technique is useless in the case of this movie and it makes things more confusing. Honestly, a simple plot would have worked better. The original also revealed, but it made sense and the movie more than the thin plot with lots of scares and a really tense atmosphere. Grudge 2 doesn't have any of these elements and is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget about the TV show acting skills, which the movie from the original Grudge looks like Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. Simply put, the movie doesn't work. It's too slow, too boring and not scary to make up for the confusing plot (which doesn't add anything to the story, so Grudge fans won't even be satisfied). <br /> <br /> Oh, and what about the old man playing Japanese look-a-boo on the bus? Is it supposed to be comic relief? Artistic statement? Or what?
