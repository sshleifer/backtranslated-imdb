Dreamy young Ashton Kutcher (like Tom Stansfield) wants a date with sexy blonde Tara Reid (as Lisa Taylor). Me. Reid thinks Mr. Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Reid's father, an anal retentive Terence Stamp (like Jack Taylor). Kutcher agrees to "house" the boss and believes he will get closer to Reid. Mr. Stempel has a pet owl called "O.J.", which becomes a toilet cake. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to get you limited to "G-rated" pre-teens ready for noisy "R-rated" rates. This will help if they haven't seen the plot before, and especially like moronic potjie humor. Remember, people are paid to do so. <br /> <br /> ** My boss's daughter (2003) David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid, Terence Stamp
