Unusual cold and stupid drama by director Sydney Pollack. Soup plot revolves around adultery couple disappearing into an airplane wreck, leaving their spouses to find each other and connect at their own intimate level. Romance novel writing is slow, though I thought the performances by lead Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas were good. Smooth production is important, although the plot still covers the same ground and never builds up emotional momentum. As a result, the climax at the airport is a big 'So What?'
