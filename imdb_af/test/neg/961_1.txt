Great story and great lead actors (Quaid and Ryan), but the movie is suffering from bad directing, bad screenplay and bad writing. The lead players do their part but can't save the movie at all. Bad because it could be a good 80's. style Hitchcock tension / riddle / thriller.Ryan looks so young and fresh in this one though. An ok look for big Ryan fans .....
