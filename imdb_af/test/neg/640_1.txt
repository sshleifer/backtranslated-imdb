It's a really horrible movie. Lou Diamond Phillips calls this one simple. The use of miniature models of the train is laughing. The plot seems to be evolving (there is a stranger on board; oh, and an eco-terrorist is also on board; oh, and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control; oh, and the train goes off to run an hour before another train, oh, and the train has nuclear waste on it ...). I mean, come on! The alien monsters are not terrifying (though there are many of them), and the acting is uncomfortable. Look at the guy who plays the "next president" - do you really think he can be president? For the sake of the good, he ran his whole acting and played bad guys!
