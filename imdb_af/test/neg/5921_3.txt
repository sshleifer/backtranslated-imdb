I'm just going to write more because it's necessary. The summary I put at the top, however, is much to speak for what this film was. You know a lot of who are from the beginning. In spite of his efforts to make a move, 'talent' is trying hard to have shock and dismay when a turn occurs. You never have to wonder 'whodunit' in this 'mystery'. <br /> <br /> The more I write, the more I feel bad about writing so much to comment, but rules are rules. I really feel bad to say this, but it's the lowest I've ever rated a movie ... I think. It makes me wonder what I save for 1 and 2 votes. However, I thought this movie deserves a 3, as I believe there was talent in the movie. Johanna Watts (or Watson) did a pretty good job. She cried and robbed in one part and I thought she had conveyed that emotion well. The man who played the trumpet also did well for his short part. <br /> <br /> Many of the actors did an "ok" job. But chief actor, David, forgets his name (terribly by name) - was pretty bad. I think he had thought he did dramatic exhibitions for "The Young and the Restless" or "Days of Our Lives". If you try, you can only wear it in a white lab coat and play a doctor with multiple personalities at 'General Hospital'. It doesn't help the movie even be shot like a day's soap. Though, I'm pretty sure I can shoot the same movie with a camcorder; although without the obvious and soap'ish sound editing. <br /> <br /> The first time I ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted. Although I wouldn't see it again, unless I paid a large amount of money.
