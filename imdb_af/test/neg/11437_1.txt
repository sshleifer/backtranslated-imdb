It's the funniest, crappiest, idiotic, silly movies I've ever seen in my entire life ... I can't believe there are directors who make these kind of movies ... this movie is a shame for the horror genre. .. acting ??? Oh! no !!! I can't carry it ... it's full of anxiety ... never watch this movie ... you'll feel like you're being tortured forever ... please, save yourself from the terrible fate of watching it movie. .. if you really want to live, do not look ... there are very good horror movies ... <br /> <br /> this movie not just one voice ... but, I hate to vote if I want to post my comment ...
