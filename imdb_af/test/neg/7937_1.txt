Is it just me, or is it an AWFUL movie? I'm going to make it an AWFUL movie ... <br /> <br /> Know that this is an old movie (usually defined as full of motor hunting, crashes, gunfights, explosions, etc.), I still expect a low degree of credibility. If I can't believe in some way, the movie won't work. So, we come to the problem with "Attack on Precinct 13." <br /> <br /> Not one for spoilers, I never report details of the plot. However, I will make an exception here because the plot is so dirty. Bad man is imprisoned in Precinct 13. Bad guy's friends want to brush him out. Surprise. The bad guys' friends are actually corrupt policemen. Bread, upset, but heroic young police, save the day while the girl is being praised. UGH. Yes, it's really that simple, and it's dumb. <br /> <br /> "Attack on Precinct 13" takes place in Detroit. Not a bad environment for crime and corruption (I spent three months there at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Yet, it is excessively violent and offensive to the Detroit police and civilians. I spent a lot of time in the center of Detroit, but I can't imagine how the final chase in Detroit's center got away. I must have missed it ... <br /> <br /> There are NO refunds to watch bad movies. Save your money. There were too many good films in 2005 to waste even $ 3.00 at Blockbuster on this one. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: 1 <br /> <br /> (Only because I've seen worse movies.)
