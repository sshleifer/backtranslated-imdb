OK, let's see ... A handsome young stranger is new in town and walks around on the local boardwalk. He meets a pretty girl, met with the petty leader of the local hip-young vampire club, risking to follow them in this cave, come in a conflict over the beautiful girl, follow an epic battle ... <br /> <br /> No, they are not lost boys, although you will be very busy telling the difference, as I think even some of the carnival music is the same. (Do you have to pay royalties for sampling a movie?) Even the end of this stinkbomb is ripped off from Lost Boys. The make-up is under the parole, even for a low-budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and exactly how much "Oh, I have this terrible experience" tones of teenage anxiety need one movie? The humor is flat and stupid, and everything is unfortunately predictable. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The only scary thing about this turkey is the promise (threat) of a successor, an idea that hopefully every distributor in the country will spend an interest.
