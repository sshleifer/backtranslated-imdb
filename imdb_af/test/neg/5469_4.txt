While buying cigarettes, professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is kidnapped and forced to have kinky sex by three women over many days. When released, the director of his company Isabel (Greta Scacchi) has already replaced him in the scene and his girlfriend gives him a cold reception. The disturbed and humiliated Daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessed with looking for the kidnappers. Daniel has sex with many women he suspects to be the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Revelation" is a strange movie with a promising start that loses its initial power and becomes a kind of too long erotic soap opera or softcore. The production is elegant, the cover of the DVD is great, but the characters are not well developed and the trauma of Daniel looks excessive as most of the men with the dream situation he imagined would fantasize? sexual object of three sexy women. The melodramatic development with Isabel's disease does not add value to the plot; The open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for the motive of the women or the title. It is very clear that the script of a man's feelings was written by a woman. It was nice to see the beautiful Greta Scacchi anyway and her makeup is finally impressive. There is a proverb in Portuguese that can be translated into English as follows: "If the rape is inevitable, relax and come." Daniel had to do it and saved me from watching nearly two hours of a useless story. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Livro das Revelações" ("The Book of Revelation")
