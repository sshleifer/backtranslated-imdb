It's like a zoology handbook, as the portrayal of animals is so accurate. Here are some details that have changed slightly during the transition to film: <br /> <br /> - Handgun balls never hit giant Komodo dragons. No matter how many times you shoot at the Komodo, the bullets just don't get close. <br /> <br /> - The best way to avoid eating through a giant Cobra or a giant Komodo dragon is just to stand there. The exception to this rule is if you have said to keep quiet. In that case, run until the Komodo is right next to you, and then stand there and expect the defeat to be. <br /> <br /> - Minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits makes it really nice to watch. <br /> <br /> - $ 5,000 is a memory enhancement tool, and a generous replacement for losing your boat license. > <br /> - Members of the elite army units do not see giant Komodo dragons coming to them within one meter of the excessive creatures. Perhaps the computer-generated nature of these dragons is something to do with it. <br /> <br /> - When filming a news story aimed at exposing illegal animal experiments, a reporter and a cameraman with one camera are all the gear and staff you need; sound gear, second camera, microphones, etc. everything is superfluous. <br /> <br /> - If you scream a hard animal and one person has a gun, he should take it out and show it to the nearest person. <br /> <br /> - If you take out a gun, the sound of safety is diminished even if your finger is nowhere near safety. <br /> <br /> - Reporters agree halfway across the globe to uncover something - without having the worst idea they expose. Background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism. <br /> <br /> - Handguns hold at least 52 bullets in one clip and then more than that in the next clip. Nevertheless, those with guns claim they need more ammunition. <br /> <br /> - Expensive cameras (also, remember the reporter only has one camera) are left behind without having to hesitate for a moment. These cameras can bring back their way back to the reporter. <br /> <br /> - The blonde girl is really the stupid one. <br /> <br /> - The same girl who says not go into a house because a Komodo dragon can easily run through it, making it unsafe, taking a team in a building of the same material for protection - and no one says a word about it. <br /> <br /> - High technology facilities look like simple high school chemistry sets. <br /> <br /> - Genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet in a matter of a day, but don't grow at all in the weeks of one side. <br /> <br /> - The army completely destroys the islands when people do not meet deadlines. <br /> <br /> Men with rifles do not necessarily change the direction of shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them. Instead, they just keep shooting in the air. <br /> <br /> - The better you look, the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures. <br /> <br /> - Woman's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn thoughts. <br /> <br /> - Every time you are hunted by giant creatures, it's a good time to hit girls half of your age. <br /> <br /> - Animal bug sounds are an appropriate masking noise for "same-volume" curse. <br /> <br /> - Old Israeli and Russian aircraft are regularly used by US Military.
