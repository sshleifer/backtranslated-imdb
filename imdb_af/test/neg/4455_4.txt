It is a pity that such a lamb should be hung in such picturesque places, with some documentary style reports being moved for extra length. A shorter movie could hold the tension a little more, and a more charismatic lead might not have had so many lines. The female head was also not allowed to do enough, leading to a beautiful but boring affair. It builds to the end, but the editor-in-chief's own salvation is too late and had to be revealed earlier in the movie. Not terrible, just sorry. Unexciting but nice enough to receive TV schedules of the early hours.
