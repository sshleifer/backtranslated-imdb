There is considerable money behind this production, so its appearance is very good. This includes some interesting appearances by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns, and a short como at the beginning of Christopher Lee. There are some exciting rifles, and a humorous little or two - the satire on Django, the Man with No Names and Sabata is amusing, especially when given the names of failed presidents of the Mexico Revolution. <br /> <br /> The problem is, there is no purpose to satirize the Spaghetti Western as attempted here. The key element in the Spaghettis is IRONY, which easily mixes in comedy; In fact, the source of all Spaghetti's is Kurosawa's Yojimbo, universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time, and most Spaghettis have easily slipped over the edge in the true comedy of a very sophisticated variety. Perhaps the best evidence of this has been found in the Trinity films, which are both openly spaghetti and open-cut stick comedy. So why bother with the satirization of a psychological genre? As a result, I found the whole business essentially unconvincing. None of these characters were people I would ever care about, the story was generic, and the production values ​​only reflected the money involved, not the passion of the director. Over all, a banal and useless attempt to pay on the phenomenon, mock it.
