This movie is like so many biopic TV movies I've seen: formulating, exaggerated, poor acting, and above all happening too soon. <br /> <br /> What I mean by that is the movie filmed and mattered, broadcast to Michael Jackson's acquittal of his child molestation complaint, which I believe was one of Jackson's most important periods of life and career so far. This would have been a great end to this drama drama. However, this film is more than just chilling, too much detail in this overly ambitious project. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Michael Jackson has led the most interesting life to date from any musician, let alone pop star today, and his story is likely to take six behind the music offers to tell accurately. This movie was trying to tell too much over three hours, and needless to say, it failed. <br /> <br /> Flex Alexander did what he could to play Jackson, but he came more like a SNL caricature. Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. It would be quite difficult to find someone who accurately portrays Jackson without meeting with the King of Pop himself and studying his methods of madness. However, on a shocking budget, one can only depend on what they see in the tabloids, and it doesn't necessarily give an accurate representation. <br /> <br /> Also, the director's efforts to make Alexander look like Jackson are completely foolish. The caucasian make-up on Alexander's face makes him look like a reverse minstrel show, and everyone in a grocery store knows that Jackson's nose isn't as big as Alexander. It's also incredible to me that the movie documents Jackson under the knife to get cosmetic surgery, but in the next scene, Alexander still has the same size nose. This kind of suspension of unbelief that the director expects cannot take place on TV viewers in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> It was even more distracting when the footage of real Michael Jackson (that is, the time he hung baby boy over a balcony in Germany) was recorded in real time between the film. It was a good try, but it just didn't work. <br /> <br /> If this movie is released in the theaters, it will only get a profit because of its stickiness. It even highlights compared to "Mama Dearest", and it says a lot. Above all, it was a movie that was probably rushing to make, like many non-HBO TV movies. It could have been much better done if it had just told one aspect of Jackson's life. Even if it only covered child molestation allegations, it would probably have been much better done and even intriguing.
