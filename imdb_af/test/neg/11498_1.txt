I just finished reading the book and was really looking forward to seeing this TV adaptation broadcast on the Hallmark channel on Monday night (5/30/05). The key to the whole book was the manifold stolen by the man with steel tooth, but I watched for an hour (out of 3 1/2) and I saw the man with the ants, but I never saw him . I saw someone stealing viruses, but what did that have to do with the book? This is too bad because this film had great production values ​​and good works, but it's not the idea to make a book in a movie (TV or movie) to get the people reading the book part of the audience no. They just kept me for an hour. I thought the assumption of the book was wonderful and what they did, but threw out the whole point. This book had a great McGuffin (to paraphrase Hitchcock), but they ignored it. And it said in the titles that Forsyth was involved in the production. They probably had to pay him a lot of money.
