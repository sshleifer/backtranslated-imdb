Terrible "comedy" in which beautiful, crazy woman (Liv Tyler) "comedies" destroy the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon rents a hit (Michael Douglas) to kill her. What happens to comedy? The year 2001 produced some of the worst comedies (Silverman, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcats, etc.). This is one of the worst. There is not one, repeat, not ONE funny moment in it. The jokes are either stupid, unsuitable, slim or really sick. There is also a strong hatred of women in this garbage - the only main female character (Tyler) is continually used as a sex object. Also extreme, bloody violence is thrown to the end. The only portable moments come from Reba McEntire as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles - both psychos. Dillon, Goodman and Reiser hit an everyday career low. The only way to go is. And poor Tyler! She stops intelligent, gutsy independent movies for HERE? And DOUGLAS ???? What was he up to when he agreed to this? A full shit - to be avoided at all costs !!!!!!!!!!
