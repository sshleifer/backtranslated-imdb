I never figured out what the appeal of Karen Black was. She always had those shiny eyes and kind of a strange look over her. She was often eccentric or thrown as the "other" woman. In this one, she is the psychological adviser and expert on the occult to a crumb producer of bad ads when he teaches astral projection. He is an average sucker, even without the new luggage. Apparently this is the way to immortality, because if you do well, you can inhabit the bodies of future generations. I believe Star Trek has a plot like this with Jack the Ripper who has been hanging out for centuries. Anyway, this guy is really dangerous. He has a nice family and makes them unhappy. He starts killing friends just because they have unfriendly comments about them, or he doesn't like it. You can see the end coming from the back row in the left field. This is a very hard, humorous movie. Most of them must be considered truthful. Why are some called but few chosen? I found it for a long time and not very satisfying.
