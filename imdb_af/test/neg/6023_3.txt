The promotions for "Clubbed" project a smooth film based on the clubbing scene of the 1980s. What we end up is a movie with identity issues. The subplots end up taking over from what viewers would suppose to be the main plot. The focus on this movie is mainly about "clubbing" and eventually gets into the gutter. <br /> <br /> Boxes, depression, self-rejection, gangsters, bouncers, and drug trafficking are all hurriedly packed in 90 strange minutes. No less than 4 occasions I had to watch the movie's run time because the concern grew that this movie was bound to disappoint. <br /> <br /> Which clubs we see are vague and repetitive. about 3 extras dance in which is almost recognizable as a "club", barely taking the sphere of the day. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about the 80's club set that did "Human Traffic" for the late 90's, forget about "Clubbed".
