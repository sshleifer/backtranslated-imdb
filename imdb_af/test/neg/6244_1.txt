After reading many good things about it, I finally looked at the clearing. With a cast of big actors like Redford and Dafoe, one would at least expect a decent movie. After the final credits were thrown, I was still shocked at how bad and incoherent this movie was. <br /> <br /> Is it supposed to be an "art" movie? I don't think so, because it's too melodramatic for that. The bad thing is that the drama seems to be forced and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The truth is, the scripture makes absolutely no sense. First, it never explains the motive behind any of the characters, but it just exceeds their so-called "personal issues." What is so bad about Redford's character's life that he has to "clean" it? The fact that he cheated, occasionally his wife? The man is a millionaire who has a good life, has a good son and a big daughter, a woman who loves him (and a girl who is also far away from the generic mistress type woman) and " a newborn grandson. just problem seems to be that he ... worked hard for his entire life to be a successful person. Approximately? His hard work seems to have really paid off and there really is no real problem with his life. /> <br /> Then we come to Dafoe's character: here is someone who was a manager of one of Redford's companies and was dismissed. Why is this man unemployed for eight years ??? He seems to need some kind of good education to have a job like he did in the first place and apparently be a man with firm ideas about his work (as evidenced by his backstage of conversation what he had at Redford when he worked for him) Why can't a man get a decent job and have a decent life? Because he was fired once? Totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The movie tries these men as "tortured souls" or something and it comes down as very cheesy. In fact, I would say that if the creators of this movie tried to say something about the American dream t Hen they unfortunately failed. <br /> <br /> Whatever the real events happening during the movie, they make no sense either. In fact, the last 20 minutes of the film come down as an insult to the viewer's intelligence, because there is not one thing that actually makes sense. Redford has about 1000 chances to escape, but he doesn't. At one moment he was ready to escape and he missed his chance because he felt sorry for his kidnapper and didn't want to hurt him! Then Dafoe grabs his rifle from the water and the mud, which would be useless (if you fire a gun with a gun after the gun was in the water and mud it might blow in your face) and the gun is a perfect condition !!! The way an unemployed, useless (as depicted in this movie) and spiritually unstable character manage to suffocate the entire FBI with such ease brings the narrative of this movie to "twilight zone" levels. The cute end (with Redford's wife's illusion) comes <br /> <br /> This movie proposes to be something, it's not (that is, a quality, sophisticated psychological thriller). Unfortunately, it fails so hard that it becomes a disaster and that is the word that describes This movie is the best: A DISASTER.
