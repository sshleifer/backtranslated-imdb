It is an irreparable, stupid, boring, unattractive piece of garbage. Looking at a live video slasher pick, it's just fair to expect the movie to be trashy at some level, but it goes beyond trashy. It's just terrible at every level, with a clich√© ride script that has been incredibly stupid and incredibly boring at the same time, a film with no name on actors and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen do not have. Even fans of slasher movies will find nothing here that would make this movie worth an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on your regular group of young people who decide to spend the weekend at a remote West Virginia farm that one member of the group recently inherited. Unfortunately for the teenagers, the hereditary land was once owned by a farmer who made sacrifices to help his crops grow, or something stupid in that direction, and now there are evil scarecrows that kill everyone. I don't know anything about writer Paul Moore, but I assume he is more than ten years old, so he should find something more original than killer scarecrows. Honest. <br /> <br /> The special effects the scarecrows bring to life are laughing arm. They often look almost like Halloween costumes on sticks. Special effects like this would have been reasonably considered over twenty years ago, but according to today's standards it is nothing but embarrassment. <br /> <br /> It's a total waste of time for all viewers, whether in horror movies. If you have to watch a slasher movie, rent one of the "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" movies. Most of them are not very good, but are definitely better than such crap.
