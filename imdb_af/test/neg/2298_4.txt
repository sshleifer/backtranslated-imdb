You know, I really have a problem with movie lists. I read Maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 best B movies of all time, and of course I know I have to go and see everyone and write reviews from everyone. That's why you see reviews of movies like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy on my list. So I noticed H.O.T.S. at the video store the other day and acknowledged it from Maxim's list of the 50 best B movies, and I decided to rent it and check it out. My only consolation is that I rented it because I recognized it from a list of B movies, so I already knew it was going to suck. <br /> <br /> Given the type of movie it is, I can't say that H.O.T.S. is a total failure, as it is nothing more than a 70-year-old T & A movie, and it never makes any difference. The only place it deviates widely from its purpose is in an unfinished subplot involving some ex-cons who pushed many stolen money into the home of the self-proclaimed H.O.T.S. move in, because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie. Despite the fact that the rest of the movie is like this, this subplot is completely redundant and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a few competing girls at the beloved FU, which existed as one of those universities that contained a grand total of one girl to reject their own form of return. at the snobs in the other. This new tournament, Help Out The Seals (HOTS), is a tournament that is supposedly based on helping seals (the seal subplot is another that doesn't really belong in the movie and little attention is paid to the meaning of that movie). name given a seal running around here and there throughout the film). <br /> <br /> It will sound weird, but there was one scene I was really impressed with in this movie. One SHOT I was impressed with, I must say. About halfway through the movie, one of the girls in Pi, the rival wrestling, was thrown into the punch, and she threw herself into a glass and drank it. Strangely, what she does when she drinks the alcohol reminds me of something Charlie Chaplin would do, which really brightens the film. Of course, nothing in this movie comes close to what Chaplin ever did, but that shot alone solved my score for the 2 to 4 movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, the movie is exactly what you'd expect it to be, many people are running around to look for excuses to take off their clothes (I liked how the one-piece one-of-a-kind-of-every-score in the soccer match was one of the girls' ideas.) And not much thought is placed in much of anything else. For example, there is a scene early in the movie when some of the Pi girls are hot sauce in the refreshments at a H.O.T.S. party is accidentally captured in an incriminating photo (the girl who took the photo did not realize she was photographed at the time), although the photo never comes into the film any reason later. <br /> <br /> I've seen such movies before, it's like Gator bait, but without the violence and the Rednecks and Coffy were not far off. Even Barb Wire is very similar, just with a bigger budget and more silicon. Luckily, Maxim's 50 B movie contains only a few more comedies, because while these stockings T&A movies are entertained every time with bad movies with the occasional semi-nude scene, after H.O.T.S. watched. I think I decided that I liked the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies. I'd rather watch many horrible actors as if they're scared as if they're funny.
