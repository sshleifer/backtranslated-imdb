Demon Wind is about as much fun as your legs break. It's definitely a terrible example of a movie. It's so terrible that I don't even consider a movie. I describe it more than a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do. We decided to watch some horror movies (unfortunately we chose this one.) Well, in the 90 minutes this thing played, we finally laughed so hard that we almost threw up. . The thing is literally useless in every sense of the word. It's just a cheap, bad round of Evil Dead. The whole "story" seems to be nothing more than a guy who wants to break down his friends by inviting them to a deserted house and cutting demons. I have a bet that the writers actually wrote the story while it was filmed. I've seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS !!!) (Shudder) I have to say that Demon Wind can definitely fight any and all of these movies in terms of sheer stupidity. Just watch if you enjoy laughing at silly movies. <br /> <br /> Fun Fact: This movie is like a cockroach on steroids! Just like the ouija board, it always looks as if it is mysterious again, every time we try to get rid of it. Terrible huh?
