It's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so bad that I plan to rent it again once I can find it. This movie makes 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' like an Oscar contender. Just look at the actors, I'd like to laugh out loud. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. It's terrible it's perfect. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). It's as far as I can go ... I'm laughing too hard. I know it shouldn't be funny, but ..... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL * <br /> <br /> STARTING ON WOOD! <br /> <br /> Regard's * DATE *
