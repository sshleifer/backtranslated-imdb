Nico Mastorakis's banned movie was, I think, very disappointing. The film is about a few, who go to a Greek island to kill all distorted people. You know you have something sick when one of the first scenes has a guy who has sex with a goat and then kills it. <br /> <br /> But things just get worse from that point, as all screens look the same. They meet some people, so they murder or sex with them (preferably both). <br /> <br /> The end is ok, when the couple allegedly remains brother and sister and she just rots him somewhere. but overall one would have expected more. No dust here, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
