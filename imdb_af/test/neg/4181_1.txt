The first DH wasn't so good, but I didn't really expect it. But this terrible movie was just out of criticism. I'm really trying to look at the shiny side and give movies like this a chance, but I just couldn't really find a good thing about it. I appreciate what Bill Cowell is trying to do, but this movie was just as boring. The story of the movie is really not that bad. In fact, it's somewhat original. But the film form is really as bad as many people say. In my opinion this one is right there with "The Off Season" and "Dracula 3000". I really know many people trash and put movies like this, but I really can't think of any other good things to say about it.
