Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. Bad acting, bad characters, annoying fool, bad lines, call it. Honestly, I'm not all that surprised that more people didn't see this movie. The only reason I watched Killjoy 2 is because I wanted to think the filmmakers learned about their mistakes. They didn't. This movie is just as bad, if not worse, than the first one. That clown .... that divine clown .... I hate him! I hate him so much! And I don't hate him because he's a good villain ... I hate him because he's annoying! I hope the filmmakers realized after they tried and failed again that this movie was irreparable. The last thing we need is a Killjoy 3.
