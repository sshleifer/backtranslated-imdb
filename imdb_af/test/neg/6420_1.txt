Years ago, Sara, a young girl, testified that her parents were murdered, and as an adult she suffered from various mental disorders (I mentioned that she has an imaginary friend?) This movie makes the viewer asleep, not in a sense of tension. but rather a feeling of drowsiness. Deadly boring, I found it hard to go through, because I could feel my eyelids getting heavier and heavier with every endless minute of sensible cattle and supposing 'mystery'. Does Sara go crazy or is it paranormal? A better question would be, who cares? And the answer to that, no one. Nobody. Skip this movie, save yourself a little better fit to do other, more valuable tasks. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D-
