This movie was just bad. I can forgive low budget movies to be low budget, but it wasn't funny, it wasn't smart, it didn't have redeeming features unless you really wanted to look at false boobs. I do not know what this genre is classified as possibly an erotic horror, but if so, it is not sexy or scary. It was useless to tie it in the slumber party bloodbath movies. I have never seen myself the previous movies, and except for one scene trying to tie it together, I had no way of knowing who the escaped psycho-killer was in "Cheerleader" or why they were bothering to involve him not, especially because and I don't think I reveal anything here). It was very clear that the cheerleader's killer in this movie was not his. As for the real killer? All I can say is, lamb. Really lamb. If you find out why the killer is taking the cheerleading group (and the coach's coach and two trainers traveling on the bus, and the bus driver apparently for that) you will sit down. there and go - WTF? Worst excuse for a murder spell ever. The "actors" (two guessing why I added the quotes) generally looked like low budget porn rejections, which they probably were. The poor people are trying to break into a "legitimate" movie. One of my friends had to say about the actor Buzzy, the bus driver, said: "He looks like the man you know, really gets in there, and his face turns red and good." We had a good bag for that. Half of the other actors had all the skills and subtleties of the actors in the sixth grade production of "Annie" I just saw. The other half was very bored to death (especially in the runaway scene, this one redhead ...), and ten minutes in this movie I was. <br /> <br /> A Note: The DVD contains one deleted scene, which would place the R-rated movie into NC-17 if it had been inserted. It was completely free, and as adult entertainment is not of a quality. The only reason to bother it is to laugh a lot at the bad things.
