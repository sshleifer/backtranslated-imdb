These rubber samples failed to cool, anything or comedians, resembling a wannabe movie from Porkys or Animals House, but the sequences and history are not always clear and cannot get your attention. All the movie looks cheap and with an incredibly bad taste, the only thing that makes you laugh is the terrible rubber samples that have to cost one dollar each, because the job or they never look realistic. The movements and expressions make the Muppets look like a Pixar 3D movie compared to this. Hope Marie Carlton is the only thing that supports this horrible movie, and when she dies in the movie, it gets even worse than before. A movie that just needs to be seen in advance.
