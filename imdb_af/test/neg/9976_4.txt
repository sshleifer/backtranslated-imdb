Mr. Giallo fanatics: beware and / or be careful? because this movie is not exactly what it seems to be. It certainly looks like a Giallo, with its juicy VHS cover (a busty naked girl and a big bloody knife), rhythmic title and the names of two veteran Italian actors in the film (John Phillip & Fernando Rey), but it's basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot. The version I watched is presumably hard censor? with a running time of barely 77 minutes ?? But then there is still a serious lack of tension, character development and most sadistic (and typically Giallo) massacre. "Eyes behind the wall" can be summarized briefly as the collection of many twisted characters and the extensive depiction of their sexuality issues. However, this is an interesting effort because writer / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) has clearly tried to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfactory and unfortunate. Inspired by Hitchcock's "Rear Window", the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair-bound writer. He and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks to spy on the single male tenant staying over the road. The tenant, respectively, likes to do gymnastics exercises at home while they are naked and clearly have bisexual desires. Wheelchair sends his wife over and they have sex. Then there is also Ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. Are there any normal characters in the story? Well no, of course not! The movie benefits from a continually ominous atmosphere, with a gentle soundtrack and nifty photography, but none of the ever leading, it is all just sleaze & sex-free. There is a real bizarre turn / revelation at the end of the story, but it comes too late and too haphazard to increase the overall quality. Not recommended for fans of Italian horror / cult cinema, but perhaps it is great for psychology students to analyze the characters Freud style.
