It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Can anyone explain the plot of this movie to me? Yes, I know the bus ran out of gas in the middle of the desert, after the driver never noticed that his compass was not functioning, but how? And how did it end? Maybe I'm stupid to understand this movie, but to me it was an absolute waste of time. <br /> <br /> My recommendation? Don't bother, there are much better movies to be seen. This movie is accompanied by my other everyday low-lows (Go Overboard - Adam Sandler and Fire on the Amazon - Sandra Bullock)
