Now I understand that it took two months to shoot. Really? I'm pretty sure my crew can do it in less than a week. This movie sucked so badly that I couldn't even pay attention. Just more evidence that booing women can't always save you from horrible writing, acting and direction. Now I understand it was no budget effort, but there is also no continuity and no real reason not to shut it down and to look at infomercials or foreign news in a language you don't understand. Oh, there are some decent females showing the goods. Yet, there are not enough sexy women alive to justify watching this movie-based transvestie. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. However, I helped it with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you can use it after this hack work. Lastly, the individual (moron) who thought about me was a good movie and loved it. Just more evidence that brothers and sisters should not create. Ow, BURN !!! - Captain J
