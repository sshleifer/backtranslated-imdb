They said it would be a movie bigger than Turkish Fruit. How do they dare <br /> <br />? It's not even 10% of these classics. Bad acting. The only character I had sympathy for was the one that Angela Disk played. Her acting was the best in the whole movie. The story could have been interesting, but it wasn't. Some screens were very well filmed (lights and camera), such as the <br /> <br /> opening scene, but the bad scene disappeared the magic <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand why so many people did this movie so well. <br /> <br /> Good.
