Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the worst movie I've seen all year, and I've walked over a few dozies. There is nothing about this garbage, from the characterization to the direction of the plot. Even the usually brilliant Dominique Swain couldn't save this movie. None of the characters is at least a little sympathetic, with the possible exception of Eloise (wonderfully portrayed by Lacey Chabert, the only brightest place in this dull failure). <br /> <br /> Possible Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with Tart is that it runs around without saying anything. It bumps over drunk instead of leading us along the way of the story. It also offers numerous potentially disappointing details (the hypochondrial brother, the mother's possessions are constantly returning, the anti-Semitic classmate, the other classmate's murderous father) without having successfully explore one of them. And just when I finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the movie comes to an unexpected end. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie was trying to tell me something but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. This is an obvious first film by a writer / director who really needs more time to work with more established filmmakers before giving more work to an unsuspecting audience. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 out of 10, and I'm usually very generous, even with bad movies.
