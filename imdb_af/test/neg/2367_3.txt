no way out 2007 was really bad, and if it's the way to wrestlemania, they choose the wrong way. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit and the hardcore boys of MVP & Minn: I think it was the best game of The night there are some good wrestles here, but not much. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Crossweight championships open (won by Chavo Guerrero): terrible, not so high, really fast and boring. 3/10 <br /> Little Bastard & Finlay Def Boeyman & The Boeyman: It was more comedy than wrestling, some laughing. 5/10 <br /> Kane def king booker: A decent try by these two, but they can do better. 6/10 <br /> WWE tag team championship Paul London & Brian Kendrick def deuce & domino: Another boring game, no high fly by champion. 4/10 <br /> Worldwide title Mr Kennedy def bobby lashley (disqualification): in my mind the worst game of the night. really terrible. I thought I was no rules, I was wrong. 2/10 <br /> <br /> John Cena & Shawn Michaels defeated Batista & the Entrepreneur: a good match but could have been a hell better. 6/10 <br /> overall it was bulls * it gives it a 3/10
