To be a fan of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr, I had to see it. What is the only thing is the tracks of Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage cuts that do not gel with the new black and white footage. With all the technology we have, why wasn't it better? money and a little change, be warned it's really bad. but if you like Lugosi Karloff and Chaney Jr. then watch their movies instead.even ed wood has better than this one.new actor-market Redfield is pretty good like an imitation Bela Lugosi. The cuts they use are; the monkey, Mr. Wong, most dangerous game, lost world, indestructible man. and devil bat.that infamous Bela Lugosi classic.i believe this production was a very low budget, and it shows 1 out of 10.
