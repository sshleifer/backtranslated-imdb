UP TO THE VILLA (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> WARNING: YOU CAN FIND ANY SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It's hard to know what the point in UP at DIE VILLA is, a beautiful but shallow period, one of those with the sole purpose of earning Oscar nominations for the best costume design and art direction (one for cinematography and another for the score is also welcome). It has the same basic idea of ​​thousands of period pieces produced every year: a beautiful, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place for her. She has many problems, but eventually finds her happiness in the arms of a man who is not the one she has achieved. In this case, our wife is in Florence, a while before World War II. She is an English widow who is engaged to a rich-but-old man (who, of course, she doesn't love). One day she met another man, who didn't have a good reputation, but for whom she fell in love. Of course, there is her friend who will help her to be better or worse and a third man who commits suicide in the woman's room, posing a risky situation to her. Guess how the story ends ...? <br /> <br /> UP TO THE VILLA is not a bad movie. I was always very interested in the story, but never got excited. The problem is not the slow pacing, but the script. Adapted from a novel, it needs something spicy, exciting, twisting and tension. Every time you think the story gets hot, it gets cooler again. If you think there's a conspiracy with the average Florence chief of police, well, there is, but it doesn't change nearly anything in the story. It just keeps going, to the predictable end. <br /> <br /> As I said, UP at the villa is not bad. If it is slightly sweet, it never becomes juicy and too sentimental. The acting is half and half, but surely convinced. Kristin Scott Thomas has made some very bad choices after the ENGLISH PATIENTS (the seed-romantic romantic drama THE HORSEWATER and the dull / annoying RANDOM HEARTS). UP AT THE VILLA is undoubtedly better than those pieces and Kristin is also better, but she can do more than that. Sean Penn is good as always, though his character is a great man. Anne Bancroft is a great actress (THE GRADE, my God!), And here she doesn't leave her character ridiculous. Now, the supporting actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davies is sooooooooooo annoying!). <br /> <br /> Directing is good, but not brave. It was interesting to know that the director is the same of ENGLISH AND INSECTS (also with Kristin Scott Thomas), another so-so drama, but more chased than that. What is important here is the footage. Florence is wonderful, the costumes are fantastic, the scenery, the music ... In the end, UP AT THE VILLA is an average romantic drama, but of course it could have been much better. It's watchful and interesting, but don't expect an exciting movie - it's not! This movie type fails because it wants a little secret, something to watch. However, there is not much to say mainly because of the flat script. Now, about the Oscar nominations, don't worry - they'll probably get them.
