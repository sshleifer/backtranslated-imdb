A creeping alien beastie accident land on earth and soon wreckage that takes place on the population is first thrown with his laser beam to dissolve in dust, almost every person he catches (that is, when his purpose is not terrible) and later his naked claws he likes to ripen and eat human spleen! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's pretty stupid. I have to give it a few points, because sometimes I'm fun. I actually enjoyed the mindless jet warfare in the beginning, and some of the later on top gore effects. However, it does not help if the monster offers the only entertaining moments of the movie and he is not on the screen for much of the movie's running time. The play throughout this is just terrific and amateurish and our main hero Sheriff Cinder is too unattractive to be the movie's hottest chick. I also have to take points for the blatant copies of the DING OF ANOTHER WORLD (1951). When the monster is not on a disaster, NIGHTBEAST is too boring and eventually its attacks become so repetitive and predictable, even making them less fun. Watch this one back to the 1951 DING and look at the distinction characterization, attention to plot and detail and create a suspense on a monster on the loose movie.
