Although the play was excellent, I waited the whole movie for the nasty boy who had so many of the characters so much sadness to get his final nemesis. Instead, they all suffered differently from him and he got the job of the man whose wife, the death he caused by walking away from his friends, won the girl he had given over-rape and tried to rape. Even his friend gave money to his father, but the butterfly effect completely failed to return. <br /> <br /> It's a very dark movie, as every character that is affected suffers from depression. None of the normal ways of relief seems to be effective and the only thing that the authorities seem to do is to spend many spells out. <br /> <br /> If it's normal behavior in Finland, I'll never go back just if I'm touched by such an amoral butterfly and eventually destroyed as the characters in this movie were.
