Well Wright may have made a sharp portrayal of life around 1800 - as he repeatedly and anal as it was written in contrast to published - but it is HIS Austen's and should not claim an adjustment. <br /> Mrs Bennett looks like a rural savings woman. It's a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing her hair, etc.)? But Wright depicts her with rough, reddish skin, all along her chest, rough hands and in the kitchen. And the swine wandering! If he wants bucolic, he must try Tess. <br /> <br /> Mr Bennett - making the writing hug and modern and ignoring the weakness in him. The scene where he stops playing Maria is supposed to make you circle - don't succeed in seconds. If not, do not include it. <br /> <br /> MacFadyen is very poor in share and seems to be a kind of pride by observing numbers. The first proposal looks like a nerve school boy rather than a man who overcomes his pride to make a proposal under his station. Most of his lines, he can also read a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Lydia is terrible. Completely over the top with excessive shouting and jumping. Indeed, Knightley Elizabeth plays more like the giggling character. Lydia is actually in the book. <br /> <br /> And Elizabeth. Half of the time, Knightley, is clear, mimicking Ehle's voice and intonation - open your eyes to see how a copy is. And in her role you see Wright's big mistake. There is NO preview. <br /> <br /> From the very first meeting with Darcy, she clearly felt him. When commenting to Bingley about the attractiveness of the women in the hall, she initially looked sore - not shocked and frightened. The latter must set the front edge of things. And when she and "caroline" come around the room, she comes across as a plague, apparently over him. And by virtually cutting out Wickham, you don't get Elizabeth enough to settle the prejudices that fall out of that relationship. <br /> <br /> And that's not Caroline's opinion. Bingley not. And Mr. Bingley happily walks in Jane's bedroom. And and - Wright boasts how big he is with the time he wants. But a few panoramic shots of rural life (showing preference for Hardy), don't excuse him the glittering in the whole place. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker - who wants clear awards - must have been between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and wasn't Tess's last promos / lighting? The need to see Darcy walking next to the scape with undressed shirt was just stupid. But most importantly - when they go between the two very different landscapes, they forget the most important one - Austen. (She laughed aloud at the Elizabeth = sadness, therefore = rain, walk through to picturesque folly, wet Darcy garbage). <br /> <br /> I admit I have seen it impossible to see the movie without context. I was willing to give it a void, as it had to provide the story in a short time. But fully forgetting half of the core of the book in prejudice and Darcy looking more and more persistent than praiseworthy, it almost made it unshakable. I could only see it as a mess with a poor performance (when Knightley didn't cry, she both blessed or jumped or both and just got reassured a few times to indicate she did have a promise - But to swing emotion is not a substitute for poor writing and poor direction - although it was only a bad writing for some. <br /> <br /> Tom Holland alone would escape. Having printed the comic aspects of Collins, he embarked on a very interesting approach. Dench does the wonderful thing she can do in her sleep, whether here or in Oscar Wilde - but that would NOT be Lady Catherine De Bourgh Lady Bracknell. She was just a little too healthy. <br /> <br /> The shortened length could certainly be handled by a skilled writer. Not filling in story gaps and helping the audience anywhere around the place. Elizabeth could not come with the Â£ 10k figure. And while they wanted to cut time with her learning about Darcy's involvement in the Wickham marriage, the lines didn't suit Lydia. This was the worst case of indifferent exposition in the piece. <br /> <br /> These are really scary things. Anyone who judges it, says it works well in the context of the book, is someone I honestly don't read or understand the characteristics of the thing. Wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s, not the 1709s of their behavior. I'm not convinced he read the book - he certainly doesn't understand it. He doesn't understand Austen's sharp white or light touch - he certainly made a dull plowing movie out of it. <br /> <br /> What's even worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lover around the 'I love you, I love you all over the place so they can sigh and go out. The fact that it has no place in Austen's work is apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Anyone reviewing it as a movie alone? Well, harder for me, except that I will notice the poor actors, the weak Darcy, and the grim in the spirit of the whole thing. If you adjust, you can change a lot - but if it loses the spirit and key motivation, don't insult the book by using it title.
