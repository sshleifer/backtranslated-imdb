Generally, I prefer horror movies that scream me so much. I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not those where people are foolish and murdered by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra is a lizard with a dog-dog, green-green-gray monster that has a kangaroo hoop, hair and claws, has a row of sharp spines from its back, and sucks the blood of livestock. Like in many horror movies, good and bad, this movie takes freedom with the legend. It not only attacks people, but it eats their bowels and has a bulletproof, almost indestructible constitution. So tell me, how can a burglar needle penetrate its skin when bullets can't? And why, when the marines find out that armored bullets can hurt it, do they break up so that the chupacabra can get them one by one? John Rhys-Davies is giving a performance that rises above the bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal also earn credit for their performances. Otherwise, the rest of the acting was poor, just like the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons and Neal.
