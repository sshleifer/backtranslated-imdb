Yes, I know the girls are hot and the scenery is nice, but for someone who knows the place, it's scary. <br /> <br /> If you want some accuracy, it's not a movie you rely on. It starts with a flight from SÃ£o Paulo to Rio on board a 747. It will never happen on the 400 km flight. Smaller planes like 737 or A-320 passengers between the two cities every half hour. The airport home drive when shown on a map will reveal a complicated zigzag back and forth. Perhaps the producers have been trying to imitate one of the best-known taxi drivers when faced with tourists. Not that it would be a local habit as if I was torn down in very serious places like Switzerland. The girls, yes. All topless. It's something an outsider will never understand. Brazilian chicks will happily uncover 100% of their incredible bodies at the Samba School parades and wear almost non-existent bikinis on the beach, but never go topless. A handful of beaches across the country will allow it. All carefully separated and out of town. Oh, the interior decoration; the amazing wallpaper ... maybe in Disneyworld ... moreover, it's very entertaining and, yes, Demi Moore is absolutely beautiful.
