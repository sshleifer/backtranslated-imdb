This is the worst kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes that never seem like they themselves believe. Are white people such monsters that they call two white child rapists in their 20-year-old "good boys" and must be convinced that this may be a reason for provocation? Are black people universally inspiring? Is the Ku Klux Klan really out of court to shoot at lawyers while nobody intervenes? Do judges really think that a fair trial can be done when the jury can hear a crowd outside "Shoot him" screaming? Do blacks really have to wait shoulder to shoulder with the Clan to hear the verdict? Do women really take a few months to realize that their husband can defend a man of unfair suspension because he knew the same thing had been done? Should jurors free people from murder because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers really use a common sense defense to convince people that their client was temporarily insane? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, any high-orientated principles of this movie were lost to the utter exploitation and free use of sexual crime to stimulate the audience. Was the subject of rape, let alone child gang rape, really in capable hands here? Is it really a topic that belongs to Hollywood's hands? And so, why the Sandra Bullock's totally free exploitation and stripping? And the totally useless statutory rape order against one of the witnesses? It seems the director doesn't immediately feel about sex crime. <br /> <br /> It was the excellent plot to kill a Mockingbird and make a candle, shallow, tasteless money spinner out of it. Shame on them.
