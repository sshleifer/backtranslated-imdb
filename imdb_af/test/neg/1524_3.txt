I loved all the other Don Knotts movies, but I never heard much of "How to Frame a Fig" and now I know why: I can't think of anyone who will find it pleasant. This movie looks to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds, but even most of them will give it a thumb. At best, there are short moments of soft entertainment, mostly from Don Knotts, who has the same nervous person who made him famous. <br /> <br /> After the movie was finished, I was curious if my teenager could pick it up. movie's fatal error. We were absolutely in agreement: the Prentiss Gates sidekick character was even thicker than the Don Knotts character. <br /> <br /> Please note that Limpet, Restrained Astronaut, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken movies are around to enjoy.
