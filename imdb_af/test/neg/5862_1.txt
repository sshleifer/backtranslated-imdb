It's probably the only worst movie I've ever seen. It has no good properties at all. <br /> <br /> It looks like it's been done in about 20 minutes and filled with title graphs the other time. <Br /> <br /> The captain who has been changed from the death door to the superman has you <br /> <br /> unlike quite predictable and not interesting at all. <br /> <br /> I left the theater feeling cheated. <br /> <br /> Needless to say I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
