Sebastian Cabot is a rich jerk who wants to buy the whole country, because there is oil - although none of the inhabitants are aware of it. With the help of an evil black warrior in black, they all kill and terrorize. When the son of a murdered man arrives, he refuses to go back and stand for these powers of darkness. <br /> <br /> Wow. Looking at TERROR IN A Texas CITY, I felt like I had seen this movie many times before and would probably see something like that again. This is because, apart from some novelties (such as Sterling Hayden with a harpoon on the bad guy), it has a plot that is too familiar. Again, we have a rich man who is trying to drive all the farmers to gain control of the whole country. And to do this, he brought rented guns to force people to sell or kill them. There it is done in just too many movies. <br /> <br /> I love Sterling Hayden in movies, but I couldn't recommend it as nothing but a bad time substitute.
