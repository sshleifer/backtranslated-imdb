Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important topic and trying to make a good movie. Ricci is my favorite actress: She is so gifted, so naturally, her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she continually radiates. This gives rise to the often abused term "star". <br /> <br /> The film misses its mark for many different reasons, but perhaps especially for the story's seemingly impatient on-screen to make it a compelling story ... more about this later. The role players at first glance are excellent, but come to think. Jessica Lang, like the Jewish mother, is too Protestant and not right, Ann Hetch does not come close to the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book. When you make a movie, how can you just say no to Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problem is in the film's construction: first failing to get any kind of lasting sympathy for the Elizabeth Wurtzle character, and secondly to say something meaningful about the all too common and horrible situation this poor girl finds herself . br /> Unfortunately, Lizzy, just like most of the retired teenagers, does not hurt as badly as she gets in the book. This is a big problem. This story had to be told from start to finish and from the therapist's couch. She is only eight or nine when her depression begins due to the devastating social factors, both society and home. It is an important point not only to elicit the proper sympathy for her, but also the gravity of her cause. She is so talented, and such a vulnerable and unpleasant spirit so early, the heart of man cannot help but reach out because of her victimization. It is missed on the movie. <br /> <br /> Eventually, one who tries to say the movie must be: it is a biopsy of one seriously affected girl, but it is also a movie about a nation who cannot get his act together ; This is very clear in the book, but not interesting in the movie where the chosen one at Harvard is even more messy than the average college enrolle. The movie can eventually not get one of these messages judiciously, and it's too bad. Is Prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or an apparent necessity in a country where so many people cannot function without a chemical stool? These are tricky and challenging concepts to work with, and the writing doesn't really try to address any of them in a lesser or interesting way. The Challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional America, but it does not have the effect it will have due to the crossbeam and insufficient earlier development of thematic control. <br /> <br /> Ricci's performance is stiff and sincere and one of her best plays. <br /> <br /> Michele Williams is also wonderful in her role.
