This movie reminds me of Harry Potter - not the style, but the marketing strategy. There can be part 2, part three ... until one day the product's life cycle ends, of course, provided the part has one commercial success. so many things seem hidden and so the story looks rather incomplete. the action design is boring. Set design is ok but not good. Perhaps Edison Chen will one day be a big star. He really looks beautiful even on big screen. The most impressive is still Anthony Wong. 4/10 <br /> <br />
