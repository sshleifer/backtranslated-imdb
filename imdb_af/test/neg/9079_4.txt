"The evil men do" begins with a truly repulsive torture, followed by a graphic verbal description of equally repulsive torture methods that the sadistic, heartless villain uses. But despite the use of such severe-for-shock effects, the filmmakers can't really cover the fact that it's just a dull, low grade Bronson vehicle. Bronson himself is solid here, but he had to choose a better writing.
