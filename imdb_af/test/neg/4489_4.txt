After reading this story, I was very excited to see the movie. I read the book again. This is one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books. What I think makes the story is the relationships. This was the point for me in the movie because I think the relationships are poorly expressed in the movie. I have no idea what the point of changing main characters is (Tim's and Alan's characters). The movie didn't touch John and Savannah's relationship at all. Maybe if you didn't read the book, you can keep this movie, but I thought it was so boring compared to the book. I thought Channing was a good choice for John, but I felt he was going to bring out all young adults to see it, so I think it's more aimed at them. The end cut out the whole point of the book, so I was also dissatisfied with it. I was hoping the movie was more like a notebook or a step to remember and how they caught the books. I feel that I wasted a Friday night and 10 dollars on a juicy love story, not the story I expected to see.
