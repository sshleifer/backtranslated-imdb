Totally unruly "jokes" falling flat, acting amateurish (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogue at best mediocre. After watching this movie, wonder how a producer on earth can overcome such a project and think, "I MUST make this movie." No wonder this can't get a theater release.
