The camera and I hired the movie the other day. At first glance, it was another teen movie, which we had hoped for, were fans of simple horror and comedy. <br /> <br /> It seems the movie is designed to make the viewer disappoint. It quickly accelerates to something that holds great potential. Unfortunately, it never leaves the ground. We watched it look like something like an hour when I finally got half-sleep: "Dude, this movie sucks." It was just 35 minutes actually. Dude agreed. <br /> <br /> The problem is: the movie is simply not funny. It was undoubtedly supposed to be funny, but it failed. It failed in a way that made me sad. This kind of reminds me of myself. I have the potential to be anything I wanted, and instead I watched cheap horror / funny movies all the time. I'm sorry for the makers of this movie from the bottom of my heart. It's so sad. All that potential .. and nothing.
