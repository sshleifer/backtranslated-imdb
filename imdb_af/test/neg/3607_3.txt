... but of course I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Now I never expected to keep the first movie. I'm not sure what Disney's marketing group is, but it turns out that every trailer they make for an animated movie eventually turns me off as childish, or stupid or stupid, yet the movies themselves are usually. And there was no movie in my trailers in the trailers like The Emperor's New Groove. That's why I was rather surprised that I really enjoyed the movie when I finally broke down and saw. I entered with zero expectations and was pleasantly entertained. <br /> <br /> Despite Disney's record with direct-to-video successors, I still hoped for a better experience with Kronk here ... but eventually I was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately not exactly surprised that I felt like that). There is almost no humor aimed at adults. The original songs are uninspired and sickly cute. The animation, while not bad, doesn't come close to Emperor (it was no Lion King to start with). <br /> <br /> So the main tomb is surprisingly small and consists mainly of a sequence of mini-plot flashbacks - actually the thing felt more like a series of pilot episodes for a Saturday morning cartoon as a well-thought-out single entity. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets about four lines throughout the movie and there isn't really John Goodman, so in general we're just too much of Patrick Warburton's Kronk - which is in the first movie as a secondary character entertained, but totally inappropriate as the lead leads here. <br /> <br /> Although children may find it somewhat fun, the only thing that Kronk's New Groove has managed to do to me is to return to see the far superior original.
