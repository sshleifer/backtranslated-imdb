Well now this strange movie. It was listed as a comedy, but I definitely found nothing to laugh about. Actually, I'm struggling to find something positive about this movie. Oh here I go. Alex Ferns is not bad in the lead and I have not chosen the end for a change, but apart from that, it has no good direction solid two-dimensional characters and it is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to make any kind of decent drama. I would really avoid ever having to watch this movie again and think it means nothing to benefit any of the worker characters he is trying to portray. I found it difficult to empathize with any of the characters and was not given enough information about the main character Jimmy to believe his motives. Best to avoid.
