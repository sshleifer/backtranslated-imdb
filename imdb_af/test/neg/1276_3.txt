If you're a kid who loves the fairy tale's "real life" adventures, see it. If you are a youth of children, don't you want to see it? :) If you're a parent to watch a movie with your kids, you're better off picking the squirrel! <br /> <br /> The start of this movie was a bit funny and has some good stuff for the events taking place. But after the kind of funny introduction of characters, settings and potential conflicts, the story turned a little dull. When more or less the same thing happens for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" occurs repeatedly, just like parts of a muted MP or the ads you really hate. And the highlight of the plot ... * oh sigh * ... poor, poor, poor!
