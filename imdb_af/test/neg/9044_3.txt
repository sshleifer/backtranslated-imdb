Why did the Italians make some of the best movies in the 50s and 60s, and then in the 70s and 80s did nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? Probably because art films didn't make money. The Kannibal movie, unlike the Zombie Movie, created by Americans and exploited by Italians, is a pure Italian creation designed as a Mondo exhibition center, and making as much money as possible (no artistic integrity be in that way here). Geet Alive came during the Cannibal Film era. The director, Umberto Lenzi, has not even beaten his fight; His genre classic, Cannibal Ferox, was still a year away. <br /> <br /> In the plot similar to (read: ripped off) Ruggero Deodato's seminal cannibal classic, Cannibal Holocaust, a woman (Janet Agren) receives word from police have an 8 mm film from her sister. She is missing in Africa, and it is suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film can do something about it. Mel Ferrer, as Somethingoranother's professor, tells her that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) started a Jonestown cult in New Guinea, and that's where the sister is. The woman hires a guide (Robert Kerman) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. And if you don't know, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /> <br /> One sentence should sum it up: if you've seen Kanibal movie, you've seen them all, mostly because these movies stumble on each other (Lenzi copied the Cannibal Holocaust to make this movie, and reconsider making Cannibal Ferox; Deodato copied parts of it for Hit and Run). And because they all have the same material, they all have the same characteristics: terrible photography, boring scenery, terrible dubbing, persecution and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. Genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran. Rassimov and Kerman have a scenic game. Agren consists solely of being naked, raped or in danger. A lot of money for all the sick out there. The cannibals, which actually occur, are native cannibals, eat lunch disguised as human flesh. And in the great tradition of Cannibal Movies, any live animal displayed on the screen will soon be killed shortly afterwards. Overall, not really a good experience, but I'm sure there are psychopaths out there who entertain this exchange. I know I did it.
