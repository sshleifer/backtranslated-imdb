Perhaps the target audience of this Disney Channel television movie is gratifying, but if parents watch with the young people, they will clearly see that "culminating" on this production is written. It was, of course, no one's dream to make this movie, but it was concentrated somewhere in a boardroom and then produced with cold efficiency. There is a talent among the role players, but actors such as Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas don't get much chance of showing their talent. The impossible cute Elisabeth Harnois is joining as the first daughter, but Will Friedle is another silly character, but he is not as moronical and annoying as in his "Boy Meets World" role. The background for this movie is Washington, D.C. and the White House, but there is no real "presidential" feel for the movie and the Secret Service is a bit better than the Keystone Cup when it comes to doing their duty. The Disney Channel offers many original TV movies and most of them are better than that.
