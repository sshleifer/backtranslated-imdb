Not the best of the Lone Star series, but it's moving fast with good performances. <br /> <br /> In the capital letter 'Singin' Sandy ', John Wayne is not a' singing cowboy '- you never even see a front of him singing. "The actual singer is the director's son, Bill Bradley, who is overtaken by many popular singers of the day such as Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff. <br /> <br /> The film features: Cecilia Parker (also seen in The Lost Jungle series, "Tombstone Canyon" and as older sister Marian in the Andy Hardy movies), do her best Katherine Hepburn - they shouldn't, I really am, "Al-St John, before literally becoming" Fuzzy "who filled all his available screen times with his distinctive business of hat-flipping, head-and-scratch, grimacing and gawky physical gestures and movements; George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as a gentle pipe smokes father, and Forrest Taylor, a 395-year-old minor veterinarian and TV show, who plays the oily villain with a rope tie and stick cigar. <br /> <br /> Fun or weird moments: Yakima Canutt's wonderful 'under the stage carriage' trick; The 'gay' scene when Singin 'Sandy Bert and Elmer join face to face, dragging them to his horse, and immersing them at Kincaid's office, where Kincaid says, "You're a good pair of love birds!"; Denton's remarkable commentary on a horrible song and guitar play by "Sandy" - "Ummm. I could listen to it all night! "; Kincaid's answer, we will not go in there," after we told a farmer, "You have the soul of a snake!"

"FDR Saved We Are From The Depression! (Is that why the villains are always bankers or in real estate?) <br /> <br /> The shootout series was taken from the previous Bradbury movie "Man from Hell's Edges" (1932).
