Boring movie. Poor plot. Poor actors. The movie happens in a room that is supposed to be in Morocco, but actually in some American cities! The "Arab terrorists" are the patriots that the blonde patriot is the "Arab terrorist" ... DAMN! <br /> <br /> There is something good about this movie (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director becomes the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism that feeds the media every day in the right thing, the terrorists are Americans (or Western people you like). <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. The first part of the film is about the Dutch journey (15 seconds), while the second part is about staying in the wonderful dark brown room (1 hour and something). <br /> <br /> The Dutch man is going to deliver money in Morocco to a "charity", coming out of the plain, taking the bus and ending kidnapping in a dark brown room. He was kidnapped with another man shot after saying: "They won't shoot at us". The Dutch survivor is forced to play with a Morpheus-like Arab sheep sheep for so long that you learn how to play chess too! In the end, the Dutch man does not reveal his plot because he has cut off four of his fingers, but because he has been kneaded by such a lame game, you must see the movie! <br /> <br /> Well if you're so tired can't sleep.
