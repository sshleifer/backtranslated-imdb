Will Spanner (David Byrnes, the fifth actor to play the role in the series) stumbles on another bizarre case, this time with vampires rather than the usual witches, warlocks & demons (he's in hospital to visit his friend watch boy who hurt in a hit and run when they hit a girl wheel that is attacked by a vamp). He brings Detectve Lutz in to help with the case surrounding a clandestine vampire organization to get a merger to go through legally enabling them to possess all the blood banks in the world or such nonsense. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie takes a backdrop to the nudity and simulated sex scenes. (As expected from this series, I think). So complaining about the lack of good acting, or compelling plot, or even convincing characters, I suspect would fall on deaf ears. If you watch this movie, you don't care about such "frivolities" and just want an action. Unfortunately, the movie is missing. All the women are attractive enough, but the way the screens are filmed is just horrific. This makes it more or less an exercise in futility in every possible way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Both Kimberly Blair and April Breneman show everything; Ashlie Rhey shows frontal; Aline Kassman & Mai-Lis Holmes only show their breasts <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
