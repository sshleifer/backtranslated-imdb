Wow! I'm really sorry to look at this picture ... Funny, I agreed to see it only for my wife, who endured the torture to see it about half an hour before retirement, while staying in front of the TV but just for the masochistic in me and me because I wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some redeeming aspects that relieved the feeling I got to be foolish to look at it has Two Girls and an old ... <br /> <br /> Everything in this picture is wrong, completely wrong ... since the initial, absurd prospect of two women, stupid enough to join their fellow boyfriend stay up to the terrible but gracious, ending, do not forget the terrible actions of the three actors ... Do not believe the rumors, the junkie's play is bad and I do not see how Graham made a famous name in the film industry . <br /> <br /> I wonder why, after the producers earned money with only three actors and only place, they did not hire a person to write the script instead of sitting a monkey to do it with his *** ... At least I felt a little fine when I destroyed the DVD and threw it to the trash. Anyway, I somehow (and just a little bit) had the brunette actress Natasha something, but it wasn't enough to beat the incredible silly and whacky performance of Face-off (changing faces), so two girls and a man going to the bottom. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this ****!
