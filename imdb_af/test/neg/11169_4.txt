These days Asian horror movies of the best in the world, known for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society. It's not one of those movies! Instead, "The Record" is a mediocre slasher movie highly derived from American films such as "I Know What You Last Summer" and "Scream". The plot is known - 5 teenagers accidentally commit a terrible crime, but cover it secretly. A year later, they are tied by a meshed maniac (with the definite unsuitable disguise of a hospital-sterile mask and an orange jersey). It doesn't help the teens to be a generally unlikely group (it's one of those movies where the killer's motives seem pretty reasonable) and there are many stupid plans to keep the story. The direction of the movie is indispensable, more influenced by MTV than by current Asian horror movies (such as "The Ring"). However, the last third of the movie is not bad, but gives some decent stress scenes, although there is probably too much in the end. 10/04
