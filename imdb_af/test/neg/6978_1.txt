This film is an abomination to everything worthy of filmmaking. The main actor surprised his audience by not acting at all. We need to look almost two hours of his bare, silent face. The jokes are all lame I never laughed as soon as it was Saturday night, and there were 5 of us a beer that has been laughing for a bit and then we put it on and you can feel all the warmth and color of the room drained. The film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went in our own ways, ruined the night! OK, so for and cons. For beautiful surroundings in Hawaii, look good on bluray. Disadvantages worst acting ever; you can only think of payday for everyone involved. Predictable poor plot. Zero character development. Armed jokes falling flat. Many shots of the guys penis that are honest, act better than he and have more charisma. May all makers of this movie keep their heads in shame and keep their fleeting men cheap.
