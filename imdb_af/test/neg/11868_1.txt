At first sight I have to say, see The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and with a more dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The Detonator has a horrible plot that focuses on a kind of atomic bomb, in Romania and with a great deal of action movie - there are no exciting moments and an action movie is bored. <br /> <br /> Really, what do you expect from Wesley Snipes to do if there are frightening screens presented to him? Don't blame him, he needs the money. <br /> <br /> It was the first impression when I saw the movie, 3 years ago. But I won't see it again, no way. Screw it. It sucks. There. I said it. <br /> <br /> PS: I don't think I've ever said "suck this movie" on an IMDb review. Thanks, detonator!
