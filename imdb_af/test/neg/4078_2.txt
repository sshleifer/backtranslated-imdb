This movie is definitely up there with the worst movies I've ever seen, probably in my top 5 worst movies. I laughed once and it was then: <br /> <br /> EVAN: "I'm building something." Evan's secretary: "I hope it's a hairdresser." It was literally the only time I laughed. in this 'comedy', awful compared to Bruce almighty who, as a great Jim Carrey fan ... wasn't even that big! <br /> <br /> This movie didn't have the humor to have God's powers and had more about family bonding. Id just class it as a family movie, definitely not a family comedy. <br /> <br /> I don't even see that the special effects were great, the animals saw a bird's-eye on someone's shirt, it looked really stuck, it was like a movie that wasn't properly glued. <br /> <br /> 2/10 movie - avoid!
