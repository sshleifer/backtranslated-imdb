I love Juan Piquer-Sim√≥n! He's my absolute favorite bad movie director and has been incapacitating throughout his career to cash in on just about every successful contemporary trend in horror and fantasy genres. After the big hit Superman, JP made his own and hilarious "Supersonic Man". He chose the violent slasher movie madness with the insane "Pieces" and he really left him with The Return of ET, the unofficial and straight-laced Spielberg's SF blocker sequel. "The Rift" is Of course, inspired by the range of lucrative underwater monster movies such as "The Abyss" and "Deepstar Six", from start to finish you can tire yourself by mocking all the stolen ideas and shameful rip-offs of these (and other) classics. A completely new and delicate type of submarine near the deep Dannekin gorge disappears, a second mission with your boat designer Wick Hayes is sent on board to investigate what really happened to Siren One, in the dark depths of the ocean discovering the rescue mission An underwater cave secretly experimenting with mutant sea creatures, but the monsters are quite aggressive, but there is also the danger of a government enemy among crew members ... "The Rift" is a forgotten movie, but this h et a bit ingenious? although very dodgy ?? sample models. Fans of blood and gore will not complain, either, as the animal attacks are very gruesome and ruthless. The acting is a lot of wood, though many of the cast names can definitely be better. It is advisable that you only enjoy the click and gory effects in "The Rift" because if you start thinking about the script, you will find that it has absolutely no meaning.
