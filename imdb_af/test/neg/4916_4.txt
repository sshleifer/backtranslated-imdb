Not a good one. Nobody. <br /> <br /> This installment revolves around a descent from the original murderer in the Amityville home, which has to look past it to rid itself of the nightmare scare of Amityville itself. <br /> <br /> It's basically nothing. My commitment is that this movie is made for some extra quick cash to buy a boat or something ... because this is just ridiculous ... Fortunately, it doesn't kill the series but it just doesn't affect it the series at all. <br /> <br /> I must say that the mere fact that it is constantly referred to the old infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one more bearable than "The Amityville Curse".
