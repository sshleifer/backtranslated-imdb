There are only 2 reasons why I am viewing this show ... I already invested the time in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all of you suppose Sci-Fi fans out there who love the new BSG, give me a break! Read some classic Sci-Fi novels through the right greetings or watch some of the milestone movies and TV shows of past and you'll see what hacks these BSG writers are. Their only gimmick is "who is the fifth silo". Poor writing and really, really no sense of character development. If Adama resigned or tried to take power or cry or discover the inner father, he had to be once again ... ahhhhh! And Roslin is so annoying a character ever set on board a star ship. Out of the loudspeaker with her. I can care less than it six months before they came to the conclusion. These wannabe writers were one of the tricks in the season. If you don't know, you just don't know how to write.
