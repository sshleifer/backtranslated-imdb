Well, I read the other comments. Didn't think it sounded good, but decided to put it anyway. Perhaps it's not so good to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie, of course I will notice the same weird stuff. Excessive blur to black, some strange camera angles and cross-talk dialog for different conversations with the same people at different times! But notice everything I thought to myself: Well, it'll probably be really boring if it all goes chronologically. The conversations are not so exciting, but kind of compulsory. And the constant fading into black after very short scenes really makes the feeling that the story is fast to the interesting part. Jump over the boring pieces. At the end of the movie it is also a bit exciting. Will they survive? <br /> <br /> So I actually liked this movie? No not really. The director had some interesting ideas on how to get the audience bored while trying to introduce the characters. But he transgressed it. It becomes irritating, and sometimes confusing. It was just the second movie he directed, so maybe he'll learn and make good things in the future. And if you sit there (in the future) read this wonder if the newly known director's second movie is worth a watch. Well, if he is good in the future, you should see this shit and wonder how he should ever make a third. Otherwise, this movie is not really worth watching unless you are very interested in filming, and want to see one way you can cut the mandatory boring introductory scenes into something viewable.
