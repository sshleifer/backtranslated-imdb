The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters watched the Kim Possible movie. The commercial did not explain Sadie and her friend the meaning of the word. This is one of the stupid commercials I've ever seen. Basically they go back and forth with lines like "nothing is something, so technically nothing is anything". When I saw it, I thought it would be another cripple Lizzie Maguire knockoff by Disney. But I had no idea how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Fast forward in 3 weeks, when my sister turned to the T.V. Of course, Sadie stayed on the ground. What I saw was one of the most unintentional funny shows I have ever seen. How are you? Something like this: <br /> <br /> Sadie, a vegetarian tree hugger, has an incredibly unhealthy, obsessive in love with the very monotonous and poorly-behaved Owen. For some reason her friend, Margret, decides that Owen should be "tested" to see if he is as good as he looks. What exactly do these tests involve? Well, one thing they do is a cockroach on her notebook. Why? So she can be discouraged and ask her monotonous knight in shiny armor to get it off. How is it a test? For when he puts it down, he is mean and unaware and does not believe the mistakes, as Sadie puts it, "are also innocent animals." They spread diseases and pests! They desire to be chosen! But of course, Owen just kicks it out of the window, and Sadie is still in love. But that's not all! Margret says he has to be challenged once more, on something that "can not succeed". This one involves the finishing of scarves on their pants (yes, you read it right) and runs to buy him to see if he sees their big pieces. Predictably he does not see, and we see Sadie in her bizarre and strange notebook world. Sadie decides that she wants to be with Owen forever, set up a family with him, and as she puts it, "live like her ducklings with their pants". This is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is the weirdest, most bad performance I watched. For those who like to have fun from stupid things, you'll love it. For someone else, skip this show.
