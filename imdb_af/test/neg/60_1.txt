I'm sick of movies that keep healthy in a one-line synopsis, and eventually become equal to what you find in the lower middle of a compost heap. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "Witchery" Perhaps it has become interesting in a pitch to the studios, even with a big name throw (such as Blair and Hasselhoff - wink, nudge hug) and the vibrant containers of Hildegard Knef (I'm not a woman ...). <br /> <br /> But on film it just falls faster than a paper-mache sculpture in a rainstorm. These unhappy people seem to be trapped in an island coastal island, and one of them (a woman I would guess) is targeted by a satanic cult to carry the child of hell while the other is grotesque, bad ways. <br /> <br /> Well, there is a cross section of "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and a few other lesser films in the satanic worship-run amok line. . Not one of them is very entertaining, and for the most part you go from stage to scene until the end. <br /> <br /> No, not even, Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help a lot. They are just about to pick up a salary and do not seem to plan to give it their "all". <br /> <br /> From the viewpoint, Hasselhoff probably wants him back on the tray with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... Well, who knows? A well-known PETA benefit or a pro-am car ride or whatever it is is today. <br /> <br /> And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh. You'll see people getting their mouths closed, held in roaring fireplaces, stripped in trees during a violent storm, vessels bursting out of their necks, etc. Sheesh, and I thought "Mark of the Devil" was the most sad movie I saw. <br /> <br /> Don't worry. It's not worth your time. I can't believe I told you so much that I did. If you see it, just check if you can count the clicks. And yes, Blair is busy, as if you haven't seen it, coming down Main Street, followed by a marching band. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Witchery" - these witches give you itching.
