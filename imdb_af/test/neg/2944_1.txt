Identifying this movie as a vampire movie is technically correct. Simple because it will suck life right out of you. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is an insult to movie buffers everywhere. The plot is almost non-existent. The make-up is just awful. And the play is just not there. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Jackie Chan gave someone a big favor to him in this movie. <br /> <br /> My wife made the movie at the rental store because it had a photo of Jackie Chan in front (as if he was playing) and thought that a good JC movie would be fun to look. This movie was interesting to watch the same way you can't help staring at the car wreck when driving. You realize very quickly the movie will not get better, but keep on how wonderful it will get.
