In this movie Gary Oldman plays a lawyer, who was previously a prosecutor. He is a bit of anxiety, but is more or less an ordinary man rather than a kind of figurative or literal monster. Funny thing is, he doesn't pull it out completely. I think you can't quite get out of there. Kevin Bacon was sufficiently creepy. The scene in the park was far too long with too many fake stories. And the strange sex scene with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to have come from another movie, though the rest of the time, Miss Young, did just fine. This movie suffers from strangeness and tries to cover the predictability. And failed. Don't bother.
