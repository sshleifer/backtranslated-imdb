This movie was really awful. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing, though, as it is the world's most unnecessary extended sex scene ever. I mean, this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeat the same 'move' over and over), that's almost 10% of the whole movie! I didn't laugh as hard as I laughed at it for a long time. <br /> <br /> There were some serious weird and useless actions in this movie, but the one I found the funniest was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter land and 5 or 6 guys in orange packs run near the end of the complex. 2 minutes later they left. What the hell was that for? Also, the little white forklift that turned magic into a big yellow digger was pretty classic. I am led to believe that this is because their footage of the 'carnosaur' trilogy used to upload this absolute donkey. I'm going to see it now! <br /> <br /> The movie is worth watching for a laugh or two, but if you don't find bad movies funny, stay away!
