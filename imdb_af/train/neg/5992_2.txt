The most embarrassing thing about this movie is when Brady Corbet says, "You've blossomed" near the end of the movie. I almost died. I'm still not really sure why the authors bring in the line there. Was it supposed to create romance? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I've never had the original Thunderbirds, but a Thunderbird movie has the potential to do so much. This movie doesn't. If it did not have the big Thunderbirds branded travel card, it would be estimated straight to TV, or canned in post-production. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play Busted's song "Thunderbirds is go". I can't believe I wasted $ 7 to look through pay-per-view.
