1937's "Stella Dallas" with Barbara Stanwyck did not age properly - how someone thought a semi-updated version of the story would now work is a real challenge. Perhaps they thought, sorry, Betty Midler could make something out of it, but this hoary script hit her. Plot about a female barman who has a baby out of wedlock, and years later, the young girl gives the child's wealthy father so that she can have a better life, can't escape escaped, old-fashioned bumps and sentiment. Midler works best with a film director who can control her excess, but it doesn't happen here; Stephen Collins was stolen as the man who changed her life, but Trini Alvarado was well-cast as Midler's daughter. This is referred to as a "woman's picture", a wall wall, but it is not succeeded because it remains too faithful to the origins of the 1930s. * 1/2 of ****
