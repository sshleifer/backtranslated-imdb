Murders take place in a Texas desert town. Who is responsible? Light curiosity of riddles and racial tensions (the latter not really suitable), but otherwise strict for treasure fans, who would appreciate the gore and nudity, which are two conventional elements for these films. <br /> <br /> Dana Kimmell (from FRIDAY THE 13th PART 3-INFAMY) stars as the bratty quasi-detective teen. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 off **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for violence and gore, nudity and some language.
