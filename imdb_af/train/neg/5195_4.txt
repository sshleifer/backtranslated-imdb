I have heard so many good things about Weeds and read what I'm looking for another big cable series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but it ran slowly with every episode I watched from Season One. (Didn't make it past the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was inexorable, confronted and embarrassing for blacks. The dialogue feels forced, as the authors are trying too hard to be smart and hip. It was a rare moment when I actually poured out an audible laugh. <br /> <br /> The characters never developed enough to care for them, they were selfish and unattractive. I absolutely had the addition of the brother-in-law (who had to drive away on a Predator) and the removal of Hodes's daughter Quinn from the movie by sending her to residence in Mexico, was so inextricable and clich√©, Had to conclude authors test the loyalty of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Episode after the episode I kept the characters less and couldn't get past many of the technical errors in the storyline. <br /> <br /> In addition, I heard that Season Two was not so good, so I lost all motivation to continue to see this play. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to keep, unless of course you are stoned and then all the races are down.
