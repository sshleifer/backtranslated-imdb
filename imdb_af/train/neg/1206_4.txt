This idea has long been lost movie sometimes available on the web. So I bought myself a copy. Well, of course, the play is terrible and the story line is childish, but it has moments. I think people who searched this one also know the background. It was made by a grindhouse theater owner for a very low budget. But for me he certainly did not spoil the money on props, but on the makeup. The makeup was done well for that kind of movie. The zombies are visible and the gore is intact. The only problem with that kind of movie is the quality of the pelican. It's terrible, happy, no spirit on the sound, but sometimes it's too dark. So you have to look clearly to see the gore. In a funny way, they tried to sell this one, not really for the pain. A voice-over tells in the beginning of the movie to look out for a sign and a man who appears with green flashes, who tells you there is a gore on the way. Of course that doesn't work, made me think of cannibal girls, had that annoying bell when the red things started to flow. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Don't go for the storyline, go for the zombies and watch a continuity error. When the girl and the old first love, she takes her bra, then they make love and suddenly her underwear is back on ... try to do it, or if I get a little off line, it eats your ugly bodies
