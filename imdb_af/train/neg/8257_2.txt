"A Gentleman's Game" uses the game golf in a country club institution to illustrate an adolescent's discovery about honesty, prejudice and other life lessons. A few times I thought I knew where this movie was going but just proved wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was going. The definition moment in this movie is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise "The Karate Kid" mocks and debates being a mentor to the adolescent golfer. It's refreshing, in a way, that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and overworking film formulas. But too much of it still comes off as confronted. At the drop of a hat people fall off all pretensions of politeness, or fail to stand up for the things they believe or are exposed to something less respectful than they accept in society. Unfortunately, there is often no solution for these moments. And besides serving as a backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or link between them. It's a pity that the authors and directors can't save a better movie, especially with the talented actors and potential in the set.
