Five minutes after I watched it, I signed up with IMDb to warn all of you there, not to wrestle with this movie ... genre: horror? it had moments of light tension and throughout the movie I thought "Somethings should happen soon". It didn't ... when the movie ended, I was so ashamed of the writer / director that I've never been the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just doesn't know how to make movies and after watching it, is sorry excuse for a horrible movie I have gone, not the biggest fan not to see one of his works. <br /> <br /> I was taken by the plot summary. Don't make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 for the actors .. they weren't bad and it was not wrong they got such things not bad direction ...
