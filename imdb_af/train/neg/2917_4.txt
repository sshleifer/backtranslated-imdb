As is often the case, the impressive and explosive Asian movie trailers carry nothing more than a lack of stories. Similar to Unleashed (which was wonderful), Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are educated as cruel dogs who carry out their master's prayer. The main characters, an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer that is similar to an equally unstable police officer, are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. In fact, in the end, do you lose who you are supposed to empathize, without even feeling the slightest emotion for one of the men? Whether it's the director's failure or maybe the underlying message he's been trying to tell is for you to decide. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film is filled with intrigue and unpredictability, waypoint demolishes it to a humdrum story of survival and revenge. The tension that was initially evident soon disappeared due to a very mismatched music score that told the potentially effective story. And in the end, you felt that everything that contained background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow unnecessary. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the transition in story from point a to point b was pretty atypical compared to American movies? so those who are not familiar with Asian movies and tired of Hollywood's predictability should look out for it. <br /> <br /> The white balance appeared in most of the movie. It was like looking at a shot shot at fluorescent when it was supposed to be on tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but it strained my eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you? An interesting buildup has given me hope for the slow moving story until it is derived from a low budget, low speed background. And just when you think you're going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of Shakespeare tragedy, you realize it's not an end, but rather a transition to a vicious country music montage over peace and quiet. calmness. <Br /> <br /> Throw a little out of the back of the polls, a moment of salvation that is unexpectedly brought back to cruelty and, on the other hand, Asians' fascination with body fluids and a horrible music party that doesn't movie does not fit, and you get the average mere Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I just don't get why every battle scene was laid with rocks of roaring lions. I thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs? Ultimately, in the end, are we reminded of a true killer who still lurks with us? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
