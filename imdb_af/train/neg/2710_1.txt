Somehow they summed up in four hours the 60's, ten years that radically changed our country. And what a painful four hours it was. They tested the main events and events and claimed they were about two families, but you barely saw the African American family. If I were NBC, I would be ashamed and embarrassed to air such a trash. What was amusing was torturing this happy family you've already seen in so many ways, but managed to attend every major 60-year event throughout the country. And the second family was such a non-factor. They may have dedicated five or six scenes to this family. The poor boy ... NBC, doesn't make movies over any other time .... leave it to PBS and the History Channel
