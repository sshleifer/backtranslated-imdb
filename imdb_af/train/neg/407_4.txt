I love special effects and evidence of new technologies that make science fiction look like. The special effects of this movie are very good. I've seen most of this movie, as it's been on HBO for the past few months. I have to admit that I have missed some screens, but I am usually drawn in movies and have seen scenes more than once. But every time I see a "Hollow Man" I feel depressed, almost like a "movie noir". I'm not sure why; Maybe it's not that I want Kevin Bacon to be angry and there is disappointment about it. But I think it's just how HOW relentlessly gets angry. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts are moving slowly), but I do not recommend for young children under the age of 14 (maybe 12, if they are adult).
