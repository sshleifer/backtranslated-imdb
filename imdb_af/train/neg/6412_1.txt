I just came back from the movie and I'm terrified. This movie is an absolute mockery for all mankind. The theater I was in might have had 4 other people. This movie was recommended to me and I couldn't believe this person liked it. I can't believe any healthy person will want it. There was no plot NO PLOT ON ONLY. It was a joke. How to make a movie about nothing. This movie just shows how Hollywood is in such shambles. I can only look at the spiral of the "Horror Movie" industry and giggle. What a transvesty for all movies, this applies to all the new "teen horror flicks" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. It's already such a trash. Don't support this kind of pig wash!
