Watching beautiful women crawling around, playing police and robbers, is one of the most beautiful guilty pleasures the medium film enjoys. The house on Carroll Street was therefore not quite a waste of time, although the story was enriched and the script uninspired and somewhat annoying. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of talk about different Hitchcock pictures, especially Kelly McGillis. She's dressed as Grace Kelly, and she's not far from the point. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. As she is introduced to the audience, she should be someone with political beliefs and purpose in life. After all, the film deals with a clearly defined period, true events and a particular issue. But in the first minutes, the story turns into a sorry ending of the crime story with incredible coincidences, high predictability and a set of two-dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable, as the performances of the actors are good, like photography and set design. <br /> <br /> The final in Central Station, New York, breathes. It starts in the underground section and then moves to the roof. The movie can be commended for the good use of architecture.
