A sad, sad face is indeed the Munster's Revenge. The Munsters are brought back last time (Fred Gywnne received a big salary to come back to the role of Herman Munster) in this made-for-TV movie about a few replicas of Oupa and Herman "terrorizing robots" "city preparing for a mummy's stash at a show. With police on their heels, the two elderly television icons are trying to figure out who is actually behind the crimes to remove their names. We see that they dress a few times in the drag roll as waitresses (a small highlight in the movie). Grandpa gets stuck several times in a bat with a safe. (Once even flying to Transylvania while Herman somehow sees his pilot's miles) a most annoying family member "the Phantom" sings and breaks glass ad nausium constantly! What is most sad is difficult to determine: it is that Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis look so bad in every scene and are so indifferent to the material. Are they the hokey costumes of the robots that look at those school production values. Maybe it's the ridiculous writing. Sid Caesar's crazy, mostly unfriendly antiques. Or maybe I see something that brings me joy and enjoyable memories as a child being treated to a super K-Mart fashion makeover. At any moment, the result is definitely disappointing and stupid, even for Munster standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is adequately in a most turbulent role (though it tears more than usual for a woman of her years and experience). K. C. Martell makes an ever-noble Eddie Munster. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings looks and trades like the aforementioned Phantom and talks in the most absurd way. The movie has a very cheap feel about it, even for a TV movie.
