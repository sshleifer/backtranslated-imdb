The Slackers mentioned in this movie are three colleagues, Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel). They will study from the university without having to write an honest examination. It remains incompatible up to the end, but the nicest character of the movie Nathan (Schwartzman) gives a picture of what to do. Nathan starts extortion to make his dream girl because he can't pursue it under normal circumstances. The only problem is when the trio starts working, Dave falls in love with the beautiful and kind Angela (James King). Unfortunately, it's not a brilliant genre movie. Schwartzman makes the movie easy to watch, as his performance is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think she was just hired to be with her beautiful look. The Slackers are reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction. Jokes are as level as in American Pie. But aren't they all used? I think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are out of originality. Overall, a few smiley moments, but a horrible movie in terms of acting (except for Schwartzman) and subject. * from *****
