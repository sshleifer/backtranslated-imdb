From the moment the movie starts, there is already a contradiction. As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East and is also an international film, one can expect proper accents to be portrayed. This is not done as the majority of American audio color. Also, I find the play to be at its best, the story is a bit difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film is very accurate in costume and scenery. If you want to see a movie to get a feel for what it was like in the past (although the lack of accents), this movie is worth a rent. If you're looking for a movie so epic as the Kingdom of Heaven, look elsewhere.
