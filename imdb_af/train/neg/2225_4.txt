Honestly, I can't understand why this movie is so good here, nor why Bakshi himself thought it was his best movie. I am a big fan of Bakshi's previous work - especially 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards', but honestly 'Wizards' (1977) was the last good movie he made. Then he started off to the mainstream, starting with the deadly 'Lord of the Rings' and then, with a sword and witchcraft heavyweight, Frank Frazetta, snapped for 'Fire and Ice'. <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is puerile, the animation is television quality. I insist that it is considerably worse than the 70's. And 'Wizards' have real imagination, splendor, beautiful background art and an underground, sensitivity to adults, 'Fire and Ice' is designed only for 14-year-old boys, and has the intellectual influence of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you like the Gor books, you might like it. In my opinion, it was just another glimpse into the slide to 'Wizards' from which Bakshi never recovered (although he has done quite a decent TV thing recently) <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10
