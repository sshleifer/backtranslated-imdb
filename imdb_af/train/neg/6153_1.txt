So let me start by saying I saw this movie as part of a bargain. I was actually bored a good 1997 day and so I looked at the movie rental shop. I asked the clerk what was the worst movie he had in stock. Without hesitation, he walked over to Lucky Stiff. He told me that he would give up the $ 1 rental (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if I promised to watch the whole movie. So watch what I've done for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. God-Awful even. I don't have to go into plot details, read the other reviews. The jokes don't make sense. The acting was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting. You can try to see it as something to laugh, but it's so bad it isn't even funny. Avoid!
