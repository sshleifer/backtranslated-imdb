I saw many bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a crazy horror movie for what it is. But it really takes weakness on new extremes. <br /> <br /> It is vague, the plot for what it never works, actually goes completely and takes time. There is no shock, no horror, no tension, just a load of guys rubbing for an hour and a half and then a quick finish. <br /> <br /> A blight on the crappy horror genre, avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
