I mean I think its badass and a nice cool flick and Melissa Bale the Slutty / Bitchy girl they pick up is hot like hell ..., the play suck and the whole bitch just sucks the clown is a big guy wearing a mask and his disgusting but that's ok i won't recommend it as if you wanted to hire a good entertaining flick after a hard days work, but if you nothing else has to do and your obbsessed With these silly movies like me, watch it someday, and I don't know how artisan DVD SICK has In his DVD collection, sick is not good enough to be in possession of a half-way movie company. All right, that's all
