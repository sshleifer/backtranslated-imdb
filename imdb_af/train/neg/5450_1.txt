Such a pretentious and lame effort to hyped. Diabolic writing and dialogue and truly embarrassing. Actually the worse movie I've ever seen (at the theater). Nothing in my opinion makes this movie a total disaster. I saw it when it found out in a theater in Brighton. People walk out and there were more people talking outside the toilets than in the auditorium! In the end, there were angry and mockery of the left-wing crowd, which was rather sad, as family members of one of the main actors were present and really sheep. But the movie was so bad that I couldn't really feel so sympathetic to them. Everybody has to start somewhere and their son has started his stage with this really awful attempt to make 'Tarantinism in the UK'. 5 years went by, but sometimes I still shout in memory of that sad night at the movie! It's a movie with no redeeming features whatsoever! I gave it a 1 because 0 was not available. They need to find a 'shameometer' for everyone involved in this sorry movie of a movie. I know some of them moved on better things. The positive thing is that none of them could have lowered it lower than that.
