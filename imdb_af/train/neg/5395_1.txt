Kenneth Branagh seeks to create William Shakspeare's dark, rarely-crafted comedy in a 1930s musical, with the result that both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors rarely perform in one or other of the two styles and in some cases, heavy swinging in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to be under the impression that he is completely hysterical like Costard, but it is badly wrong and Alicia Silverstone, who handles the Shakespeare language with all the authority of a teenage girl who does the writing out loud in her reading middle class English class. <br /> <br /> The music numbers feature the expertise of a high school production of "Ladies by Sea". The movie looks uncomfortable and amateurish as it sings and dances, with the only exception being Adrian Lester proving him a beautiful song and dancer. The only other saving grace of the film is Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer's eye candy contribution, but they performed better than in this movie and you would be wise to watch some of the other titles in their films. A pass rate is a success.
