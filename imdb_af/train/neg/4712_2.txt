This performance is probably the biggest, ugliest, most generic steam pile I've seen in child programming that has actually been successful. The main character, Johnny, while understanding that he is supposed to represent an ordinary child, is not nice or even acceptable. The jokes are lame, exaggerated (that is, the "Whoa! Didn't see it." Gag. Come on, it wasn't even funny the first time. It's not even cute) and has no form of primitive white or inspiration. And finally ... it's just ugly to look at. While children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they still prefer candy. I can't stand watching the show, because in a way the art style is just ... gross. Hidden, in fact. Just plain crummy. <br /> <br /> I just can't say it's getting so much airtime. While I understand that nostalgia may be a bit irrational, and I shouldn't get up, I come back. I really miss the old cartoons. Bring back Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls ... all but this crap. I think that's just desirable thinking already. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I advise you not to waste your time on this show. I believe that great children can also enjoy good children's pictures. And it doesn't cut it.
