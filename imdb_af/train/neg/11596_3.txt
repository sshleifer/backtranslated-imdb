"The Dream Child" of 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overrated) "Nightmare" series, and at the last point of this point the series has become total garbage. The only good films in the series were Wes Craven's original 1984, and the third, "The Dream Warriors" of 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and that was the fourth part in which the formerly terrible madman Freddy Krueger started Annoy with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry to the series has almost nothing to recommend, except for (albeit large) footage and a creepy scene, a backdrop of how Freddy Krueger came into being. The rest of the movie consists mainly of our razor-scratched maniac-turned-jokester shouting stupid one-liners, and the old formula of a lot of teenage jackets trying to avoid falling asleep, because good old Freddy is waiting for them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, like a super-stupid 'terrifying' childhood, is added for no other reason than to make a kind of justification for the redundant and boring successor . In short: No originality, just a decrease in the old formula, and an overload of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visual arts, and especially to highlight the difference to the horrible next successor, "Freddy's Dead", who is very convinced. If you're not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast, the "Dream Child" should be avoided, and even if you are, it's likely to be disappointing.
