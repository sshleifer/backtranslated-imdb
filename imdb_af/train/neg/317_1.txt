It must be the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. In the first 15 minutes there was nothing to keep my interest in this movie. I was on vacation at that time, and had enough time to dedicate to a just-for-fun movie. The apartment we live in had this movie in stock. They should get it from the $ 1 store or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, it's nothing like any other movie he made. It started with a bad point of departure and then it just got worse. There is nothing even a little funny about it. <br /> <br /> I watched a lot of movies, including some I don't care about. But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you.
