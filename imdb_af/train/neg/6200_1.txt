It's the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. It makes "Requiem for a Dream" look like a Disney movie. Although technically it has been reasonably well done, acting, filmmaking, music, directing, etc., is good. However, the closing gang rape scene is the most terrible and violent thing I've ever seen and I really wish I hadn't seen it. I'm afraid it will haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think someone will find the movie very disturbing, my wife and her friends are victimized in a very similar way and I really don't need a clear reminder of the horror they've experienced. I watched the movie at the SXSW film festival in Austin, TX and none of the governors or crew were present. I would have liked them to have the opportunity to defend the violence in their film, which I felt was excessive, unnecessary and unnecessary. An older scene successfully conveyed the mood, which apparently strives, but without rubbing your face into the extreme and explicit sexual violence. This film should have a large WARNING label on it. For these reasons I would not recommend anyone to see it. You're warned.
