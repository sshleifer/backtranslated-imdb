It's almost the worst movie you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsday is currently pulling the back of this one for me. The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once referred to as "cheepnis". The space tones seem to have been made in a 1950's power station just before demolition. The music really sucks. The acting is wood and ham. The characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and brazenly obvious when copying techniques and ideas from other movies. The quality of the direction beggars faith. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it if you just experience what one of the biggest waste of a small budget ever needs to be. It's a valuable example of a silly movie!
