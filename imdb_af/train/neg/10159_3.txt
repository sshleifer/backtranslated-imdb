More wide-eyed, hysterical 50's hyper-cheer that gives new meaning to antisocial, pathological behavior. Danza and Grayson will beg you for mercy. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that all the people involved in making this movie are now dead (or in nursing homes). I thought they should sue for torture. As this movie began to unleash its unashamedly aggressive operational attack on my poor, defenseless eardrums, I immediately felt strong pain, enveloping my whole being. That damn muscular fibrillation can break Soviet tanks into small pieces, never mind glass. <br /> <br /> "Why didn't you change the channel if you didn't like it?", you might be angry. Just point, fair point ... The answer is that I wanted, but the pain was so sudden and ominous that I fell to the floor and crossed in fear. With my last turbulent energy I tried to reach the remote but couldn't. <br /> <br /> Niven discovers a wandering fisherman with the dubious talent of singing with an annoying opera voice, who then continues to "pigmalionize" him. Lanza is in love with asymmetrical Grayson, but she predictably contends with contempt until they finally hook. It may look like a pretty thin plot, but this noisy movie is so beat of song and music that there's almost no dialogue. This movie is RELENTLESS. Forget hippies and war prisoners torturing with Slayer's "Reign In Blood" (as in a South Park episode). What a tiny conversation there among the foolish adults who infects this strange 50-year-old musical world, it's all infantile - as if they were all 6-year-olds portraying adults. I can only envy people who find movies like this funny. It must be great to be easy: what will open a miracle to me if I can just enjoy a stupid old gag as a hilarious, engaging comedy. <br /> <br /> But let's examine this phenomenon, the 50's musical. My best guess is that some 50 musical instruments offer the more daydreaming idealists among us a look at Utopia or Heaven (depending on whether you are going to a church or a Lenin tomb) or at least very cheesy version of this fantasy inspired places. TTONO is more related to a representation of hell, but it's just me. I don't seem to get musical. People talk, there is a story - but then everyone suddenly starts about 4 minutes of singing, after which they suddenly calm down and then pretend that nothing unusual happened! Thinking about it, musicals are stranger than any science-fiction movie. <br /> <br /> But worse, TTONO (my favorite type of pizza, VAT) is not just a 50-year-old music, but one with opera squealing. Opera is proof that there is such a thing as practicing a voice - to the point where it becomes an overbearing weapon, rather than a way to please the listener. The clear example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson unite their Dark Side vocal forces for a truly unbearable duet. I tried to lower the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then 8. I finally let it down to a 1, which is usually so low that it is only heard by specially trained dogs and certain types of marsupials, and yet I still can hear the two like donkeys ! <br /> <br /> Take the scene in the small boat in the river. Danza starts with one of his deafening, mind-boggling songs, and then ... nothing. No animals to see. Even the crocodiles, which are mostly deaf, have all left. If you look carefully, you can even see the trees change color, from green to yellow, in a few minutes. No, it was not a continuity error, it was ordinary old torture of the flora. And those trees were just carpet paintings! Imagine how the right trees would react. <br /> <br /> The reason why glass breaks when a high C comes out of the overweight gap of an operational screamer is not due to any physics laws related to waves and frequency, but because glass just human - so can take as much pain before suicide is committed by spontaneous self-explosion. I can listen for hours to the hardest, least friendly death metal band, but give me only a minute of a soprano and I get a brain pain.
