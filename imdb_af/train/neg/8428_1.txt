Despite the mysterious positive reviews and high ratings, it's a horrible movie. Terrible enough, I feel compelled to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film is in the final period of the Raj, during the time of India's struggle for independence. What follows in the ridiculous plot fills me with unbelief. What the characters do and how they act does not convince me that the characters in that era exist. <br /> <br /> For example, the young married Hindu homemaker from the local town would have had a relationship with her married Englishman master, knowing that the discovery of the case would probably be social delay and shame if it was not the death penalty? Unlikely, but maybe still. But would the same young Hindu roommate, in the conservative society of India of that era, like a half-naked Britney Spears in heat, participate in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open views where they can be discovered at any moment? It's not just bloody unlikely, it's a delayed plot line. <br /> <br /> Such idiocies combined with the poor acting, drove me to leave the cinema for an hour in the movie, so I didn't watch the second half of the movie. One can only hope the end is more intelligence than I saw in the first half.
