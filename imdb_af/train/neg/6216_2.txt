9, the movie I've been looking forward to for months ... was little more than a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised at 9's lack of story and strange character development. All the wonderful action sequences in the world do not make for a single unsympathetic character. <br /> <br /> The strange, almost thrown in occult rows, were not just out of place, they were busy. The story is about robots and scientists ... why does it suddenly become a necromonomic horror that changes with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines, instead of giving answers to what might be terrifying scary stories? <br /> <br /> How, what, when, why .... questions just ask if you care and it gets less and less likely to get away from the theater like you. <br /> <br /> A movie like this is frustrating because of the lack of depth .... I will see this movie in the chalk if the story was good. But the filmmakers relied on CGI wizards and Tim Burton's name to sign the crowd. Which ... was who brought me in, but got my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could have been fantastic ... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect for their own creators.
