It's a really horrible movie. The plot (as it is) is completely invisible. (I think it has something to do with extortion, but I'm not quite sure.) <br /> <br /> Half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches. The other half is spoken by the various actors in such incomprehensible imitations of "southern" accents that (fortunately) the words cannot be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the one real tragedy of the movie is that such a historical talent such as Mary Tyler Moore was apparently in such serious financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it. <br /> <br />
