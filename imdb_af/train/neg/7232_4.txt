I thoroughly enjoyed the Bilal's graphic novel when it came out and was surprised when I saw the trailer for this movie, and even more so when I found that Bilal had directed himself. The film, however, was a great decay. The imagery is nowhere near the rich and eager texture of the original artwork, and the story is poorly told. Bilal has chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he does not do a very good job in it either. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship-hate relationship between Nikopol and Horus. They were both from their real time and place, forced together by circumstances. Most of them were funny and fun. Not so here. Nikopol has no perceptible personality whatsoever, and Horus is a pompous twist that just wants to get. Although the movie is French, Horus doesn't have to be! <br /> <br /> We've all seen movies we've enjoyed but won't recommend to anyone, for some reason. I would not recommend anyone to Immortel, except perhaps as a warning not to persuade your talent and resources. Bilal is a master narrator, but of course not a master of any visual medium.
