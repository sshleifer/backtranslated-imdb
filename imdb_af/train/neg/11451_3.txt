Good, friends, a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movies, the bad as well as the good, and this movie has put me to the test. I won't cut words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. Indeed, I asked myself why did I even bother to see this rotten trashy movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something I suspected would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what should otherwise be avoided. I won't waste your time explaining exactly what was wrong with this amateur movie, except to say that the quality of the acting was polite, sub-par. A serious movie buffalo may want to take the responsibility to watch this movie. Anders. Stay home, don't waste your time, read a book, take tasks, or eat yourself a good sandwich.
