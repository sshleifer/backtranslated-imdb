I understand that I want to make a movie that is noble and different. I understand the previous reviewer comment that it is a misunderstood movie. My point is once this movie has ended, my first remark was: "This is what happens if a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent ... she uses dad's money to make a movie what she wrote, led and paid for ..... of course to realize near the film that there was no character development and no directions like a start, middle and end ..... the voyeur part was good and edgy but what was the point? I saw a woman go to a house, find some photos, screw the caretaker, come out on a very cold night (not credible) to watch and run sound about her caretaker lover .... movie ends ...... As one teaches me ignorant ars? i really want to know what the point is .... what was the vision of the directors ..... why no the dead lover? Why not leave the caretaker behind? What is the point of the night vision? What is the point of the lipstick on the car? Why a dead caretaker? we of an escaped spiritual patient / peeping tom? What's with the urn? Oh, and the lamp is supposed to indicate whose home it is? Territorial? Why? Why would the caretaker feel it's his home? that aspect has never been pursued ...... as for William Defoe ... I hired this movie because he was in it and known for edgy characters ..... write back and tell me what to learn ... I am just a mother in Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
