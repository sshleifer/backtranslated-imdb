This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's bad, even on TV movie level standards. The plot is flawed diabolically, and the well-known names in this movie are wasted on confused, uncertain characters. I don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a movie together - it's so bad. Billed as a 'Psychological Horror Thriller' - this is probably terrible. There is nothing exciting about it. And it can do your psychological damage! The initial opening styles kept such a promise - a possible start to whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the complete bumps that followed the car accident scene are beyond belief. No matter how hard you try, you can't care less about the characters. There are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is indeed a collage of disconnected phrases from Chinese philosophers, and the movie will make you worse! <br /> <br /> I bought over 300 movies on DVD. , and this is the FIRST one I will get to get my money back. AVOID.
