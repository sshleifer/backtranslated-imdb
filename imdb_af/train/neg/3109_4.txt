This movie wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good. I'm a big fan of Toni Collette I think she's a very beautiful and talented actress. The movie starts with Robin Williams, a writer, and gets a book from a 14-year-old child. The book is wonderful and he can't believe a child wrote it. Toni Collette plays the baby guard that you don't know if this kid really exists or if she does it all. I'm not going to ruin the movie, but I'll say the movie isn't scary. <br /> <br /> The play is pretty good and Toni Collette's performance was fantastic as well as Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion. I'll wait for it to come to the DVD.
