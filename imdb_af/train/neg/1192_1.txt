I totally agree with jamrom4. It was the only most horrible movie I've ever seen. holy crap it was awful .. i was warned not to see it .. and foolish i looked at it anyway. About 10 minutes into the painful experience, I stood up to watch the atrocities. But to go to the end. Just to see if I could .. Well I did and now I wish I didn't. It was disgusting. nothing happened and the end was all preaching .. no movie that is bad has the right to survive. I encourage everyone to save yourself about the scare of greasy buses. If I just kept the same warning .. save yourself from this movie. I felt those who were highly acclaimed were involved in making the movie .. and should all be wiped off the face of the planet.
