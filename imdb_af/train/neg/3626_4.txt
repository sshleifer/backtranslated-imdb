I don't know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they have seen some difficult things to see with the best picture Oscar. All I know is that there was happiness Gene Kelly playing in it, or it would have been twice as bad as I think it is. First, I don't think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role. She is not that talented, she is not a good dancer and she does not look good. It's a pity that one actor or actress can ruin a movie just like playing in it, because if Leslie Caron wasn't in it, it might have made a huge movie. The story was intelligent, the direction wasn't bad, and as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all these things about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I just say this because I think that's the worst part of the movie. She's probably a good actress, but I can't tell because I didn't see her in anything else, but I think she was pretty bad in an American in Paris. So if you want to see it, go ahead, but I'll tell you, you're better off watching "Singin" in the rain. "
