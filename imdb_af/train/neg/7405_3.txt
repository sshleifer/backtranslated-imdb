I think they really get rid of the quality of the DVD production. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I rented it on the 3rd DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Anyone else has this problem? It's really hard to make the movie an indefinite review after you've made so much effort to play it. For one I have never seen a Finnish horror movie, so I was so scared that the movie was done in English. Also, since it has never been made clear to Sarah, she has only delayed, so I really only hoped that someone would shoot her and break all the terrible events.
