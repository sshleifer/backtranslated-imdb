I can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie! The Gingerbread man starts from the right, and manages to build some great expectations for the end. But at one point or another, the movie becomes one of the worst stories I've ever wasted my time. It's just as incredible how the conquered Mallory Doss manages to draw Kenneth Branagh's character through his nose. The movie climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer left in the sun for too long. The Gingerbread man is probably the worst Grisham movie ever, and it is not changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie. Don't waste your time!
