This weekend just passed, I looked "28 weeks later" which was very good. Then I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I told you this is one of the most boring so-called horrors you can ever see. The scenes were unrealistic, there was no writing and no plot. The alien being was unreal. And battle scenes light up compared to a school yard battle. And to make it worse, the man named Cody had an uncontrollable loose dirt that distracts from the main film. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie; Rather keep 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Mesake C.
