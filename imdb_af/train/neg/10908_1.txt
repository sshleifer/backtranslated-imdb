Nothing in this movie is funny. I thought the premise, which one gives the libido of a rimmed ram, was interesting and should allow for a few laughs. WRONG! There is simply nothing funny about the movie. For example, the main character hitting a buck in heat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny, it borders on obsession. They play on one level with bestiality in this movie on one level, and it's just funny. <br /> <br /> We all know dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character does it with everything, everywhere, every time it's not funny either. It becomes a cliche. <br /> <br /> I think, Rob Schneider is acceptable in the role. By this I mean that he is not a bad actor, but with rotten material it is difficult to comment on quality. Coleen Haskell, the other half of the MENS romantic leaders (do you think the number of animals whose main character is also interested in romantic clues?), Is embarrassing the whole thing, and she must be too. She seems to be acting in some vacuum, apart from all the other actors in the movie. <br /> <br /> See this movie only if you want to be bored by tasteless, dull, repetitive material.
