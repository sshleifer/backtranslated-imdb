** May Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> A dude in a dull Kong suit (the same one used in KING KONG VS GODZILLA in 1962) offers a lot of laffs in this very mocked monster movie. Kong is raised on Mondo Island and this time helps the lunkhead hero and other good guys. The vampire-like villain is the name of Dr. Who? - funny, he doesn't look like Peter Cushing! Kong eventually pulls it out with whose pride and joy, a giant robot monkey that looks like a bad metal image of Magilla Gorilla. Like many of Honda's flicks, it might have been a bit of a breeze before the American audiences wandered around and added new footage. The Rankin / Bass animation company has a hand in this mess. They had to hold on to better children's programs like The Little Drummer Boy.
