This film caught on the tube on a Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I watched it on IMDb to see what others thought of it. I was not surprised at the amount of stupid people who enjoyed this fluff. However, I was surprised when I looked at the comments to read the Hated It categories to find that they were nothing. I was shocked about this; I always look at the hate it is because they are always the one who hates a movie, no matter how good it is. Somehow, this movie made it uncomfortable with the haters I say about it and proudly say I hate this movie! I know I need to know in detail why I hate this movie, but to do this, this movie will give more respect than it deserves.
