After a quasi-gothic, fruity music video, the movie begins with Cassidy the lead singer who kills herself. In a perfect world it would be and the end credits would roll. We do not live the world. The rude members decide to go to a clown to contact her dead creature. If I say clown, I mean real fool. He tells them they will all die by Cassidy's spirit (the spirit owns Dora, one of the teammates). We can't care less, because the characters are all boring, foolish and extremely horrible. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an unbelievable apropos of when ever there was one), and director of Corbin Timbrook (who after The Attendant, and the Tower of Blood must know that he is still making a living for his life) between the incompetence of the movie and the viewer's need to stay awake. Not enough blood to satisfy gorehounds, nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs. My movie: F <br /> <br /> Cookie: Amanda Carraway gets topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
