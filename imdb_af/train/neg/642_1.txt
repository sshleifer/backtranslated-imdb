First of all, if you're a fan of the comic, you'll be very disappointed. I'm sure! Low budget movie !!! Largo is supposed to be Serbian in the comic, now he suddenly becomes cruel, pfff! chicken producers, it gave a little spice and intestines to the cartoon. By the way, in the movie, his father speaks Serbian, and he speaks Croatian ... Lol. The striking N.Y. Winch building is becoming a common average small hunt in H.K. The good-hearted Largo becomes a little Tscheran / Turkish search man. Freddy the cool 'scarface' pilot gets fat, out of shape, sad, average man. Simon, Largo's good friend, doesn't exist at all !? He gave pepper! Largo doesn't throw knives at all, but just stares at a snake ... The whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious TV movie. French directors and producers, if you don't have the money, the ability or the technology to properly adjust the cartoon, please stick to a romance shot in Paris. Very very bad movie, good thing I just rented, don't count on me to see the successor (if any!).
