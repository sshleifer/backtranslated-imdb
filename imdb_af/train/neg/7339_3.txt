Maya is a woman without any interests. She just dreams her life away and wonders why she doesn't feel fulfilled. This can be an interesting subject. It will need a good story, a good environment and good dialogues. It doesn't have any of these. This movie is totally boring. There are only lengths and no climax. The only climax is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I'm a big fan of her, I couldn't stand this movie. Even he can't leave this movie. The movie is not as bad as 'King Uncle', and if you are an Art-house fan or as it is slow, you might like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catching. My recommendation: Don't look at it.
