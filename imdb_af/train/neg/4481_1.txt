I was skeptical when I first saw the Calvin Kline esque commercials, but I thought I'd give it a chance. So I watched it, and all I can say is pale. This movie was so bad. It's hardly that I hate such a movie. Watching this movie, I reminded me of the funny scenes in Altman's "The Player", when the authors place their bizarre ideas on producers. I would like to know which MTV producer decided on an hour and a half long music video adjustment from Bronte (but this time Heathcliff's name is Heath and he's a rock star, and Hindley's name is Hendrix), so would ' be a good idea. /> <br /> Even that might not have been so bad, even though they didn't get so bad about every other aspect of the movie. The direction should have been: "You are lonely, pout for me." I laughed aloud during all the "serious" scenes and was bored with the rest. The work of the camera was unfinished and repeatedly reminded me that I had watched a bad movie trying to be edgy. My theory is that the good man got bored and went to the beach for a few beers with his buoy. All I could hear in half the screens was the waves. And in the other scenes I wish this was all I could hear. And what they did to the Sisters of Mercy song "More" is absolutely unrelenting, and then they are relentless to Bronte. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, there was one entertaining scene - specifically the moment Johnny Whitworth's Katherine Heigl's face leaked - and if you could tell me what that scene was about to do with the rest of the story, you have more power.
