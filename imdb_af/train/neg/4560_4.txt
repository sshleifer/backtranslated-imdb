Men in black 2 were a real disappointment to me. While the actors did a pretty good job, especially Smith, it is not just a cure for a poor writing that is once in production. The movie really had a "sequel" kind of feeling, which played partial events of the first film. The story was, in a word ... bad, at best. It was not well thought out and sometimes looked temporary and inaudible. <br /> <br /> In the first movie, the MIB organization had a kind of "elite" power. You had some special agents, and it had a "clandestine" feeling. Subsequently, the MIB organization has a JROTC summer camp vibe. <br /> <br /> The movie was not terrible or anything. It only has the "coolness" (for lack of a better phrase) of the first Movie. Much of the same old humor was recovered from the first to the second, and didn't really add any originality to the MIB universe. <br /> <br /> A perfect analogy is episode 1 for the first 3 movies. Was it decent? Yes. Is it worth wearing the title? Not really.
