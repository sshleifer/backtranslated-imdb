Dolph Lundgren hatches and blows his way through this incoherent mystery / thriller that is almost as cool as the box would believe you. He's really pretty good here, but the story is a mess of B movie clips (detectives, revenge, tycoons, hookers, S & M) that seem to be compounded. The movie takes a little in the second half, but rather for a more decent Lundgren movie, hiring RED SCORPION.
