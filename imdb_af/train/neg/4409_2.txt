Strictly a routine, by-the-numbers western (directed by the genre chapter Andrew V. McLaglen, so is it any wonder?). The colonel of the army, Brian Keith, had a smart bandit Dean Martin. He just kidnapped the colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found her niche after playing Pussy Galore in Goldfinger). Fist fights, shoot-outs, stadium coach robberies and Denver arrows in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Keith is beaten in a low monotone continuously, with a prostitute (something of a shock to his running on TV's Family Affair), but otherwise this lower-cost material spills Keith's lovely talents. It's also bad news for Dino, who doesn't look or care. Hack direction, poor writing and various unfunny efforts at lowball humor. * of ****
