Ok so I was bored and I watched it all the time. <br /> <br /> This film is soft, unsatisfactory and lackluster. The story is so pure that it puts your teeth on the opening titles. A tail of two "traumatized" children is learning about "God" the fairy tale way that has honestly traumatized me. It uses the Irish blarney in such a stereotypical way. One hopes that no real Irish will ever see it. Targeted children who will honestly turn off after the first attempt to have an 'OIRISH' accent. All in all, they pump it out.
