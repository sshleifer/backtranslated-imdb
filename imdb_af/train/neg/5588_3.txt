This is an effort by both author Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers at an Arabic "Tarzan of the Apes". But this devastating movie does not show any of the majesty present in Burroughs' more successful jungle adventure. The focus is on the love between attractive English noble Jon Hall (as' El 'Lion' Chatham) and exotic Arabian beauty Kathleen Burke (as Princess Eulilah), with revenge taking place to coincide with their urge to merge. The opening explains that the boy's mother, although found innocent, lives - but she never goes back in the picture. Unfortunately, the Lion Man has deteriorated, and it seems to be failing. <br /> <br /> *** The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
