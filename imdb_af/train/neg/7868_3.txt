I saw a lot of Guy Maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me headaches. John Gurdebeke's editing is far too frenetic, and apart from a series sequence that makes a cup of heads cut to look at one object, it does nothing but the actors' ability to communicate with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing I didn't like about this movie was that it looked more brutal than Maddin's previous works - although his films always had dark elements, she had sympathy for the characters movie given a dominant sense of humanity. This one had more hardness for hardness. <br /> <br /> Since I need to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that actor "Guy Maddin" is playing to monkey his facial expressions.
