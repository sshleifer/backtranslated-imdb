I thought I read somewhere that it was the last Monogram production, but whether it was true or not, no matter, because if it wasn't, it should have been. It's a deadly dull relationship with John Carradine who has gray hair, to make him look like an older scientist experimenting with the help of his young pupil (Robert Shayne) to bring the dead back to life. Each time their subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face like marble while being captured on the lab table. Carradine succeeds in restoring his faithful dog to life after he died, and the mutt gets an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostly manner. (Wooooooooohhhh). It's about everything she wrote. <br /> <br /> For an ultra-cheap monogram quickie, this thing at least actually uses a more fancy-schmancy lab setup than usual. The funniest joke in the movie is that older doctor Carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant Shayne as "m'boy" when Carradine was actually 40 and was Shayne 45 when they made it!
