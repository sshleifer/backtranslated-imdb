I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved The Running Man. So of course I was very excited that someone made a movie of it. And when a local network showed the movie, I was in heaven. I was all ready for a nice evening! <br /> <br /> The first indication that something was wrong was when I saw someone throwing Arnold Schwarzenegger. I simply couldn't believe that a man who became famous for a shootin-filled movie could play a more cunning role, as described in the book. I was still convinced it would be a good movie. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he didn't. I soon realized that the only reason he was even cast was because someone wrote the whole story again to make it a 'shootin'. Yup, it was a standard Arnold movie: hero was done wrong, hero solves problems by bending his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and the hero gets the girl. <br /> <br /> I was amazed. This is NOT what the book has said at all. I know books can't be literally put on the screen, but they didn't even have links to the book. Stephen King had to openly condemn any affiliation with the film and he had banned the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of film. I don't say that often, but this movie was BAD. If I wasn't home, I threw rotten tomatoes on the screen. Again: bad. <br /> <br /> (Note that I used a lot of "someone." I did this because I'm sure many people are shy about working on it and I don't want to give them any further by calling them here. )
