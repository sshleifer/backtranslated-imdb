Wait, don't tell me. They throw out the movie and hold it out. You know, this movie could be shot in a backyard in New York. I think the "Gangster Bangster". Gangster Rap, Designer gangster clothing including the kerchief that somehow moved the neck to protect the dust storms to the head. I think it was protecting the head from the heat filtering through the K-Mart hats. "Budget-rent-a-horsie", it seems, provided the horsies. The one bedroom scene where the girl speaks and the man spoke her words .... I've talked to him already. You know, look at this movie just confirm it, it's no longer about the acting ... it's about to look and it's about the money. Couldn't have been too much of this movie involved. All in all, I think this movie will be the worst movie ever made. One more thing, where was Ice T? Did he finally go on Oprah?
