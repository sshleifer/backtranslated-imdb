I start with a pattern in the movies I give a 1 to. They are almost all the movies my wife has shown me. Maybe I should stop having faith in her taste in movies. Anyway, it's a typical drive geared towards pre-teen girls, but even worse than usual. Again, the author broke the cardinal rule of any film. He / she made the main character unlikely. She starts with a full b * tch to her friend at the beginning, and finds out when she is 30, that she is actually a person (with business, etc.). Why would the F feel like this person? OK, let's say we can get past it. Jennifer Garner is as appealing as you can without having some kind of deformity. I don't know if it's her or the author's fault, but her character goes beyond my threshold for annoyance. Here's a tip for future movie makers: 13 year olds aren't entertaining, it's annoying. By far the most embarrassing thing in the movie came when they danced to "Thriller". Sacred crap that was painful. It showed her to practice the dance at the beginning. This explains why she knows it, but a whole club full of people?!? Oh no !!! The Macarena would be more credible! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job and no one notices? At least Tom Hanks' character on "Big" had a job that made sense for a child. This body-changing / growing adult overnight movie is really getting out of hand, and that is by far the worst.
