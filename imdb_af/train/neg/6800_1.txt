I just signed in to comment on how terribly silly this movie is. Apart from being a partition of the Executive Decision or Air Force One or some other kind of terrorist story, it is the kind of movie that appreciates watching a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It is difficult to blame the actors when giving such a stupid, clich√©-based script to work with. It's bad enough if you groan in a movie once you experience an insult to your intelligence. But if you feel yourself over and over again, you have to conclude that the director is not the brightest light bulb in the movie business either. are the producers to decide to bring this story into the first place. The most low-cost rental actors you can excuse to tackle this command because they've probably got the money and exposure, and not that it's part of this joke-of-a-movie, they will earn any awards or recognition. This can cause them to be embarrassed because they have such poor judgment in getting involved in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the plot or even giving examples to prove my case, as it would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one in this crisis has involved. Just like studying well-made movies, you can inspire how to make a good, skillfully crafted artwork and beauty, the only thing you can learn to watch this monster is what NOT to do and NOT work ! Be warned.
