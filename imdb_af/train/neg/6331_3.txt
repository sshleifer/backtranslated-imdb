Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I wanted to see what he would do with total creative control over a movie. Unfortunately, it's unshakable, though not because the jokes aren't funny - some (I don't say the most) are of them, and in fact, Mr. Mike did a good job of translating his mentally unbalanced skins into visual gags. The problem is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, call it) is so god-fearing, the movie is unbearable. Some outfits called "PKO Productions" get the production credit, but it doesn't produce at all; Mike seems to have stolen one of the SNL set cameras and made the whole thing in an afternoon. I realize Mike's aim was to torture the audience, but even it deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear, or understand what's shocking. Yet the DVD is not a total waste: it contains a song for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three "SNL's Mike Least Loved Bedtime Stories". Plus, the "cat swim" section of the movie is a wonderful scene to be captured to see if you want to devour someone. 10/03
