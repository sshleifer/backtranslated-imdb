Okay, so I went into this movie, I didn't really expect it. I looked like an action movie like the Fast and the Furious. A few nice cars, some pretty girls, a bit of a decent plot. Unfortunately I will have to say that this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Don't get me wrong, the cars were nice and the girls were OK, but the way they got the movie together was just a good thing to put it on. The story has never worried you just for the cast and the movie just nailed. So overall, this movie isn't the worst thing ever, but if you're looking for a movie to go to this weekend, I'd pass this one for now.
