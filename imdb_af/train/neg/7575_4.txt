A retired diplomat, played beautifully by Michael York, goes to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who killed the diplomat's policeman boy. There, the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian policeman who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> I remember the old action flags of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as the evil bad people undermine the righteous US government. It's interesting to see the Russian man this time as a hero. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, it's actually a "B" action movie. Michael York teaches this mediocre movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays Russian police, is kind of "blah", but has surprising chemistry with Michael York. See it, Michael York is such a good actor that he will have chemistry with anyone he does. Disappointingly, the attractive Adrian Paul is killed in the film in the first 15 minutes. Now, if Adrian Paul in this movie was longer, it would have been an above average "B" action movie. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is really nice to watch the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical bad guy. He is very blond and very villain in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent this flick if there is nothing else on TV to watch. It is good. It doesn't suck badly. The action scenes are decent. The play can be better, the plot can move much faster, but hey, you will see how Russia looks like today!
