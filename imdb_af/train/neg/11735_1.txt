This movie made me very angry because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know people don't have southern accent here. This movie is about a man who is doing to me and I don't know the right plot or what the movie is about. It has a nice graphic drug use in it and it's really offensive. So see these people using meth as if it were sugar. I lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it captivates the drug. The movie makes it cool to use the drug, but I was happy at the end when the man almost made it over the state line. I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape do not want to make love for their boyfriend or husband the next day. The movie is just wrong in all directions. I would suggest the "Basketball Diaries" if I wanted to introduce a movie about drugs.
