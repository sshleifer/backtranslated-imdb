This movie should not be classified as a cinema. Although it is now over 10 years old, it should never ever get funding, and it is a blast on the Australian film industry, now producing such brilliant films as "The Dish". <br /> <br /> The actors can't act, the music is .. to be quiet, not music, the storyline is completely non-existent and is a struggle to go through. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. It's a total waste of your time.
