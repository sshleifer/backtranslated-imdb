I didn't even want to believe them, but I think that's what people are talking about when they say the South Korean film has reached its peak and can even go downhill. After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie "Gwoemul" (also known as "The Host") of 2006 - which actually managed to make a sharp satire from a B-movie genre - successive Korean blockbusters have become increasingly generic Even though their budgets (mainly spend on special effects) have become increasingly fantastic. South Korean filmmakers really want to destroy the goodwill of the audience and investor, who have built up their industry since the 1999 outbreak movie "Shiri / Swiri", by making a whole host of major medium-sized films such as mainland China. ? <br /> <br /> The only "reason" I can make to make this movie is to force investors to get the most detailed and liquid digital animation from a Korean / East Asian dragon. to finance what I saw. to date, for the final scenes. Now, when they launched the dragon at the beginning and gave more personality and purpose as in the 1996 "Dragonheart", the movie might have had some other redeeming features than having many digitally animated dragons. Remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? Didn't anyone learn that the trick is how many special effects you use, but how well do you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use because they killed just as much international interest in Korean dragon legends by the way they filmed this one. In short, I agree with all the negative reviews that have gone before and wonder how Korean felt their people's national anthem "Arirang" was finally played. As a creature feature I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences were worth it, but I saw many video games with better camera work and mini-dissertation (fewer dragons).
