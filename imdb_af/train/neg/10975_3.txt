This movie blows - let's get it straight now. There are some scenic gems scratched in this pile, but no one can redeem the loose plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and acts similarly. I usually hate Colin because he is generally a fairy tale, but he is OK in this movie. There were two plot lines in this movie - one about a child throwing rocks through supplies of moving vehicles and the other over a woman with a mustache. Let's see it - this movie has no freaking idea of ​​what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go. The characters story lines intertwine on some levels, but are in no way worthy of being included in a script. The whole thing is weak and useless and then there is an occasional OK scene. But overall - Don't be bothered unless you love Irish accents so much that you can see mediocrity and it's saved by everyone who sounds like the Lucky Charms elf - an American fetish that has hit some real crappy movies to success .
