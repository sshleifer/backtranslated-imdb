Hi, I am a friend of werewolf movies, and when I saw the title of Darkwolf hit the shelves, I was like "hmm, simple and beautiful name at least. But ... I wonder why I didn't hear about it before "<br /> <br /> First, the movie starts with tits. Many tits. Tits are pretty much all these movies budget going to. Who cares for a werewolf, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots! <br /> <br /> So, about the mysterious darkwolf character (a little spoiled ahead, but really caring ...) He's your average daily biker. Not even super-hard-looking, but like the old-fashioned woman in the movie, "he is much more powerful and dangerous than you have ever faced." Just by describing her a tattooed biker-type man. Pretty original. I even looked twice when they first used the "red glowing eyes". SPECIAL EFFECTS! I mean, my god, that the "just-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-by-computer" effect has been used since the seventies. It looks ugly here! And don't start me with the werewolf 3D CGI. As mentioned earlier, like a bad and old video game. <br /> <br /> And finally, as I do like werewolf movies, as I said. They always build a werewolf legend of their own. Darkwolf also builds the werewolf world, about a few stupid legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient bloodline. BUT. It almost immediately after the rules of engagement were created, "the dark wolf kills someone who touched the girl" starts randomly. Which just doesn't make sense, why even save the rules of killing, when they won't even play them ... Aplus the wolf-point-of-view shots are made with a Sony handycam or something, filming mostly the floor and walls. Just add coarse sounds and you have a super werewolf effect. The gore is partially OK. But when the wolf cuts everyone with an open hand, just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims, it just doesn't make me the trick ... <br /> <br /> Truly, who gives money make these heaps of rubbish straight-to-video horrortitles, they're not even funny kind of bad movies, just sad.
