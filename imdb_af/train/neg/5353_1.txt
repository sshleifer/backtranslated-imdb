I had the privilege of attending a special show of 'The Absence of Light' at a horror convention in Ohio. <br /> <br /> First, you know you're in trouble when the director launches a movie, says, "Keep in mind, we didn't have much money ..." Not that non-budget movies bad, but if a filmmaker uses it as an excuse, the results are always poor. And there is no better example than this unwavering sleeping party. <br /> <br /> In fact, Absence of Light is the first in the world of underground theater. It's the only time I've seen a dream throw from talented genre veterinarians, who actually carried me. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly enter the movie and leave it both as uninteresting as the amateurist names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's so boring, you'll stop caring for anything or anyone. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I got up and walked out of the theater. Not surprisingly, so most of the players also attended. <br /> <br /> Any curious genre fans will do well to stay away from this. With some luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
