The comparison may be unfair, but inevitable. Those who are attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be a little horrifying to discover a slice and slice of American style - uncomfortable, stylized dialogue with inexplicable song and dance numbers. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so poor that an awful job of dubbing has been replaced (as you recall, dubbing is almost perfect in Umbrellas). The translation of the French (for subtitled versions) also leaves something to be desired, although it cannot be attributed to Demy. The film also has several self-conscious moments that are a bit disturbing, such as references in songs to LeGrand itself. And the costumes - the combination of stiff pants / white boots and the freakish unnatural colors reminiscent of one of the Austin Powers movies. . <br /> <br /> But Demy rewards the viewer with notes to umbrellas; Note, for example, the suitcase worn by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase that Guy wears in his departure from Cherbourg. Also note the "Convenient Brunette of Resolution" - Madeleine in Umbrellas, and Josette in Young Girls. Generally speaking, those who expect the natural sense of umbrellas (except the floating bike scene), or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous ends as in Umbrella's script, should probably be this one. Those looking for a French version of a thin '60s American musical will be very happy.
