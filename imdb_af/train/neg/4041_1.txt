Like wearing a shirt shirt. Positive, absolutely, without a shadow of doubt, one of the worst movies ever. Pure torture. Zero stars out of ten. A long, boring, crafted, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical and leadenly artsy scene after another. Intended to be dreamy and impressionistic, the soul burst, it is rather a mess. <br /> <br /> Half-naked, father and son greet and whisper like lovers. "Homo-erotic" is the point, hard and clear. OK, so what? <br /> <br /> More than once the boy repeats, the rule is elevated to "Living Saints." Crucify a father's love. A loving son is being crucified. The parallel with God and his son, Christ, is heavy-hearted, irrelevant and bombastic like everything here. <br /> <br /> Some points of reference to the theme of Russian subsidiary: "Mother and Son" (1997); "The Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Fathers and Boys"; and of course Dostoyevsky, "The Brothers Karamazov." <br /> <br /> Credits in English indicate international distribution, which means that the excuse cannot be used to be Russian to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> It is nowhere near as complete or compelling as Sokurov's last, "Russian Ark" (2003). <br /> <br /> As in his "Mother and Son", an equally powerful soporific, some scenes are filmed by confusing mirrors, but not as interesting. The film is almost monochromatic, shot from start to finish by beige filters, making it as visual as it dips dramatically. A soft focus rabbit just adds to the drugged feeling. <br /> <br /> An annoying soundtrack drones on, never shut, like a band loop. An old radio plays constantly in the background. Russian Romantic melancholy floats endlessly as "themes based on Tchaikovsky." Of course, the presence of a "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) indicates that all the annoying little sounds, radio static, sounds, distortions and such "designs". <br /> <br /> It is difficult to believe anyone (Sergei Potepolov) actually wrote this thing. Everything looks as random as traffic, as if improvised by bored actors, who are not pushed into anything at all. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally managed to explain the thing without being the thing, so what we see The idea of ​​the idea, empty as a shell, but not even a shell , just the idea of ​​a shell. Can one ask for a better definition of decadence?
