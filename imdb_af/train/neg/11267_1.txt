Okay. So there aren't really so many great movies. Recent gemstones like American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 are usually not as close together. But boy (!) Balance this film against the balance. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people thought they were doing. Are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to finance such a crockery of ****? I can see it now ... <br /> <br /> Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes. He's cute as a button and was pretty good at Shakespeare in Love. And we have Rhys Ifans, who's not nice, but cool in Notting Hill, we blend into a mediocre score, some forgotten post-Britpop songs, hemlock root and lizard and hey presto, you have the worst movie of the new millennium, and believe me It will be hard to make anything as bad as it is in the next thousand years. "<br /> <br /> The Bank -" I Love It! Any unnecessary sex? Bad camera movements? And what about the worst accent? this side of Devil's Own? "<br /> <br /> Producer -" Yes, we have a lot of it. "<br /> <br /> The Bank -" Sounds good, where do we sign? <br /> <br /> please.
