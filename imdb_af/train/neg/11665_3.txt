I enjoyed the film very emotionally, intellectually and visually. It contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and does not require it, and keeps my attention all the time with the visual, story and intersperse words of wisdom. <br /> <br /> But: 1] some of the foreign language accent has made the dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] There is unnecessary over-exploitation of curse (especially the F-word, which is the only reason why the film R is classified). [3] The movie is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotions you keep throughout the film, except the final resolution last minutes, are unpleasant due to the exaggerated prolonged dysfunctional reaction of some characters to lose, In the depths of bitterness and depression it stays too long. [4] I would not recommend this movie because of 5 seconds of background story, which did not add a little to the side character, or the movie - it just turned me to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterwards: the main character's mother of the German ancestor, if he watches old WWII movies, "secretly rooted for the Germans." There will be no "local color" or art if the Nazis have won the war. I don't know of any Germans today, except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazis won World War II.
