This film was screened as part of the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. I had no expectation of the movie if anyone else chose it for me. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that take time to develop, movies that unfold the characters and make the story flow. Silence is good. But this movie was just slow. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to the two main actors. There was a sense of tension between them as two completely different people, who are really wrong, come together in a very uncomfortable way. There were gentle moments and sadness as we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the environment and the way it was shot. It was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the film's intimacy and strengthened the strangeness of the characters. <br /> <br /> I just don't understand the end. What was the point of everything?
