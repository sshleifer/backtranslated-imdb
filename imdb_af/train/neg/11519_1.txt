It's absolutely the stupidest movie I've ever seen. What a waste of a wonderful saucepan. This is James Cromwell as the ignorant who plays deputy. I can go on, but of course I will spend more time on this review than anyone ever did on the screenplay. The only thing this movie is about, we are against them and how to solve in ominous slapstick, beyond any reasonable person's tolerance. It's one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
