I remember when this piece of garbage came out, all the newspapers talked about how it took Barbra Streisand years to make the movie. Well, it couldn't have taken so many years; the play only opened in 1975, eight years before. It made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh, who probably had to be thrown into the movie, but NOOOOOO ... the big STAR BARBRA DID THAT. AND LESS MUSIC! This movie is a total disaster from beginning to end. For one thing, Barbra was THIRD YEAR when she made it and she looked there every minute. There was no way anyone could have her swallowed as a young girl who wanted to study Torah. And when she's dressed as a boy, it becomes champion. I get the impression that Streisand cannot bear to be unattractive, so she played with the make-up; she is more beautiful than a boy than she is as a girl. And as if it's not bad enough, she gets involved with both her partner Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, whose best moment is the lap of his naked back) AND his fiancee (Amy Irving, doing her usual sleepwalking routine, a bit of Schtick, the poor woman, always falls over when the director ignores her and she doesn't know what she is doing). Yentl goes so far as to marry the girl; I won't even call the "wedding day" scene. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music. Nine completely forgotten songs, all sung by Streisand through voice-over (presumably as a glance in her mind), and each as obtrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard. <br /> <br /> I won't say Streisand doesn't show a brilliant promise here as a director; Some of the visuals are beautiful (Patinkin's back especially), and she has a good eye for balance. The problem with this movie is that it won't come out in its own way. I didn't believe her in the title role for one second; she never had to add the songs, and the whole mess went on for two hours and fifteen minutes. I was sick of the whole shame about five and forty minutes. <br /> <br /> Terrible, terrible, terrible.
