I rented this movie on Netflix after winning all the Oscars, to see if it really was that good. <br /> <br /> The Hurt Locker is a very realistic depiction of a group of soldiers' rotation in Iraq. The film is around Will James, a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline, to take risks and defuse bombs. <br /> <br /> Where this movie seems to me to be lacking, is the plot and direction of the movie. This movie has no clear plot unlike other movies like Black Hawk Down. What this film is trying to do focus more on the characters and their different attitudes to the war. Bigelow does a good job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to be dragging. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, but it feels like a 3-hour movie. <br /> <br /> One scene in the movie that was particularly horrific and the movies ruined perfect credibility was the sneaking scene halfway through the movie. It was both unrealistic and very long. Overall, I thought this movie was OK, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was because it was a big fall to win the best picture. at the Oscars. I felt that this movie could be so much better, as Raving Private Ryan lost the best picture, but it was much better than this movie. Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down, which has won only 2 Oscars. I honestly don't know how it won the best picture. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an action-packed war strip, hire Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.
