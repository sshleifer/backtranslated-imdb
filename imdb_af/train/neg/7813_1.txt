In my eyes, it's almost the perfect example of Hollywood ego, just hit by the new King Kong movie. Superman is the original superhero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he is wearing tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen. From the start of the movie, you just want to hit a piece of kryptonite in his throat. He just seems stupid to put on the costume. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for Lois Lane, she's supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was poor and predictable (WOW, he is actually superman son, who would ever have thought ....) and the acting was terrible. This movie has one good thing to do, and the name is Kevin Spacey. His performance of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but even he couldn't save this movie. What this movie needed was the movie of "lois and clark" (except of Kevin Spacey of course) and another story. I watched this movie after watching "the hills have eyes" and I was shocked to learn that there were worse movies, then.
