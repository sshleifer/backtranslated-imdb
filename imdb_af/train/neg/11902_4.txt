The hysterical aspect of this movie is that, according to the director, it is difficult to find a distributor in the US because most of those who saw it could not reconcile the seemingly contradictory messages of Christianity and American fear. The idea that someone sees it as a religious film is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Because a minister at a homeless mission asks if someone wants Godspeed, does it make it a "Christian" movie? One can interpret that it is actually a belief in the "Land of Plenty", with all its material remains. The best thing an organized mission can do is to publish a bowl of soup and a bible verse. Very unlucky or apostate maybe? Many useless homeless missions? How about many psychiatrists in Vietnam? As a pill-popping survivor survivor of agent "pink" we believe America is a "Land of Plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have many psychiatric patients? Certainly, we don't have enough people concerned about Palestine's politics, based on the main characters' phone call in the movie. Of course, if you worked in a German homeless shelter, the unfortunate one would be much more concerned about peace in a far country than their own personal survival, as the world knows how Europe is the "continent of abundance" when it comes to sophistication. /> <br /> In fact, I finally agreed with the title, as the United States is the "Land of Plenty" and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts, amateur acts and indifferent directed films. Life is too short and one, even an American, does not have enough time to look at this piece.
