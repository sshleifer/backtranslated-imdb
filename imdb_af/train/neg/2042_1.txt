Zodiac Assassin. 1 out of 10. The worst acting ever. No real worst ever. David Hess (Last House on the left.) No, one in the seventies. Rent it, it's really good) is the worst of the bunch (Pretty stiff competition, but he is incredibly god-terrible.) One will be hard pressed. To find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence. The movie really screams to a beautiful painful halt when it's on the screen. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie actually has any redeeming features for Mr. Hess to destroy. It is filmed with a home movie camera and by the look of things is a nice old one, complete with the secret beam. No mail production. Let there be a kicking that a five-year-old computer can use to clean up this photo. Throw bizarre stock footage photos of outopsies and aircraft carrier takeoffs and this is a visually screwed photo. The autopsy photos are, under the influence of Italian cannibal films, the god-horrible lifelong animal murders. And the naval material is supposed to be an anti-war statement (Because we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs are joining the fleet.) What in the world is Lion's Gate dropping this garbage? This will make Troma embarrassing. The plot is about the Zodiac Killer. (Last seen in Dirty Harry.) No, one in the seventies. Rent it, it's really good.) Someone is shot in the stomach in LA and police accept the Zodiac Killer is back? Uh huh. What can you expect from a movie that doesn't know that DSM IV is a book that is not a psychiatric disorder and where the younger killer older male relationship looks the same as a congressional newspaper and a congressman? Yes eighty-year-old hairstyles and production values ​​meet a Nambla subplot. Sign me up.
