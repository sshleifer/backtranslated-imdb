Simply, I found the TV show "Mash" trite, preachy, oh ever so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and greatest sin of all, and that's? that it was (was) incredibly boring. You've got Alan Alda starring, "(star), so in love with himself and his smartness, that it made me even uncomfortable to even try an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, which I would like to acknowledge, had some pain and style for their character offering. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both singular and composite, are like caviar and fresh oysters with Wonderbread. Loretta Swit, who I also found boring, was also no wonder to watch, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the movie, got tired and acted on the show. To see once a year it showed me. Jamie Farr was just a low-profile "comedy" and is not even worth mentioning here. The reason I didn't give it is a (one) appreciation, which anyone who reads it now, is wondering is that classifications of any kind are not just a subjective call, but a relative one. Television, except for relatively few exceptions, is such a junk. Mash has, relatively speaking, some degree of production quality, (according to television standards) of that era and today, and therefore it deserves a two. Rob Ritter
