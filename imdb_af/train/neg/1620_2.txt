This movie has not recommended much, although it is not the breathtaking scenery, cinematography and wildlife direction, it is difficult to face its weaknesses to such grand reviews. It is precisely these things, but it makes the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution is so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched it with my kids and none of us was too impressed with the end. Yes, the pictures were wonderful, the broad landscapes over the woods and mountains were wonderful, but what happened in the foreground? The dull narration of the stupidity of an indifferent girl who is slowly learning a very basic lesson about game friendship - and is easily out of the record of that kind of thing. This is definitely not a new story. In fact, there is nothing but the novel about the way it is told, and we've seen it before, and indeed much more eloquent by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. <br /> <br /> The only thing really taken from this movie is a sense of how to work with these wonderful lenses and bush lighting; The rest is a waste of time.
