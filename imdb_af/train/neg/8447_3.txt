I don't know what I missed here, but I can't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this movie. I thought it was stupid, and a little over it. I had like the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, but the other was just boring. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies, I really do, but it was a bit further in the alphabet for me. I saw someone comparing the humor and the horror in this with "Army Of Darkness" and "Shaun of the Dead", as well as "Compared to the Re-Animator". You gotta joke. I didn't find this movie funny, it was trying, it made an effort (possibly too much trouble), but I think it failed. By the time I was hit with the 3rd or 4th one liner, I rolled my eyes and checked my watch. <br /> <br /> There was definitely tribute to several other movies, which are always cool, similar to an inside joke for our horror fans. But here it may just be a lack of original thought. There were some good special effects, good gore, but it can't carry a whole movie. The mutant Grant looks like a cross between Jabba the Hut, and in the early stages of mutation-Chet of "Weird Science" (after changing into the monster) and one of the alien creatures / children of "The Explorers". It just didn't work. I thought it looked like something a Grade 5 child could have designed art classes. Then there was Brenda, the woman who fertilized Grant and chained it in the barn. When the aid finally arrived, she looked like a giant tick waiting to be. The design was again totally unattractive. A colored balloon with a face in the middle. * Digressed * <br /> <br /> Now About Zombies-The more movies I see today with zombies in them, the more I wish George A. Romero a patent on them and was the only author / director allowed to to make movies about them. He is the only person so far to do it, with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but it was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were a different Zombie style. Perhaps Mr. Romero ruined a zombie movie for me because of his inventive ability to make his actors sound, groan and move around as if their joints had dried up and even had a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles were fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that started to fix before they are animated again. The people of "Wheelsy" just didn't have the right motivation ... they were terrible zombies. <br /> <br /> In the end, I give a 3 times 'slither', for a few laughs and some pretty good scenes.
