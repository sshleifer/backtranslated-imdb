The title should have been "The Walker". It's just he walked. <br /> <br /> There was nothing good about the movie. The description of the movie doesn't really fit the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get from the movie is that he was a good boy, but a terrible person with a low life. <Br /> <br /> I'm sorry to spend my money and time on this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. I kept hoping it would be better .... what a mistake. I got worse. <br /> <br /> If there is a suggestion I can make to his producer, his life has been diverted to another field because making movies is definitely not his cup of tea
