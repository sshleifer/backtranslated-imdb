I'm not an artistically inclined individual. I am a scientific woman and I felt that this movie was one of those champion-artsy-type movies on a budget. I watched part of it with my fiancee and my future stepdaughter. We tried very hard to find something in this movie to keep our interest. My fiancee and his daughter rejected it and we went to Ocean's 13, but that's another story. Not to be alarmed, I woke up the next morning and gave the movie another shot. I started looking seriously at this movie again. I just didn't get it. I thought I'd get it. I thought the funniest part was the spindle of the ashes and the urn found a place through the fireplace to be used as dead flowers. Interesting and still it has dead things. It was a strange and weird movie. Maybe that's what they were after, but I won't be fooled again a second time!
