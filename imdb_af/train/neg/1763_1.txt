This is one of the worst movies ever made. Commonplace. Predictable. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that reached one point was that there were some nice scenes highlighting Barcelona. I think they will use movies like this in Guantanamo or another hidden CIA / NSA prison to torture suspects. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies are some redeeming features, it has nothing. If I was in it or worked on it, I would change my name. Actually a maze. Hard to write more than that, but I feel the world's filmmakers need a head. On the other hand, it will make a good gift for people you can't stand. <br /> <br /> You can send it to politicians you don't like, in laws, ex-women, teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W., and a host of others.
