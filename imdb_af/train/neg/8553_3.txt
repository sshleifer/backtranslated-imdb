It's actually a very bad movie. The ideology is not as perverse as in the films that Collins made later. However, my main concerns about the film are that it is unquestionable and quite frankly boring for a long time. The whole concept of an ex-SAS man who doesn't join terrorists for any particular reason is not very convincing, and you can't help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists (who are becoming rather unclear) are don't fall. The movie starts with a pretty powerful scene, but then it is quite a long time to build up to the grand finale. Overall, I think whoever dared win could have been an interesting 45 minute episode of The Professionals, but the story doesn't carry a feature film. Although reasonably successful, this film began with Collins's career, which made cheap and dubious soldier-or-fortune films in the 1980s. Sorry, because he is actually a versatile actor, but in the end Martin Shaw has chosen his roles more closely and still has a successful career.
