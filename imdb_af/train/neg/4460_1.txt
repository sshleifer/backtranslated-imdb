AWFUL! Avoid like the pest. I will evaluate it in the top 10 worst movies ever. Special effects, acting, sound, etc. Are done by daycare students ... wait, I've seen programs better than that. Opens like a soft porn show with a dull nude who does a shower and then goes bad. Good naaktonele, but that's it. Sounds and light problems were constantly in the movie. Sometimes I swear I can hear the roar of the camera cars. Yikes! I'd like to see another movie on this story, but done by different people. This group of actors and crew need more acting and movies. Selected 1 out of 10.
