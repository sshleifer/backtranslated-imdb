It must be one of the best overlooked anime shows ever made. And yes, I even showed the "Gospel End" and it still made me hate. Not to mention the many rip-offs of this show! <br /> <br /> I don't care for psychological and philosophical untertones, but Gospel drag it into mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters were very interesting. The only interesting thing was Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Other than that, mostly everyone else was a lot of nice crybaby losers. They must go to a psychiatric center and not manage giant robots against strangers called "Angels". <br /> <br /> Even the mecha and alien fights didn't help at all. Proceed as follows: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are these robots, and they're really cool because they're bleeding (!) When they are hurt, but they're not really mecha, but angels caught, so sometimes they go insane and don't do what the minor pilots want, and they should be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't recommend Gospel to anyone. , anime otakus or not. For those who love this series, you are right about that, I respect you. But for those who have an obsession to think that each of these series will hold, you are more selfish. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run -Dim" and "Robot Taekwon V" myself.
