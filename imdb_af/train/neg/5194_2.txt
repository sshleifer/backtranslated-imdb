Don't get me wrong, I want to see marijuana as the next man is legalized. I'll go out now. However, the writing was unrealistic. A PTA mother who deals with drugs, but is determined that her drugs come from a minor. Give me a chance. The smugness of the very beautiful Mary Louise Parkers character was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not nice at all. Actually, the plot lines didn't go anywhere. I understand his only TV country. The hypocrisy was blatant. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a good mother and I have to believe it .... WHY ???? I just had the feeling that I was preached by a show that blew out. It's like saying it's OK to cheat on your wife, but with someone of legal age status. OK, not exactly the same thing, but I think you people get my point. It saves the kids things great for campaign paths, I think, but it doesn't hold water in a cab over a suburban mother, like the local wholesaler.
