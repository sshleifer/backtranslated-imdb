Never look at this movie ... it's the biggest pile I've ever experienced in my life. And that's something to say. the acting, storyline and filming were absolutely scary, this is the WORST FILM IN THE WORLD !!! seriously does it not even give you a hit as it costs me 99p of sainsburys and it was only made in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen .... although if you really want to watch it, you should watch the "scary shark scene" ... possibly the best play I saw in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously, this is the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours, EVER !!
