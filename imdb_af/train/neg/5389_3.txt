If you've seen other movies like this, they're probably better. The Omega man emerges. For the studio's credit, they avoided the unbridled, unnecessary, big budget technology that featured movies of this ilk. In addition, the setup and premise were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious deadly disease. What is bad is ALL OTHER! I get tired of endless stupid, indifferent, wimpy, ineffective, arrogant characters in a movie. It pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point. I rented it, and I repeatedly shouted at the TV, "No, don't do it!", "Why are you so stupid," "Look out!" A true lack of character development seems halfway in. " A movie should give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so you actually care about what happens to them. This one doesn't. There also had to be a longer, more involved end of the movie.
