Mind, my friends and I have seen the movie based on it's title alone. It's cute but clear in the plot and direction - you know where the movie goes within the first five minutes. My main quarrel with the plot is that, while apparently consistent, they never explain much of the stuff behind the characters. An alcoholic father, excessive mother, stressful sister ... it's a bad family, but apart from the occasional mention of the sister, there's no decision. I was also confused about the scene with the bottles. It was pretty random. <br /> <br /> The writing is a secondary issue ... the kids weren't bad actors, but their writing left a lot. to wish. Unfortunately, what a cute niche movie could have been set aside for a single, blah special effect, lame scripting and a sudden obvious plot.
