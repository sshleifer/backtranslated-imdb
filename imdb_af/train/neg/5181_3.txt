This is the first movie of the Horrorfest that I watched and after I almost think I don't have to see any of the others. I said she was a "think men's horror movie" and had to say that if that meant me I would think the flatter / gore movies would be in the collection. Don't get me wrong, even the gore in this movie is worth going through. <br /> <br /> The plot is much wiped out with too much art for the sake of art. The camera effects and music are most of the time, and the characters are banal to say the least. Several characters and scenes eventually seem worthless if they begin to reveal Hamiltons' hooks. I figured out who Lenny was about half an hour when I figured out the movie. I was so visually educated and confused by the Lenny revelation that I was totally torn off. I was expecting what I got, but they could have gone so much further, indeed, all the gores are completely flat. With movies out there, such as "Hostel" and "Saw", you should get a little better for a movie that is considered "graphic or disturbing to general audiences".
