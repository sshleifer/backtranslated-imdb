The point of the great prolonged preparatory phase of this star is born story seems to be ultimately more sublime success. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a female young woman who has been imprisoned within herself, but never convincingly as the stage actress of ever-increasing fame who both overcomes and gains profit from this debauchery. Even in the long scenes of Esther's acting, we never see her the instructions of the teacher. After suffering from ominous details through Esther's (largely self-inflicted) pain, we are not convincingly given her triumph. <br /> <br /> The obsessive presence of the heroine's pain seems to be a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. Yet, the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) never come together in a coherent whole. A 163-minute movie with a simple plot should be able to knit loose points. Esther Kahn is not ready to go before an audience.
