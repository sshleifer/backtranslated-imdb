If you ever hear these three words being told you ... "Joe Don Baker", be scared ... Final Justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas city called Geronimo (pronounced as Heronimo). He is an ugly, slim, rude character looking for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His mate actually drops twice in the movie. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, and doesn't make the plot anywhere. Plus, he shoots everyone as if he's in the wild. I don't think anyone told him it was the 20th century. A woman's head was assigned to show him Malta (which looks like Elaine from Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can sit with the redhead. She must be mad! <br /> <br /> The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Their dance is shown throughout the film and I started to pair with the messy women. Well, at least it was better than trying to squeeze Geronimo out of his way. The end is faulty and somewhat predictable, and I was glad it was finally over. You will never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker's movie. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to imagine how he was in THREE Bond films ... very strange! Anyway, if you laugh a bit, see this one on MST3K. I also heard his other bad movie (under many), the Mitchell MST3K version is released on Rhino on DVD. I can't wait to see it!
