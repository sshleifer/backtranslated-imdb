Lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a deceptive attempt to make an heir's fortune; Karloff is the butler and Lorre is a professor who exposes fake media, but it seems they are both in conspiracy with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and his band of 30-year-old "kids" uncover the truth with the minimum of humor on the way.
