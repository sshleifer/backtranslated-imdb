(This is an overview of the later English edition by Disney, with Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and co.) <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Really, really. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and having seen all the glowing reviews on this early Miyazaki movie, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked, I say, about the quality of this movie. The later movies boast well-made stands, three-dimensional characters and the best movie music ever since ... ever ... ever. This movie just doesn't come close. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I can also start with the positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki films, this one is still very imaginative, with a bizarre fantasy / science environment, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast a far superior animation with other films. (though not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki's later films) and the English voice show was pretty well done. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... isn't ... good ... The characters are all cardboard - from saccharin sweet nausicaa, to the relentless evil Tolmekians, in between. Once you have seen every 30 seconds, you have seen everything there is. And the fact that the plot just moves around doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music ... Now Hisaichi hands off my favorite movie composer, but Nausicaa doesn't do him justice. Half of the music is 80's keyboards at exaggerated, and it usually comes so far as to distract the visual images rather than help them. I highly suspect Syaichi had told a lot about the music before he saw the photo. <br /> <br /> But wait! There is a good message with this movie, right? Let's save the environment! It's a pity that this movie hits you with a sledge hammer. There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree. No really. I'm not joking. <br /> <br /> It makes me a little sad to talk about how lamb this movie is. But for some reason, all the other reviews on IMDb look to worship it. And when the characters talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell what is going on, it's lame. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who worships anime, enjoys music and planting a tree every tree day, you will probably like this movie. Otherwise, save your money for his later movies, because they rock big time.
