James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a 'mental illness facility' for a medical residency assignment with Dr McCort (Bruce Paynes). There he realizes that many interns are killed by `The Ripper ', who takes their souls to the devil, in a cult run by dr. McCort is promoted. This story is so absurd and incomprehensible that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when the character of Helen, the blonde fiancé of James Bishop, arrives in the asylum, it is almost incredible that a writer has the courage to include them in a script. And what about James returning to the hospital to bring the dead patients files? And the role play composed of ham actors and actresses? Honestly, I don't know what or who is the worst in this movie: the screenplay, the director or the movie. The correct answer is definitely all of them. I saw this cable on cable television, and I'm surprised how a producer can spend money in such a garbage. This horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurdity of the plot. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Demônio '(` Devil')
