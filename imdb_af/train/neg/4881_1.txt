This is the most boring worthless piece of shit I have ever wasted an hour of my life. All I can say is thank God it was only an hour. More than half of this 'movie' is footage of the original 'Criminally Insane'. At least I could see the highlights of the weird exploitation classics, because for some loss of reality, my videobusiness only had "Criminal Insane II" (as it had Crazy Fat Ethel II). But the rest of this movie is the absolute worst home video active and backyard movie you'll ever see. Why is it my video store, does it and not the original one? Why do things like this end up in video stores? Why do people rent it and don't burn the copy right away when they have seen their horror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? <br /> <br /> Unless you like to see annoying fruit, eat whole candy in a turbulent slow-motion scene, or say fruit is hung in an even slower tone of the stairs, or becomes a character stabbed sideways (ask) several times in the back, or brain-mocking monologues about giving poisoned tea to his wife and then complaining that all the talks made your own tea cold, or the mentally-delayed food fly soup, or just wanted Crazy See Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden: Don't see this movie. Repeat: Don't watch this movie. Don't rent this movie. If that is not at all possible, don't pass a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie institution on it. You can still be saved, but it's too late for me now. . .
