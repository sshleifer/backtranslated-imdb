What is interesting is that the play; was not bad, just not enough. It was rather lame. Special effects or lines were the single culprit for this failure. To stand alone they were not terribly bad, but together was a tragic move. The show has been long-lasting and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed up the movie, but it failed completely. <br /> <br /> Much of the blame for this disaster has been put on special effects. Don't believe it, they were cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this effort. Although she might have chosen everything, with a little bit of recognition. An experienced actress would have done something like Appleby never did. Scfi puts out some very good original movies, it's just as bad that it has failed so drastically.
