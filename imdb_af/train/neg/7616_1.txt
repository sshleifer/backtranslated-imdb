The good news is that a movie has been thrown on a so-called Aztec myth and with an extraordinary Aztec American (such a word). The bad news is that it was dead at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood came out of his retirement and coached George Romaro through his classic 'Night of the Living Dead', it might be what we could do with. 'Diablo's legend' is clearly feeding for any future revival of the 'Mystery Science Theater 3000!' <br /> <br /> I don't think one can even call it a B movie. The production values ​​are so uncomfortable that I feel like I have watched a long slit from a variety show or an 8 mm backyard by a group of schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> ANY SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The basic plot line sounds interesting enough to attract me to rent it. A rural California sheriff finds a box with an Aztec demon and accidentally unleashed it on the unsuspecting community. His daughters, one hot and one housewife, team up with a Gringo FBI man and a priest to try to save the devil again. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, every zombie scene you've ever seen in previous incredible movies has become weak. These zombies are more like an army of Nutty professors than the dead! The supposed infrared screens of the devil's point of view are nothing special? and he / she / it seems very secure (instead of turning the forward). And the scene where the priest quickly draws the devil out of the cave is ridiculous! It really looks like the comic effect, though I know it wasn't! I expected the Benny Hill theme music to start playing and for all the gang zombies to chase the priest over the beach! <br /> <br /> Of course, the Darth Vader / Field of Dreams voice speaks, and calling the FBI agent is completely comical. Then again, so was most of this cheese ball! Robert Napton, director and author of the screenplay, should win something for this effort! (How about a lifetime blackballing, like the 'Hollywood 10?') This one, I see now, is rated 1.5 on a 10-scale. I fear it may be a little yellow! <br /> <br /> Is there something good about this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty warm like the younger daughter of the dead sheriff. That's probably why her domestic older sister (Calvi Pabon) really drove away from home! Fred Estrado is pretty decent as the FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who played for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, he must have held on to baseball. In fact, they could not have been worse if they went with a baseball theme and called it 'Demons Abroad'. <br /> <br /> If I find out, it was actually a community college cinema project, I will issue excuses. It could be good enough for a B or even B + as long as the gang got the college camcorder back to the campus in one piece! "The Blair Witch Project" has proven that a cool, campable film can be screened. "The legend of Diablo," did not look like a SHOESTING or work shoes! It was low-budget, low-talent, low-everything. The last final scene - and I mean the last 10 seconds of the movie - is the only light creative or interesting moment. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 to rent it. I could better spend it on a hamburger!
