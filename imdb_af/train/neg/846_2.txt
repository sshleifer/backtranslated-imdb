It must be by far the absolute worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw Michael Madsen in it, I thought it couldn't be a movie because he was in some nice, fine movies, and he was a fairly fair actor. WRONG! No one should waste their time on this movie. I quickly send 80 percent of it and I didn't feel like I missed anything.
