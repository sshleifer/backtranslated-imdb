As a fan of silent movies, I look forward to seeing this photo for the first time. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, the movie looks like one long, long, commercial for the Maxwell car. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the race was about half the length, I enjoyed the movie more. But it soon became very old. And while I realize that reality is often stretched in movies, without diminishing the viewer's enjoyment, what were the Mexican bandits? I mean, they are driving a car through the mountains, a car that mostly moves about one mile per hour, but they can't catch it?
