John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domerge, who as players all saw better days in better movies, came together for this Grade G horror movie about life mimicking art in a mysterious mansion. <br /> <br /> For Carradine it was in the past The past two decades of his career he appeared in the theory in everything, it was better to stay working no matter what you did and get those pay cards in. With that wonderful sun-like voice of her, Carradine was always in great demand for horror photos and The man did not at least discriminate in what he appeared. <br /> <br /> He is the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion, where movie director John Ireland hired for his latest low-budget slasher film. It even has a cemetery but with a missing resident. Domergue's belief is Ireland's aging star and Carole Wells is young engineering. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes or so, most of the cast is killed, which is not dead. The writing is so incoherent. I'm still trying to figure out the point. I will no longer waste gray matter on it.
