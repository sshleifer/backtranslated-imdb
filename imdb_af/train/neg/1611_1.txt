I think it's the terribly crafted and directed movie. Benicio Del Toro should not work in the production of movies, he must accentuate his acting and that is it. Steven Soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea of ​​revolution, ideas and most importantly about the life of Che Guevara and so on. Camera is horrible, like someone with 2 days work experience with shooting, music is ... I don't know .. is there music in the movie ???? I would not recommend this piece of sh .. to anyone. It just wasted about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever .... I can't figure out how to rate this movie more than 3 stars. RAMP .... RAMP .... RAMP .... RAMP Please don't please. Save This Misery of "Movie"
