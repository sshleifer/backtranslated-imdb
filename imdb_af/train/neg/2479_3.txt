I taught the Wendigo many years ago from the Wendigo in one of Alvin Schwartz's "Scary Stories" books. According to the story, the Wendigo - after you've called your name in the wind - pulls you together and pulls you into the air and powders you. While it looks like a bitter idea, Schwartz's story has turned it into a fairly coherent idea. <br /> <br /> The movie "Wendigo" doesn't mean. It basically consists of every horror flick clich√©: family moves to a new home and strange things begin to happen. Anyone who harms them, asks, and everyone has better listen to the old Indian man. I've seen these things so many times that I don't bother anymore. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm in the Middle") did much better than this.
