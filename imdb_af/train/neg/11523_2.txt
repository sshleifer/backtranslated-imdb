"Igor and the Lunatics" is a completely improper and amateurist attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing spree horror movie. Apparently, even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring over-haunting but incompetent garbage makers. This is a typical Troma production, which means there are many boring and completely irrelevant tissue materials to accompany the nonsense plot. There is a bit of casual gore and gratuity on each other? what's not bad ?? but it is so useless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. "Igor and the Lunatics" are so desperate that they are often used for the visual material, such as the circle. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by drug addicts and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower qualified disciples, called Igor, becomes a little too obsessed with Bible stories and drug organs and gradually causes the entire cult to descend into criminal insanity. To illustrate exactly how crazy Igor is by illustrating a small example: he vibrates his heart straight out of the chest of a very sexy black hitch-hiker girl! There is an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some embarrassing embarrassed pseudo-artistic camera tricks, such as slow motion footage and lurid dream sequences. Perhaps there is one order that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for garbage collectors and that is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds the lap of the blade in the bloodbone for fifteen full seconds.
