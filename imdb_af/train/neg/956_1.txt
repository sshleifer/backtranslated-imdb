It's amazing that this movie is after all in one of my hits. This is by far the number 1 worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only have I bored it before (fortunately not more than 1.5 hours), pre-adolescent humor attempts that feature are not even close, but one of the cornerstones of my mouth slightly tilted. After the first very uncomfortable part, you tend to hope that the other parts will at least be slightly better. You hope in vain, it just goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> The movie has no story to tell and repeats this non-story three times. One can only hope that by any miracle all the remaining copies of this movie will be lost forever and Trent Harris will never lay his hands on a camera again ...
