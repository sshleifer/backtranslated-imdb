I have to say that in my childhood I am very proud of many of the movies I have rented. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the all-time swindler movie in any actor's CV. Can you imagine what Whoopie's fired agent had to tell her to sign up on this piece of crap? Hey Whoop, you've ever seen Dinosaurs, yes, they make a movie out there and you see Germany! "Then, the agent must refer a lot of Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, I thought Whoopie had bought and destroyed every copy of this movie. I just wish she could do the same thing in me memory, because my sister still gives me a little bit to watch that movie, I mean, I will even admit that I watched Nanny and Kazzam in the theaters (good reason why I've been Hulk Hogan and Shaq gave up), but it stinks me in my mind as the worst of my childhood, and the biggest regret of my life, and it was 16 years ago I am now 24 if you want to do the math. br /> <br /> When I think of my all-time list of worst movies, I don't even call this one, because like a raped stepchild, I'm trying hard to suppress it ever happened. Whoopie, just be glad people only recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst luck you have.
