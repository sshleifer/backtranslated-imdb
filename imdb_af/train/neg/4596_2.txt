A question for you: A family goes to a new home and is harassed by demonic forces. In what movie do I speak? Every horror movie you've seen? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I will reduce it by saying there are many teen angry scenes. Isn't that helpful? Well, there are many pieces where the characters are captured by a creation and you see the characters through the creature's POV. No further? Okay, there is a dream sequence with lots of blood? Can still be a horror movie you say. Oh yes, it can take weeks, so I'll tell the movie what I'm talking about, many Aussies. Many of them appeared in the near and home and away. Yes, that's right, the movie is THE THIRD CIRCLE (also known as CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the above exercise is about? It's about how the THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any horror movie made.
