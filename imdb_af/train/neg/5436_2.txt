A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital where a team of doctors are trying to remove a DVD case from his ***. <br /> <br /> I was excited by the prospects of another Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels I brought a lot of entertainment and previous shows were wonderful, but boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the people who did the casting had to fall asleep. I think the castings went like this. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I enjoy a lot of fish." "Wonderful, you're hired. Have money." <br /> <br /> Then there's the writing. I read Chabon, which I hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong, and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not sure why it irritated me as it did, but it may have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech-impaired 90-year-old drunk duck hunter with a proper cranial lobe dysfunction would surprise me. be compared to the one-liners these 2-grade model carnage children splash out. <br /> <br /> It's a real line of the movie; "If you tell me something you've never told someone aloud, this moment will be unique!" Alternative? Do this? Is it really? Of course, not you plank. Please give me the Imodium. I will have a full **** strip. <br /> <br /> Directing is ... well. I have nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber is just the word his grandmother exploded or something. Keep up the direction of comedies. No keep in advertising ads. <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that I hit my head against a wall, so hard, it brought me back to the stone age. I give it 2 stars because I don't want to be the one who watched a 1 star movie.
