I have absolutely no knowledge of author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work, I would probably have had little interest in her books as a child. When I was a kid, I wasn't really interested in little, unless it had soldiers who could fight monsters, with a high body number. <br /> <br /> Judging by this movie version of TOM's MIDNIGHT GARDEN, I think Pearce is writing for lower middle class children since much of the story of turning around protagonist Tom Long moves to a house with no garden then suddenly metaphysical one. Having a private garden was undoubtedly something that working class people didn't have in the 1950s, so I think there's a political class somewhere down there. There is also a romance with a young girl named Hattie, but again are cynical children charmed by love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little is in the way of excitement or adventure in the narrative. <br /> <br /> It is a children's movie that seems to be dated by its source. It's unintentional, but I'm surprised by its high rating by the IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would have scored so much if they were 10-year-olds who only saw the Lord of the Rings trilogy?
