Two years before he wrote and directed "Arthur", Steve Gordon had a small hit with his script for this crackpot comedian for Henry Winkler, then TV's "The Fonz". A 1950's college thespian (and all-round jerk) lives and marries without any prospect of working on the horizon; To finish, he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling, which eventually becomes a "Gorgeous George" -like celebrity. Converting Winkler into a silly goof-off probably sounded like an interesting idea of ​​the time (and a sure way to separate him from his television alter-ego), but the jokes and situations are often wrong and mean by director Carl Reiner. Especially rough is a windy little bit that Hervé Villechaize (of "Fantasy Island") places the movements on Polly Holliday (Flo of "Alice"). Like Henry's beloved, Kim Darby looks a bit out of her element - especially when surrounded by all of these TV hammers - which makes the romance aspect of the text indifferent. * 1/2 of ****
