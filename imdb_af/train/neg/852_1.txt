I'm going to keep this short. This "adaptation" of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and as a result, this movie mysteriously found its way into the top 250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is laughing like Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall. The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is a disjointed mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story: stick to the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and the people who say that Kubrick has every right to destroy the King story, because King is ... not a good writer when reviewing "masterpieces" like "wide eyes".
