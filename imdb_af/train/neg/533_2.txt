I knew that 'night' was a girl movie, so I expected to be bored. A bad tease on IMDb said it was a "chick flick" but that your companion would survive. <br /> <br /> Survive? Yes. I'm still here, but when the two of us came out, we were surprised to find that it only lasted two hours - it was a much longer night than that! I suppose this is supposed to be elevated or fascinating to Yanks, as it is about rich people living on the beach - along the beach, in a house with a large veranda and lawn, but no apparent lawnmower . If that kind of thing impresses you, it may seem like a short movie. <br /> <br /> There's a Monty Python movie about a knight that just won't die. He ends with a wrestling (why add Yanks a third syllable to this word I wonder) torso in the road still screams threats on his nemesis. This film is also about a kind of living death. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the graveyard shown here) continues and dies while having inappropriate debts. She is not worried about being a wide, breathtaking bimbo, but regarded herself as a murderer. <br /> <br /> Obviously, as a girl movie, there's a chap that Mr Darcy / Heathcliff has to be character. I'm not a wanderer, so I can't claim to judge such things well, but the boring wimp that turns out to be just seems to have the title of servant in favor of him. He is a bloodless sieve. <br /> <br /> As you come together, the main characters aren't many cops, but the minors manage, incredibly much worse. There is a fellow whose only job is to respond to the news that his girlfriend is prettier. Good enough, but it's not Hamlet's role - why is it so bad? Forget about being a girl movie, I thought he would be thrown out because any decent girl friend would have told him that the face-thumb hadn't flattered him, but then I realized she should have encouraged him to a beard, because he looked worse. <br /> <br /> I watched by watching which actors and actresses had their overlaps attached or free and saw interesting nature clashes - when dragged on, see if you can see the stuffed buffalo head, just the kind of thing you expect in a beach house. <br /> <br /> Apart from the compulsory wedding there is only one piece of action. You would have thought they did it. Unfortunately, the hit and the accident were carried out by a car that couldn't be there. When the accident is discovered, the role player is shouting for a character they can't know is close (but we do as the audience). If they have no idea that the person is within a few miles of the place, why are they deliberately shouting for him? I suppose the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream order ... <br /> <br /> Another scenic item that caught my attention was a copper bottom saucer. I didn't think the technology to do that was developed until the fifties.
