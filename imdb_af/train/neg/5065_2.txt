This movie is just bad. Poor story, poor direction and below average. The thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising - constantly - for a well-known internet provider. Obviously, some scenes are written to do so, advertise. This movie is a slap in the face of anyone who paid money for it. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this, it's not worth it.
