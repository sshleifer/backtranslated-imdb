"The brain machine" will at least put your own brain into overdrive to try and find out what it is all about. Four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence were chosen for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment. Since the only common denominator is among them, the fact that they do not have a familiar family is a hint. None of them will be missed. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is known under the supervision of a mysterious creep. like the general, but he seems to be leading a senator who wants to remain anonymous. Good is calling on the senator's part. There is also a shadow waiting for the camera to constantly zoom in, which later claims that it does not take its direction from the general or the project. He was no longer effective, he was quite easily inundated before the whole thing was kablooey. <br /> <br /> As nothing else, the movie is a true treasure trove of 1970's technology with repeated shots of mobile phones, room-size computers and a teletype machine that won't stop. Perhaps it was the basis of the movie's alternative title - "Time Warp"; nothing else makes sense. As for myself, I would like to consider a title by the murdered dr. Krisner's experiment entitled 'Group stress project' is being considered. This also applies to the film's actors and viewers. Just keep an eye over the general's head at the pool when he asks an agent for his weapon. A boom microphone is visible above its head for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> You might want to catch this movie if you're a hard Gerald McRaney fan, could he ever have been so young? James Best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic pastor, but does not call him Father. For something a little more on its rise, try to get your hands on 1959's "The Killers Shrews". That one at least does not propose to take himself so seriously.
