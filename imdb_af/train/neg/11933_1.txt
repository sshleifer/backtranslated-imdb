My child makes better videos than this! I feel like spending the $ 4.00 to rent this thing! There is no date on the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; And, what's even worse, there's no production date for the original movie that appears anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, leading to an unsuspecting tenant to believe he is getting a recent movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad from the point of view that it was outdated and irrelevant for any period, but exactly when it was made, that I was surprised that someone would take the time and cost to make it a video marketing. It may be of interest to students studying the anti-culture of the 1960s, anti-war, anti-settling, tune-in, turn-on and drop-out culture; But if you read the back of the video cabinet, there is no hint that this is what you get. However, if you make the mistake of renting it, it's probably best seen while on drugs, so your thoughts are closer to the wavelength of the thoughts of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind as you watch it, I can tell you that it doesn't get any better after the first scene; So, knowing I'm sure you will fall asleep long before the end.
