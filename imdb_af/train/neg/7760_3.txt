In the Fiji Islands, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the Valalola resort of Primal Park, investors and guests are invited to an opening party of its composition made up of hotel and zoo to find partners for its discoveries. When a lot of college temporary thieves put a virus in the security system to take part in a chariot hunting, the biggest attractions of the zoo? sabretoothes from the prehistoric era develop from DNA found in fossils ?? escape, kill the hosts and guards for pleasure. <br /> <br /> The incredibly lame and cheap "Attack of the Sabretooth" is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. The characters are horrible and not funny or pleasant and the story is a terrible Jurassik Park rip-off with a bad collection of clich√©s. Basically, all the lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabretoothes are bulimic and love to kill. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("The Attack of the Sabretooth")
