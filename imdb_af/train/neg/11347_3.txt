Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in a pristine print that offers full justice to any merit it has as a movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> It has a capable second-rank role players who can be acquitted and can be expected under the circumstances. It is efficiently targeted, entirely on phases of sound and standing frames on the studio backlight. It looks good, but is over-emphasized and at a barely 80 minutes it is still heavily stuffed. <br /> <br /> For example, the double cobra attack on the first of the CIs was surely one attack too much. <br /> <br /> The business about Julia, who prefers to marry Pete, rather than Tom, never amounts to anything. Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and she never has reason to be jealous of Julia. <br /> <br /> Julia's "female intuition" is introduced as if it would lead a major plot development, but does not. Similarly, Pete's investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly fell on Tom serve no purpose other than to fill screen time. <br /> <br /> These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is structured like a mystery, but it is not. As soon as the curse is pronounced, we know exactly where the story is going, so the characters are carefully revealed what we already know. <br /> <br /> The end is particularly lame. Julia is inadvertently threatened. Lisa has no reason to kill her - it happens at the wrong time in the wrong place. When Tom appears in the time frame to save her, it's not even clear if she's totally threatened. He simply has the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done. <br /> <br /> It's such an inconspicuous little pipe-case of a story I found myself on the ground as the studio heads. Then it happened to me. Someone said, "These Val Lewton movies were very successful at RKO, so why don't we do that?" <br /> <br /> Cobra's cult is clearly modeled on Cat People: mysterious, upset, form-shifting woman in love with the hero, apparently cute, murdered, raising the suspicions of the hero's wife friend and die at the end. But 'modeled' does not mean 'as good as' - with a wide margin. It copies but doesn't understand what it is copying. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a low key, suggestive Lewton style trial, but this approach does not follow in the story. Lisa is not Irene. She is meant to be strange and mysterious, but there is no secrecy about her. We get a glimpse of her after the first attack in Asia, so immediately acknowledge her when she appears in New York. There is never any doubt about her purpose. There is also no ambiguity as to whether she does not really change into a snake. <br /> <br /> Also, during her nightly prowling, we don't get one, but two attempts at 'buses'. Don't come down because the director doesn't understand what a 'bus' job is, and anyway it happens with the stalker, not the person being stalked. <br /> <br /> These vague echoes of Cat People Give the Cobra's Cult any small distinction it may have, but they only pay attention to the gaping gap between the original and the imitation. Plagiarism can be the sincere form of flattery, but I doubt Lewton or Tourneur was particularly flattered when this tiny little one passed by.
