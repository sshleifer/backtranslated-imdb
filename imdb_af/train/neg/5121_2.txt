In this movie I thought it would be a neat football drama (remembering the same thing as the Titans); However, I felt like I had just attended a Ted Haggard sermon on the Rapture. The only thing missing was the request for a tenth at the end of the movie. In fact, one would probably come more from a televangelistic sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment. At least with the television angelic sermon, there are quotes from Scripture rather than quotes from popular self-help help. The plot was far too predictable to the point that anyone with a long enough attention span could have explained the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie.
