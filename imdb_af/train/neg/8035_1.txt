This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror movie buff and will rent a horror movie unless it's made for tsv. Looking at the box, it says it's rated R and Gore. Where was the Gore? Were they one good mortal scene where you actually saw it? I could have overlooked it if there were some short nudity or good dialogue. There was not even a sensible or amusing line in this film. Sometimes horror movies are great because they are so stupid, but it was just sad.
