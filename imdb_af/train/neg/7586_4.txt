Summer vacation is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness and also deserves it with the Broadway musical adaptation of Take Me Along. With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of the other Harry Warren-Ralph Blane songs are worth remembering and even one is questionable. <br /> <br /> It was immediately after the release of this movie that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I don't think it happened. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948. So Mickey was 26 playing an Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was just too old for the 17-year-old who influenced radical ideas in a spirit of youth rebellion. <br /> <br /> From 1946 to 1948 Rooney made four films for MGM, one, killer McCoy a remake of Robert Taylor's A Crowd Roars, Love Laughs at Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all of them, Rooney was an adult. Even in the Andy Hardy movie, Mickey played World War II adult Andy Hardy. Why he was in this Louis B. Mayer just knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney's bad casting makes Summer Vacation the worst because in the original Ah Wilderness the father's character is played here by Walter Huston. And in the Broadway show Take Me Along, which won a Tony award for Jackie Gleason, the Great One played the vacant son-in-law, Uncle Sid, played here by Frank Morgan and that is the central character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven is acting for Judy Garland as Rooney's lovely and sweet girl friend, and Marilyn Maxwell plays the show girl who gives Rooney an adult education. In the original play, O'Neill had her as a prostitute, but it was the Hollywood of the Code. All Marilyn does is soused young Rooney. <br /> <br /> Many very talented people have a hand in this one and they do their best, but the summer holiday fades rather quickly in a cold autumn.
