First, I would like to say that the user's comments alone made me laugh with tears in my eyes. One note that bad SF movies are getting good comedies is right on the point. MST3000 made it live. <br /> <br /> Looking at the ANGRY RED PLANET as the chorus dream of a 10-year comic book reader from 1959, you'll have the handle on this sucker. All the elements are there: the pseudoscience, sometimes logical, more often hilariously infantile. The adolescent boy's attitude towards sex, with the "gigolo" captain (good call on that one, guys!) Eyes at the buxom "scientist" with hair so red it is a wonder it doesn't turn off the fire alarms. The ridiculous view of Mars as a planet so strange that everything glows red, but one alien monster has a mouse face, and the blob alien has an eye that rotates like a child's toy. The comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!) Seems to have never completed the 8th grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his shotgun. And of course, the mere fact that strangers = dangerous evil. As these people E.T. met them, they would have fried in two seconds! "OW" indeed! <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I rated this movie low. Yet it is never boring (unless the scientist tries to explain everything - to make it sound more and more ridiculous), and you have to admit that it lets you jump into a little child. <br /> <br /> Well, don't admit it. I think you were never 10.
