The Sentinel represents everything about Hollywood's soulless and the sad lack of imagination that currently exists in so many movies. I can't think of one thing well, it's so generic, so fabricated and so lazy that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting, undeserved public. <br /> <br /> A Plot on a Secret Service Agent planning to kill the Prez can be well entertained. Being handled by a good director or caring role it is. Douglas is the one estimated. Basinger is the First Lady, with whom he has a relationship (an undeveloped, unresolved plot retreat). Sutherland is the best mate who is guilty of guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and ... that's it. I think there are fewer requirements for women when entering the Secret Service. As usual in a movie like this, the role of the Prez itself is nothing more than an instrument, a sign and is very badly written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, who gave us the same bad SWAT 2003, mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and count their performances from afar. Eva Longoria, the 21st century's most exaggerated woman, is basically the only one to attract the Desperate Housewives audience. Her role is 100% useless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add character development. She barely has 2 lines to rub together. A real shameless marketing slip. <br /> <br /> If you are a glutton for punishment, don't let me stop you. But it's not time and money you won't get.
