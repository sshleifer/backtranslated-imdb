Ironically, though he can do the splits, Thomas is a complete stiff as an actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is being sown in my memory as one of the most crumbly and incompetent movies I've ever seen. As such, I really love it. <br /> <br /> Yet, the only reason it gets more than one star is that Thomas is a good shape and it is nice to see his small, muscular body that has different skills of gymnastics skill on the strangely shaped rocks and poles spread. across the eastern European countryside (including the infamous "pumice-horse" hole in the middle of a town square that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers). But let the poor man open his mouth and try to emulate, and any illusion that he can have a film career is immediately hit on the chest. <br /> <br /> At least Thomas had the excuse that he wasn't really an actor. Everyone else in the movie - actors, directors, editors, camera guys, etc. Is at least as bad, or even worse, and most of them are professional. So Kurt doesn't come out as much as you might think. <br /> <br /> I hope poor Kurt took the money and ran it. If anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts movie again, I'll bet that Thomas kicks the man.
