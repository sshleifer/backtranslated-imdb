I saw this movie when I was very little. It's by far one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Now, usually I like strange movies, but it was just a little too much. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a plot on the movie. Anything, it starts out like Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to save their new friend, Babette. From there come madness. There is the Greedy, the Loonys, a sea monster called Gazooks, and a lot of pirates singing songs, which just made the movie more. Also, I can't help but feel Babette is annoying and a bit shiny. She definitely didn't help the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, though I don't like this movie, there were some cute parts. I love the camel's song. Although it was a song to be alone, it had a friendly feel. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most of the payrolls were just nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. King Koo Koo was just a little garbage bag dr. Evil looks like a serious villain. There was also Raggedy Andy's song, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely a good song for little boys who wanted to run. But honestly, even these things didn't make the movie any better. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) <br /> <br /> While I wouldn't personally recommend this movie, I even admit it has its beautiful moments. See it if you are interested, but only if you are in the mood for something "really" extraordinary.
