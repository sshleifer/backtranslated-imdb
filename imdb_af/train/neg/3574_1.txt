I simply couldn't finish this movie. I agreed to what I would say is my nomination for the most miserable attempt at sexual proposal award: a scene in which Pia Zadora at a picnic stands between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she wants a hot dog, which he then holds for her. At crossroads. I hope I don't spoil anything to say she doesn't turn and take the hot dog with a smile. Just pathetic.
