Above Derek does not go down in history as a great actress. On the other hand, which began in the 1980s, real actors in Hollywood were less and less of a required capability, so Bo could have gone very well to bigger and better things after Blake Edwards' big box "10." That's when she didn't allow her husband, John Derek, to take over her career. Several Playboy spreads and bad movies like this one (especially those directed by John) destroyed the momentum she had and made her the joke of many jokes. In the 1980s, it was assumed that you could place a certain personality in a certain movie and that would be above gold. John thought that Bo was in a movie she was naked, because many of the running time would allow people to flock to the ten hype to the theaters. Maybe if the movie was good. This version of Tarzan must be the worst of the many reviews of Burrough's lord of the jungle, a slap in the face of the character's book and movie heritage. Tarzan is actually a reflection, as the film is primarily a vehicle for Bo's breasts and Richard Harris's wonderful overworking (remember, the couple worked together in Orca). His cold art helps you stay awake during the boredom of everything and yes, the movie is rather boring. Nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance. Bo's body can get you that far. Miles O'Keeffe, who at least played Tarzan, would go on a long and enjoyable B-movie career and Richard Harris could follow it after his recent acting triumphant, but Bo and John Derek never recovered from this fiasco and future cooperation between the two only served to show why his direct career and her acting career died in the first place. <br /> <br /> And how did the orangutan go to Africa?
