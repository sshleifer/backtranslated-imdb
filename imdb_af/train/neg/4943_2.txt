I watched 3 episodes of Caveman, and I have no idea why I continue except maybe waiting to get it better. <br /> <br /> For me, this show is just pumping itself from the ads, with no real humor. While we were around, we all speculated about what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> The episode of the female rat woman with an attitude was actually big, yes, right for us. she is rough in a theater and is hard on strangers, and the truth is, she needs a blow <br /> <br /> must say, Cavemen is comparable to the old show, my mother, the car. I give it a 2, just because they earn 1 better than 1 because they actually spent money on it.
