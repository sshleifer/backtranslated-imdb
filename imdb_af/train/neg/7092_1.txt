<br /> <br /> This movie (not a movie - clearly recorded on a cheap cam-corder) can be one of the biggest movie stump bombs in history. Beware: the packaging advertises the movie as an erotic exploration of sex addiction. The movie is not an exploration of anything, and it is no longer erotic than staring at your own warts. The writing is useless and winding, with all the plotting elements serving as segways between alleged sex scenes. However, even the sex scenes are lame lame lame. Except for the first, they are about three seconds long (then again, maybe my version cut) and comic overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent movie, you don't want it. If you are looking for a titled sex movie, you don't want it. As for your life goals, desires or perspectives, you don't want to see this movie. How did they start Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski, and Ed to act in this stink bomb, is mysterious in the extreme.
