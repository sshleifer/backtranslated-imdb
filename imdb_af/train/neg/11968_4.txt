It's just typical Bruce Willis, action movie schtick. Watch it with some popcorn and your friends. Rent it to save money. <br /> <br /> None is realistic. The battles are not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. The victims are not realistic. And why was Tom Skerritt's character with Willis of the DECK OF THE CARRIER? How about this? He can't do it inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. gets a machete wound. There are a lot of average explosions. <br /> <br /> If this movie represents the Navy SEALS accurately, do not sink into Africa and expect them to save you! <br /> <br /> The noble attack In town, I was most concerned. "Front seats for ethnic cleansing" ... as Bruce looks at the battle in the village. So what does he do? He crawls into the city on his stomach. Yep. How many died while running around? Oh yes, a body count was necessary, I think. <br /> <br /> And if that one African guy was so important, why didn't he get the helicopter with the elderly and kids? Can he say, "Duh?" <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie was very dark. Not just in plot, but so much happening at night, it was difficult to determine what was going on. <br /> <br /> Rent it.
