It's hard to believe, after we've been waiting for 14 years, we'll be filming this movie. The original was a high impact, dark thriller that gained cult status, demonstrating the fine art of theater as Paul Verhoeven indicated. This film adds nothing, does nothing, and eventually ends up in the big box of failed prosecutions. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence could create an intriguing set of plot developments with a significant talented and capable role. Unfortunately, we are treated in a 90-minute thesis in Catherine Tramell's self-sufficient life ... or is it Sharon Stone. Possibly a combination of both. <br /> <br /> If the desire is to see a continuation of the sensually challenging battle of sex as in "B.S.1", forget about it. You come up with softcore boredom that eventually upholds the old expression that a woman can be more attractive in clothes than out of them. It is interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling surrounded her skivvies, through the 1966 GEORGY GIRL, then Mrs. Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and quite capable of keeping herself here. <br /> <br /> If you are a true movie lover, you should see this movie and judge it by using your own rating system. If not, just wait for the DVD release in the "rated" version, "unrated" version, "collectors" edition or "ultimate" version, and maybe in another 14 years we will be satisfied with the news of "Basic Instinct 3", at which point Mrs. Stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really mind.
