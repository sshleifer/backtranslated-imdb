This romantic adventure had to be shockingly subversive in his day. A rich English women's high school scheme complicates and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to begin secret activities of a definite anti-social kind. There is a clever sex-roll reversal, as her activities risk her more and stomp than most characters. But of course there is a long, dark and attractive stranger to retain the love interest, and this evil lady is not backward to come forward when she meets the right man. <br /> <br /> The desirable weakness and belief of every other character makes the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who thirst for romance will overlook it.
