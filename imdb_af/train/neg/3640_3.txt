I had no background knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it sounded and I wanted to see a very fast Viking movie for a while ... unfortunately, this movie wasn't what I was looking for. I was hoping for the best, but instead a boring Nordic soap opera was delivered that lasted too long despite being 84 minutes long. The film's point of departure is intriguing enough: it's about a Viking warrior who resists his God and Odin is so furious that he curses the shepherd's son, Barek, for death and rebirth as a Berserker. This bald man is then forced to live furiously, madly and violently after the lifetime. The film is skilfully filmed, with some powerful cinematography and quasi-good performances by the actors, but again I was bored and questioned when this dribble ended. The filmmakers had the opportunity to make something rather entertaining and semi-unique, but they dropped the ball. Maybe it could be improved with a few cheap mining tactics thrown into such free nudity, and many gore ... I mean, we're talking about Berserkers, aren't we? Vikings were supposed to be enough, what with all the rape and looting, so are Berserkers not even more extreme? All in all, if you are a fan of The Young and Restless (and so on) or, you are, in fact, an insane Berserker who likes suicide. I will surely get rid of this messy piece of celluloid.
