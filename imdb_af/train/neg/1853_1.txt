This movie, no correction, this THING, this mutilated horror of the burning wells of hell, had to be murdered before it even left the author's head. I couldn't get enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try. Awful, bad, deceptive, tasteless, shit, vomit induction, gutwrenchingly bad, terrible, nasty, uncomfortable, there just aren't enough words in the English language! The "plot" involves a serial killer who becomes a snowman. Don't ask how, not important. The killer snowman walks over killing people. How can you ask, can a snowman kill someone? In tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if it is, you don't have to endure that Styrofoam snowman. In ways that make you want to fill your ears with warm wax, you no longer have to endure its snow points. Don't see this movie! Destroy it! For the sake of your soul you should not look!
