You can often say a movie has not turned out as it should by the heavy use of a narrator. This movie contains this device all the time. Richard Jobson, who is not entirely satisfied with writing live and even fundraising, adds his credits by reading the excerpts of his own semi-autobiographical writing, which, combined with some nice editing, manages to brilliance over what a dull depressive story is that he must err for real art house. Kevin McKidd is in a good performance. Everyone else is good. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints have meant that all scenes are shot in the daylight, although most obviously are meant to be at night, but if you know serious alcoholics, they work mostly in the day so for me. Add it to a touch of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie is a waitress who doesn't run a single day in the 20 strange years that goes between her appearances. A more extreme version of the problem that McKidd has that goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.
