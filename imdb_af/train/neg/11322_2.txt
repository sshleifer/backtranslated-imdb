There is a word for this kind of movie, and the word is 'brave'. It was foolish when it was a VHS rental, and it was re-routed on the satellite. <br /> <br /> It can mislead you because it has 2 moderate well-known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, reasonable soundtrack music, and a beautiful Monument Valley scenery. <br /> <br /> It also has a curly woman who is fighting a lot. <br /> <br /> If that's all you want from a movie, it might keep you. happy. <br /> <br /> It's still brave.
