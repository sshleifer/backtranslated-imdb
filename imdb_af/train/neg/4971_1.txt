I work at a Blockbuster store and every week we have movies that contain just a few copies. This is the kind of movies that show the Sci-Fi channel. The kind of movie nobody ever wants, and just those idiots, when they bring it back, I ask them: "was it good?", They say "no, we turned it off after 15 minutes!" Movies with horrible computer-generated, super imposed monsters and so on, very unattractive. <br /> <br /> It's the same kind of movie that Grendel is, and absolute waste of time, if you reasonably (and reasonably want)) Good Beowulf-based movie, then Beowulf & Grendel, lead roles Gerard Butler, try the excited 300 plays as King Leonidas of Sparta. <br /> <br /> Plus, later this year we have another Beowulf movie, featuring a star-studded cast ranging from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But don't let your hopes rise as we all did with Eragon, or we're all in for another great disappointment. <br /> <br /> And with regard to rentals, here's my rule: If there is only one or two copies, don't rent it, as it's a load of crap. (That's where 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is strange, or a documentary.)
