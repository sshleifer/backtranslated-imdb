This movie (along with Rinne) is small jewels under the repetition of homage pics that have so far passed the 8FTDF "HorrorFest". And yes, it's dull praise. Because there's not much worse in film doom than authors who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get with The Abandoned. It is a movie that is almost entirely made in the director's head. Certainly, it would have been nice if he had transferred it to film, but it did. It's a very nice movie with some real scares, but the last line is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd.
