Although it is 2 years old, I still remember the complete waste that involves the whole plot of the movie. Unfortunately I got this movie to my friends and I chose it while browsing through the new issues at Blockbuster. We decided to choose the movie because it was the only one we didn't see and it sounded like it was nice. Although it has been a long time since I watched the movie, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously, there is no real plot), and the waste of time spent watching the movie too. completed. If you are in the video store and catch this movie catching your eye, get up and find a better movie. If you finally see this movie, I understand your pain :)
