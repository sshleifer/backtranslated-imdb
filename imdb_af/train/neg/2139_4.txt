I wanted it, but in the end it was a bad movie with too little laugh. <br /> <br /> Politics is about, it's going to offend hell of republicans, but that's what it's designed to do. . This alone gives me the reason to chuckle. <br /> <br /> The problem is, it seems to be in a REAL hurry (about a week). And it contains a silly subplot about a bimbo singer, which seems completely out of the subject. Turiqistan is, of course, Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number of countries the US has since been visiting. the 50s. The humor is a bit dark (amputees dance with prosthetic bones made by Tamerlane corporation), but that's about to hit, especially with the corporations that pay in the reconstruction ("democracy lite")! <br /> <br /> But as a lot of satire criticizes the US, it looks terribly heavy and handed. I think it's against so many bs propaganda running so it has to uncover people over the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer a nudge, shiny approach - a bit subtle. But that's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can see it again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope "W" is more about.
