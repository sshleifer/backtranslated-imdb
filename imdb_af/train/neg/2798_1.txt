This movie is bad. If you are thinking of watching, there is only one decent scene in the movie, and it takes about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's topless scene). The rest of the movie is terrible. I think high school probably plays better. The plot doesn't make sense at all. The set was pretty lame and it wasn't even good to have fun. It was just boring and very bad! I watched it on Starz, so I thought it had to be at least decent. The mini description sounded like it would be good. The girl killed herself for apparently no reason at the start of the movie, after seeing some terrible music videos. The transitions between scenes are VERY sudden and it's like someone who just puts some clips in a movie without first thinking about how to change it. Just cut from one scene to another, no smoothness. Similar to my random switch to talk about how bad the movie is, to explain why the plot sucks. The sound is low on some points, where you can barely hear it, and then becomes out loud with gay horror screams thrown at random in the movie. It's the same sound every time. It's officially the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Story Line: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame Meter: 1,000,000 / 10
