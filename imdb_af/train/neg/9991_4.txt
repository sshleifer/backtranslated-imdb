First, I'm not here to dog this movie. I find it quite pleasant despite the poor production quality. The acting here is about as horrible as the monster they stole, although the monster itself was done very well ... impressively well done. He actually looks a different worldly nature, like a stranger family on holiday in Himalayas. And while the father was out, he was ... taking part in nature's call, Spot came loose and they just didn't have time to hunt him. This, whether he is the Wishmaster's Caucasian brother. I didn't decide which one. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems like it's been filmed somewhere in snowy land, yes, but probably, Canada, somewhere like China. The trees and views tell Canada and it is good that the established area will never find the cold or cold feeling of a person in the Himalayas of China. This is a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of location. <br /> <br /> Moreover, apparently (as we have just established), scientists are not regularly traveled because they are unaware that commercial aircraft are flying over again as shown here and the next accident would not did not happen. But as I said, it's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we have to forgive a few things. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes graphic, and turns between "Alive" about the Donner Party, "Predator" about the stranger in the bush, and any bad wushu movie they fly on wires. The Yeti can apparently jump like Spiderman or Super Mario ... remember? "Run faster! Jump higher! Live longer!" <br /> <br /> The Yeti also missed his teddy bear. He was looking high and low, but didn't look like a cadaver. Poor Yeti! You can't help feeling sorry about it. It survived and developed thousands of years just to succumb to severe teddy bear loss. He missed his bear. Or maybe it wants to go, but the thought is out of the question! Do you hear me? Well, it seems to be an unmanaged man. REBANISHED! <br /> <br /> It's super human. Well, it's not human ... it's super-Yeti! But again, what is normal-yeti? I don't know, but he has a definite Michael Meyers quality that is totally disturbing. And he has this beautiful way to clean his fur. FABulous Dahlink! It's suddenly white at times when it shouldn't be so. He is fiercely super-super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> All in all? It was a lot of fun to watch, have some great deaths and some honest plot elements. In spite of the terrible gravelly production style, it is actually quite entertaining. I can't help wondering if they plan to plan another? <br /> <br /> It's a 6.0 / 10 on the M4TV scale. <br /> <br /> It amounts to 4.4 / 10 on the slide of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
