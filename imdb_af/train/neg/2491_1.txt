Maiden Voyage is just that. I want to say straight away that I watched this 5 minutes before I could no longer do it. As already said in another comment, this movie does not fall in the whole "so bad it is good" thing, it's just bad. The acting is terrible, the sfx is poor, and the story is vague and stupid. Even the extras suck, the bag guy guards and such apparently keep their weapons like water pistols. <br /> <br /> Don't even watch the movie, the only thing about it doesn't matter. how low your expectations are, you will still be disappointed.
