Bad movie for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with very poor special effects, lots of hasty scenes (for example, the airport), and a real unfunny time. (Charles Dance) is terrible as the evil man and he is much better at (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) does a non-comic joke, and I've heard that this sank has already passed, big time success ?? !! I will never understand why or how? In a TV interview I (Eddie Murphy) heard himself, when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, regret it on a comic book item! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... It's the 1980s!). Well, no, my friend. It's the cinematic folly that has made many RAZZIE films over the past few years, be it the 1980s or the 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons that make me write about this movie. The first is that I will never forget the long tan-fascinating legs of (Charlotte Lewis), especially if she was on the bed before the bad guys attack her home, just wear a blue shirt and OH BOY, have the camera take care of her bare bones if it should be. But how strange! As I watched her in the next movies and she wasn't beautiful again! Anyway, the second reason is that I've recently found this movie's title at my list of the worst 100 movies ever! <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
