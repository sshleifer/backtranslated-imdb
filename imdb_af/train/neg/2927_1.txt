Somewhere, out there, there should be a list of the all-time worst gay movies each made. One has a long camera shot of stars staring firmly into space, or they are unbearably focused on kitty cats eating spaghetti. This motion picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love swimming and stuck in caves and one of them has a depressed mother and the other has no mother. They talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital eight days and then comes out and there is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long shots of one in the room watch or just sit and do nothing. I think it's a kind of gymnastic filmmaking technique or maybe it's that movie is so bad that it has to fill it with long, wasted shots, otherwise they would have to rely on a plot or story. The movie will be about 14 minutes. Don't get me wrong, it's about the 30th gay movie I've watched over the past 6 months and some of them (many of them) were very formative, predictable and boring, but it's one is really a terrible waste of The best one so far was "Beautiful Thing". So, I watched it and after the first opening shot that turned and turned, I thought, "Oh no, it's going to be creative sensual mah." But I gave it a chance I watched it and when it was finished I threw the DVD into the trash. Sorry, I didn't like it and if you did, sorry if I insulted.
