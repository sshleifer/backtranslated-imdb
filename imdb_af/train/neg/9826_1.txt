I think it would be a good movie for a true believer in organized Christian Dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation of Church and State and GOOD Science Fiction, it is a horrible joke! br /> <br /> There are some well-known actors who needed either bad work or a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of our heathen. <br /> <br /> I was entertained by this movie the same way I am entertained by "Reefer Madness." This movie tried to educate drug education by frightening tactics, just as this film tries to teach "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who do not share their interpretations of our world. <br /> <br /> It cried with laughter and at the same time frightened me of realizing how many people actually believe our society should return to the good old days of the 19th century!
