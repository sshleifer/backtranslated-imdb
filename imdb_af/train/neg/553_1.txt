After waiting eagerly for the end, I must say I wish I hadn't joined the whole series for the first time. The last episode was all by the previous seven years. It ruined everything. The trip was 23 years, but Janeway's captain has the power to reduce it. Just say seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crew members have died along the journey. Why does she just want to save seven of nine? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew comes home is not really the main thing for them. As the saying goes, "travel is more important than the destination". Unbelievable. And on the final scene they are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst end ever.
