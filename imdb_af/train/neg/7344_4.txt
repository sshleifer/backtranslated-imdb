This is the story of a young woman being seduced and then shed by her older, married lover after she became pregnant; She avenges herself against him, and his whole family, through black magic? what, disappointingly, she didn't do herself, but did somebody else for her. Good production values ​​for a Thai horror flick. But the mere scrip never generates tension, the director approaches the material quite conventionally and the final act forfeits the sympathy of viewer for the victims by throwing the logic at the winds. At one point, a character has an excellent opportunity to simply kill the villain, and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun. Bad Writing? you are relaxing in it! <br /> <br /> Some icky gore effects, including a very tasteless late-fetus body and one guy who dies to burst hundreds of alive from his stomach. Only recommended for genre finalists who should only see every horror movie produced in Asia over the past 15 years.
