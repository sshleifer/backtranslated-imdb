There is enough star power in the house of the mind to create another galaxy, but the final product is reasonably negotiable. The movie and its messages are very noble, and I think maybe most will agree with them. (Liberal Democracy good, violent fascist regime bad, openness good, racism bad, etc.). Unfortunately, we are plundered here from head to toe, and so much subtlety is used as I have described it. <br /> <br /> Eventually we are left to watch many noble people without any fears that scare off with nasty cries that have no redeeming features. It radiates with all the tension of a poorly orchestrated "pro" wrestling match. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close, as her son-in-law. If the camera stays with these people, the movie tends to move, and it's pretty nice. Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS involves just too many subplots, and characters jump up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets. We don't teach them, so we don't have to look after them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille Augustus, the director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) extended the movie or cut a few characters, this movie could have worked completely. As it stands, it was a good try, with fine messages, and a bonecrushing yawnfest. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
