Tierney is an authentic hard man, but this movie error of normally competent RCD undermines its impact on every turn. The script is about as likely as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times that Tierney's incredible car company swallows one after another terrible apology for his elusive and violent acts. The old clich√© about it, which just happens in the movies, is here in the spades. Then there is the guy who plays the watchman, who apparently invaded a crazy WC Fields comedy, destroying the impending mood in the process. The static one-room sets also don't help, nor Feist's obvious lack of material. Then add a final motor yacht missing both imagination and installment, and the results are pretty flat. In fact, the film first arrives at the station home scene where difficult policemen discover the hidden forces of innocent gas station workers. It is a pity that Tieney's career never really went. I gathered what was largely due to the fact that I was such a hard man on the screen like scraping on one blow to another. His ice-cold way and clarity of emotion sometimes reminds me of Lee Marvin at his best man. Anyway, this project can work as a radio game, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.
