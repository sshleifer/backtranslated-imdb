This movie makes Canadians and British asinine moronic idiots. The men are stoned / drunk, and then they scream / beat each other almost every scene. The women are superfluous to the story? I don't understand what they are there? they spend every scene that causes a ruckus, or worse, like a spoken bull that blooms. Apparently, the Canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hiccups. It's the standard snap friend, her in love boyfriend and his evil despair that we've seen in countless movies. <br /> <br /> Every character here is a carp, infantile stereotype. Not to mention that they all look like they need a shower! And the idea of ​​any kind of scene that implies sex with George Wendt ?? sitting ?? is enough to make someone gag! I watched the movie because Samuel West was in it ?? but I can't understand why he would have accepted a role like this. Maybe he needed the money. Ian Tracey is an excellent actor - the only one with a vague redemptive moment, but his talent is wasted here. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot ?? the three imbeciles trying to get their baptism back? yawn - or Karl ?? who is dead, but who is actually a very lively character in the minds of those left behind (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece? Although I am ashamed to even think of comparing these two movies), why even save it? Karl is so scary that you find the circumstances of his death satisfactory. <br /> <br /> By the end of this miserable movie, I thought they'd all be better off joining him on that boat!
