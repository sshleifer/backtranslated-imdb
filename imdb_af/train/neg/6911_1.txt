Which misses a BIG stack. Shot-on video (REAL crappy camcorder, NOT digital) stack of garbage. This is without a doubt the dumbest thing ever made. The fact that this crap is actually released is totally asanine. Everyone who sees it will be stupid because they watched it. Seriously. I felt it killed several brain cells after watching this rubbish. The positive reviews of this $ crap were made by the "filmmaker" (and I use the term VERY loosely) himself and / or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel is as honest as this would have wasted. life. Trust me, stay away from this video. You will thank me for that. Avoid it like herpes.
