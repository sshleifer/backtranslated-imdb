This movie is billed as a comedy and a mystery. They both fail poorly. The only secret here is why someone will make such a poorly constructed film. The only comedy is the laughter I got when I saw how high the readers were here. Can there be two movies of the same name? The movie I saw has a girl with nice blue eyes and a plot that wasn't there. <br /> <br />
