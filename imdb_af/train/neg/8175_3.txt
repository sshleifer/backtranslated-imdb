The mood of this movie is pretty good and it keeps the feel of the 80's good with some good performances. <br /> <br /> But ..... <br /> <br /> The script runs out of the mill with the exception of a few comic moments and comes down as strange where I expect it is meant to be edgy to be. The characters are all about dramatized and incredible and full-fledged clich√©s that the scriptwriter probably saw a panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie has no real story. It records all the right "arty" boxes, but nothing really happens and in the end you keep wondering what the point was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
