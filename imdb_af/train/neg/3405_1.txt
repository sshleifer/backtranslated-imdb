I can't believe how uneducated this movie is. It's like watching the police academy, except it is with people who have no idea what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot that's supposed to be a sidekick. I can understand the suspension of unbelief, but it's just folly. Not only is there a plot for this movie. It's like seeing someone pretending to be a doctor, throwing non-medical words as if they were a head of staff at a large medical facility. Plus, the people wear clothes that aren't available for a space program. I feel like I'm watching a "b" movie in the valley girls, in space.
