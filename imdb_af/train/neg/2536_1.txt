My wife and I just finished watching BÃ»su AKA The Booth. She fell asleep during some parts of the movie. I really wish I had an assassination with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud that it is impossible to sleep. When we speak protagonist, it makes me Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke. He also has no redeeming qualities. I was hoping he would hit a bus with five minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love Asian horror cinema, but The Booth is extremely annoying and full of scenes that really are. Don't make a damn sense. If you want a good Asian theater, look at a story of two sisters or in the mirror. Avoid the booth like the pest, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
