Here is an interesting little movie that gives the phrase "low budget" a terrible name. Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization". Students are hopelessly killed by false coincidences of submarine sandwiches and school supplies. Sounds like a resurrection of classic B-films from the fifties, right? Nope! It's not an example of a high camp fun, it's gone, away from the point. A glamorous showcase of breasts and dimples has our desire for pleasure, which is to counter the terror that 99.44% more in the first place has to resist. Bottom-of-the-bar entertainment at its best, supported by pennies of red blood and dead student bodies. Horrific movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who has a Masters in Film Production! It's an automatic "F", so rest easy!
