It was disgusting and painful. What a waste of a throw! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed twice in 90 minutes. It's not a lie. Don't even rent it out. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was just too mean to be credible. <br /> <br /> Cusack was OK. Just OK. I was sorry for him (the actor) as people remember this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as she always is. Charming and sweet, but with no purpose. The "romance" with John was absolutely incredible.
