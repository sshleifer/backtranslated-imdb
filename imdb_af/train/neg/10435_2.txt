With these people fucking so many shots, using old footage and gas animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a played set with actors, what to believe? Old film from countries is nice, but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films. I know, racism is good in these old movies, but there's more to losing this couple's credibility. They never flew their planes, they never flew their planes, Martin Johnson was an ex-vaudevillian, used friends like Jack London to win money while he wrestled with royalties, denying his wife's apparent depression and used her as a cute prop. unbearable. They were by no means the first to travel to these countries, or the first to write about them. He was OK as a filmmaker and photographer, but it's about it.
