The thing that stands out in my mind (unfortunately) is the launch, where John Berlin (Andy Garcia) drives into town. You see his Mercedes go on a winding road through a forest that looks like it is loaded with Redwood trees. It's pretty pretty. <br /> <br /> What Andy Garcia plays a character with Berlin's surname is good ... Andy is only Spanish / Latin because it's wise. Perhaps a Caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that if you put him in a town of farm people and booths, he looks like a sore thumb, especially with his accent flashing when he gets angry. Yes, I know, big deal right? He is still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title relates to a series of killers calling his victims Jennifer. All the victims are blind and he met them. The murderer took a boost but suddenly revived when a blind witness (not asking) appeared, Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman does a good job of playing a blind person to my surprise. When I see Lance Henriksen play Sgt. Freddy Ross, I was worried. Henriksen played in some strange films, especially late. I can't forget him in the pumpkinhead, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> Berlin movies to a small town of L.A. as a detective. He started investigating the Jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local dump. His luster in the discovery of one of the victims was blind, was far-fetched. So the irony of * SPOILER * Freddy's murder, with the recording and name agreements. I became very confused about the logic of how eight "Jennifers" became. And the killer's motive simply didn't pack a punch. In retrospect, this movie is probably more lifelike to expose an unsuspecting individual to murderousness, simply because they have become a little wacko over time, or maybe they're born looney toons. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich does a wonderful job in his interrogation of Garcia! Although no cop will legally be allowed to push someone who is so hard and eggs without knocking straight. In the end, it's a bit of a surprise, but is highly arguable, much like Sgt. Ross's murder. The killer chooses to go to his current victim and rather chooses to think. <br /> <br /> There are so many opportunities he has to kill her that it's ridiculous. I won't ruin the end because it's a good surprise despite being innocent. Then you will probably say, as I did, "she was happy!" 10/04
