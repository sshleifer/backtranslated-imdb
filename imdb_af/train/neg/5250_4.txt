I absolutely love the book written by Robin Klein. So I was very excited when I heard that a movie based on the book was going on. <br /> <br /> But I was very disappointed with the movie when I saw it because it didn't catch what I loved from the book - the absolutely ridiculous funny Erica and the interesting way she saw the world. <br /> <br /> From the start, I realized things were wrong It's not the same as I thought in the book. So, I just went along for the ride. It wasn't that bad, I think. Miss Belmont was completely different from what I thought she was! I didn't think she'd be one to smoke and drink. Jean Kittson, who plays her, is hilarious! <br /> <br /> On its own, I thought the movie and it's actors / actresses in it have a good job, but unfortunately, I'm such a fan of the book (one of my favorite books of all time ) I couldn't help but disappointed = P
