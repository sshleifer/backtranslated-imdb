It says that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this "movie". No wonder she has no other credits for her name for writing or directing. She made a serious career mistake to choose it as her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The fundamental thing wrong with this movie, besides its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four poor thugs, is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC. <br /> <br /> ** After she left the mall, she was approached by four thugs as they surrounded her. Tell me, what woman will be aggressively a potential attacker while being surrounded and verbally insulted? I don't mean after an attack has started, because then it is quite normal for someone to fight back. But she moved that man and made it rise pretty much to the next level. No woman will do it unless she has 1) a weapon, 2) have the confidence to know that the backup is very close and so reasonably safe from the damage or 3) the attackers are so young and weak that she pretty sure she can take them. None of these that are applied in this situation, so she just acted like someone who asked to be raped or camped. And by the way, when the security guard approached, as soon as he came within the walking distance of Kim Basinger, why wouldn't she either run to him for help or shout immediately? <br /> <br /> ** When she runs away after the security guard is shot in the head, she drives into a deserted part of town and crashes. She had a good three-minute lead over the pursuers, instead of just walking in a diagonal direction behind the houses and climbing and moving fences, she got her Red Toolbox out and started under her hood. too tight. I understand she tried to repair her car, but she had to run. <br /> <br /> (I didn't even mean it's a chronological summary of the movie, because I'm making the people doing their reviews, but it just happens that every main series of this movie so blatantly that I should comment on that.) <br /> <br /> ** Why would she wear a hard, red toolbox as she tried to sneak away in the dark? When caught, one of the jokers demands that she open the tools. First, she resists, then it finally opens it. And remove a wrench. This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the total failure of dramatic effect, I have to break it down, it's one of the stupid scenes in the whole movie. When she was asked to open the box, she was resisting the first time as if it were her plan to get some of the evildoers to open it out of anger after she did. opened, just as someone in an action movie could have had a device that an enemy requires the person to touch / push / open / manipulate, and as soon as the hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs the device , just to give that device automatic chemicals / to shoot it in the face. He was unconscious, what was the hero's plan long ago. It feels like they've tried Kim Basinger here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a SCREEN and sends one of the crooks away, and somehow gets away with him and the other three thugs. <br /> ** During the rest of the movie, what you see is this suburban housewife, wiping in the bush while wearing her Red Toolbox. Various tools are used as weapons to kill her attacks. <br /> <br /> ** When she ran away, how did she eventually go back to where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they played the radio hard in tribute to the dead. Somehow, she crawled on them when I thought they were moving away from them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, this whole point of departure is so poor because the whole reason she's being pursued in the first place is because of the thugs' perspective, she was a witness of a murder that they had previously committed the security officer and they felt they had to kill her. How ridiculous. As one of the thugs even said, they could just leave town and return to the city they were driving to. No one saw her anyway, and she probably didn't get the badge. Even if these possibilities did not work in their favor, how about hell and someone coming to kill them, to improve your chances of getting away with the original murder?
