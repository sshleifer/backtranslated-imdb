I can't believe anyone likes this movie. I've seen very low-budget movies, but this one sucked absolutely. Low budget doesn't mean the movie should be demented. Horror doesn't mean the movie should be demented. There was nothing scary about this movie. It was just a gore-fest, and a particularly disturbing one about it. The acting was average, as they were all unheard of actors, but the story was pathetic. The dialogue was pathetic. The movie is trying to come down as "artistic" or something. It's not one of the really big movies that only cost thousands of dollars to make, but it's done incredibly well. It was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely ill people to post their perverse obsessions on film. Other reviews here also said that the soundtrack sucked ... that's because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the authors of the movie. There were no loose qualities for this movie. A complete waste of my time and money.
