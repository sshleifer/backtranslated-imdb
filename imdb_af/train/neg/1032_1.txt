While I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (because of its terrible production values), it looks like Shakespeare compared to this stack of crap brought by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children (including the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Ribbon worm). What a shining idea it was to create a kind of short mutant dog and allow it to talk and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with it?! Whoever deserves this must leave or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the puppy is just unsuitable, irritating and nervous, and it's just in the BETTER episodes !! After many years it would have been better to just end the franchise than to create this mess! I can see why in the live action Scooby-Doo movie they made the villain Scrappy-Doo - since almost everyone hates him!
