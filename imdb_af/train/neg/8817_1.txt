No, I've never seen the "Santa Slasher" series, that is, "Silent Night, Deadly Night", the original "Black Christmas" or this one, "Christmas Evil." I've heard of their reputation, or, MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.) I thought I'd rent this one, as I heard it, and appear as a reference to a "Fat Guys At the Movies" segment . /> <br /> Mothers should be this, but not for the ooooohhhh "killer" Santa, but the fact is that this movie was just a shit. Drilling, long? even at just 92 minutes, shit. <br /> <br /> Little boy sees Santa coming down a chimney in 1947, delivering gifts, eating nicely and wonderfully, floating up the chimney. Son goes to sleep, but returns to the lounge to see Mom and Christmas (tackle). Apparently, it messed up the child for the rest of his life, although the scene was about as steamy as Ralphie's father had the "Leg Lamp" in a Christmas story. He was so disturbed, he went to the attic and cut his own hand. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! Now it's 1980 and a gift maker works in a toy factory. We get a bit of a little off him, and he bumps both kids and parents. Who's naughty, who's beautiful, blah blah. Does it take a good two-thirds of the movie to get him to finally catch up? as if it was not a frame one frame. NO MOVIE should take so long. <br /> <br /> I will admit this movie has built its tensions, but just because I expected it to do something to anyone. When he finally does, punish, "who's naughty," it's as graphical as a "garbage dump kid" card. And I didn't mention the WTF end. I think it was a metaphor, but in reality, it's just as strange as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who is upset that kills his brother and sister, and his solution is? Uh, murder.) Don't open this mess, even on Christmas or Evil. Again, I didn't watch the other "Santa Slashers", but this one sucked badly. It built up tension due to the nature of the movie and never delivered one decent gift.
