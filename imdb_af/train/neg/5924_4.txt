Princess Muldaur appears for the second time on Star Trek, but this time as a different character. No one seems to be on board - maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she's not the god of the god (see the previous episode), but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enables her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the man who falls in love with her, a few cards short of a full deck, and tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who stays strange in a small crate - it's a difficult way to travel). And unfortunately, Muldayr doesn't get so well wounded. What happens next is a kind of dumb and by the time the episode was the first I saw, I was pretty relieved. Watching all the men on board, going over Muldaur, was pretty stupid and the play of Spock when he was crazy, was pretty champion. Do yourself a favor - if you haven't seen the show yet, choose another episode.
