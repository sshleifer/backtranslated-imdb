Ritchie's first two films were funny, stylish entertainment. Here, he recommends two recent classics? 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Fight Club' ?? and still get out of hand. <br /> <br /> Despite worsening him as a mystery (with the sub-'Usual Suspects' twaddle, he was the biggest thing he ever pulled, convinced that he was you or what it was) Whatever was ...) and trying to turn a "Fight Club" into what characters really are and what internal manifestations are, the movie struggles to keep interest in its second half. By the last third, you know you are leading a blind alley, and slowly slowing down. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages, chess and game theory are all big subjects, but Ritchie digs them up superficially and repeatedly to use much of the material. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) vigilant is Ritchie's brave way with a scene and Maurice-Jones' dynamic camera. If Ritchie had nailed a more satisfactory plot, and focused on tighter editing, there was no reason why he couldn't make another nice gangster captain. <br /> <br /> As it is, Revolver is a waste of your time. Incomprehension is not equal to depth. If you want to see a good movie, which doesn't make sense, but is a virtue of it (and unfortunately, which also includes an inexplicable escape from lonely childbirth) see 'Lost Highway'.
