I saw this movie two weeks ago at the festival of modern images du Japon in Paris. Although I didn't expect much from it, I must say I'm disappointed as many people in the audience ... if I want to summarize how I felt, I would say I compared it to Princess Mononok and Nausicaa from the beginning to the end . Of course it's stupid. But I couldn't help it. The stories are very different, but the worlds shown are very similar. And from this point of view, palm trees certainly can't do the comparison with Miyazaki's masterpieces. Even if it's technically quite good, boredom remains. In the end, the complete lack of originality recommends that you don't mind seeing it. I got it 2 out of 10 (a bit hard, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
