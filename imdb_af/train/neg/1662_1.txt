This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It makes your walk from the mill TV movie look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on a book by one and only Britney Spears and her mother, it's a rubbish bin with nothing that Virginia Madsen's reasonable performance (I hope you paid well) to save it. The story of a red neck gutter who wins a scholarship in a prestigious music school is few, but a vehicle to pedal, Ms Spears, pants music to the consumer and generally agrees that low appearance makes the road must be. There is nothing good going on here, with all the beats as predictable as the night the next day. Never again.
