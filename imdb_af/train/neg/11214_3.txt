I also saw this film a local screen a year ago. First, I'm going to say that it looks good. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic movie maker. I just wish the movie was as good as it looks. I won't call it a horror movie. Setting a few shots of a dilapidated ghost doesn't make it a horror movie. There is no secret, there is no tension, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what the whole movie is doing on both sides. The acting was okay, but it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the tagline, "Revenge can be deadly" .... really? ... they have to make sure how many hundreds of horror / thriller movies have exactly the same lines? <br /> <br /> It hurts me to say this, but I know a lot of the people who worked on this movie and I know they don't want people to smoke blowing their ass, so I give my honest opinion.
