A female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood. She has an assistant who doesn't want to be a vampire, so he has to do what she orders or changes into a blood sugar. After a few kills, the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? That his pacing is too slow, that it has some strange sound effects (never a bite sounds so strange) and atmosphere (new jazz here I come in) and the lights don't look included on the set. It looks like an "author" horror movie with all the self-care inside. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite stupid and, as you can guess, it is the female vampire who explains how to kill her, even if she doesn't. of course, crosses, lights, garlic and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> It's not even a funny loop movie. Maybe with a few friends and lots of beer, it can't have its funny sides (to be honest, it's funny in 10-15 minutes near the end of the movie). Don't be fooled by the Troma sticker, it's one of the bad movies they offer.
