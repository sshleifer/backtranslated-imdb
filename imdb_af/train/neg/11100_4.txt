Loved the original story, had very high expectations for the movie (especially since Barker was interviewed about it), it finally saw and what can I say? It was a total MESS! Directing all over the place, the acting was horrible, the flashy visual and choreography was just flat, empty and completely unnecessary (what are the common music video techniques like the fast forward?) It was stylishly yes, but not necessary in this movie not and made the atmosphere cheap in a dumb MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo music video). While some of the shots were pretty cool and brutal, some were just ridiculously laughing (the first death on the Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Raimi's death was just stupidly funny). It just hurts over the place with zero voltage and tension, completely away from the original story, and then goes back into the final that only feels touched to waste it even more. No explanations were given. I mean, I knew what had just happened, as I would read the story, but for people who didn't, it was even more confusing as sometimes, even I didn't know where it was going and what it was trying to do. to do - it was on a bad tangent all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I wanted to keep this movie, because I'm a big fan of Barker's work and loved the story as it has enormous potential. for a cracking movie, the hell I even enjoyed from Kitamura's movies as fun romps, but this movie only spoke of amateurism and sotiness from start to finish. I didn't care about anyone or anything, the whole thing was rushed and severely cut off from the real source, changing it into something else entirely. Granted it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a wonderful badass, but everything was all over the place, more than disappointing. burned
