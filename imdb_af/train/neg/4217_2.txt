It was recently on AMC's live movie classic and I had to laugh. I had high expectations for this adventure that follows in the year of "Voyage to the Earth's Core" and "Mysterious Island". I was very disappointed not only in the acting credentials, but in the foolish story line read from a five-year-old comic book. Make sure the wires attached to the Pterdactyl's wings see when they understand a half-idiot-modern man who is befriended by the lost adventurers. The end left it open for further repetition of the same effects in "People that Time Forgot". Don't waste your time.
