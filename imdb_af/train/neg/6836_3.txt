Please, even if you are in the worst of the showers, you should not watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> I don't think there's anything right about this movie. On the recommendation of a friend I watched it and I literally threw 1h and 48 min of my life in the cupboard. Poor performance, stupid direction, poor storyline and pathetic action series - and if you mix it together, you get 'Double Impact'. Even the least of the expectations was not met. <br /> <br /> I think I've learned one thing - Never watch Van Damme action movie. They are pure waste of time!
