What a shame that Alan Clarke should be associated with these trips. However, it does not matter; Gather a group of boys and a few Stellas and have a whale of a time running this one and walking around on the floor again in tears of laughter. Great mess night things. All Hunter houses in a well-publicized late 80's theme - those hooligans were well organized and not really interested in the football itself - often with respected work (real estate agent ???). But how can Clarke convince us that any of the two-bit actors who come from other low-quality TV productions (Grange Hill) or are soon going to a poor quality drama (Eastenders) can believe us for a nanosecond that their tough football is throbbing is laughing. Are we really convinced that the ICF (of course the drama based) will ever go to another town to fight with just six blocks? <br /> <br /> The ICF would launch tube stations and similar people with HUNDREDS. Andy Nicholls' Scally needs to be read before even considering a story of this nature. The acting is terrible and offers the most of laughter. Oldman is such a camp, it's incredible. Most of them seem to be in a bubble of Mr. Matey must be. A true inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a movie.
