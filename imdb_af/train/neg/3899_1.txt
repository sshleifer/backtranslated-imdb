Where do I start? By the title of this movie, I expected some authenticity, in the end I was lowered separately. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, rather it is a Hollywood story (or choose your movie-making hub), which is loosely based on some real characters. I had to have an idea when I heard a heavy English accent giving the film in German; the crimson text (title, artists) had been the 2nd idea. The story line was confronted (Lale was not kidnapped from Switzerland. Rolf Liebermann's parents had no information. Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany. The original song was recorded outside the control of the NS regime, not below control, the record played at the station was picked up in Vienna while a Lt was on leave, etc.). The costumes are poor and wrong for the timeframes (SS black uniforms use every place of border guards to staff positions, it has gone from daily use as soon as the war begins, etc.), the characters are stereo types (SA bulls in a club once they were essentially out of order. Don't waste your time.
