1993 was the year. It was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas won an Oscar. Who knew I would be an extra in a movie with him? I was actually a paid extra in "My Boyfriend's Back," shot in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thank you, the producers have a change of heart!) I was in the theater scene. I rushed to see the movie the day it was released in the theaters. It's more of a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you might want to look it up. Nothing even close to "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead" quality, but the cheese factor is good enough. goodbye
