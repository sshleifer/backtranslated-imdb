Following the success of the (terrible) Gilligan's Island TV movie reruns, a number of TV movies were made in the 1980s reunification of casts of classic shows. Most of these movies have completely missed the boat, as it recovers the humor that made the performances so special. THE REVENGE MOSTS is one of the most disappointing, as it is for a Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style that wasn't really in the original range. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedian and essential to the series, has been completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any 30 minute episode. And since the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and recreating them? With very little rewriting they could use Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although some of the Munsters haunting family members were a fine touch, I didn't enjoy Sid Caesar as the hammy mad scientist, especially because there is too much of him and not enough of the under-used Munsters (ironically, the year 1981). , Caesar's old friend In the comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriate cast into a major role in a TV movie reunion return of the Beverly HILLBILLIES). Another odd inexplicable piece at the beginning of the film represented the Munster family as wash figures at a local horror wash museum. Why would they be there if they were supposed to be a "typical" (strange) American family, not familiar monsters? It was the last Munsters project with the original role in their roles. There was a terrible revival of the series in the late 1980s with a completely new movie and a television movie of 1990 that DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick had in coming roles. a family dining room.
