I totally agree with the review by a Variety reviewer that the film is never so funny, alive or informative about the creative process as it seems to be. Narrative is messy and the lighting is really problematic. If the film is supposed to be character-driven, the poor lighting does not improve the acting and sometimes it is difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will struggle to follow the spoken English in the movie and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. Last year I watched the film at the Cape World Cinema Festival. Commentary and reactions to the film ranged from unshakable and untidy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110-year history. Not surprisingly, the movie disappeared just two weeks after its release from the Cape Town theater and most of the theaters in Durban and Gauteng. This clearly restricted appeal between South African audiences.
