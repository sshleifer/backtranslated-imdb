A memorable line of short life. After the episode where the line was launched, my fraternity intramural flag team started using the line to break our huddles on violation. Instead of Klaar / Breek, our quarter said FOOTBALL and the rest of the team responded YOUR BET! A fun way to break the huddle that our rivals had to scratch their heads like very few of them looked at the show. Using this line, I have added a unique element to our season that I will never forget. We had the best season during my college time that year and to a small extent it was due to the fun we used with this line. The show was quite a stinker, but it remains in the memories of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi intramural flag soccer team at West Virginia Tech.
