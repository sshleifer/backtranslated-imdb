If you've ever seen this movie, you'll know it! If you don't, and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you watch this movie because it is right at the worst. So, if you're really bored, go rent it. If you want to know how it is, here's my summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant ship with some me universe models and five other people. Adam doesn't like how one passenger gets all the kids, and he tries to take on the cute jokes. BUT WAIT! It just gets worse! You have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
