I'll keep it short, as a movie like this doesn't earn a full review. <br /> <br /> Given the environment, this movie could have been something really special. It could be another "28 days later" or even a "Blair Witch Project" <br /> <br /> The first 20 or so minutes of the movie I was very excited. Directer did a decent job with cinematography and excitement, though I don't think he managed to catch true honesty from an empty London Underground. <br /> <br /> Characters were a great deviation. Our "heroine" in this movie is a worthless piece of shit, and you really don't care whether she dies or not. As many people have said before, I waited for the homeless and the black man who managed to give me a crook or two (whether the authors are planning or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain is being held in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when he was revealed, I was very disappointed. I won't spoil it, but can only say my 10-year-old sister can surely defeat him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just another mediocre horror movie that falls in the fall for a simple Hollywood formula. This film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the point. <br /> <br /> Just to emphasize how paralyzed this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE times to download and kill the main villain. . IN THE BEGINNING they go away.
