I know movies aren't necessarily supposed to reflect reality, but this one came to my nerves. It maintains ignorant stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. The "psycho mom" thing has already been done too often (and usually done better) and much of the rest of the plot is also far-fetched. The acting was not terrible, but nothing to frighten. <br /> <br /> One highlight: I am a long-time fan of General Hospital and it was a journey to see one of the roles played earlier by GH, Jon Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you can meditate on the bad psychoanalytic part of it, a person should likewise suspend reality / judgment if you watch a lot of movies, then this movie may be acceptable. If you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I spent my time watching it.
