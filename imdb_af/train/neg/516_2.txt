Have you ever noticed how in his later movies, Burt Reynolds' laughter sounds like screaming brakes? <br /> <br /> Must be too exhausted with Hal Needham. <br /> <br /> And from the look of "Stroker Ace", WAY too much. <br /> <br /> Can you believe it was based on a book? I can't either, but it was. And probably not a bestseller, I'll bet. <br /> <br /> Burt's another good old boy in the NASCAR track hooking up with Beatty as a fried chicken magnet with designs on his team. Anderson gives what love interest is there and Nabors impresses most of his Gomer Arrows as loyal mechanic / best friend Lugs. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends of Burt's or Hal's. Others need the job. And even real NASCAR drivers enter the act and look more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /> <br /> As far as it goes, Bubba Smith (front "Police Academy") gets them as Beatty's driver. And Petersen, in full Elvira mode, gets many valuable teachings as a lady who really wants to get to know Lugs. VERY MUCH. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Burt threw away so much time and effort into a movie like "Stroker Ace", where it didn't matter whether he had saved to act or not. They didn't bother to write a character for him, why save it to do? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly for Petersen, and for the outreaches at the end. Now they are funny.
