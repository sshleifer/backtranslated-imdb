This movie is bad news and I'm really surprised at the level of great name talent that would ever appear in such a mess. I think there were some strangled agents scattered across Hollywood Blvd. because of this fiasco. What really gets you is that it could have been good. The directors star appeal and the topic was enough feed to spark interest and ticket sales, but it is a flop. The multiple story lines all go from bad to stupid through the photos, and you end up like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that seems to be rotten. What Spike is capable of achieving is revenge against any Italians who could defeat him when he was or was insulting a child, as the film is quite a number of outdated and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee movie, there are some very challenging and magical camera work. He has the gift to grab your psyche and transport you in his vision if it's just for some memorable scenes. But the question remains ... can you endure the other 2 hours of scratch and watch while you're wondering and waiting for the end to be somewhere there.
