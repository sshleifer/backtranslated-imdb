Seriously, why do American and Free actors pretending to need Czech to speak perfect English with a fake Russian accent? I'm a man, so I enjoyed the enjoyable nudity - but a gentle porn movie would have more of it, and would at least not pretend it was artistic. <br /> <br /> All the political statements where painfully didactic- Did the director of subtlety hear? The play was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never funny. The characters were very shallow, and I couldn't identify them at all. <br /> <br /> The little thing I laughed at was when they cut the actors in the archives of the demonstrations in Prague - and they were black and white and then sepia to adjust the footage, just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of Kundera's short stories (not the unbearability of existence) and there are good things about his writing style (though his themes are one big male fantasy) - and I have to say , the movie did NOT convey any of the goodness of Cunderas style.
