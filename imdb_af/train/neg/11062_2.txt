Away to bait! You just made a cold, roughly interesting story of a necrophilic cannibal in a gentle, mellow drama. Clearly, a movie called Dahmer is one of two types: Horror, or Documentary Law? It wasn't. It wasn't close to any detailed facts (it actually had virtually no dust). It wasn't really morbid or scary, or it didn't even try to be very disturbing. (As if you had to try !!) What the hell was this writer / director thinking? Here's one of the most real-life examples of sick serial killers ever and we're being shot down, poorly behaved gay bar roofie rapes and long-haired flashbacks after only time in his old parent's home. I think Jacobson actually tried (or invented) the soft side of j.Dahmer.
