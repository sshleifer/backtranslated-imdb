This film relates to alleged non-settling types (aesthetic and sexual) that apparently cannot withstand basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players participate, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are based on a puerile script that relies almost entirely on a smart dialogue. what not. Nixon's role has the best lines, but she often cries too quickly, a timing that has to be anointed by the director. The grotesque climax uses every available cliche, spends or not, and applies this killing effort to comedy.
