Well, the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a preview, otherwise I would never have seen this terrible teenage treasure. I mean, haven't we had enough of this yet? Scream and Scary Movie at least didn't take them seriously! The plot sucks, and the acting is the worst I have seen. (Just Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie competing for the worst I've seen in theater with this one.) <br /> <br /> There are so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike, that you didn't even kill now and who didn't. (and you don't mind.) The only one I knew before was Denise, and she was the most talented lesser actress I've ever seen in this bad movie for a movie. Stay as far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)
