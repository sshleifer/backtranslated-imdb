"White Noise" has the potential to be one of the most talked-about movies since the "Exorcist" I think. To see if EPP is probably true, it really had an easy transition to be a dreaded real fact. Not many movies come together that really put fear in the minds of people. As I said, this movie can have, but doesn't. The film lowered him to a low-class PG-13 terrifying movie. Nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense". Someone really just has to act in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that doesn't just make us think, but it lets us jump, scream, whatever a horror movie should do. I'm honestly sick of the PG-13 Horror genre, because it becomes a genre of its own. We need the old days, the blood and gore days, the Freddy Kruger, the Jason, The Mike Myers days. Few movies can make a thought of this mentality, not so frightening. So why try to pull it off? A few good jumps in this movie are nothing but one of the stupidest ends in movie history without any resolution ... don't waste your money on this movie.
