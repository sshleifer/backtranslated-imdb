Sorry, but every time I see a movie in which a woman is struggling with a man and the man does nothing, but the film loses all credibility. So, the new (female) Starbuck immediately contaminated the plot before it even came off the ground (no pun intended). Dirk Benedictus was so much more likely than the sensitive hero type as the new Kattee Sackhoff - whose over-hearing is likely to be praised in future as "a compelling, exciting, must-see breakthrough performance" by today's politically correct new-talk copy editors; but in essence it's just a tired, old image of a woman with a slide on her shoulder that is as big as a townhouse: the biggest clich√© on screens today. I can still give this series a shot, but human caricature alone does not hold me. As James Hilton once pointed out, a story, please, just give me a story. '
