I wanted to keep this movie, yes it is a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff, but I like those movies. Well done, it had all the ingredients to be a good, not brilliant but good movie .... unfortunately the ingredients went down! The acting was terrible, and it was seen for the first time when the prisoners were introduced to their prisoner one by one (the caps were taken off), the comments and one liners were just terrible, yes I know, write badly .... It's more than that it was bad writing along with bad acting. Two of the inmates were in a relationship with one another and have not even acknowledged it, to much more in the movie ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I even wonder why I was bothering it not at all. <br /> <br /> I will end up with PLOTHULLE, PLOTHULES AND MORE PLOTHULES! Disappointing!
