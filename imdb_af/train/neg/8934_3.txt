I bought this DVD without any previous reference, but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on his cover. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to watch and expect to see a funny comedy, maybe like 'Switch'. However, the non-sense story is terrible and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is being submitted to an operation to change his gender in Copenhagen. He goes back to Hollywood and tells that she is Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claims half of his uncle Buck Loner's (John Huston) property. Over the days, Myra and her alter-ego Myron damage a young couple in her uncle's academy with kinky sex. At a certain moment, the messy script is so confused that I believe the whole story was just a thought-out journey from Myron caused by the accident. Unfortunately, the beauty of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett is not enough to keep this movie. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man & Woman Up to a Point")
