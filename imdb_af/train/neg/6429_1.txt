Personally, I would recommend people to stay away from this movie. It's generally a drill to watch and the battle is poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD edition of this movie, the Bey Logan audio note is worth listening to. <br /> <br /> But anyway, since when ever there was a Ninja movie worth watching. I can't think of one and honestly don't want to. <br /> <br /> Overall, when it comes to movies, I have one golden rule: Avoid any movies that contain the word "Ninja".
