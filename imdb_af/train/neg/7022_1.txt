In over 70 years of movies, this has to be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others made some very bad comedies, but this is the absolute bottom of the run. <br /> <br /> It is indecent from the start to the play during the credits. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, what I normally want, needed her salary. She desperately needs to learn her craft. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I don't know who he is) needs a better director to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Also, Liv Tyler is not in her role. <br /> <br /> Mike White has yet to find a character, he has done the same kind of person a few times too much. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard who <br /> <br /> There has been no more than a first-rate actor, but not as good as he was. <br /> <br /> There is nothing decent I can say about this film comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
