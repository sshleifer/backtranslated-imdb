No need to rent this movie. Of the opening credits, I knew I was in trouble. <br /> <br /> It was filmed as if it were a soft porn movie, but there really is nothing erotic about it. Looking at the world of sex addiction is intriguing, but only to a point. Drilling sex scenes, bad plot, and comos by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette is not enough to save this movie. .
