A well-compiled entry into the serial killer genre that unfortunately is dismissed in its own pretentiousness to be really satisfying. Willem Dafoe is wonderful as a NYC detective trying to track down what appears to be a copycat with the same Renaissance artificial murder techniques used in a series of murders he had solved years ago. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's junior partner and they have pretty good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters appear to link the two cases together. Clea Duval is the friend of an earlier victim and Peter Stormare is a kind of broker / mentor for Dafoe. It's a bit difficult to take, though, of course, Stormare is never boring. The film's end is particularly disappointing. Quickly look for Deborah Harry as Dafa's less-than-neighbor neighbor.
