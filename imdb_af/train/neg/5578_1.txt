Even if you could pass the notion that these boring characters had personally seen every important moment of the 1960s (okay, Katie didn't join the Manson family, and nobody died at Altamont). This movie was still incredibly terrible. I got the impression that the authors locked themselves in a room and watched "Forrest Gump", The Wonder Years and Oliver Stone's 60's over and over. A Canadian television critic called the closure of the first episode "head spin". He was right.
