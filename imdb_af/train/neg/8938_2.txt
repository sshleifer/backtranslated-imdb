I still can't believe how bad this movie was. If I wasn't a masso, I don't know if I would have survived the show. It seems to cost about $ 1000, but it wasn't the money they brought. The acting was terrible - not only bad, 3rd graders could have read the lines better. Secondly, the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin, and it is much lacking in this movie. We don't even get the more attractive chicas in the buff. <br /> <br /> Agh, better luck, next time, eh?
