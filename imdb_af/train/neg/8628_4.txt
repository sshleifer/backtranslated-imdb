My 7-year-old daughter loved it, because Disney executives had calculated improperly that she would. This is the problem with "Air Buddies." It is a strictly-numbered children's movie filled with carefully calculated cynicism, some politically correct morals, and enough potjie humor to avoid the dreaded G rating. As a parent, or even a 10-year-old, you've seen it before and done better. Think "101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone" and you get the general idea. I believe that a good children's story is a good story. "Air Buddies", which is about as original as recycled paper, fails to meet that standard. It's not the worst video your child can watch, but there are megatones of better kids.
