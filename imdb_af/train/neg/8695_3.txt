Elizabeth Rohm was the worst actress of all the ADA's of law and order and her acting is even worse here. Her efforts on a Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic. Also, she cannot adequately address the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child. at times while her daughter is missing, she just runs vaguely irritated, as if she can't remember where she left her keys. <br /> <br /> This is an important true story, so it's too bad that the terribly acting actress has so much off the message. The rest of the actors are talented enough, but they just can't dominate Rohm's inclination to merely lay a heavy dummy of a southern draw when real acting is needed.
