I was very dissatisfied with this move. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy was inhumane, the action exaggerated, the songs unmistakable. Even the storyline was weightless. From a writer who wrote successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations. The actors worked way too hard and didn't help the movie at all. Of course, Kareena smelled the screen in a bikini, but for two seconds. I think Hindi stunt directors should investigate how action flags are done. They tend to overdo it too much. In Chinese films, this style works because it's their signature piece. But, Hindi's signature is the song. A good action movie should not last longer than two hours and may not seem unrealistic. But in the future I am sure these action films will be much sharper. Also noted: Comedy and action movies do not mix unless done properly. Good Luck next time.
