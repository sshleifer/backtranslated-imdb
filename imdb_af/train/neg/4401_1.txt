We went to the movie with the group because the play will cancel us. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever. It's not that I don't like culture movies I do. But nothing happens in the movie. One doesn't feel any connection with the characters whatsoever. endless times without dialogue. And the car. How do you wear a big tent and beds and clothes every day? It's a two seat! However, I have to say the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director had to make a photo of the movie so we could spend about 80 minutes of useless time, with nothing happening anyway. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend it because it's a waste of your time
