Ok, I wrote a scathing review b / c the movie is terrible. While waiting for another review (for Derrida) for me, I decided to watch old reviews of this horrible movie. View all the positive reviews. They EVERYTHING, I SAY ALL, come from contributors not yet rated any other movie except this one. Crimminy! and wait for you to review the "rosebud". <br /> <br /> Checkout reviews the other movies rosebud and has glowing recommendations. Oh, shoot !, They seem to be the only other movies by the two authors and directors. Holy Window Wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as writers, and Tony, you can't figure out a bad script. No job opportunities for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CONTACT POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOWEST HAPPY MOVIE!
