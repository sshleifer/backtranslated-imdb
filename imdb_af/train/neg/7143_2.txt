This movie has some of the most beautiful cars I've ever seen in a movie, and definitely the hottest women, but I have to say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot, and if you read it with a bit of bend, you also have the acting. Start, bring characters, hot female singing (obvious lip sync). Music agent or producer comes in, thinks she is wonderful, asks her to race. She turns off, too many bad memories. Flash after the war hero, back from the war, has several battles, and becomes film hero with the attitude that he is better than everyone. Drive down a fast exotic car. Brother breeds, then die. Hero to avenge death, cut away to get a friend's arms. (You have never seen this friend before or after, but looks really caring for him.) Are you sure you want to do that; Yes, I mean you are really sure; Yes, give me weapons; are you really sure; Yes, OK, I think I can't pronounce you out of it, be careful man, I love you. <br /> <br /> Now he's going to blow up his uncle's house that owns the car driving his brother. Find wife, decide to save her. She drove away, and he didn't kill his uncle. Now there will be a race to complete the movie. Oh yeah, you have to throw in another scene with bad people coming in to beat people who don't really matter, but maybe it adds a little plot. Race is not even exciting, it ends up with two racing cars, and one that has to win throws in a surprise. <br /> <br /> OK, I just saved you $ 7.00. You can send all your money to me, because I had to give you the same amount of pleasure as this movie does. Don't get me wrong, the cars are great, and Nadija is beautiful, but it's really a horrible movie.
