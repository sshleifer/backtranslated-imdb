What looks like a good condition for a movie ... unfortunately it fails to deliver at almost every level. Very difficult to follow at the start of the movie, I actually found that the desire to turn off the biggest problem of a visual aspect was the fact that the camera was simply over the top, with so much "arty" splicing and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the film that actually divert you from the general story. It really tries too hard to suppress and build you to an exciting end, but the movie has so many semi-conscious characters and non-relevant writing. It just makes you feel disappointed and confused why they tried so deeply.
