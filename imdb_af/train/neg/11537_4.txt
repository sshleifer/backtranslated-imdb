I've been following the movie of these films for quite some time, so maybe I was expecting too much. I see both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer as well as they do, and were interested to see what Dan Reed could do, but unfortunately it just didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that the movie does not really seem to understand what genre it is, and as such it fails to impress on drama, horror and thriller elements because rather than on Focusing on one and doing it well is a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none. <br /> <br /> The point of departure (as with most revenge films) is simple, few meet and go out, something bad happens and they get their revenge. It's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled over the years. Unfortunately, in this case, Dan Reed thought, "It would be great to do one of those revenge movies that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and in their spiritual state. to deepen more detail ... "Wrong! There are also some key elements missing, in this type of movie there is generally a kind of warning. A does not do it or it can happen an element that adds tension, but here is nothing of the kind. It just happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends. <br /> <br /> There is really really fierce competition in this genre and Dan Reed's hats to try, I have no problem with his governmental ability but in terms of writing ... I'll next say he Must stick to the formula for the type of film he makes instead of being too smart and he will have a quality movie on his hands.
