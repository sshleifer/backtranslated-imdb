The movie shooting scenes of a scenic cruise. <br /> <br /> Remember none of this movie, except for Michael Pataki who spends the extreme pain as JC in "Five the Hard Way". He is the very annoying sheriff I did when practicing a nocturnal rod on our rabid doctor. Probably the most laugh you will have is with dr. Beck's epileptic seizures from nowhere. Can mrs. Beck be more wood? Seriously, if you took a 4 foot roof and pasted it into a whirlpool, you wouldn't be able to see a difference. The horror and tension look at the clock and wonder how the credits will roll. <br /> <br /> Watch it as a late-night movie, MSTified, but don't get out of your way.
