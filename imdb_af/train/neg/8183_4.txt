It's a pretty velvet piece about WW II codes that were broken, stolen, etc. The acting is about what I expected of these role-players from MGM-B actors. <br /> <br /> Great caution. Jean Rogers, who did such a good job in the first two Flash Gordon series to play the very sexy Dale Arden, is just awful in this movie. Her character is extremely irritating. She never left with her overwork. We should believe that at the height of a World War that would be a Top Secret Code, she would be allowed to choose just in and out of her office, although she has no official function. From this point of view, I'm sorry I ever watched this movie. It has my perception of me. Rogers forever changed. Talentwise, she's an extremely lightweight. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is his usual self, which means he's just enough. <br /> <br />
