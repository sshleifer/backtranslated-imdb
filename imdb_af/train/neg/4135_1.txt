This movie was so bad that I had to make the most of the good bits. Hah what good bits? The only part worth mentioning was the end (those who watched the movie will know what I mean). I expected a lot from this movie, as a sub-world met the day of death, met Freddy vs Jason, but what I got was this crap. Story was forgotten, the throw was badly used and what did the director think when he made it. It could have been a great thing, but I seem to have been the most boring movie I've ever watched. OK, so, if there was a nice bit of T and A, I was gore and I was very disappointed. Don't expect a movie to go well, but if you want a bad, horrible horror, you have to see it and see how a horror movie shouldn't be done.
