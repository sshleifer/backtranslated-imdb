Flat characters you don't do and will never mind. Cringe-inducing dialogue in place. No turning (they think they have one, but if you haven't found it after about 40 minutes, you're not too bright). Many good actors in roles and gigs that are happy for everyone involved will be forgotten once the final credits roll. <br /> <br /> I don't care for 'slow' movies, but they have to go. This one does not. <br /> <br /> The plot wasn't what made it a direct-to-DVD movie, it's just a reasonable excuse to try and drown a fake controversy. <br /> <br /> The as-of-writing 37 (!) ten (10) ratings need to be involved in production.
