WOW is all I can say if you read it, it is looked at or thought about. trust me, watch it! <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst play ever made is very funny! I can't believe they've overloaded the school signal! I had to play the scene over and over, just to laugh more and more every time. If a movie like this can be made, it gives us all hope of making our own movies. even the costume was bad. It seems as if my 7-year-old cousin could do a better job. hey i bet he also wrote and acted better. All I know is that I just have to watch the second part, so I can see if it was as bad as the first. It's a cool idea about a killer scarecrow, but a much better job could have been done. hopefully another killer comes scarecrow movie, not like this one.
