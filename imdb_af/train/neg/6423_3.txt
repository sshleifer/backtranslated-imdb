The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown ran my finger on the remote side, ready to flicker to see something else. The foreground of two authors, under their happiness, who were in a self-storage "bin", was generously amusing, but painfully soft. <br /> <br /> The launch of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - the big deal movie man who lives and sleeps in the park in a toilet, offered hope and I decided to add another. minutes to give. And then a few more to Kristy Swansons' introduction as an emerging film director and borderline nymphomania, added a little spice. Her solid acting performance has increased her presence beyond just a very welcome insight into eye-candy. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the clear low-budget impact on the movie has poor shooting tones, short cut and slapstick handling for certain moments. Some of my favorite movies of all time are low budget, Whithnail and I are one who also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but on their luck. <br /> <br /> But for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the archive "Terrible movie" and just about nudges it in the "may have been a cult movie" archive. I laughed aloud at some of Joe Pantoliano's characters. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the terribly cleaved, but still funny, rich-but-screwed character house, where the story unfolds after the final moments. <br /> <br /> I can see how Tinseltown has a wonderful play and while the filmmakers have done their best to translate it into celluloid, it simply didn't work and while listening aloud to some scenes and linen , I think the first 30 minutes plunged my senses and expectations so. I would have laughed for a degree. <br /> <br /> Unless you've been holding a coffee coaster, don't pick it up if you see it in a bargain.
