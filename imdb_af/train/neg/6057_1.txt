Can someone John John Carpenter continually destroy his reputation? How low can you go? This man seems to have lost self-respect. <br /> <br /> This episode seems to have been done by a film student, it's not even worth starting talking about what was bad, because it was just a drill party, directed by someone with no one talent as a movie maker or without any motivation. <br /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Carpenter, do not immediately retire with a rest of self-image and stop wasting it. in a bad tradition of Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Get drunk.
