It's probably the worst Christmas movie ever. The plot is virtually non-existent, the play (especially Affleck) is poor at best. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this movie, but they have to agree deeply. As far as I could gather, the plot consisting of Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman, is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and a list of things he wanted from his childhood forget, burn. In doing so, he ends the family currently living in the house to be his family for Christmas. And that's it. The film continues and eventually he gets with the daughter of the family .... blah blah blah.
