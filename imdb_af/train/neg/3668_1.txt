This movie is so bad you almost feel infected. In fact, there is a strong sense of relief when it's over, relief that you can put the cassette back in the rewinder and RUSH back to the video rental store before polluting the rest of your video collection. I was funny when we hired it to look like the kind of movie William Hurt would call his performance. I meant he wouldn't try very hard. But look, in a lot of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is actually on the phone! We realized this irony was the only pleasure we got from this confusing mess. The cinematography and editing are dark and dirty, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a very similar resemblance to Falling Down, but the film had an extremely disturbing story line, great writing and acting and an engaging soundtrack. "Infected Man" is just a kind of old European tourist trap, and look, it's like driving along an unfamiliar back road into an unknown country where you don't speak the language in a steady rain just after night. the windshield fails. You get the picture? Don't get this one.
