First, IFC runs City and Country, and now it. The difference between that stinker and this Pink Panther rip-off is that the town and the country were vigilant. It's not. <br /> <br /> I can only suspect that the governor has reported it so they can turn on someone else's dime in Europe. Belushi is particularly irritating. His play with Candy (doing a Z-degree Dom DeLuise) was torture. To speak of torture, five minutes from the talented Shepherd, and I bet the prisoners at Gitmo would crack like walnuts! <br /> <br /> The real "Crime" (apart from being green) is Shepherd's character: a mongoose woman who takes a Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy it, I have an ocean property in Arizona where you may be interested!
