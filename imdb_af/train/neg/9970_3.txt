People who really loved Problem Child (1990) should investigate their heads. Who will take the idea of ​​seeing a malicious boy, causing others to stroke and watch it funny? The movie is not funny, ever, in any way, begins to end. It wants to be a cartoon, but the authors do not realize that slapstick is not funny when people are attacked by bones or hit with baseball bats. The film's young hero is Junior (Michael Oliver), who has been placed at the foster parents' front doors since he was a baby. for adoption. The families reject him, because Junior tends to give them a hard time. <br /> <br /> He is then thrown into an orphanage, where he terrorizes the nuns, and writes penpals letters to the convicted Bow-Tie Killer Michael Richards). He will soon be adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Yasbeck), who die to have a child, just like any other parent in their area. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of the Healy household and 'Little' Ben has an interest in him, despite the fact that he destroys a camping tour by attracting a bear on the grounds or ' a cat at his father, Big Ben Jack Warden, a great politician. <br /> <br /> I think we're supposed to care for Junior so we can root for him when he gets revenge on people. His new mom, Flo, is a bitch, his grandfather is completely selfish, and a little girl who adopted the kids is such a spoil. <br /> <br /> But what does Junior do to get the last? laughing is not funny - it's mean, cruel and sometimes life-threatening. <br /> <br /> And what's the movie's message? That children have to solve problems with violence and vandalism? That their friendship should look for by writing to convicted murderers? They certainly do not have to be a bad child. Junior is not one - he is just a sadistic, small check. There was a time when it was bad for children to beat others. Now everyone laughs when Junior beats kids with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this movie was marketed as a "family comedy". What's worse is that Problem Child is PG. What did the MPAA think when they saw it? There are a lot of mockery and congregations here, wondering about the split between the PG and the PG-13. <br /> <br /> Children will enjoy it, but parents will be shocked at what is on display. And for most people, Problem Child will be considered a "guilty pleasure" class; a film that will be scamily acknowledged, even if the prevailing opinion, as suggested by more serious viewers, is that the movie is a bit crazy.
