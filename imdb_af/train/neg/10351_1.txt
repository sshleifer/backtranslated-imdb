This movie barely followed the story line of the movie. All the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie. They eventually turned it into a cute "tween" Disney movie "crush" story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that Hillary Duff had to play the part, or one of the containers. This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can't believe it's Disney can even get away with such a cheap, basic version. If you've ever read the book, I think you'll agree that it can easily be made into a movie of "Lord of the Rings" equivalence. This movie had never used the title of a ripple in time. Poorly done.
