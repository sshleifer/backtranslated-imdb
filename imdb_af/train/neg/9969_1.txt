I joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a movie. I'm not admitted for a second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They throw every topic they can think of hoping something will hold. I will bet (and hope) that everyone involved with Teachers looks back with embarrassment. There are some good actors here, but you will never know. Thanks, it didn't destroy Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern's careers. There was no vision, no labor of love here, just a terrible attempt went wrong. BTW I don't think the author ever put foot in a real school.
