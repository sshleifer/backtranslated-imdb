Actually horrible movie made by cinematographer-turn-director Ted Tetzlaff. Definitely enough to watch movie, but for a time bomb movie, without any tension. Ford, as someone is sitting here, he already sleeps with this distinctive smirk. There are a few details thrown - Canadian ex-army or RAF, exposing bombs in the war, his wife leaving him - but none of these stories add up too much. The bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to inflate this variety of mines? For the matter, what period of time are we talking about here? World War II or post-war? I accepted the latter which made the motif of the bomber even more noticeable. Generally, but just a horrible movie. There are many good time bomb flashes to hit this one. See any episode of "Danger UXB" for a more exciting time, at about the same running time.
