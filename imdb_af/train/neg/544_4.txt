PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or I always manage this man AB in their movies?). Some touch scenes in the 2nd half. <br /> <br /> NADG: The 1st hour (the jokes were flat to say the least). Every scene involving Rajpal Yadav. Great stupidity in AB's decision making. Let me get it straight, he believes he is insulting his son's soul in every possible way (this will probably ruin their relationship). It is better for him to finally give Akshay responsibility and then tell the truth. WTF? He thinks Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father will soon die because of cancer, but does he think he's insulting him to make him stronger? Am I the only one who doesn't see the logic here? Easy movie's biggest mistake. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a stuntman. LMGA !! We are told that he graduated 1st in college every year and holds an MBA degree. But when the time comes to support himself, and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL !! How does it really apply for a normal job in your field? Or Heck, nowhere else where your life is not in danger? It's an amazing stupid writing. <br /> <br /> - The end. I hate this kind of melodramatic shit. Everything is pushed on our throat to be sorry for AB's character, which I couldn't. The whole thing reminds me a little too much of Srk in KHNH (which I hate). This "sorry for the man with the disease" crap she walked. I felt more like a joke than sympathy for the old man. Couldn't watch the final 20 or so minutes and therefore had to hold fast. the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Bottomline: Waqt is just too stupid to be called a good movie. The obvious director Vipul Shah has targeted it on the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies that could give less about a story that actually makes sense. Give some decent song-picturizations, fancy outfits, lots of glycerin-filled plays and a few strengths and they'll happily slap this way.
