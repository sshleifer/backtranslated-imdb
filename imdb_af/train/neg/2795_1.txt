Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun in her mouth blowing the back of her head on boyfriend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of a "demone and death" rock group who could not shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend's neglect towards her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve it differently than to get a bullet sitting by your head). However, she returns with the soul of Dora (Jill Small), her friend, who replaces her on chorus, so the band can complete the album ceased by Cassidy's incredible death. But Cassidy made an agreement with the dark and souls have to be gathered. She is consumed by this rage against mainly Neal, but all the members of the band or anyone in the music bands are killed if they fall prey to whom they believe, a Dora has threatened. Cassidy did not return for a refund. <br /> <br /> Lousy micro-budget horror flick looks cheap, has an inexpensive role to make plans in a different line of work, and boasts inexpensive death guards that aren't an effective one.
