When the childhood reminder tells you, it was a scary movie; It touches and goes on to repeat it. Anyway, I remember a scary scene playing a homeless person and a cool villain. Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very good movie, sad to say. It's full of cop cliches and a very poor draft with holes that can drive a truck (along with many convenient "twists" that help the story run). Lou Diamond Phillips is the over-insured bad assman sending the bad ceremony Kober to the gas chamber to see that he was a bit of Satan himself and now has the power of resurrection with the power to possess every poorly sensible person he comes across . Through the mixture a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the matter. <br /> <br /> Ahh, this is trash. But enjoyable as such, especially if you have good memories of it. It scared me as a child and the scene at the homeless person is pretty good. Like any kind of logic here; Forget about it; just about every scenario is thrown well and you end up with a cross between a Steven Segal action movie and a 70-year-old demonic movie. And who on earth thought it was a good idea to envisage Lou Diamond Phillips here? Needless to say he is not convincing at all, but he tries his best and I have never had the problem with the man, so many judges look here. As far as Tracy Griffith is concerned, the less the better said. But Kober is pretty good as the killer; always liked that actor. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" can only be what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and a "brain switch off" is needed. Beer will probably improve the viewing experience and I will definitely have a lot of it. The next time I give this movie a spin. Taken all into account; Not a good movie, but a little guilty for nostalgic fans who were easily frightened as children. "See you around, buddy boy"!
