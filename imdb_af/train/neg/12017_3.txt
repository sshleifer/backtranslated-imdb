I'm a big fan of Ludlum's work, and of the Covert-one books, and I often thought how incredible they would be in a movie. Excite me to learn that such a movie actually existed! The Hades Factor, which was the first in the series, was a clear place to start. <br /> <br /> From the start, the movie was disappointing. Simple elements of the movie like Griffin's first encounter with Smith are unnecessarily different from the book, and much less exciting. Several characters were also cast poorly. For starters, Dorff is ashamed as Smith. Not a bad actor, just an incredibly bad choice, because he is too soft, and fails to display many of the features definitely made by John Smith. <br /> <br /> Renaming, redirecting and even failing certain characters further lowers this movie. For example, removing Victor Tremont and the entire back story of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, makes the whole point of the film slightly obscure. Marty Zeller Bach is a very large part of the book, and in the seat he takes, much of the back seat varies (not to mention that the movie character has nothing in common with the character in the book). Another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russel is probably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only is she supposed to be Sophie Amsden's sister (Sophia Russel should be named), but she is also supposed to work from the CIA, not "Covert-one". This brings me to my final point, and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE does not even exist at this stage! Not the second book of the Covert-One series presented by the president as a precautionary measure against further biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I can go all day. In short - if you want the books and want to see a good fit, I'm afraid you will be very disappointed. Even as an action movie, it is well average, mainly due to many missing editing and poor effects. The bumbled story line and dull and demolished water script are the final nails in the very cheap box of this movie.
