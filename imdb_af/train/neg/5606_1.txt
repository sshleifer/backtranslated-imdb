I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. I think he (the lady) protests too much. The whole thing sounded to me as if the author tried to convince himself! He places ominous literature (writings of the same period, but not attached to the Bible), but I can think of at least three references from the top of my head that give historical accuracy to events in the Bible. Anyone can skew data and prove anything they want, but it doesn't. Customs change, word definitions change over time (look at English and German where it is, of course, a common root). Nothing remains the same, it continues to grow and change. The Bible has many different translations, but the King James version is the one I found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will see some words written in italics. These words are added by the translators and can be dropped and the average of the whole verse changes. Writings from around Christ's time are written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without numerical verses. These writings look like one long word and the translators have added all of the above. For example, how would you read it: GODISNOWHERE do you read it because God is nowhere or do you read it as God is here? The same string of letters has two completely different meanings. That is why many Biblical researchers use a "lexicon" to help them with translation because it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew, depending on the language in which Scripture was originally written. It is also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic, you can prove that God exists, but you cannot prove that He does not exist! In the end, I just love listening to people who think they are so clever that they are qualified to judge the Almighty. Talk about ego! Throw away soapbox, God bless Maegi
