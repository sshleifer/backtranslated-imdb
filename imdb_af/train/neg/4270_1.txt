This is another typical incredible and non-sensual piece of Hollywood drink. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, as Snake Pliskin in a suit, convinced me that he was a better 2nd baseman. Ray Liotta as the psychotic policeman is completely predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual carton herself and doesn't make much of a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this perseplay is absolutely predictable until the end when Kurt Ray beats him with a vase or something. Kurt and Madeline then do their mandatory end-of-the-film embrace, and EVERYTHING --- except Russell and Stowe, KNOW Liotta to rise again and threaten the couple again. <br /> <br /> He does, of course, and Russell exercises him 10 times with his 9mm, which was actually unnecessary. This movie may have ended just as well with the emerging scene - except Hollywood voices over unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or "improve," the more slobbery they get.
