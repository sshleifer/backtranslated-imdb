Yep .. it's definitely up there with some of the worst of the MSTIFIED movies, but I've definitely seen it worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well, anyway, I met Rick Sloane at a scientific convention, it's incredible, he was dosing! It was one of the very low budget conventions, where everything goes, everyone has brought something in (if you want to see you have seen what some friends and I brought in). <br /> <br /> He was like a very good guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins, and he even said I shouldn't take it seriously and said he got the MST3K version loved! <br /> <br /> All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think it was bad like Mars Attacks. So I think I stand up for this movie and give it a 5, and betray all my fellow human beings. Sorry guys.
