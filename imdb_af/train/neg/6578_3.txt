Unexpected, uninvolved hybrid of "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it's not nearly as good as one of those messengers. It's about acting sheriff, Artie (Taye Diggs) who is called to investigate a lethal drug overdose at a solid higher class of Univesity, but to keep it at a low. While digging deeper, he thinks it's much more than it seems at first glance. We follow Alicia, the girl who is also exaggerated in flashbacks. About 90 minutes, if this movie was welcome to start with, it would have worn it. This movie does not bring anything new to the table. But this is the only movie so far that is me. Swain topless, so the grade is just higher for it. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Cookie Cookie: Dominique Swain is topless a mistake made by "Happy Campers"); another girl is topless <br /> <br /> Anti-Eye Candy: more male ass than girl often
