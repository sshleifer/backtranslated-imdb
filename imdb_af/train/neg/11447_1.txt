Surely the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to leave for the first ten minutes. The only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners. Don't get me wrong, I'm foolish, stupid movies as much as the next gall, but the whole assumption, writing and humor stink. It was a feeling of a "Napoleon Dynamite" - strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult. Instead, it eventually forced, became uncomfortable and strange. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I just totally felt she (and Sissy Spacek) were reporting this horrible thing. /> <br /> Thanks, I didn't pay for it.
