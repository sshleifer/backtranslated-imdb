I was rarely so annoyed by a leading performance as I was by Ali McGraw's in this movie. God is she troublesome or what? She says everything in the same tone and is terrible, so terrible that Ryan O'Neal, on the other hand, is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a story. He is rich, she is wood, they must both give a lot of love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, her name is named by his first name, if you don't notice the difference in the two of them who conquered them in the name of love. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nominations for this movie indicate that it was a bad year. John Marley is good as Wood's father, but a supportive nomination? At least Ali didn't win. <br /> <br /> I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but again, if it had been for me, Katharine Ross would have been in much more movies. She is definitely a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I didn't even cry when she got sick, and never seemed to feel sad. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones look like he was about 15, and the score is good. But this one is so old, it now has a beard a mile long, and its sin is not so old, but it feels it.
