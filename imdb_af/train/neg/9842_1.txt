Seems everyone in this movie is channeling Woody Allen. They bump and break and bump even more. Only for VERY dying DeNero fans! It tries to look so edgy and artistic - but it comes down to a very, very low budget film made by college students. The most commonly used word in the whole movie is "hum". However, the film captures the atmosphere of the late sixties / early seventies. If you like movies where people talk about each other, terrible lighting (even if it's for "art's business"), and make you feel like you're sitting at a lame political meeting, then you might like it - but you really should be bored. I found this CD in the dollar tray and now I know why.
