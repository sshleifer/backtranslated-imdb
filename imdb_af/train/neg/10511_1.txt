Note to Horror Fans: The only horror here is when you realize you wasted just 95 minutes of your life on a movie that is so worthless, it is insulting. <br /> <br /> I watched it because: <br /> <br /> The point of departure sounded a little promising: it's not. It's just an excuse to use the same equal pieces of other low-budget movies that weren't good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked forest nymphs looked nice, even if the movie was scary: it's not. It is not so. The amateur cinematography ensures that the "fallen angels" are about as sexy as the average homeless person. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He is the king of low budget special effects and lower budget act. Think about it, Savini had to be a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he has been selling it since horror conventions. <br /> <br /> But we focus on the positives: Forest of the Damned is a good example of how to NOT. a movie. <br /> <br /> All others are negative. Obviously, the author is allergic to originality. The writing is terrible. It's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless pacing; The way the director treats a pleasure, and "characterization" as a nuisance, he thinks nobody cares anyway; and the incredibly long and boring riding, walking and nature ranges (which undoubtedly increase the running time to qualify the film for distribution) show a complete lack of film and storytelling in general. <br /> <br /> This is another great example of the number one way you can know if a movie is going to be bad: If it's written and directed by the same person, expect rubbish.
