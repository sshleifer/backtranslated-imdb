Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past feel are the need to try to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo Moon Landing with the Titanic Zinc and you've become so realistic a movie, as this formula-soap opera was completely populated by low-life refuse. Is it what kids were too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and didn't fail the grade school mix? "I'll show that old meanies, I'll post my own movie and prove that you don't need to know about your topic to make money!" Yes, we already know it. The one thing that watched this movie was for me to give me some insight into the underclass. The next time I see a slut in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, and I walk the other side. It is child abuse to allow parents to raise worthless children. It is hearing abuse to keep Woodstock and the moonland in a movie, as if in ipso facto that movie depicts 1969.
