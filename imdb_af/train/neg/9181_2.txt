I usually try to be professional and upbeat when I film movies, but my GOD !!! It was the worst movie I've ever seen. Badly acting, bad effects, bad writing, bad things! <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenage clubs heading for a raven (which occurs in broad daylight) at a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party goers, the set is down on a mission through a zombie-infected forest. During this crusade they are assisted by a police chick and a sea captain who has only the right number of weapons to give to each of the children. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and other survivors. The rest of the movie is basically a collection of poorly directed action sequences, including too long a shootout outside the "home of death". This battle came with cute Hollywood violence, excess clips from the HOTD video game and messy matrix-like camera rotations. One of the characters even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because some of his face had been bursting with acid, a zombie spat on him after continuing the creature long after it was deactivated! I must be sorry for this guy?! <br /> <br /> To sum it all up, it's absolutely no point to watch this movie unless you just want to see how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I had wasted saw this piece easily cover the costs it took to make it. GRADE: F
