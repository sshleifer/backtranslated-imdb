Wow, I love and respect anything that David Lynch did. However, this film is related to the first filmmaker's attempt to make a pseudo-art video. <br /> <br /> To give you a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is typically a visual movie maker, but it has little visual artistic content (empty walls, "upset" with ceiling in the background) <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch usually takes great pride in sound, but here you can even hear the video camera's hum. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to swallow the idea that he has something to do with this movie. unless ... <br /> <br /> ... it's a joke, on David's side, to force fans to search his site (for hours) just to find these drives. I hope so, because at least the idea is funny.
