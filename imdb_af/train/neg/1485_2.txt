For your own good, it is best to disregard any positive reviews about this movie. This flick STINKS. Now, I like (at least in theory) low budget horror movies, but this one makes the worst mistake a low budget flick can make: it takes HOME too seriously. And unfortunately this is not the only problem. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the murderous Beane tribe of British Ilses being transmitted in modern times. An interesting point of departure, but there are two things that are immediately confusing about this movie when you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1 Why is the biggest name on the CD box Jenna Jameson? She is an investigative woman who cannot act and she has a small role. ANSWER: She is apparently a well-known pornstar (as you read no doubt in other reviews), so I think it's a "cameo" look to her. She gives the movie the necessary "name recognition", it seems. Her top bill is not an indication of her talent, but it is an indication of how Untalented is the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> # 2 How can filmmakers be so stupid to think that Canada can be over Ireland? It doesn't even look like Ireland. And the house where the guests / victims remain is this great great North American wood frame Edwardian thing. They had skipped the entire Beane theme and developed a story that also happened in NA. If you are going to make a movie that takes place in Ireland, it is probably best to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and that was a VERY VERY LARGE Irish accent.) It wouldn't have been as bad as the director did not want to make the following "Night of the Living Dead", but it seems he was. Sorry. He enjoyed it very much. In fact, some of the screens were not far from unintentional comedies like they were. <br /> <br /> Like the infamous folding scene, the woman is chained to the table, stripped naked, then cut open and dehumidified. It's funny, you ask? Well, in the deleted scene version, pull the mutant killer miles to miles after miles of guts. It's actually funny after a while. And what self-respecting cannibal eat intestines anyway? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Heck no, we eat hams and ribs and drumsticks. Oh yes. <br /> <br /> Some of the other role players were annoying: the sneaky, fluffy Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think he's supposed to be thrown as a STUD. In fact, he is as big a loser and goofball as his name implies. What would explain why the character of equally annoying Gillian Leigh fell to him. <br /> <br /> I checked Gillian Leigh on her link on IMDb, and apparently it's important to know that she obtained high school with distinction. I can't decide if it is more amusing or pathetic to know that just a few years after the graduation, the first student is doing naked softcore scenes in a shower with a man named Howard Rosenstein. Wonder if her former classmates saw this movie? If they have, hopefully they'll get the message: DISCOVER THIS FAT! Go to college! I can turn on and off, but why. If you like Gore, you'll find something in this movie, but not much more.
