Captured it on IFC yesterday and can't believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these ladies were? Kate tells Jed she can be dismissed because she is supposed to be a pillar of the community, but stick to him! Then suddenly they decide they are in love? And she's so devastated about his death, she's not going to his funeral, much less, telling his family the "good news"! By the way, how did an American become the main force of a very proper British school? Janine had to be in power for her unspeakable abuse of power, but nothing happened! And she blows up a little what she brought in for questioning! And the less Molly says, the better! <br /> <br /> Regarding debt, Janine and Molly feel about Jed, please! This is the punk's own damn error, he has turned into the road box! Where's the blame for poor Gerald, who's being attacked? If I could just do the same after the upset behind this "movie"!
