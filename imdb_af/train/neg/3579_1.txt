Immediately after renting and watching this movie a few years ago, a friend and I decided it defined the absolute zero on the film scale. There was nothing about the movie that could have been worse than it was. To this day, we still have movies, even very bad, with how much better than "The Lonely Lady". <br /> <br /> A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the screens. Among other things, "Last Summer" and "Diary of a Mad Housewife" and she said she was asked to write a script for the Harold Robbins book "The Lonely Lady." She said she had submitted a treatment and it was rejected because she didn't think she understood the problems of a Hollywood screenwriter. She said, "I think they got someone else to write it." The interview was filmed before the movie was released. She died in 1981, and I bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally to save her from involvement in the rash.
