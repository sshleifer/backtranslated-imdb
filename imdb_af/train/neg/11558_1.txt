Exceptionally horrible story I can hardly put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the victims of the murder was finally resurrected, alive and well, to defeat first. There is a chance that I have missed some important platelet elements, as I could have been in a mild coma during the time this baby was on. The box in which the movie appears shows scenes that are never in the movie. I was attracted by the rough images of slavery torture and promises of a "Euro trash, sexy horror flick." I get the feeling it is the budget and about a quarter of the film is left out. All the good stuff more than likely. I have the PG-13 add-on that made about as much sense as the end of the new Planet of the Apes movie. Look at this one with a friend and a bottle of hard stuff. You will need it.
