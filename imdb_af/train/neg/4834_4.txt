I look forward to Kathryn Bigelow's great anticipation movie after the endless hype and 6 Oscars it was awarded. Unfortunately, this is not really a good movie. The depiction of the situation certainly seems to be accurate and credible, but after that the story is simply incomplete and the direction of the film seems to be uncertain and random. The actors made a good effort, but I didn't really get what the movie was. It's not as atmospheric and tempting as Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as Band of Brothers, not as action packed as ... though anything. Certainly I can't see why it is so highly rated, nor why people get it on epic relationships. Note, I have given the caliber of movies over the past few years, and I think there is not much to choose from.
