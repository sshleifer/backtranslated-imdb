DO NOT BE THIS SAD VINTAGE FOR A MOVIE. I wasted time and money on this and am beautiful about it. <br /> <br /> The play is comparable to high school games. The writing is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes from the end (which I believe I should be rewarded to reach), I had a headache of all the screaming, crying and crying girls of the five girls. <br /> <br /> The majority of the violence (scarcely for a movie today) was suggested rather than graphically depicted, but I found the characters so annoying that I wanted to see them, and indeed every person involved Making this piece, dying in the most terrible ways. <br /> <br /> I spend ten minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours. Don't do this.
