Misty Ayers had a smoking body, and that's what this movie is about. Pure exploitation flick. I started playing a game with myself, with the number of times they ran the stock band music. And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. Case in point: to go to a room and say with the words "hello" is written with the music of a Roman epic. I would like to know why this film is on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this movie: that women's low tethering existed in 1954. I'm talking to Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie pants. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes, Misty is quiet on the side and takes on her clothes (except for bra and panties, unfortunately). Also include terrible dubbing, resulting in a "Look Out! effect.
