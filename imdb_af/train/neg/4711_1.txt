I really hate this show! I watched one episode, and I knew this show was really awful. The story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad. I think it's just a sh + + + rip-off from Dexter's Laboratory and Johnny Quest, "a silly boy with flamed blonde hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog; A stay-at-home dad and a smart, super-busy mom ... Like oh-my-flippin 'God! Their father is a ma-f ** chin homemaker, it's not that gay! If my father is a housewife, I will personally die! Of shame that is ... Actually, I would. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else about this ... this travesty just 3 words; count them 3 words to describe it: <br /> <br /> · Lame, · Mute, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I can say, it's definitely my list of the worst animated series EV-ER! If I had one what it is.
