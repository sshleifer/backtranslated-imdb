If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror, don't save with Gawi. The film barely earns alongside A-list work such as Ringu, Tale of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even as good as The Eye of Inner Senses). Those movies thrive with subtleties, unexpected images, rich characters, and a definite non-western take on what's scary. Gawi is stripped of the remaining limbs and organs of everything that made American horror uncomfortable over the past five and twenty years. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to mix Asian ghost story and Hollywood slasher movie, but it's a poor fitness. One aesthetic is obliged to suffocate the other; guess what? They do not have a story of their own to tell that the filmmakers are plundering Ringu for an evil child, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, crap characters, witless plot, dull ghost, ho hum.
