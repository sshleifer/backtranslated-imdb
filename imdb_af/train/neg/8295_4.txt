I tend to like character-driven movies. I also think Hope Davis is turning into consistently good work, so I had high expectations for this movie. That hope was soon. <br /> <br /> The main mistake with this movie is the direction. There are many scenes that are daydreaming ranges. The film regularly uses the Denis Leary character as the Campbell Scott character's alter ego. It doesn't work for me at all. It would have worked better than a play as a movie. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the plot. It is important that the characters in a movie take a trip and end in a different place from where they started. I didn't feel the characters grew in the experiences depicted in the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editing was not done well either. There was a very large bag in the middle of the movie that was particularly boring. <br /> <br /> Apart from acting, which I feel was consistently strong, this movie failed in almost every aspect of the theater.
