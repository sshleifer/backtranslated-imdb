The original Lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre. It's pure adventure SF with any substance (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood didn't film it word for word, because it's just the kind of thing they love: massive explosions, super-weapons, uber-heroics, hero gets the girl, aliens (great CGI potential), good versus evil in purest form, etc. etc. Instead (and remember I'm a Japan-o-subsidiary and anime lover), we get this horrible kiddie movie that blends the bowels of the story into Star-Wars (ironic as the latter occasionally from books) ripped off, packed and dipped the whole thing to 'Thundercats' level. To see Kimball Kinnison is the symbol of the Galactic Patrol Officer and the second stage Lensman portrayed as a small boy sadly (etc.). I just can't understand why the makers did it, because they had the rights to the story and could have made much more money (VR!) By telling them straight. It does not make sense.
