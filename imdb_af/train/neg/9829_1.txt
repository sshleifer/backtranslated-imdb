The point of departure sucked me in, but it was about 30 seconds because it was David Lynch or something serious. Interesting to look just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list. I can be a struggling spiritual piece (Romero occurs), but there was nothing spiritual about this one. The message seems to be that we all have to pretend that we have an IQ of 80 (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer, what happened to you?) And blindly follow the Bible without any self-examination whatsoever or we'll be the second times come on. This is the kind of attitude that lets people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings (I work around the corner of the former WTC site). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
