This program is really overestimated. A detective such as Danny Pino's hothead character would have been transferred to the "rubber gun group" years ago. The whole group consists of sacred egoism that judges people whose actions go back decades according to the 2007 standards. Every Vietnam veteran character they ever had, apparently has been the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran . There was only one black murderer, and he was attacked by his white boss. The only Spanish killer was a "traitor" who murdered another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street child for a crime that (naturally) committed two rich white children. What a lot of propaganda. Hey, authors: minorities and poor people also commit murder. Just on this show, most killers are top white. <br /> <br /> The arrests of people in their 70s, 80s and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are also a joke. No real DA will push for murder because it means the state will be stuck with their medical medical bills until they finally kick off. The state will favor their families and insurance companies. The prosecutor will only plead with involuntary homicide and they will not serve a day. The only many old criminals going to jail are either organized crime figures or former Nazis, whose high-profile beliefs promote DA's careers.
