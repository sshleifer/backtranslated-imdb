1999 goes down in history as the year the film critic deceives the general public. First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they lifted the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA is by far the worst movie of the year. What is it about? Who knows this? It's full of confidence and loads of bad acting. I like to always stay and watch the credits, but when this thing was over, I couldn't get out of the movie fast enough. Most of the audience who attended the show felt almost the same. Dates have argued with each other as well as strangers. It's an ugly and hateful movie that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
