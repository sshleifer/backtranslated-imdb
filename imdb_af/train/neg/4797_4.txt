After killing boss Vic Moretti (letting Anthony Franciosa) kill his lady who killed him with Derek, their new driver / Vietnam veterinarian and blamed it on the poor guy, Derek found him in jail where he was corrupted officer, Vic's inmate jail brother and, oh yes, illegal experiments conducted by a shady CIA agent (major genre mainstay and first director John Saxon) to change various prisoners into super-human invincible zombies . Of course, things get out of hand and Derek and the rest of the unchanged prisoners have to save the day after the infected people leave prison. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a great talented actor & As a director, Saxons is a ... talented actor. To say this movie (John's only direct outing to date) lack a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement. However, the film is not completely without merit. The dialogue, while idiot, is just bad enough to be humorous at times. Unfortunately, it is not really enough to kiss the film alone and it lasts forever that the film even comes in its own (which is pretty late in the movie). As such, most of the people I recommend to this movie can say that if you're a fan of the Saxon (which I am indeed) is one value show, just go with low expectations and be good. <br /> <br /> Eyebrows: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure are topless <br /> <br /> My Degree: D +
