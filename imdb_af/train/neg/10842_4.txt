I watched the movie, I recently watched this movie on TCM and hoped for an undervalued jewel, seeing many movies from the 30's. It's not a jewel - not even semi-precious. The anachronistic clothes and the 1930s Rolls Royce limo hit you right away. The casting is also funny. But mostly, there are too many stupid and unnecessary plot devices. This film has very good ingredients and a basic plot that contains promise, but the components are not mixed in the right recipe. It simply doesn't come together as it should. And that's a shame. With some obvious but small changes, it might have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about an American showgirl (Jean Harlow) looking for a rich British man - preferably from the nobility. She meets Franchot Tone and his friend, who on a lick in a Rolls Royce are owned by his partner's employer. Harlow is wrong. Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls, and she puts on her images. This early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction. <br /> <br /> Tone, however, unconsciously remembers the fact that his employer is actually a German 5th column on the eve of World War II, and that is when the film changes completely and begins to fall apart. Tone and Harlow are married, but just as the honeymoon begins, he is shot by a Mata Hari (Benita Hume), and Harlow flees the scene, with a bystander accusing her of Tone's murder. (In fact, Tone recovery from the wounds.) <br /> <br /> Harlow flees to France, where she falls in love again - this time with a rich French cad (Cary Grant). Tone, now in the army, and Harlow are unexpectedly brought to Grant's hospital room, where he is rehab in a plane crash. In the next scene, Tone accuses Harlow of leaving him because she is actually a gold digger. Harlow never explains the witness accusing her of murder and her panic! This is one of the unreal, movie-plot device breakdowns in the story. <br /> <br /> Then Tone is also brought into contact with the woman (Hume) who shot him. She is about to see her paramour, Grant, testing the new plane that Tone delivered to him from England. Incredibly, Hume and Tone recognize dull one, but simply can't come true! Well, so Tone was shot and almost died; Perhaps his memory is a bit out of the shit. But how many men did Hume shoot that she would forget one of her points? (It doesn't seem like she's falling into memory.) <br /> <br /> It's unexplained and unnecessary. Hume had to recognize him completely, but played well when she realized that Tone couldn't place her. That would be a much better treatment for the problem. <br /> <br /> The final is also very unsatisfactory. The film, as made, teamed up Tone and Harlow to retain the good reputation of the cad, Grant, leading to his fraudulent funeral as a hero. Then Harlow and Tone just walk away. It is noble to keep the French public's perception of their national war hero, but very unsatisfactory as a love story! <br /> <br /> What begs the film is: Harlow explains that she has fled in a panic of murder accusations; Tone forgives her and silently puts her love for her; He then carries a torch for her, even while helping her direct the crash site to preserve Grant's reputation. Meanwhile, Harlow eventually acknowledges Grant for the cad he is. When he saw Tone for the brave and noble man, Harlow again had feelings for him. By the end of the film, the two of them were reconciled while working together to guide the appearance of Grant's death. After Grant's hero's funeral we see them embracing and kissing on the blur. It would have made a nice little movie. For Cary Grant fans, it would have been even better if Tone played the French cad who was murdered and the slow-paced first man reunited with Harlow. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is thrown as The Irishman lives in England, while Cary Grant is thrown as a Frenchman. This movie would have been much better if their roles changed. It would also be more conducive to the movie that should have been ...
