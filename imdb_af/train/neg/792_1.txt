Thanks to the BBC for this show. I had an inferiority complex, I hated to leave home, talk to new people and I had an overwhelming feeling that people hated me. But after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes, my fortunes began to change. After episode 2, I started doing new work, presenting fashionable clothes, and actually feeling talented. When the series was finished, I ran the sales department at work, hit an abundance of women, and regularly made the karaoke competition my local. If you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn, then take a trip to Poundland and pick up the DVD, it's just 99p.
