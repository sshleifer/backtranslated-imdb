I'm all for a "bad" horror movie, but it was just a puppy! How anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me. If you want quick editing to cover the special effects, then bad acting and a bad script will go! There was no tension and the gore factor was laughable because it was so false. I will take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this pile every day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows a stinker when she sees one. On the other hand I sat dumb through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got better. No luck! I don't have his other movie Torched and I doubt if I'm bothering now.
