Start very well, nice intro and build up for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes the charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same form as the American Pie and Loser main player without the supportive role or innovative storyline that made the Pie movies more commercially successful. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest - Heder's play was pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best but did not have a substantial plot or writing to get their teeth in. The movie goes without any pace or clear logical story justifying its length. <br /> <br /> The end is about as predictable. As they come - so predictably, I chose the aerosol for this one line. <br /> <br /> My advice: Avoid at all costs, unless you really have nothing else to do or listen to or look at you will feel that the producers just spent half an hour on your life.
