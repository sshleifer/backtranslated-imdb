I'll give it a negative rating if I could. I didn't expect this movie, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! The snakes are, of course, fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guy johnson. Oh, how original; If I was a 12 year old boy, I could laugh about it. I have no idea how this movie has become so popular. Seriously, the worst thing I've ever seen. I wasn't entertained, it wasn't funny, I wasn't even bored! I was nothing. It wasn't even that bad, it was good, it's just bad. Ridiculous actually. Please don't waste your money on this movie. Don't rent this movie first. No idea how it gets such a high rating.
