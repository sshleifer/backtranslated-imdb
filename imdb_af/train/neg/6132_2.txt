As a child, my friends and I all believed that Gymkata was the most violent, bloody movie ever made. I'm not sure who started that rumor. It was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who didn't allow it for some reason. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a perennial late night cable movie, and as a result, I was able to compensate the lost time. I had seen more than a dozen times scenes of this horrific film excuse, and I can always see it from 1-2 seconds of screen time. Apart from the forced connection of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad dubbing, the stiff dialogue and the exorbitantly difficult story line, the movie has some things for it. With everything that is bad about the movie visually, the sound is actually quite entertaining. Never had a punch or kick landed with so little power and so much volume! The canned kung-fu sounds are shaky, but the delayed and shuffled music, and the almost 5-minute motif is really weird. The chasing the city of demented bloodthirsty villagers is not really tense as much as it is annoying, and there are plenty of bad wigs and extras that all look at the camera and move to make this train wreck a little fun. . Can it be a cult classic? Where is MST3K when we need it?
