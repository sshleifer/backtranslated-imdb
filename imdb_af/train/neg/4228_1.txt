I can't believe how bad this piece of garbage is! I want my $ 3.99 back! Words deny description of this poorly made piece of shit! The dubbing in no way forms or forms in line with the actor's mouth. The movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970s video camera. I shot better movies with my cellphone camera. The gore is laughing because of the stupid, incredible plot. The acting is what you would expect if you had called all your friends on a Saturday afternoon and continued to be completely torn, then try to play a play in your garage. Don't get me wrong ... I didn't expect O'Neil and I love Zombie movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this movie than making it unshakable. Avoid!
