Sundown - with the worst, bravest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most inappropriate, pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane the vampire, which is every move and spoken word, was so ridiculous that I half laughed at the times and rolled me over the rest. <br /> <br /> The vampires do not seem to have any special powers - except for power (sometimes), to switch off a lamp with their minds (once) and .. This is really. Do you ever think that Dracula got rid of a fight because he ran out of bullets? I also didn't practically have any other film Dracula who would eat this one for breakfast, use his followers skin and their legs as toothpicks. <br /> <br /> The main chart of the movie is that a human family of four is captured in a vampire gang battle - Dracula's vs. It could have been a good old B-movie fun, but the excessive dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a little too seriously and eventually the rest of the movie not already destroyed by clay bats, spoiled, mediocre acting and the ridiculous script. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just too stupid to be funny. Certainly, it has some entertaining moments, but they are few and far apart.
