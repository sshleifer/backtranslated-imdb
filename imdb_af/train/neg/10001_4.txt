This film lacked something I couldn't even touch on my finger: charisma of the leading actress. It inevitably translated into a lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading husband. Even the romantic plays have come as mere actors in the game. It could very well be the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. I just don't know. <br /> <br /> But could this be the script? Just exactly who was the chef in love with? He was more surprised by his cuisine and restaurant, and finally by himself and his youthful exploitation, than by anyone or anything else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this movie. But do not forget that it is for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
