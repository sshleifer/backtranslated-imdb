ALL FOR LOVE (as it is titled when it is broadcast after the weekend) is a romantic period drama with Captain Saint Ives, a French officer in Napoleon's army captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and fall in love with a young girl visiting prison. There is also a story in which a murder is involved. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and confess that I have not been taken by the movie as I am not much of a fan of time styles and the script feels somewhat episodic, but I will say that done well by everyone involved and it has a good role to include Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. The costume design you can expect is also excellent. <br /> <br /> I will be very surprised if this movie does not get complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at theater. Captain Saint Ives is in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is completely exposed and there is a scene of French prisoners that includes a murder scene to which blood is clearly seen. You really don't have to worry if the BBC schedulers have any kind of clue about what they're doing
