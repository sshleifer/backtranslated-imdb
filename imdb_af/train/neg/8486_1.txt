I can't believe anyone thought there was something original or interesting about this movie. I am a fan of science fiction as much as the next man, and I can even enjoy old movies with ridiculous sites as long as they are written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my glowing review of Changed States [1980].) <br /> <br /> A monkey could have explained better why I had to take the basic idea behind this movie for a second. The problem is not that the producers have a low budget - that's what they don't care about. <br /> <br /> Now, to humiliate the worthless magazines that see the glowing reviews on the box: <br /> <br> Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I enjoy reading the latter two. To review credibility, went through the floor. But I know if I ever have a movie with a handheld camera, a cheesy plot and silly effects, I will show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about Conceiving Ada.)
