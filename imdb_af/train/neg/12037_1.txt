This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood it's incredible. They just want to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It can also just be New Adventures from Mr. Bland Acting is called. <br /> <br /> Someone told me that if you had imagination, you liked this show. It's a terrible approach to a TV show. A visual media like this should spark your imagination, you should not force your imagination into making it good. It will be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and start talking about who killed or who killed. "If a movie is boring, I make up my own story." <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Absolute human waste.
