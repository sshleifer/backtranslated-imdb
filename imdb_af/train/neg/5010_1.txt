Don't waste your time or money on this one. The half decent throw can make you foolish to think that this teen thriller, while barely breaking any records, can easily entertain for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It won't. <br /> <br /> It won't scare you, laugh, cry or even challenge your intellect. This will make you wonder how this movie ever made the production. Yes, it's really that poor.
