You know how painful to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst movies ever has to include one of the most beautiful cars. Why the cars should not only be victims of offense, but also the only true actors and artists in it. So how on earth can you allow Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever those people come into contact with your cars and destroy your reputation for which you give millions. Stop the benefit of the cars and earn money on their coffins. It's painful for those who love cars. It is painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want my money back !!!
