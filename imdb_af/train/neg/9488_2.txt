In my time I saw very horrible horror movies, and although it's not the worst of the bunch, it's definitely in the bottom half. The script starts with OK. A young doctor goes to hospital as an intern, hoping that he will secure himself for a better job for him and his future wife. Nice huh? The movie then goes straight into the toilet when you realize that something kills patients. It seems that there is a demon in the basement that reaps people's souls. This is the work of the 1 doctor, 1 nurse and 1 security guard throughout the hospital staff to drag this mental patient down, do a ritual that only cuts the tongue, and then allows the devil's haunted house to come and steal his soul through the magic of cheese-like special effects. At this point, the film becomes so ridiculously silly, I beg this past. There was another hour to go. It looks like an episode of 'Tales From the Crypt' half an hour stretched somehow in an hour and a half crap. From Tiny Lister who offends his best-known John Coffey (The Green Mile) in turn to Tracy Scoggins, who plays the stereotypical cute Nurse Ratchet, this movie fails at every possible level. I gave these 2 stars for only TWO reasons. 1) His fiancee is quite warm, she slightly relieves the pain and 2) The movie actually looks OK, much better than the current trend of horror movies made with Wal-Mart home camera. <br /> <br /> In the end, avoid this maze even if you got the Blockbuster movie pass (which I do and I still cheated). As a bonus drinking game, you and your friends take a shot every time Matt Stasi (Dr James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. You will be drunk for 15 minutes in the movie.
