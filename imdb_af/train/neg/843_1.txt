A Los Angeles BDSM subculture serves as a backdrop to this low budget and sharply constructed mess. This is clearly a nice piece for his top-paid player, Celia Xavier, who also produces and writes while playing a dual role as twin sister Vanessa. and Celia. A question is soon being developed as to whether a little unbeatable camera, lighting and editing of pirate technology can ever make a connection with a poor and often incoherent story that will not be taken seriously by a sensational viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated county or Los Angeles pilot while her evil natural twins have become an iconic figure within her fetishist world, mainly due to erotic appearances on CD-ROMs, but when the disaster "Mistress" Vanessa 'prevents Celia, who is determined to discover her sister's malicious attacker, starts a new sex as a "sex slave" at the private Castle Club, where the specialty of the house is a "devil's party". In addition to a police officer in Los Angeles police station, two FBI field agents (whose deployment to the Vanessa case is presumably needed due to their involvement in BDSM sites) are being named to investigate the crime while trying to secure security. provided for Celia whose passionate performance in her new calling is diligently considered by her clients to create conditions of personal danger for her. Lack of logic and continuity is abundant, such as a murder given to L.A.P.D. Operational South Bureau, a region of the metropolis that is far from the area. Direction is unfocused and is not supported by erratic editing and audio reproduction after production. The said photographic gymnastics culminates with a sturdy mount near the film's end of previous footage, which refers only to the scenario. One solid acting turn appears under this snail: Stan Abe as an avid FBI agent.
