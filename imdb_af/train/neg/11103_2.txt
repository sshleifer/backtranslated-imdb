OK, so I just saw the movie, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was generally a decent movie, except for the storyline, which was stupid and horrible. First, do we learn nothing about the beings, why did they appear, what are they doing in our world, and really, were they on Earth before or were they just getting out of space? Secondly, the role of the butcher to maintain order is just as clearly created. Actually, how big can the underground be for a substation? There were just so many of these creatures, so I think rather than killing innocent people, they could have just planted tactical bombs, or maybe the creatures and a Nuke would have done the job. I know it sounds funny and it is, but I don't see the death of people as necessary. Third, Leon plays like a Superman who jumps on the train and fights Vinnie Jones, who is much bigger and bigger. Then again, when he looks out the conductor, he does nothing and acts like a lash and looks at all the abominations. I mean OK, the conductor helped creepy (lol), but if Leon were so brave, he would have gone completely. I mean he first dares his life, and then does nothing exactly when he should have. He could have been dead as a hero, but living as a coward ... this may be the case, but not after having had so much braveness before. Then, the policeman ... come on! It was a city with a subway, I bet there should have been other police, except that lady, other police stations, it was really foolish. All in all, great play by Vinnie Jones, interesting idea for the reason This is not really built. By the way, what did the signs on the chest mean? Vinnie Jones can't make the rest ...
