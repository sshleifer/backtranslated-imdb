In fact, it was never. I don't know why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940-ball comedy. What a nice bump! None of these people come close to a Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc., and anyway, today's audience is not as receptive to this easy muck. Writing is trivial. The chopped plot is razor thin and obvious. The chemistry between the leading characters does not exist. Interestingly, Julia Roberts thinks she is a reincarnation of a great star in the "golden age of Hollywood", whenever it may be. This is an effect she has tried and does not reach with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
