This is a seriously disturbed movie. Even though the boys earned what they had ..... the sadistic gruesome dismissals were "slightly" over. The only character that had been in the hunt earlier was killed before he could offer some help to the sad plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, there was a promise of a mediocre relationship, but it was just an attempt to abandon viewers in a false sense of security before the joy of what's coming. <br /> <br /> The only thing the movie saved me was when Jack Nicholson jumped out of the bushes and screamed, "and where's the batman?" Kim Basinger could have shouted. <br /> <br /> Now it would have been cool!
