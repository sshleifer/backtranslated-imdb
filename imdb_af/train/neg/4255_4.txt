The movie opens with a beautiful lady in a dressed white gown who goes through a stereotypical Eastern European city. we know she is being followed by something, because she looks behind her. And soon we see her being chased by a mysterious man in a black ditch scrap. then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter and he is after her. but look, is it her reflection in the shop window ??? no she is just her identical twin vampire! but unfortunately they both get it. <br /> <br /> After this brilliant and incredibly fun setback to the old hammer movies of the 60's and 70's (in the credits the twins are called the twins of evil, which of course is the name of the final installment in hammer 's Karnstein trilogy), the plot dies pretty much. <br /> <br /> What little plot is there, dracula (which conveniently changes its appearance every time he is born again, so the producer doesn't bring you the same drakula) comes to a mortuary, the fellow students realize he is dead and thinking .... wow what an opportunity, maybe i'll just ignore all those movies that say drinking vampire blood turns you into a vampire and uses the vampire's blood to find a cure for our malignant ailment. Of course this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept, but illegally subtracted. The movie stops setting up wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, fellow students endeavor to bring back to life by placing him in a bath of blood in a secluded lowland. mansion. The house itself is scary enough to be the centerpiece of the movie, but are we staying there? no because they decide to take the vampire to a deserted pool. sigh. This movie has a real problem with "homages" as I mentioned before the opening scene is out of hammer and this home theater would have been perfect for a hammer-like movie, but the movie changes gears quickly and turns into a medical horror. <br /> <br /> The other problem is that they set so many characters, it's almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them. There are fellow students and their wheelchair-bound professor-type "friend". The fellow students are all: arrogant, boring, money hungry and stupid. How they did it surprised me, unless the school had to meet his muscular base / big chest quota. And then there is the vampire hunter who stays secretive through the movie. hey i can respect it, but it would be nice if they didn't set it up like the movie would be about him. Then you have random priests, policemen and science types. so many people are introduced and then soon forgotten until they need that person to either save the day or jump out for a cheap scare that gets bored quickly. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a lazy movie. No real scares, just a few predictable jump scares. The setup for this is so extended, it's hilarious. For example, the bath full of blood. It is so obvious that drunkards will come out of the dark blood. and yet we have to wait too long to get the inevitable fright. afterwards he kills one of the stupid and larger brushes with students. we all know she will be one of the dead. but what does the other do? bury her in a shallow grave near the house. Suck, so you know who will jump out of your way when the police come home .......... <br /> <br /> Oh yeah. <br /> <br /> Perhaps someone will get the hint that it's impossible to make a horrible vampire movie and just go atmospheric, and then we end up with a whole movie that's as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
