During the first 3 seasons, equally strange parents were as nice as hard candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's as nice as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you need after looking at the more recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence that has no laughter. Cosmo, one of the more engaging Nick characters, surrendered to an abused unfunny cretin that Family Guy's cast didn't even want to know. Timmy has become an egotistical arrogant jerk that Bart Simpson would like to make up the snot and give Timmy's snottiness. It would be a lot of beating. And poor Wanda ... a true charmer who fell victim to her husband and grandchild, she has now marked a "night" to care for the well-being of others. Plus Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else, but he is never punished for it, nor does he teach lessons. What pretty much summarizes Butch Hartman's attitude towards children: they are rough, vulgar and not too bright. Thanks, God, this crummy tone was canceled, along with Butch Hartman's darling, Danny Phantom. At least Butch has what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.
