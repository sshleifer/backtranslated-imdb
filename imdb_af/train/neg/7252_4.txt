The DECOY is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newcomers, but it does not have all the common mistakes that most such movies are sinking. It has a definite story, it is adequate, photography is very good, the hero and the bad man are both formidable men, and the background music is not overdoing. This is a new DVD version, so people will look here to see if it's worth it. I don't know where all the 10's come from, because it's not so, this movie is so good - even if you're the movie maker's mother. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw at a theater was Warner's rubbish of J K Rawlings' beloved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. If you compare the DECOY with PHOENIX, think that Phoenix (as made by Warners) had no story, certainly no actor was allowed by the director, photography was scary, and the sound-sounding musical score was just a mess. I gave Phoenix a "1" because the scale is not lower. The DECOY is 4 times better - in all respects. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, THE DECOY gives you a chance. Remember, it's not "Decoy 3 - the Shootout" or any such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations are not left behind by the foolish "10" scores here, you can just enjoy the movie on its own terms.
