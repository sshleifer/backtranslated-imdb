I'm afraid I shouldn't agree with the majority. I found Spike Lee's youngest boring! Although he is trying something different, ie not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I don't think it worked too well. <br /> <br /> There's really a bit too much going on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. The story is good, but in the end everything you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a challenging killer, Mr. Lee can no longer sit in the side of the movie? > <br /> <br /> However, there are good points. All plays with the son of Sam's killer David Berkowitz look very nice (color saturation, etc.) And the play is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall, I felt the different stories worked well. on their own or otherwise without the murder. In the end, it was just not strong enough. <br /> <br />
