The judge of Poland must be a feminist, because she finds "Young Catherine" a good movie and historically accurate. Nothing can come out of the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many years, I have taken exception with YC almost every time, and in particular the politically correct portrayal of her as the boss who had the one-handed hand, moved Russia in a direction of domination. The truth? She is just after St. Petersburg brought to be a wife and mother, and found that she had to bind with the Dvorians, the boyars and the military to survive. As long as she didn't challenge her, she could welcome her cultural wishes (fill in the Hermitage with art treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that she was not "big", but in this area of ​​postmodern revisionism, evidence is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a little fluff from Ted Turner who, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is another example of how much Russia is portrayed in the West.
