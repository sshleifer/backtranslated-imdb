As many others have commented on here, I must say that this movie is bad, but not the worst I have ever seen. There will be no direct references to movies or series in this comment, because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I felt like I had watched an episode of a TV show or something where they got a hold of a few extra $$$ to spend on CGI (I got worse from seen that). All in all, this is an insult to the viewer, at least if you have no knowledge of computers and / or technology at all. . There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me comfortable, and I found myself pleading for everything to end quickly - halfway through. In addition, there are numerous "easy way out" scenarios, which are also an insult to your intelligence as a thinking person ... <br /> <br /> This movie definitely fades compared to the old "Wargames" and I think It's a pity they even call it a successor. <br /> <br /> Two stars from me, because of one thing and one thing: the actors' performances are not half the repetition of a script they had to work on. Yet they should never draw on this movie. Not really a career movement, but I think we all have accounts to pay. <br /> <br /> For those of you who gave this movie store ... you need to be on the studio's payroll or something, that's My only explanation. <br /> <br /> For anyone who hasn't seen this one, look it anyway and make your own mind. But lower your expectations to the floor (and then some).
