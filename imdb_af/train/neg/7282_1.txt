National Lampoon was once a funny magazine. Whether you like the stoner hippy days of the late sixties or the smug-and-socks of the seventies (when the comedy with many naked babies is strengthened) depends a lot on your date of birth, but everyone agrees that the early eighties the middle-aged subtracted from the remaining sparks of anarchic humor that the drugs had not, and offers such as this film and the increasingly terrible spin-off records shot further holes in the hull. Outside a nicely illustrated title set, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this simple depressive stink bug. If you slice it through the baffling opening segment, 'Growing Myself', hope that things will get better, strength - they don't. Anyone who thought the idea that a woman was raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold that had to be returned to him on a dog rest dish. If there is ever a worldwide shortage of guitar picks, the negatives of this fearless ragbag of crumpled ideas and brave performances may well serve some purpose.
