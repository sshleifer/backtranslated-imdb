San Francisco is a great city with great acting credits. In this one, the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city. They don't even manage the most basic of realistic details. So I wouldn't recommend it to anyone on a San Francisco movie. You won't think, "Oh, I was there," would you think "how did a two-story quadruple change in a quiet hotel lobby?" Some of the leaders used East Coast speech styles and influences. Doing this detracts, but the acting was always competent. <br /> <br /> The stories seem to be shot in three different styles, at least in the beginning. The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting. The plot is a weak, torn scene for plays from elegant Hong Kong action movies. The original had much more tension and emotional resonance, they were better framed and better set. But the acting is nice and we see James Hong and other locations. <br /> <br /> The white boy's intro was useless. I think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it, so they loosely structured and cut it. The father is a strange attempt at a liberal Berkeley - really people, everyone knows it's not "groovy" to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous. They threw away some good opportunities. Staged and bitter on the West Coast, a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they do in New York. They are equally unbearable but always distinguishable. It would have been interesting; It wasn't. <br /> <br /> The Hunter's Point intro was the most disappointing. It was the most derivative of the three, and stylistically the farthest from San Francisco. You've seen it before and you've seen it better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite the generic non-locality and aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent and something interesting begins to force their way around the awkward direction ... about ten minutes before the end. Good concept placed in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there is a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one.
