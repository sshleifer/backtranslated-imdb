I do not agree with many who wrote and said about this supposed "masterpiece" of the German New Wave: <br /> <br /> 1) There are major errors in simple exposition, in the basic communication of critical plot points, as related to Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the man agreed in return for substantial financial compensation not to return to his wife and return until Oswald died? <br /> <br /> 2) The end is highly unsatisfactory because it is arbitrary and accidental. The original script asked Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's will, to establish that her husband had actually sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Mary only runs water from a tap over her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Mary is then briefly inflated, rather than confronting the consequences of her self-deception and moral compromise. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder is trying to force the public on private, political and personal. Contrary to what critics and "experts" claim, I don't think it works. By entering the historical radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie, historical events do not integrate the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of Mary's emergence of poverty to prosperity is meant to compare the so-called economic miracle of post-war Germany. Mary is, therefore, meant to be a woman who is specific and reflective of her time and place, but is in fact inexorable and non-specific. Women claimed their independence by using sex for self-promotion for centuries. <br /> <br /> 4 Finally, there are several instances of inexcusable mess and amateurity. Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention had their effect. Unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen; music is unclear on the spot; and melodramatic attitude sporadically substitutes for acting. <br /> <br /> Oddly, for a movie condemning a country for the deliberate collective memory loss of the Holocaust, it never calls it.
