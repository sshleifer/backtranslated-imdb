This film is massively boring and pretentious. There is only one good moment when a sailor moves the Barney's (think the purple dinosaur-less appearance) eyebrow. The music is relentlessly going on - it's sad that Bjork, someone with so much inner beauty, put into pretense falsity in her art. The pumping of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem brief. Mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are being lifted. Not just from Japanese culture, but from another movie maker ....... In a perfect "art mimic life" moment-the crew of the ship finds a huge piece of sh * t. That's what the audience found in the theater. There are a few pieces that are very much composed and arty without heart --- then? Prepare for spoilers. I'm talking to you, Mr. BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney, you've retired! I saw Jodorowsky's HOLY MOUNTAIN. And your thin, false veil from BS has been lifted. You stole your images your style and your ALL ART CATALOG from this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released, let's stop the forces that are at the art councils of the world, STOP FINANCES! Poor Jodorowsky lost in a financial battle with the Beatles lawyer when he was the Lennon / McCartney of film making. And VAT while Jodorowsky is the Beatle - YOU ARE THE MONKEY! A cheap, thin, silvery rip that is only cared for by fascinating kitschy colleagues. And VAT I am a movie maker. If you are interested in making a reality movie, I will legally fight you in a ring that protects Jodorowsky, and you defend thieves.
