Apparently, Hollywood just gives money to anyone with a camera and the ability to talk. This movie was annoyingly bad. The casting was terrible, the acting unspeakable, and the story full of holes. Script? who needs the script? I was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as I thought, but I had enough shots from T&A to keep me alive. The movie was like listening to a 19-year-old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college), tells a story. To be so poorly written, I thought the two brothers in the movie were initially lovers. The scenes at the racetrack, along with the lead female actor in the film, reminded me of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of movie Grindhouse has modeled himself ... just the authors thought they were serious.
