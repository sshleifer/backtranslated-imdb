A trooper is on the side of the road and make sure everyone obeys the speed limit (doing his job); he then pulls over a woman who appears to be a mother (there is a child in the back seat); he told her what was wrong and BAM ... they were killed. Well, this is the beginning of what I personally thought would have been a good movie. When I was in this movie in the theater, I was with some friends. It was our first night after the summer, so we wanted to see a good movie. We all decided to see a thrill / thriller that looks good to everyone in the group. This was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Not only did I wipe out $ 7.oo on a movie ticket, but I had to sit on the brain through torture. This movie started with mystery and tension and I thought seriously, "It can't be bad ..." I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it doesn't make sense; even if you can pass the bad play, the "not so scary" storyline, and the surprising mess that this movie was, you'll still be amazed. It's not because you're not smart enough to understand it, because that's because no one with a brain can understand what this silly movie is about. Right now you can think, "Oh man! I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is". Get what you thought now from your head !!! I'm trying to save you from watching this movie by telling you it's so bad that there's no reason to even consider seeing it. Please, people don't make the same mistake, I thought this movie has potential ... it doesn't. I give this movie 1 out of 10 (if I can give zero what I want), and I do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie, you will save yourself a lot of sleepless nights with w.t.f. to think. That freaking movie is over.
