Not that I want to be meaningful, but this movie surprised me a lot. Throughout the movie I was like ... erm ... what is this movie about? I don't get the animations at all. Probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belong to the 1980s. During the film, a group of people went out. After the movie, many people said, "That's it?" Frankly, I can't believe this movie was the best child movie award. If you think of watching this movie, I strongly advise you not. You will regret it. I'm not joking. You will find that you are just wasting your time and money.
