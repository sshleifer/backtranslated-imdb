No one goes to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same goes for the majority of lower rental wheelchairs, especially those called Roger Ebert "Dead Teenager Movies". The Hills definitely qualified 2 as a Dead Teen movie, right here, the teens gave the superficial appearance of military pupils. <br /> <br /> Some will argue the line "it's just a movie" if questionable facts are raised in a movie review, but I have always been a firm belief that all good fantasy should in reality be rooted in be effective. In the hills, eyes 2, we have to believe the main characters are military people on an exercise, but they look and talk like a high school camp in the desert. The dialogue is terrible and often vulgar to excess. Although the movies are not nearly comparable, I thought these "soldiers" were in Platoon and scared with fear. Very few about the characters call another soldier as guns and fatigue: radio broadcasts are performed as teenage-girl conversations; A colonel speaks of "hey, asshole" by a private. And no one has the slightest idea of ​​doing what to do, or any command structure, when things go wrong. I think of the soldiers in James Cameron's Aliens, a film of pure fantasy, and how even the futuristic Marines behaved like true soldiers despite their fantastic situations. Fantasy is rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to start watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10, and judging it's strengths and weaknesses from there. You must grant concessions for the material; Star Wars is just as good as a movie like The Godfather, on equal footing. But both are excellent examples of their kind. <br /> <br /> In this respect, while the Hills Eye 2 is a pretty awesome exercise in amateur and immature writing, it's just modestly worse than the typical Dead Teen Movie. On the technical side, it seems that the movie has good production values ​​and that is pretty good from that perspective. Scenes intended to shock, or intended to evoke urgency or tension, generally work. So while looking at The Hills, eyes 2 may have a lot worse than death, there are certainly much worse horror flicks in circulation. <br /> <br /> It is worth a watch for those who enjoy this kind of thing without the usual fanboy luggage, or those who are not inclined to think of every movie they see is either the best ever or the worst ever of all time. If you don't get a "horror", especially the Dead Teenage variety, you won't have a good time with this one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
