A movie like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how the left side in this country just doesn't get it. They never did. And liberalism continues to go into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This film deals with a small league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest against the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy is understandably ridiculous until a lot of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex Engels, join his case. Not only some of them are involved. By the time his movement reaches its peak, all leagues of professional and college sport have to cancel their seasons as no one will play. Just to move this review, I'm willing to give them this point of departure. Although it will never happen in a million years, I will only suggest that it can, then go from there. <br /> <br /> I don't remember how, but some kind of agreement has been reached and the Boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly juicy and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before you criticize the message of this movie, let me just say that this film is poorly written, performed and directed. Even if one agrees with the attitude of the boy, it would be impossible to overcome the severity of the film. And it is a pity, because there are many good actors who are going to waste. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex Engels does as well as he has with his character, and I wish he would try to act in more movies. Oh, it's probably much easier to find work in the NBA coaching world. One wishes Mr. English will learn more from these dull NBA types today how to shoot the rock a little better. Alex definitely knew how to put the ball through the hoop. <br /> <br /> Regarding the movie's message, it's just wrong. Flat and simple. All the punched heads are in those missile silos in the west. PREVENTIVE WAR !!!!! It will be one thing for this boy and his herd to protest a real war or the use of nuclear weapons. These weapons were never used, and that was the genius behind them. No side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what happened between the US and the USSR. <br /> <br /> Of course, the creators of this movie were meant for kids in America to take their cause and follow in Chuck's footsteps. However, kids in America are more intelligent than the left-hand coke that created this drink. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth only 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about the dangers of the nuclear war, stay with Dr Strangelove. </ br /> <br /> Mr. Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
