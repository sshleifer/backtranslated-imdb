Seriously - avoid this movie at any cost. I just saw it in my first sneak preview, and although I paid non-refundable money for it, I walked out of the theater after just 15 minutes. This already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends or not to go. First time I ever went out of a movie. And I lived by some pretty bad people. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies (and very bad ones), even though it's shown in its original language. It relies on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. On the army ("What do we do once we reach the campaign?" - "You're going out of the car and dying"; actually it's very funny to read here how it was delivered in the movie), on drugs ( An old man eats a "room biscuit", works very silly and misses his wedding or has to live completely - everything is badly written and performed), on women in the army ("Why do we just get trumpets? guns!" - "That's how that's how it stays "). Argh. Okay, you can actually find this funny, but in that case you make me scary. <br /> <br /> In addition, I performed better in the kind of soft porn movies you get on European late-night TV. So it played jokes (badly rendered), above average lower, acting lack, was poorly baptized and edited? It just didn't work. At least not at any level used as a partner for movies. <br /> <br /> I would even be as fat as saying this movie proves that there are people who can be much less funny zan's Germans. And it says something if you want stereotypes. (What I'm not doing, it's fun to play with them. Just if someone thinks I'm not enough PC.) <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, do something useful . Try to shrimp, paint your tennis balls in a very annoying color, disassemble your bike, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, turn to another religion and back. Keep on listening to "Last Christmas" by Wham! to endless repeats. Anything, but don't look at this horrible movie.
