This is the kind of movie that shows the paucity of the French movie when it comes to vibrators. The director's desire to sound like America is so scary you won't be deceived for a moment unless you've seen a serial killer movie "Peeping Tom". <br /> <br /> Two male policemen (or one and a half, more like you will see), horrible murders, a plot more complex than complex. Charles Berling is not happy with the genre. (see the astonishing stupid "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" a few years ago). The scenes with his pregnant wife - which is supposed to be a peer to the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot - are one of the worst ever filmed. Add a steaming love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 to attract the great adolescent audience. A great and absurd conclusion, followed by a silent epilogue that can make a fine commercial for the CÃ´te d'Azur, is really the silence of the lamb.
