I just finished watching "El Otro". I always have my hat off for Julio Chavez's performances as he is a good actor, but this movie is really depressed and slow. I think it would have been even worse if it wasn't for Julio. Anyway, this is definitely a movie you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I would recommend you not to rent this movie to have a nice time with your girlfriend , boyfriend, family or friends. ... it's really depressed and incredibly slow, and the plot doesn't make much sense either. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is drill and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. Overall, I definitely didn't like this movie.
