After enjoying Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones", I was interested, and I tried to sit down this second-string tournament, about an investigation into the death of a jockey - but I didn't make it to the end. . Arthur, photographed in a crazy movie magazine, wants both ex-husband William Powell or another shot at marriage, but I never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks (she's the one kind of heroine prone to comic curiosity, but once in a mortuary - like all women in these 30's comedies - she falls. William Powell reportedly had a great time with Mrs. Arthur to work, but you will never know the end result; they seem uncomfortable standing side by side, reluctant about their villain. The actor who plays Powell's valet is rude, and the pauses for the show are pregnant with discomfort.
