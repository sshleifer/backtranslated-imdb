All the X-Men movies were wonderful. And I mean everyone, including the long-hated X-Men 3. They have solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion) and a good storybook. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard this movie, was on production and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is The Fountain, but you won't hear from this movie if they talk about the actor) and his play is not what the movie screws up . <br /> <br /> The whole movie is plagued with many meaningless characters who add nothing to the plot (such as Blob or Gambit), which was thrown to allow fans to believe the filmmakers read the original cartoons. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of XMen, I've read a lot of their stories and this movie has not met them. None. Not even the continuity. It doesn't respect Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost. The motivation for wolverine is simply stupid and seen in millions of movies: Revenge for the death of a loved one. <br /> <br /> O. What I expected the whole darn movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine, similar to the one he had in X2 in school, when Stryker men entered and he alone enemy forces decimate, but hey, it's Fox, it's a family movie and you won't see explicit violence from the most violent and horrific miracle. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have had a sense of consistency with this movie because Wolverine's Origins has already been explained in X2, we already know how it has its adamantium skeleton so it doesn't make sense to make a movie of something we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters who doesn't need a solid back story. for mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker has his scars?
