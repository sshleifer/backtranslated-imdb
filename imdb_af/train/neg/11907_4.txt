I get it the Diehl character is a microcosm of America itself - to see Arab terrorists under each rock, just to find out that it is his own action that already has him in that siege and truly if he Everyone wants good and everything will be rainbows and lollipops. Sorry Wim you've made wonderful movies in the past that remain neutral from politics and controversy is your weak point and they weaken it a well-made, incredibly filmed movie with absurd characters, dialogue and plot. Good luck with your next movie. Another thing that made me crank was the particular point of the homeless part of LA being hungry there. These people don't get enough to eat. Surely these people do not eat properly, but the real hunger these people are a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a spiritual hunger. They need self-respect, self-worth, dignity that you cannot give a man. Yes, the people are hungry and if they need it, it is available. Less central to hunger in America, I would say it is more the center of alcoholism, drug abuse, spiritual suffering and economic destruction. To deal with hunger, although a noble pursuit, a more profound systematic society and age-old human problem of homelessness. Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute as the young, still (clicked) old soul.
