Someone else noticed when they were in the car every time the camera took a new angle, switching their roads. As in one scene, it is a one-story residential area with sidewalks. Then they are on a multiple lane with a divider, along a dual lane road with double yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget, but it was just a messy movie. <br /> <br /> I also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie. I think if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, you can enjoy this movie. However, if you find his job / not funny then I would recommend staying away from this one.
