This is one of the worst observations I've ever seen. I love Almereyda's Nadja, but it's just absolute drink. Apart from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music, this film is simply immovable acting and silly material. Jared Harris is especially bad, but no one in this one is well off. The plot is a joke, but not the haha ​​kind. I don't even know if you can forgive movies that are so bad. Please make the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director Nadja and Another Girl make Another Planet?
