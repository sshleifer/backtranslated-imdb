I don't know ... maybe it's because I'm Brazil, but all those things were too much. Too much love for the music, too many parties, too much contrast between the fun of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. Everything seems to me to be false: the families, the relationships, the music, the "happiness". It only sells a little taste of the fake Latin American culture. I must be honest: it has seduced me a bit, but who wouldn't be fooled by the false lives of good music, sex and parties? I'm not so stupid: what kind of world is this one in which people don't suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness and sexual transmitted diseases? I love the scene with Caridad's mother call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
