I saw this movie twice. I can't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I'm also a movie / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. It is no longer Romania, but I can see that the events occur in the same period with the incident from 11 September. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just empty images. <br /> <br /> What most Romans don't know, this movie is for French viewers, not for us. They really believe this is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I don't really know if we can call it a movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we have such an image in Europe. It was a reality, but it is no longer. A good friend of mine from the British embassy said, "You have no idea what a long Romanian people walked from Ceausescu".
