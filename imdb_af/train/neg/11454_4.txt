So I had low expectations for this movie to start with, but it didn't even. While there were a few funny parts, even one or two laughing out loud, this movie was terribly short of what I would call good. The funniest jokes were unexpected and very fast, and we sat down there. "WTF just happened?" In addition, there were some jokes that just dragged on and on. The part where he fell on the mountain grabbed me. Also editing was really lacking. There were a few poor stage transitions, but it seems to be the style of today. It made me laugh, but I won't see it again, and I'm really glad I waited to rent it. Give it a try, you may enjoy it, but don't think you're in the line of the 40-year-old virgin or Superbad.
