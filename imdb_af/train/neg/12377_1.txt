Just because someone is under the age of 10 doesn't mean they're stupid. If your child likes this movie, you can test him / her better. I am constantly amazed at how so many people can be involved in something so bad. This "movie" is a showcase for digital wizard and nothing else. The writing is terrible. I can't remember when I heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are over. The acting is subpar, but then the actors are not much given. Who decided to employ Joey Fatone? He can't sing and he's ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the obviousness of everything. It's as if the writers have gone out of their way to make it so stupid. Big children's films are bad, clever and full of white - films like Shrek and Toy Story in the past year, Willie Wonka and The Witches to name two of the past. But in the continual eclipse of the Americans, more like Nemo Finding (yes, it's right), the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and a crosshair like Red Riding Hood.
