And so the great rewriting of history is still Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> It was senseless ridiculous junk. <br /> <br /> It shocks me that such a wonderful amount of money can be spent producing what is the most sincere, poorly acted inaccurate movie I've ever seen. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage's short flirt with serious acting seems to be. I can only assume that leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in another litany of horrible movies. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy was no luck, she couldn't really act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself to work at such a time. <br /> <br /> Only recommended for those who either recover from a recent lobotomy or people believe that America invented the world.
