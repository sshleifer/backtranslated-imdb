I've been trying to watch this show several times, but for a show that shows the 70's, I don't have much of a few hairstyles and the occasional disco that discourages the 70's - the decade in which I grew up. Of the episodes I've seen, most of the plots and jokes can be set at any time. Remove the novelty of (supposedly) in the 70's, and the show isn't interesting or funny. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a show that represents the success of youth in America more successfully In the 70's, in my humble opinion, you can't do better than the "Wonder Years."
