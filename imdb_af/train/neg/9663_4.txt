How cynical are the authors to pander like this. I can be an American citizen, but I don't have to see other Americans knocking each other for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I am surprised that so few have commented on how completely jingoistic, sentimental and urgent the dialogue in this movie really is. The historical inaccuracy of the film is not as rough and offensive as in "U-571" (it changes British submarines to Americans), but you still walk away and feel a bit smart. Really, the Germans in this movie do nothing but admire the Americans between battles! How sad, unnecessary! I just want to say to the authors: for many of us it goes without saying that you can't catch real people with real-life problems under real pressure and you've taken very well-tested shortcuts. Fortunately for you, there are always nationalist utility jobs to appreciate your sugar cover.
