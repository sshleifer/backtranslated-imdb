Ok so here is the basic plot. This is 1933, Peter Sellers is dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who lived quite a while. The film begins with his birthday in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir that (even the film never calls) prolongs his life. Well, on this occasion the elixir is slapped by an assistant (Kato if you remember the Pink Panther movies) and he recommends his minions to get 6 rare items to make the elixir. It creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen eventually rob diamonds of diamonds and dare to meet with dr. Fu's nemisis, a retired Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith, also played by Sellers trying to stop him from stopping. to be a humorous comic adventure. <br /> <br /> It was obviously Sellers's last full-length movie he made before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Sellers who have such a gifted comedian and had memorable 'funny' roles in the Panther movies and party in the movie 'The Party' are anything but in this movie. This movie was absolute torture to go through and I couldn't even finish it. He was VERY BAD and I kept watching Sellers' performance. Having come to the great work of 'There There' a year ago, how do I mean HOW can he make it and HOW did this thing even make? As one person mentioned the first 10. 15 minutes is good, but then it's ALL DOWN ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like the pest. <br /> <br /> Rating 1 out of 10.
