I blindly bought this movie and am pretty upset that I have paid as much as I did, but I would say that it is at least worth a rental for some cool deaths and ridiculous. It's not a good movie in any way, but I have to say I was entertaining. I think it can be called so badly. It is good. <br /> <br /> As I said, the play is terrible, I feel like I could do a better job that at least shows some emotion. The story is nothing new and is better done. I think I just have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire-type movie. I will say rent or download, but definitely do not buy it. It's no longer worth a watch.
