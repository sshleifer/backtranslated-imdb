Will somebody tell Shaq to stick to what he's good at basketball. This movie wasn't even entertaining on a stupid level. In this movie, Shaq plays a genius living in a revival box, not a genius in a tree power instead of a lamp. He's supposed to play a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra. This movie has the most thin story since the water world, the acting was terrible and I think everyone who likes this flame will be afraid to admit it.
