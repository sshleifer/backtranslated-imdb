slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words describing the film of the book. This is certainly a case where the movie was never made at the expense of the book. The best part of the movie was the view, excellent. The worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors combined with endless meaningful looks. The editing is sudden and pathetic. Despite this, the actors worked very hard, at least trying to be a bit credible with a terrible writing. It was disturbing that although there was in Peru, there was hardly a Peruvian descent running around the set - even in the flashback scenes depicting Peru in the 17th century. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
