Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze is a terrible movie. Poorly written, exaggerated, and just stupid. It is said ... it's actually a fun movie on some level. This movie desires to be watched in a group with a good supply of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like "Santa Claus conquering the Martians" or "Yor, the Hunter from the Future" ... so bad it is pretty good. If you have the right group of people, this movie is a blast to watch. This is campy. It's fun. It has a theme by Sousa. However, if you are looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> VAT, I heard rumors a studio is investigating the possibility of a remake ...
