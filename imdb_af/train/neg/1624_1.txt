I saw this movie a few years back. I couldn't sleep and there was nothing. So I looked at it. What really gets me, doesn't make sense and that's why it's upsetting. Richard is tied up in chicken wire and Jarvis starts with Richard's girlfriend while she is unconscious. Then Jarvis's friend Troubador plays a dumb song on his guitar. By the next morning it shows Richard's girlfriend with Jarvis and Trouby and then she goes back to Richard and looks at him while he is still tied up. Then they play happy music and the movie is finished. I mean what happened? Did they lift up? And what did she say to the two guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? It is mysterious and too poor. I can't save movies and don't make sense. It was the worst movie I've ever seen since the 90's version of Lord of the Flies.
