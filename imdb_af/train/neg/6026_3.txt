* Review may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Predictable, campus, bad special effects. it felt a TV movie. The idea of ​​the UN as taken over by Satan is an interesting turn to the end of the world according to the Bible. The point of departure is interesting, but the exception falls short. If you want to convert people with Christianity to a movie like this, at least make it a good one! I checked my watch seriously while watching this piece of liquor. can't say much more about this movie as I've seen it more than a year ago, and there's not really much to say about this movie, except to beat it!
