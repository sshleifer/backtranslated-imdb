I'll be blunt and to the point. This movie is not good at all. The movie story of me hated the acting, essay, story, direction and almost all the editing. Amanda Peet proved she could act because she was a high point of 'The Whole Nine Yards'. So she had to avoid this movie with a ten footstool. The infantile part of me, however, found this movie very funny. If you can forget about the quality of the production, and if you find jokes funny, then you should do it. And for those who can't come from your pedestal, it's your choice. My inner child did not die, and I laughed a fair bit. Even then, just a 3 out of 10, because if a movie makes it really stink.
