The story was seen before, but it doesn't matter if you can figure out how to make a proper storyboard. It is clear that the director did not exercise his work on the storyboard. In addition, the cameraman spent too much time leaning corners that did not match the message of the movie. The funniest thing is, if you take a look at the website of the movie, you can read that it is right that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles. Because this reminds us of hunting. But I have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles ;-) It will have 1 star because the story is OK. It's a pity that Ti West didn't spend more time reviewing his story. It's as if the movie was more important than planning. Because you have a camera, it doesn't mean you have to make a movie right away ... come on. Everyone can make a movie, but not everyone will be just as good. Such a advice from Ti West is: stopping and labeling what you want. Use your time to plan and not to film until everything comes down to a storyboard. You definitely have the ability and desire - don't abuse your talent.
