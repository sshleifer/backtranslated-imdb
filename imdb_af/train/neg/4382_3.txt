The fifth "Black Emanuelle" I watched may have been the most intriguing plot line dealing with the fearless female reporter investigating the white slavery / prostitution racket taking her from San Francisco to Rome to Macao and returning to her own hometown, New York! The film is accompanied by former veterans of the series who inexplicably play different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (who appears here as head of the United Nations Third World Committee!), Karin Shubert (as a feminist contender) Don Powell (as Rassimov's driver. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as usual with this type of movie (despite being shown at night), it is very much edited and a particularly graphic scene (described in "Stracultr) in which" An Asian slave trader gets his arrival by being sodomized by a dog, is nowhere to be seen! Yet a disturbing sequence is left in the film when a messy politician puts some girls (including of course Gemser and Shubert) a midnight rendezvous under a New York bridge with a group of bombs (that's the way he gets their voices, get it!) - with his high society's bitter-looking pals, almost looks intact. The most ridiculous element of this entry - apart from Gems there is a privilege to make a house every time (even for perfect strangers) (even for perfect strangers). her outing to India to interrogate a charlatan / guru (George Eastman has significantly C became hilarious!) who found a way to extend coitus indefinitely; of course, when Emanuelle gets him, he ends with premature ejaculation ... !!
