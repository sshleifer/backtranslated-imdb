Everything about this movie is pork. Spicy acting, terrible dialogue, ugly native girls. this movie is sinking in oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director had to have been a weekend striker. Robert C. is completely lost and has no idea what is going on. The college kids are the worst. No acting talent whatsoever, very stupid reasoning, and just right dumbbells. Special effects are for the birds. The so-called security force around this park belongs in toy ground: with foolish looking guns, walkie talkies that are useless; and a computer system with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and does not work; why do potential customers bother until everything is done. the authors must be the first victims of the mess with the producers and crew members. The whole movie should be shot in a septic tank shot at another planet to watch. What a jewel. Convicts should watch it so they can commit suicide.
