I really didn't like this movie ... mainly because of the main characters! They are both immature, selfish and self-centered people. They hurt EVERYONE to play their stupid game. The visual effects were good, but how good are they if there are no characters that you associate with or a story that is interesting. Should I be happy if these two psychologists, FINALE, exacerbate their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I thought, "It's supposed to be the # 1 smash of France?" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> As for the end: GOOD RIDDANCE! They both earn each other! <br /> <br />
