It's not a movie, it's an 111-year-old Evangelical Christian sermon that has been draped over red state America's # 1 sport, high school football. Another of the long, serious messages to the converts who are supposed to be far enough to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbors. <br /> <br /> Dialogue like "You won the big one when you accepted Christ" lost any possible appeals by the alarming intensity in director / coach Alex Kendrick's sunken black eyes. Then there are the "parables". <br /> <br /> Two farmers prayed for rain, but only one prepared his field to receive it. Which one do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question is intended to obscure the miraculous climax, in the course of which Coach asks his brave backup kicker: "Sun, do you think God can help you make that kick?" This is the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faith-based funding ad infinitum, if only the Evangelical Christian Bush administration's hegemonic pursuit around the world convinced us all to be "committed" to their example. See the poor Giants coaching in the apocalyptic final, and ask his team to cry: "Who's with me!" while the dedicated Eagles, on the other hand, quietly did the work of the Lord. <br /> <br /> So do you think our horrible backup kicks to conquer the self-centered Goliaths? Well, we all know that zealots cannot lose. Put it like this: Transfer the playing field to the deserts of the Middle East, replace the Christian proselytizing, and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a Taliban versus superpower parable, which may want to think of the devoted worshipers of this garbage About a minute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, they won't mind and shouldn't: as the coach tells his team to pregame seriously empty vessels, the answers are here in this book. And Christian Law will consume it on their way to their Rapture, the final victory for which they have prepared their fields.
