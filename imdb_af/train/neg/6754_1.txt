The only reason I comment on this movie is to save you 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. <br /> <br /> I bought it for Â£ 3.00, it looks interesting, so I have a chance. <br /> <br /> Within minutes of turning it on, I realized I was making a mistake. The entire casting must be stored away until winter and then thrown onto the nearest wood fire, where they can meet more of their kind. <br /> <br /> As far as the Devin Hamilton (Author and Director) is concerned, he should only be shooting, unfortunately it had to be done before he made this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you see it running in stores. <br /> <br /> 1/10
