Without repeating what was said about this movie above, I would like to add that I was looking forward to this movie ... the cast / location and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc. ... It had a vague shadow from Look at the storyline from the beginning. A stay in different surroundings (Italy again) to reduce the sadness of the loss ... or maybe I saw it? That's why I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and to make a move on what we expected to happen to this family in a strange European country ... and I sat there and sat down there. .. and guess what? nothing really happens! and i mean nothing !! You don't even get the chance to enter the characters, because they are so one-dimensional and empty. You are led to believe in the pass of the movie that something will happen that will turn the whole movie upside down ... The oldest girls flirt with the local vespa boys, had a lot of room to put the movie in a take another direction. The latest girls' visions of her dead mother eventually became a fruitless and useless exercise. The fathers are trying to be seduced by one of his female students. feels ridiculous given his age. It seemed as if the script had a final revocation, where they decided at the last moment to eradicate any story to the story and enforce it for a minimal to no effect. When the credits start rolling (unexpectedly), you can't help but spend your time robbing, and look at this stack of garbage.
