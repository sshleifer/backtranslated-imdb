It really does not correspond to Cagliostro Castle. Lupine is not as funny or wacky or hyperactive. The scenery and music are uninspired and the plot is just not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this 'un' is the nudity (only in the unhealthy version) provided by Fujiko. It helped to clear up some of the boring scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and made the movie for some imaginative pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very lively or attractive. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen don't even offer decent party entertainment. It is as if they are only fulfilling a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But a strange thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or time code that appears on the player as soon as it is inserted. Although you can still switch to the next scene number with the remote control.
