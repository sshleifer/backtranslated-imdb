Hip. Erotic. Bad sexy ... whatever. This is "The Terminator" with werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. The police are saving the girl (waitress!) From the big monster and referring to herself as her "protector". Chief actor Ryan Alosio does a good job of emulating Kyle Reese ... there is a massacre in a police station ... the bad man is muscular with red eyes ... and even contains a dialogue the hand of "You said it yourself, he will never ever stop. The scary script comes from a first-rate screenwriter who, thanks to God, did not sell anything and it is all thrown by well-known bad director Richard Friedman <br /> <br /> The movie opens in a strip bar (always a good sign), and an average bikerman jumps in for no apparent reason, followed by three policemen, one of whom is black, and (shock shock!) Is he the one killed in the first five minutes, the movie going down the next hour, then picking up a few decent action sequences before finishing it all with a deviant end . <br /> <br /> Most of the time, the role-player comes over as skilled actors do what they can with a bad slap. if and a director who is willing to settle down. If nothing else appears to be learning how to act in this movie, and Alosio, along with some of the supporting role-playing games, shows signs of talent. Dark wolf in his human form is played by giant Kane Hodder - known for his numerous portrayals of Jason Vorhees in the 'Friday the 13th' movies. He is decent enough, especially since he is not used to roles. <br /> <br /> It became known among groups of horny teens for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, which made her a few times in the great tradition of former Power Rangers actresses. And it is unknowable that the editor spent too much time on the scene ... Anyway, the main reasoning feature is that the physical werewolf effects are pretty good and the design of the wolf is not bad at all. But the CGI is bad. Just plain bad. I mean seriously, if you can't achieve some realism - why bother? Just put some extra money into the makeup! Apart from the terrible writing, this movie has its moments, many of which are inadvertently funny. It's good for a laugh if you have nothing better to do, but just don't spend money on it. Please.
