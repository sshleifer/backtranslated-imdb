What a terrible movie. Rotting tomatoes also had a good score for this. don't be fooled by the positive comments; It wasn't scary. It wasn't funny. It wasn't smart. It won't even pay attention to you. I just wasted 2 hours of my life, and watch this crap fix. The computer-generated monster was interesting to see the first few times. After about 15 minutes, it is no longer entertained. The dialogue was terrible, must be a translation case. Another negative that stood out was the idiot Americans. 3 is depicted and they all lack character, intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a few lines to fill it as we need 10. The employees at the video store had to knock me off to bring this title to the counter.
