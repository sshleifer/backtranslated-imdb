This valued production has its fans. But to paraphrase the classic bad review of 'Mary Reilly', Moby Dick is like a painting, but slower. <br /> <br /> This is because the philosophical grounds for a movie "production" never make a good movie, rather it is the lack of a strong lead idea (in this case for a book transmission to replace film with a list of hopelessly atomized, non-dynamic but brilliant faces in an attempt to make viewers think they have seen greatness. As viewers and critics can fall for it, Oscars follows, feeding the whole dumb comparison. <br /> <br /> I don't share the pleasure of all these reviewers. Moby Dick is incredibly tireless. Writers make posters about Jonah, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick, conscientious. All things that can't react and one doesn't absorb in the slightest. This is dramatically inert. It doesn't build. In narrative terms, Moby Dick (like a movie) is a little more than a preliminary conclusion in search of a real story. After half an hour I mumbled. "Oh, fantastic ... another oath ... another 4-minute soliloquy!" <br /> <br /> In the unsuccessful attempt to engage you, it is a beautiful, campy, exaggerated showcase. Very gray hair here. Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!) <br /> <br /> One looks at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than repeating the feelings of someone else's paintings and palette, or relieving a classic balm like Huston here. . Paintings and books are nice, but they are a different medium. A movie like this doesn't understand that an honestly nice piece of crap (Village of the Damned) is in most respects better than an insatiable piece of culture. This is the school for eating your vegetable from film. <br /> <br /> One appreciates the work that had to be done to make the movie, but not the narrative. Only a few segments that reflect maritime research are interesting; the inclusion of shanties as a way of structuring work and various marine efforts; and the whale hunting technology. And it doesn't ask for a two-plus-hour movie.
