... so I thought I'd say a few words about William McNamara. Not a bad way to spend a few hours if you want to see him in his feelings - it's obvious that he has pumped for this role and he looks pretty good at them - or less. There is an extensive order in a cave where he has to come down to his bottom. There is a nice little bit that he has to chase after Miss Eleniak in the dull, with only his hands over his groin. Of course, William McNamara is a bit on the slim side, but he has a nice, generous handful of booty. Also, there is a moment when he goes out of bed, if you stop the action at the right moment, you can see the whole enchilada. If you are inclined to do so and come up, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy men are on a road trip. I just want to thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity, generous nudity. Can William McNamara Act? Heck if I know.
