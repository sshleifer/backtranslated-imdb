I have no idea why they made this version of "Persuasion" when they already had that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose they wanted to make a version of the feature length, but of course many had to be removed; unfortunately, who ended up in the classroom floor was all the lovely humor and humor, leaving a movie that was just melodrama, rather than an entertaining exposition of English land manners and mores. <br /> <br /> The characters were also level and uninteresting. They searched poor Anne afterwards in the streets after Captain Wentworth looked like a stupid, modern adolescent (and if you are a stupid, modern adolescent, read it, let me tell you: run to a man like a woman in heat is not cool). This is something that a well-known woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this lucky heroine. <br /> <br /> Some people said they found this antic laughing. My response was not laughter but outrage. The idea of ​​such an Austen work corruption is contemptuous. <br /> <br /> It was terrible.
