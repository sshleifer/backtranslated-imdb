In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I couldn't find too much about To Paris With Love. I'm sure Guinness did the film to get a free trip to Paris from there. The movie has no other reason for existence. <br /> <br /> Of course, Paris is beautifully photographed with the wonderful opening of Guinness and his son who drive down the Champs Elysee with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it goes from there. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry at all between Guinness and the young girl he has in Paris. According to the recent biography of Guinness by Piers Paul Read, Guinness denied the girl positively, found her actions unprofessional. What Odile Vernois thought of her co-star is no record available. They have as much chemistry as two neutered cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good moment in the movie straight from one of his Ealing comedies as he climbs a tree to find a badminton shot. But I won't wait for the movie. <br /> <br /> At least Alec has a trip to Paris outside of the deal.
