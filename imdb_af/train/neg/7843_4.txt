It's a weak sequel: it has the interest and light touch of the beautiful "Man Called Horse" in almost every aspect, and compared to one another it hardly looks like the same genre. <br /> <br /> The proceeds are almost a parody of the first and are trying to call on various Indian ceremonies, but pretend it's too difficult to bottle the magic of the first. In this film, the tribe is lost and abandoned, after losing their homelands, modern life has faced paradise and they are living in great misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film has taken us to a place we want to be, a simpler time. This brings us to the broken Indians in an unhappy world and the White Man is the hero and savior who denies the whole idea of ​​the film rather. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first lies in the fact that the white man is learning and discovering that true civilization lies in values ​​rather than Western materialism. In the second film it is all but missing and so we end up with a poor film. <br /> <br /> A great disappointment.
