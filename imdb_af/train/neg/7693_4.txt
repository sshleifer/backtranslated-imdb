Is there something happening in this movie that is NOT predictable? I do not think so. The movie is basically cliché to cliché and really nothing ever comes as a surprise. This makes the movie extremely predictable and therefore the film is also seriously lacking in tension. So it is not tension and unpredictability, but even as a drama it is a failure. This is because the film is highly unlikely. I mean, this can never happen in real life, just as the events in this movie occur. So the movie has a real tension and credibility problem. <br /> <br /> But it's really the cliches that killed the movie. It was temporary at times. Everything is so formative in this movie. The predator is portrayed as a cool heartless, almost psychopathic like sexual frustrated boy and victim as a naive young woman acting as if she had not seen this. Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and it all happened for a reason. Like the order in which the "predator" fixes the "victims" broken car. It must be one of the oldest clichés in the book. I knew what the movie was after. I tried to look as if the teacher and the student had really grown to one another, through the eyes of the other people around them. It was so incredibly obvious and inexpensive that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie to that point. The movie is filled with moments like this. <br /> <br /> The title may suggest that it is a cheap porn movie, but it's actually made a lot of fun for TV movies. This means that everything is slow and the film spends time on character development and unnecessary subplots to make the movie even more drama. <br /> <br /> I will admit that Elizabeth Berkley is doing pretty well in this movie. She makes the clichés and events sometimes seem almost realistic. Her Hollywood career is as good as over after she appeared in the Paul Verhoeven movie "Showgirls", so unfortunately she will probably only appear in movies and television shows like this one. It is a waste of her talent and she deserves better. All the other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier plays the cliché beautiful 'untouchable' rich boy and the way the man of the main character is portrayed is even worse. He looks more like a sexually frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie. Anyway, he tries sex with his wife in every row. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before he goes to bed, he wants sex. He came home, he wanted sex. It may be a realistic thing, but I don't know, it just doesn't feel right for a movie like this and the story in general. <br /> <br /> A Cliché-filled movie and I can't think of For any reason someone should ever watch this movie. It is predictable and therefore lacks tension and credibility. Not a "horrible" movie and it's definitely a viewable one, but all the bad and cliché elements in the movie also make it far from a recommendable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
