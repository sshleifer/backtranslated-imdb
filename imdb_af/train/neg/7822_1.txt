This movie is a very poor attempt to earn money using a classic theme. I loved Superman movies, but this one made me shoot. Very poorly acting, far-reaching special effects, and a plot equal to zero. To sum up: The superman leaves the earth because scientists have discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (duh), don't tell his girlfriend anything before he left (duh again), take off in a spaceship (?!?), I think back 5 years later, looking forward to joining his girlfriend again (who is now racing his son, which boy, in my humble opinion, is at least 7 years old old). And how about Lex Luthor? Growing a new continent to sell land? Please !! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie just because I'm not allowed to vote. If you have anything to do with your time, this movie will not be seen. And even if you have nothing else to do, stay home and watch television!
