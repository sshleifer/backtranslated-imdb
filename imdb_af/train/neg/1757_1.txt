Don't get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If there was one man who earned his gold medal at the Olympic Games, it was Dan. <br /> <br /> But how can Bill Corcoran make such a bad movie about the amazing Dan Jansen story, because the real Dan Jansen story is truly incredible! Especially when you watch this movie through a sportsman's eyes, everything is wrong, the way Matt Keeslar and the other actors skate, their technique, the dimensions of the transfer sketch, is wrong! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
