There is a lot of love placed in West Anderson's "Fantastic Mr Fox". Unfortunately, all the love for himself is. Granted, there has been a lot of time and effort to make this so self-conscious peculiar universe, but if just the same time and effort is put into writing to try to make it, it's funny. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and that's what West Anderson could do. <br /> <br /> The animation is good in the near shots of the animals, but when the camera is farther away everything gets really hard on the eyes and to be completely honest, it looks like a bit of a rubbish. There was also nothing special about the acting, with West deciding to choose his friends and big names about more specialized voice actors that could make the movie better. I'm pretty sure George Clooney's voice show consists of two cameo appearances in South Park, one of them where he played a dog. <br /> <br /> The movie is too obscure and trying too hard to be smart and otherwise it is typical, although the film is set in England, all good animals are typical Americans playing baseball. The bad guys are stereotypical English with the most offensive English accent. I can't emphasize how much time wasting this movie is. I didn't even laugh.
