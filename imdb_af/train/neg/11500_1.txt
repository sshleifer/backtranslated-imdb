This move is slow, plowing, cold, dark, and without a plot or hope. It follows the tried and true European formula that they like to subsidize, it is never seen, but the critics think it makes an important point. <br /> <br /> The film is valuable as nothing but the big difference in thinking between Americans and Europeans in terms of employment. In this movie, men are still nursing their wounds years ago and feel it is the government's duty to provide their jobs. Knowing in the US, we have to go outside and create value for someone. <br /> <br /> Spain has never looked back!
