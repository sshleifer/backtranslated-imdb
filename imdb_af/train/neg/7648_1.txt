It is considered fashionable to highlight every social evil caused by patriarchy and male domination, but moronies can be this illogical "logic." In the story and theme of the film, however, there is no gray area and the woman called the film's antagonist is the '' villain of the story ''. Under no circumstances can what she justified. Sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with reality. It is betrayal of the ultimate kind. The man eventually spent his resources and time wasting another's offspring. To top it all off, the weakest of the arguments saturated by the 3 'liberated' female characters in the climax is pathetic. A woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and betray her husband and worse. There are no other children. So essentially his life was wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations lead to the execution of the unjust.
