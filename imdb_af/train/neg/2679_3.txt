(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "action" (and I use the term loose) that I've been trying for more than a year. I finally came to the end and now I wish I didn't make the repeated effort. <br /> <br /> In an effort to save two hours of your life, I'm going to tell you he has "returned a man who has the ability to make a long blade out of his arm. to see his mother. Things get ugly after being beaten by the mafia boyfriend of an old girlfriend. He takes revenge on the man when he brings the girl home. The guys-mafia mother sent her men out to get revenge while police were also looking for him. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. No explanation is really given for anything (such as why their ID friend closes in an asylum) and the action, for the most part, is all out of the screen. The movie consists mainly of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody, who looks intense and doesn't say anything, kills people (off the screen, most of the action goes off-screen). It looks good, well behaved and there was some kind of reason for it, it could be a good movie. Hell, I would have liked to have true character development or back story (all we know is that the man was picked up as a child). The movie runs the better part of two hours and it feels like she is six. If they didn't tell us anything, they could get the pass, so it looked like it was moving too fast. No, we get the hero on a boat. The hero in a bus, the hero walks, the hero seems disturbed. She met his girlfriend. This really irritated me as I think it could be a good movie if they just did something or someone actually said something meaningful than giving instructions to get this guy. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 It's about four hours (all my efforts to see it). I will never come back. Only for those who want to see a Russian action movie with very little action
