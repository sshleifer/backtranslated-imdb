This is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last. This time the spoof is mainly on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some strange reasons. In my opinion, this movie was very useless and unnecessary and not even funny. Maybe I laughed three times and that's not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two, but this one was just stupid. If your jokes consist of bodies to store and people are constantly throwing things at each other, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if you stay smart enough at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies, they only get 3/10 worse.
