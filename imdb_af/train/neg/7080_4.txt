This movie could have been an interesting character study and could have provided insight into its subject, but the real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have it. It gives no insight or solutions to the problem. It's just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addict and the problems it creates for his daily life and family. Why would you want to see it? It's all so useless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> It also really doesn't help that the main character is a wrinkly 50+ year old man. You will find it difficult to identify and sympathize with him. He looks just like a dirty old playboy, who is a constant hunt for woman and sex. He has all kinds of sexual intercourse about 3 times a day with different women and not just with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It also doesn't have a bad visual style, though it feels a bit forced. But it's better than most other direct-to-video productions. Who knows, if the filmmakers got better material to work with, the movie would have earned a better faith. <br /> <br /> The story actually gets ridiculous. There are really a few pointless plot lines that are often lighter than they were supposed to be. For example, I'm talking about the whole Ordell plot line. Things get worse when the movie starts to end. Also, the whole way the story is told, back and forth between events that happened and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist feel a little cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But as far as bad movies are concerned, it's just not one of them. It's not really better or worse than any other random movie with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> It looks rather weird and quite amazing that they managed to get Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. a simple little insignificant production like this one. Guess they were really desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
