I'm not as sweet as Love Sick as I image. Eventually, the film became the sexual relationship of Alex, Kik, Sandu, their triangular love, full of perseverance, frustration and jealousy. In the end, Alex woke up and realized that they would not have the result and future. The action was sad. <br /> <br /> The director Tudor Giurgiu was in the AMC theater on Sunday, 12:00 on 08/10/06. We watched the movie with us. After the movie, he told the audience that the purpose of creating this film that would express the sexual relations of Romanian was kind of difficult. <br /> <br /> In my view, sexual life is always complicated everywhere, I don't feel a specific impression and effect from the movie. The love story of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu, were kind of nearby neighborhood story. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons I don't like this movie are firstly the movie didn't tell us how they fell in love? It looks as if Alex went to the building where Kiki lived, then two girls fell in love. It doesn't make sense at all. How a girl in love with a man fell in love with another girl. Too many fragments, you need the image and connect the stories through your mind. Secondly, the whole movie didn't have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, that's what I was waiting for? However, it was still a few things that were deserved to recommend. The part of the "piercing" was interesting. Alex was prepared to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love. It was a pleasant scene that gave you some idea of ​​their love. Also, the scene of them was in the soccer field, the conversation expressing their love was truth and passionate.
