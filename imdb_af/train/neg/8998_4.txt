Stephen Feinberg, who played the Proctologist and was one of the authors of the movie, died early in 2006. I met in 1993 in Portland. It was a year later when he told me that he was a writer in Hollywood earlier. , mostly works on TV promotions. He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I've seen it! Actually, I have seen it for years when it was released. At that time I didn't think it was such a movie. However, if I saw it as an adult, my opinion was somewhat different. Yes, it is a bit puerile as well as dated. Steve admitted it was not a very good movie. He said he was just a little proud of 'The Proctologist' sketch.
