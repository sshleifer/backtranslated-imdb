In the beginning I look like an interesting movie, a Spanish thriller in an interesting current Madrid, but it's really nothing, it's actually a film that is just interesting for future movie directors, and learns how not to film don't make it. In other words, it's not worse, even the presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 dollar used to watch this movie. The play is horrible and the actors seem to be only getting ready to go home the day, lead it to nowhere and are boring, poor and bad, don't spend time or money on this movie.
