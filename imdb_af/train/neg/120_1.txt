When I first saw a look at this movie, I soon noticed the actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely horrible. Lucille Ball was an amazing comedian with incredible talent. To think of a legend like Lucille Ball portrayed as she was in the movie is terrible. I can't believe all the actresses in the world who could play a lot better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She may be a good actress in other roles, but playing the role of Lucille Ball is difficult. Finding Lucille Ball is pretty difficult, but at least they can find someone similar in body and talent. If you saw York's representation of Lucy in episodes of Love Lucy as of the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is in any way similar - her expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> To finish it all, playing Danny Pino Desi Arnaz is terrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He is small and slim, his accent is unreal, and again, his play is incredible. Although Fred and Ethel were not equal, they weren't as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. <br /> <br /> Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A & E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book by Lucille Ball himself, or find PBS's American masters: Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, "Before the Laughter" will be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to this. At least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.
