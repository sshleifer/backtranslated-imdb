Soft SPOILERS contain. I spoil this movie to make you see it. <br /> <br /> Jet Li's movies fall into one of two categories: Shaolin-era films and movies that turn into contemporary Hong Kong around Triads or Triad like organizations. Each genre has its best and worst movies. "Twin Warriors" is Jet Li's best Shaolin era flick while "The Evil Cult" is the worst. "Fist of Legend" while in the recent past is the best 'modern era' Jet Li movie. "Black Mask" is without a doubt the worst. <br /> <br /> Jet Li plays a self-contained mercenary who receives an injection that gives him abundant abilities but shortens his life span. In his "new life" in exile, he plays a pacifist librarian. When his old mercenary goes on a disaster, Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them. He downsized a very silly corrugated cardboard mask to hide his police (and public) identity as a librarian, as well as to hide his true identity from his former comrades in the arms. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was baptized and horrible about it. Why does Jet Li hold his gambling co-worker hostage if he is a pacifist? Is there a love story between them? Why does the police chief not care when he learns about the Black Mask's true identity? The plot is just plain BAD. Bad through the superhero cheesiness, bad in the sense that characters have never been properly developed, bad in his character interactions, all done by a half-explained story that I quickly lost interest. <br /> <br /> The action and martial arts sequences are beyond the top. Many blood, gore (unfinished body parts), explosions and Matrix-style superhuman martial arts phascos are present in the film. Unfortunately, it's the best movies and only point of sale. If you want to see Jet Li deliver a vigilant superhero in a Mission Impossible movie "Black Mask". For the rest of our Jet Li fans, it's a real disappointment. It's one of those movies where Jet Li never becomes Jet Li: he doesn't get the chance to love us with his character, nor the chance to impress us with his impressive but realistic martial arts ability. <br /> <br /> Normally, a Ozzy Osbourne Chinese knockoff would be enough to enchant me in a movie, but Black Mask was unfortunately an exception to that rule. In fact, the antagonist of this movie, as he dressed, looks like his long straight hair and brand-round sunglasses like the modern Ozzy Osbourne. But the villain is not long enough on the screen to make the gimmick worthwhile. I suppose Ozzy's appearance was intentional; In addition to the villain's appearance, he also raced a satanic look. So much more could be made of the Ozzy Osbourne villain snoop! If only the author, director or ANY had a backdrop to develop the character of the film's arc trench! <br /> <br /> "Black Mask" was the first video released on video in the US on Jet Li. to Lethal Weapon 4, and I'm glad I stayed away till now. It may have ruined my whole perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Li at its worst, rent "Black Mask" and "The Evil Cult" and make it a double function or horror, deliberate and unintentional. Unlike the movements that use Jet Li's talents, they have semi-well-thought-out and likely sites. 3/9 stars.
