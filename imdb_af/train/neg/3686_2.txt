I'm surprised everyone (even the critics) thinks it was a good movie. It was the most cleaved thriller ever made that I saw. We have the "bad guy" that the "good guy" (or girls in this case) wants to do or have something to do. The "good girl" in this movie must use her clever and skill to defeat the bad man and save the day and her loved ones. Use charisma, bravery and even happiness to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (good name) at an airport. One coincidence leads to another and soon the lot seems to bring these two together. Sharing drinks sitting next to each other seems to be in every way ... Is there more to this stranger? Can these two be meant for each other? Does 'fate' have a reason for their strange and random encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, it seems sorry, yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him kill the Director of Home Security by moving him from one room to another so his men can start attacking him. Oh, if she doesn't, then her father is dead. Although we never learn the exact reasons why and what is really behind this madness, Jackson explains more about how it is going to happen and why it is in Lisa's best interest to help him. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa defeats his evil plans with her grief and puts him in the neck, letting him go over chairs and hitting him with a hockey stick. Oh, and before that, she drove him on a wild yacht through the Miami airport where she passed, and he stole a car she used later to run over the man ordered to kill her father. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> First, I find it strange that a man like Jackson who can get his hands on high technology needs the help of a hotel manager. Can't he just sneak a bomb into the building? Wouldn't it make him and his team safer by leaving out any third parties? And why do characters like Jackson explain everything they are going to do to someone who threatens them? Doesn't it make it easier for them to stop by the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did their best to take into account the movie they gave. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still watching actors. I also believe that Jayma Mays (who played the 'lovely' Cynthia) will be someone we will see more. It's just too bad that they all got stuck here. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
