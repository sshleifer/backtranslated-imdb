For the hard-hearted Judy Garland fans. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady (you've all seen the pictures), and a nice good number at the end. There are some scenes where the lines are funny. But basically, the writing is so bad and the movie is so dated that it's hard not to cringe through the horror. But it's worth buying the movie. Just be prepared to progress quickly.
