I went to see the D war on an invasion and with very low expectations. The movie did not meet them. <br /> <br /> I don't care about stories that are credible - remember Reign of Fire? - But I expect them to be internally consistent. This movie jumps from villain to crying without breathing, and everything varies from special effects far behind the LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A formally-shifting mystic warrior from Korea, with a wonderful mood in a Caucasian antique dealer and dolls like Deus ex Machina to get the unfortunate protagonists out of their latest mess. A special FBI agent apparently portrayed entirely on the old Korean folklore because of the Fed's excellent "paranormal division" - which has so far remained unlimited. Lovers kiss on deserted beaches where one exclaims: "I never meant that would happen." A reincarnated pair of long-dead Koreans who died "like star-crossed lovers." Mysterious pendants, sightless hordes of robot soldiers (who owe much to Peter Jackson's Orcs) and a snake that wastes so much time that every time the chosen prey is reached, something comes together to derive it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, the acting wood and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, boring. For me, however, the crowning moment was at the end, after the final, when the music was for the closing credits - Arirang! It's rather like Akira Kurosawa's closing "Ran" with a karaoke version of My Way - and let me be clear that I am by no means comparing the director Shim of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> In short, a self-reliant, indifferent collection of clich√©s and narrative non-sequiters that can appeal to the meaning of the melodramatic as common in Quran-popular culture, but the price of the ticket may not be worth a serious filmmaker, or even a non-serious filmmaker. I suggest that it completely bypass the movie theaters and go straight to the video, but I'm not even sure it's worth that much.
