The point of departure was intriguing, but unfortunately this movie just doesn't do right. The casting was pretty good and it was beautifully shot - but stylistically, much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized quick editing was done there, it had no effect.) I waited for Steven Bochco to walk in the credits being followed by a commercial), characters are exclusively identified by using cookies on the screen (and almost everything for Boogie Nights for character development) and no characters to draw the viewer into the story. A very forgotten movie.
