Steve Carpenter can't make horror movies. First of all, the casting was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown, haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. These movies have no gore (usually an important ingredient of a horror movie), no action, no acting, and no tension (also an important ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he is so dry and clear that it is sad. There were a few parts that were supposed to be funny (the teenage horror / comedy films) and no one laughed at the audience. I thought this movie was classified R, and I didn't pay attention and realized it was changing to PG-13. Anyway, see this movie if you liked that I still know what you did last summer. It is the only kind of person who will find this movie even remotely. And seriously, it's for you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
