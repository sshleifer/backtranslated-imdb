Good. It wasn't a surprise. many people will tell you it's gory. but they all speak "shiztz" this movie is very slow. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy who makes a conspiracy to call no pain. He called it "my son" there are some greedy scenes, but I found their kind poor. You can just overshoot 40 minutes and come to the eyeball scene that was surprisingly impressive and sick. There are some very faint scenes in this. and they beat over the hits and hit with stupid false bangs that made me laugh! I would not recommend it. Keep watching gore dogs. <br /> <br /> See if you want the 20-10 minute final scene that is not so wonderful and has a random scene of the man who wants to rape his rape.
