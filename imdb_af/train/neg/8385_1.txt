I just realized I was watching this movie, losing valuable precious moments of my life. I will never come back. This film is not only poor. It reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia thinks it's a race problem, apparently "White" doesn't like it because it doesn't have white actors. Mate, I think you'll find the reason why nobody liked it so much, because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and more fun than this pile of bravery. <br /> <br /> Please stop making crap movies.
