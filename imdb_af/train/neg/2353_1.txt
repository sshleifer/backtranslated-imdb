Madhur gave us a powerful movie in the past, Chandni Bar. His next film was one of the worst movies of all time. It apparently tells the story of some high class people in India. After seeing a scene where the man forced another man for sexual reasons for Star in a Movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidentally, I did. The reason why the film contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. I literally threw up and was shocked to see a movie with bare children. Very disturbing things, it was not necessary to show the children fully naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell to foreign people, British men in this movie. I'm shocked to know this movie was a hit in parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in the UK, USA and Australia. I'm from the UK, and these kinds of things make me sick, shouldn't be released from the UK.
