Alan Alda plays the actual "Sports Illustrated" writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions soccer team as an honorary member. On the contrary, uncompelling drama, which is curiously tempered with fantasy. Director Alex March takes an interesting attack on this material, shoots it in a quasi-documentary manner (with macho commentary) and yet gives the story a touch of Capraesque whimsy; Nevertheless, by bringing out the flashy movie in this setting, he is turning the main story into a boost. Alda's unfortunate, unkarmatic performance is another disability, although the supporting role-player is full of real pro-athletes (and Lauren Hutton scans as Alda's girl - how's that fantasy?). * 1/2 of ****
