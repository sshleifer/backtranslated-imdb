I didn't see very low budget movies that I have to admit, but it's probably the worst movie probably, the main character the old man spoke, he had a lobotomy, and lost power every 5 seconds more than one word to speak, a 5 year old can perform better. The story had the most horrible plot, and the army did well. He thought it was army and then he just looked over the top. I just looked at how bad it was and hoped it was on the right movie. . I can't believe it was under the 2 night rent thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take it for free and get it from our eyes. I think there was one semi-decent actor except the woman, I think the only good thing about the budget was the make-up, but they show every important scene of the movie in the beginning. Very terrible.
