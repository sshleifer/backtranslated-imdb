'Metamoprhis' is the story of a young young scientist honored in the local college. This is being investigated by financial providers for college. It forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad-Hollywood melodramatic fashion. <br /> <br /> My first thought to this movie's conclusion was that. "Not good, but not bad, for early to mid eighties." Of course, I realized that it was made in 1990, which almost made it a '4', but decided to keep it on mediocre '5'. <br /> <br /> 'Metamorphis' looks like a good movie a few times desperately trying to get out. The acting, while not starring, is usually competent. You can even see the occasional gloss of a modest quality. Pacing is a big problem with the movie. After I thought I realized ninety minutes, I realized I had only watched an hour. Special effects are not sterile, but the director mostly appears competent enough to bring about that weakness. <br /> <br /> The head, a lightly charismatic man who wants to avoid a mixed channel of Tom Cruise and Christopher. Reeves, mostly reminds me of Matt Dillon's character in 'Wild Things'. The female heroine does an OK job but does not distinguish her anyway. There is a "naughty girl" role here, and the actress does what she can, but it doesn't look that much. There is a child actor who cannot decide the director whether he is mean, cheerful or just strange. <br /> <br /> Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem with this movie for a final battle with the bad guy who will blush a Power Ranger. It is bizarre and inexplicable to the final scene that must be dramatic, but only hilarious, saturated with every bad camera trick and overwork that can be compressed in about thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> A decent one-off look at the Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack. Nothing to bring you back, and nothing to buy yourself.
