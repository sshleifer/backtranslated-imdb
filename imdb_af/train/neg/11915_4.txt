The obvious pilot for an unproductive TV series features the young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some incredible forces to be used when a runaway man releases the world be. The CGI is par for a TV work, and Appleby is OK as an amnesiac, but hard to swallow as a superhero. Well-known TV face Richard Burgi is together for Appleby's mentor, but he can't do anything to raise this drink above the mediocre level. We see too much of the cartoonish flying demon from the beginning, a bad sign. Also, the screens where Burgi Appleby trains for battle are actually laughing. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other films, especially REMO WILLIAMS.
