Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was once responsible for some of my favorite horror movies ever (such as the Edgar Allen Poe "Masque of the Red Death" and "Pit and the Pendulum"), as well as some indifferent cheap and sticky garbage (such as "Creature of the Haunted Sea "and" She Gods of the Shark Reef "). Corman also made some movies that are simply unbeatable and ?? simply stated ?? almost impossible to judge properly. The journey, for example, as well as this imaginative title "Gas-s-s-s" can be marked somewhat as psychedelic exploitation. In other words, they are incredibly strange hippie culture influencing movies. Half the time you don't have the slightest idea what's going on, who are these characters walking back and forth through the screen and where the hell is going. The plot is simple yet highly effective: a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally released and the world population over the age of 25 destroyed. It could be the basic premise of an atmospheric, avid and nail-like suspenseful post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi landmark, but author George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to make it into a "trippy" movie comedy. None of the characters even try to prevent their inevitable emerging deaths; they party only in the streets and find little youth crime syndicates. "Gas-s-s" is a disappointingly boring one and is trying too hard to be bizarre. The whole writing seems to be improvised on the spot and not funny at all. Certainly not my cup of tea, but the movie has a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who should I say it's not worth your time or money?
