In the last 10 years I have worked in 3 different indigenous wrestling organizations, many pro wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), 2 different wrestling programs. They voted on and commented on many wrestling DVDs. I have NEVER seen the level of live amateur-like stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and a turbulent production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. To name it even as a wrestling video of any kind is a direct abuse of the term. Shot with low dollar video cameras, it's mostly home videos of kids playing in the backyard. The sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, and the acting is terrible. The "wrestlers" carry bags of costumes with hand-drawn T-shirts and ski masks, hitting each other with a variety of items and half-mimicking wrestling movements. Sometimes the "matches" are on the grass. Sometimes on a backyard trampoline. EVERYONE has acted poorly and performed with a disgraceful lack of any wrestling skills. In short, do not store with this stinker. Whether your interest in this DVD is entertaining or academic (both in my case), you will be very disappointed.
