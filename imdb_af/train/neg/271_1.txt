I can't believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid scientist fan. I read many sci-fi novels and enjoyed many sci-fi movies and TV shows. I wouldn't even consider this sci-fi. Every episode I've been sitting on was like a lame, watered-down version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything that makes it interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> It's basically a lot of people standing in ARMY fatigues, talking about something boring, sometimes going through the Stargate and ending up on a planet that looks just like Earth, with people just as people look and sound! It was extremely low budget. The characters are all forgetful one-dimensional carvings, and the many attempts to drop humor fall flat. It reminds me when you see a brand with a well-known athlete in it, trying to be funny, but he's not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was terrible too. There is so much you can do with a portal through space, but wherever the ARMY people go is USE! It shows no imagination! I actually thought the TV series "Alien Nation" a few years back (based on the movie Alien Nation) was much better. That show actually has good story lines and decent characters. I didn't love "Alien Nation", but compared to this over-rated crap it was wonderful! <br /> <br /> Unlike the big new Battlestar Galactica series, Stargate also bought the look. of the lame movie too now! At least they have updated the special "toilet flush" special effect of when someone goes through the Stargate.
