I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from NYC. After 30 minutes I said to him: "You must sheep. Is this a kind of joke?" He thought it was good. I told him I thought it was probably one of the silliest films ever made. "What was it supposed to be?" I asked. A propaganda movie made for kids? The plot is stupid. The play is the worst ever for most of the principals and honest people who look at this kind of fear and think it has nothing to do with lifestyle, love or even afterlife, which offers an incredible idiotic view ... some psychiatric help. If someone tries to keep it in your DVD or Video player, it looks as if you are entering a virus into your computer ... it won't destroy your player, but it will destroy your night. If they made Razzies in the 40's, it would have won in every category. (PS. It's also under the questionable sobriquet of "Trap to Heaven.")
