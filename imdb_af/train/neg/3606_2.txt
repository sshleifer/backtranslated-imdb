This movie is the worst movie, but it is very high for me. That's how a slasher movie should be. It takes place at a university where there are only a handful of students. The teachers are more stupid than a bag of hammers. It is filled with good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so clicked. It's hard to believe I could predict quotes in quotes. The slashings have some creativity and seem to stick around to pierce the genitals. Lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters who deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for a fun time. Get a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.
