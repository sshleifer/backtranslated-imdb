There are three kinds of bad movies - the cheapest, the boring, and the tasteless. the only very bad movies are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> boring movies are just, good, boring - if you don't leave fast enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Tasteless movies actually have their defenders; but the fact remains that they are masturbatory tools for many sick people. <br /> <br /> Only the cheapest bad movies are really funny, because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperate, they passed them beyond their capabilities and available resources. <br /> <br /> Of course, above Derek is boring and tasteless; Luckily, the fate and the lack of funds and skills saved her by making her look cheap too. This movie is hilarious and may be the last really funny movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I first saw it in a theater, may God forgive me; I was laughing so hard, I rolled off my chair, and so with most of the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Derek and her husband's promoter, partly from this movie as a partial, are a satire; Unfortunately, the dereks clearly had no resources needed to pull it off; consequently, the "satirical" element emerges as a schoolgirl's impression of a gay young man's impression of Frank Gorshin's impression of the mystery in batman trying to pretend to be robin - it doesn't fly over our heads, it has no idea where any human head may be. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are so-called serious moments in this movie - it's supposed to be an action movie, remember - it's so surprisingly cheesy, one wonders or someone <br /> <br /> Like Derek's notorious tendency to reveal her breasts - I can't imagine a less erotic nudity photographic show, she is so strange with those broad shoulders. I can "I don't think anyone ever saw her. <br /> <br /> As for the plot - as it is - well, it is not; Derek is chasing Africa, and God alone knows why. then her father, Harris, pretends to act in some manic puppetry, and then of course there is the Hunk'o'Tarzan who apparently wondered about advertising without knowing that the subject has changed - probably because he is not a script - apparently no one has. <br /> <br /> insignificant camera work, clumsy editing - if it wasn't for the 3-way chimpanzee, the movie would be unbearable. <br /> <br /> as it is, it is a real hoot.
