Randolph Scott leaves the US for the greener pastures of Canada's British Columbia. He wants to start a cattle farmer with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They shoved their little herd over a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory. Later, Jory stirred their cattle and Williams lost his left arm during the fracas. <br /> <br /> From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good adult theme westerns, some of which are considered true classics. Unfortunately, the Cariboo route will never be listed among its best western. <br /> <br /> It's more like the material Roy Rogers or Gene Autry may use. The story is sometimes equally silly. Williams, who was with Scott with him, wanted gold prospects, as there was a big strike at the time. He doesn't blame the robbers, he estimates Scott to convince him to make the trip for the loss of his arm. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the movie when Scott, Lee Tung Foo, and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians. They escape because Gabby's mules have been taught to kick off and he kicks away at the Indians so our heroes can escape. I'm not sure it played in a Rogers movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, the story would like you to believe that tyro prospector Randolph Scott accidentally crashes into a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospect Gabby Hayes on finding gold. <br /> <br /> It was part of Gabby Hayes' farewell feature movie. It would have been better if he went out in a good western area and actually did some better people with Randolph Scott. <br /> <br /> I'll say it, though no caribou made any look at the movie, it's one of the few Canadian local films from the past that didn't have Mounties. <br /> <br /> But if I were you, unless you're a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, take the next detour from The Cariboo Trail.
