this movie is really bad ....... no i really mean very bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. From all the movies he made, I made just like the enemy of the state. In addition, he is one of the worse directors of all time. As far as I am concerned, Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did this script. Now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, but getting involved in this hope makes him learn his lesson. <br /> <br /> Now I love Mickey Rourke's new roles, but I can't like him in this because of the horrible story and look of it. Don't get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he made some accidents in his time and that is one of them. I don't know what to say about Keira knightly, I think she's a little overestimated. I just can't feel for her in movies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is bad. that's it ....... 10/10 ....... j.d. Seaton
