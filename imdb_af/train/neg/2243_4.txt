It doesn't even earn a review, except as a warning to potential viewers. It's a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio while filming a drama in World War II. There is no fear involved, no tension whatsoever or any surprises. A shocking moment that seems a bit too stupid to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, although there is some really nice editing at some time. The story never comes together, and the movies are really just a complete bust. 10/04.
