About halfway I realized that I didn't care much about these characters. However, I looked a little more anyway. Unfortunately I returned the next day and finished it. I shouldn't have bothered. <br /> <br /> If you know something about the movie beforehand, you know that the main character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a good idea of ​​what's going on - he'll call the phone and people talk about it! It was almost as bad as 'Snakes on a plane' (another bad airplane catastrophe). I realize this is an old movie, and the acting style was much less naturalistic than today. But even through those standards, the play was embarrassing. These were not characters, they were stereotypes. I suspect this movie was more than anything, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's (Gary Merrill) career. But I didn't see - I saw that oak trees showed more real emotions than he did. <br /> <br /> Davis's lucky cripple (ie, a non-glamorous role) was probably viewed as an edgy and bold career move. It wasn't. It was just boring. She was a kind of Tiny Tim in the movie, which Trask (Merrill's character) sees the truth about love and forgiveness (although she was less profitable than Tiny Tim), spreading the well-being of life and relationships calmly without hinting her beloved man had just died. <br /> <br /> The final scene where Trask calls his wife back in Iowa to reconcile is so touched and handed over on both sides of the phone line, I almost cut. I had to remind myself that these people really paid for what they did in this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw many people enjoying this movie. If you lift it up, it's great. But honestly, I just got it. There are many old films from the Golden Age of Hollywood that wrote and performed much better.
