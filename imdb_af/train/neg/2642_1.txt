Slow, Slow, Slow ... There is no secret or excitement in this movie. If you don't find out who the "mole" in the first ten minutes is, you need to be brain dead. The secret service also had to be because it took them the whole movie to put it together. There are no compelling characters in the movie (not movie). The tempo of the movie is slow, there is no tension. The hired killer is an excellent shot, unless he strives to Michael Douglas as he seems to be beating, is huge glass plates. The funniest scene in the movie is when the presidential woman says the code word at the anticlimatic end. It's ridiculous. At least six people got up and left the movie early. I would have joined them if I hadn't been in the middle of the row. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
