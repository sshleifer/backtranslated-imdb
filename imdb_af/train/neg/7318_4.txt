It's a depressed level, naive and mostly unfriendly look at an unlikely relationship between Brooks' psychotic film editor and his short-time friend Harold. The two have ZERO chemistry together - mainly because Harold is unable to do anything, except to look pretty at this stage of her career; but also because Brooks's character is not interesting or enjoyable. There were 15 stately, rude minutes at the beginning, where Brooks, just breaking up with Harold, stumbled across his flat in a depressed, extinct state. <br /> <br /> Sappily and unimaginable by Joe Cocker's book "You're so beautiful", there's simply not enough material here for a feature film. There is almost nothing to the edge of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world. I'm sure Brooks's intention was to shine a white, powerful spotlight on the matter and to deconstruct it in some way; But if you do, the writing and acting must be far better than it is here.
