Oh, dear, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, it's the nail in the coffin as far as its A-list Hollywood career is concerned. After tight turns in Girl it can't help, Wayward Bus, the Burglar and the Rock Hunter, Jayne seemed to be well on his way to becoming one of Tinsel Town's hottest stars. However, obsession with rushed publicity and an appearance in this clunker, Mansfield moved to the sidelines, namely cheap Euro loan, until Fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a deadly waste of everyone's time, with the exception of Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this movie that is enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her timetable for the bad returns of this movie at the box and while she is in pain in this movie, she can only do her best with the material. After all, Cary barely set the screen on fire? After a handful of very good dramatic and comedic innings, Jayne takes ten steps back in her quest as a serious actress by voting (just for Grant's appearance) to portray this squeaky, idiotic threat. Her character from Alice is a complete comic book bimbo and although she seems good enough to eat in a kettle pack, her every look in the movie becomes nervous. We all know Jayne can do so much better than this dross and yet she is around here like a prize pudding. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Get rid of this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than funny.
