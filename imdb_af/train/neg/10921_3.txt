I make a point of watching bad movies regularly, and the original movie fiction movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment if I have seen Sands of oblivion. The acting was uncharacteristically sub-par, as opposed to the horribly disgraceful performance sci-fi usually has in store for us. There are a few cameos made by people you will probably recognize, although you may not know their names. The CGI special effects are minimal, and as such one of the largest sources of comedy is missing in a sci-fi function. Certainly, there are a few funny moments such as when a man is beheaded by a bulldozer, or when the main character dies of his friend to save a girl, he is known for a few days, but overall it just ends not to roll you down with laughter on the floor and I see it as a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I make it on a 10-star scale made specifically for TV movies, I'll probably give it a 4, maybe even 5. A shame that I might have to wait for the next sci-fi original movie to get a good laugh, and I really hope this movie is not part of an overall quality boost in science. - An original movie.
