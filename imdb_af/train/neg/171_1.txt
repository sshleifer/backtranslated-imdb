I thought Hedy Burress (who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one) would be part 2. Don't think. I just think they had to finish off as they did on Friday. The 13th Part 2 (you know what I mean). <br /> <br /> This movie like Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2 follows movies in a movie. <Br /> <br /> It was PURE CRAP! The whole movie in a movie case. <br /> <br /> BAD Stay away!
