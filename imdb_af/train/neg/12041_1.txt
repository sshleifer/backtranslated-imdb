Well, must start? This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever paid to see good money. I won't comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. To start with is the acting, except for Eric Bana, soap opera quality. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but every actor on The Bold and the Beautiful disgraces him. The camera action doesn't help either. How it hangs on him when he thinks, it just takes me back to Brooke Forrester's days in the lab! Peter O'Toole also had a very bad plastic surgery, or he desperately needed one. Anyway, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to end my comment, Diane Kruger is a cute girl, but she's not Helen of Troy. Peterson had to have chosen Saffra Burrows for the role, as Elizabeth Taylor would have been scared.
