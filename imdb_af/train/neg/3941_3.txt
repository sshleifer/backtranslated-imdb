This is what happens when you live in China and the local video store is thin on English titles? You are blessed with this work of what seems to be, Romanian theater. Yet I think it has real comic potential. <br /> <br /> Spoilers technically follow: <br /> <br /> Although I don't think it will spoil anyone's viewing space to ask why a movie in a casino has a scene of beach archery , even in flashback. This mystery and many other confrontations are exploited by desperate comedians, perhaps when they are stuck in Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Let me also wonder aloud why perfectly enjoyable people allow themselves to abuse film like this. It's sad.
