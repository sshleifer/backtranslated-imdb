Jane Russell was a wonderful musical comedy artist in the similar title "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" ?? but unfortunately this film disappears the skills. There is a budget and beautiful Paris photography, but the movie just doesn't work. Mrs. Russell seems to play Marilyn Monroe. It doesn't allow anyone to play Jane Russell enough. Some of the other players are WAY out of their element. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing arts; usually, be warned: there is a musical number where flabby African cannibals cook the brunette in a pot, after Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting, sometimes embarrassing, waste of resources. <br /> <br /> *** People Marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sell ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
