An award for the worst movie ever made. Joanna Pakula's character seems to have an IQ. of 3 which is only one less than the author and director. The script would not have passed a high school writing class; the "jokes" are young; the concept corny. Of course, these artists were desperate for work. I just stayed to see if it would get worse. It did. Life is too short to spend any part of it watching this movie.
