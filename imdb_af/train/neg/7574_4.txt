But it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting. Nevsky acts like a body builder and he is not so attractive, in fact, IMO, he is uncomfortable. (his acting skills miss everything!) Sascha is very well played by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character had to be developed. There are too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much action, and too stupid of an end. It's very violent. However, I loved the landscape, this movie takes you all over the world, and that's a bonus. I also liked how it had about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough to get my attention. The actors had to be more attractive ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha will be hot enough, but for our ladies fans of action, Nevsky doesn't cut it. Overall, this movie was good, I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it, but it was just another normal movie.
