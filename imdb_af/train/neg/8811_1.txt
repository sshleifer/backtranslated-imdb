SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie and I didn't. <br /> <br /> First reason: Drilling. Hardly anything happens, the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke weeds, read magazines, take care of their sick friend and cut the occasional dead body. BORN !! <br /> <br /> Second reason: There are too many things inexplicable. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter kidnapping random men, holding them in a chair and interrogating them. Who are these men? How do they know anything about illegal activities related to the sick carnivores? Why does he kill one and let another go? <br /> <br /> There is also this man who also initially thought the flesh was eating diseases, but he slipped his fist through a wall of superhuman power suggesting that he was not quite what we originally thought- never explain! How frustrating is it? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the duologists boring and the action that didn't exist. The cover art is also misleading as it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool if it's not clear. I rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this site. Although I respect that some people enjoyed this movie, from now on I will make sure that I read more than two reviews deep in a movie. To avoid renting another movie, I regret it.
