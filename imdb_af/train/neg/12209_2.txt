Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and brother both had a policy that had to pay the person choosing the movie. And while I would never pay to see the crap they did to me, I couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! This is how I came to see the crap like the second Conan movie and never again! Now, despite being a miserable movie, it is in entertaining places to watch - in a brain-dead manner. And technically, the stunts and camera work well, so it elevates my score all the way to a 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this one has virtually no plot, Rambo himself says only 3 words (unlike grunts and screams), there is an unnecessary and completely irrelevant and undeveloped "romance" and the movie is a giant stupid special effect. And what surprisingly special effects. While 12383499143743701 shot bullets and rockets at Rambo, no one has any influence on him, and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots beats his mark! And while the bad guys use AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all Rambo has bow and arrows with what looks like nuclear tips !! The scene where one bad man shoots at him slowly and quietly starts one of these explosive arrows is made especially for stupid viewers! It was wonderfully parodied in UHF with Weird Al. Plus, HOT SHOTS, SHARE DEUX also makes a funny parody of the genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, a movie so stupid and useless, it's almost like self-pity!
