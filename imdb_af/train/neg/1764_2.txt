Although I agree with the other reviewers' comments in many ways. I find that the plot and idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal issue with this movie is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen a less talented "actor". How this person ever was in a movie or on television, I can't imagine. In my opinion, she would be better than a bigger one at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles asks the question ... "Who does she know?" I would like to see this film made with some talent again. I'm not writing the writer for the failure of this movie to be the time to see it.
