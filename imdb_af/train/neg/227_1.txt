Was it meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a lightweight crook between three women. Fine. It moves in a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are some antics between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and eventually turns black, I began to wonder if I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It stays in this vein for a while until it eventually jumps back to the original, light bitter. But now it's too late. It's hard to see why these women are still talking to each other and the final is unconvincing. Really a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of not making movies. Hard to see how producers ever convinced themselves of this movie. And the box office proved that it was a real flop because I have never heard of this movie until this weekend (four years after its release).
