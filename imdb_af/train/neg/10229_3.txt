I base it on my observations of one episode I saw last night (9/27/06). I don't think I will look again. The acting was completely wood, the plot is completely predictable, the end is completely unrealistic. I mean, who would believe a $ 30m judgment for killing terminal cancer addict drug? The chief actor (Victor Garber) was so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role - perhaps he realized how bad the writing was !! I fully realize that the drama presented this season is pretty poor, but they can certainly find better writers. Maybe they're outsourcing the writing to India or China !! I'll bet we won't see this one next season!
