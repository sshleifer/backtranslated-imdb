You probably heard this phrase when it came to this movie? "Herbie: Fully loaded with crap" and yes this is true. This film is really awful and completely crippled. <br /> <br /> It must be the second worst movie. Lindsey has since been in the Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen. The only good thing about this movie seems to be the talent talent that is by far better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie. I don't see how such a respected actor like Matt Dillon could be part of this movie, didn't he read that horrible script before he signed it? <br /> <br /> What I don't like about this movie is also based on how Herbie is surreal and fantasy, such as extraordinary ability and climbing on the wall and moving faster than a racing car, it's just a Beatle . I know it's a kid's movie, but they've gone about it and it's just becoming more silly than entertainment. Little realism is needed, plus the story is far too predictable. <br /> <br /> Final Words: Unless the kids are actually 5-12 years old, I highly doubt that anyone can enjoy this senseless movie. What a waste of my money. I feel like cheating. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)
