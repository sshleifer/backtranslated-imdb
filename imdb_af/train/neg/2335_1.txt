A movie that is so uncertain is that the creators may suspect an original film noir classic title, "Goodbye My Love," and think the believer will take it a remake. The characters are so dirty and unattractive that it earned the cold reception when it was first issued. Time only adds to his absurdity. Instead of having any of the fraud, cinematography, despair or despair of classic noir, it based on a winding and senseless crime plot that resulted in several arrests within hours. As if that wasn't enough, it made a totally sexless effort for eroticism in which at least one of the participants didn't bother to bathe within days. It just made this mess more and more painful to watch. Find a good classic forties or fifties movie noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure.
