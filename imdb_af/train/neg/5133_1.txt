I didn't have any real expectations in this movie and I'm happy. Even if I expected it to be bad, I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First, I think 15% of the movie consisted of stock images of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle field. I understand. There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrows" was sufficient. <br /> <br /> Secondly, no damn thing is ever explained about scarecrows and paranormal events. There are too many times where I left WTF? <br /> <br /> Third, the movie itself takes seriously. I am all for a B-movie with buckets of blood, screaming women and senseless violence resulting from a simple psychopath or ancient curse. But those movies often know they are B-movies and even flaunt like Dead Snow (hilarious Scandanavian zombie flick) or Evil Dead 2. But this movie seems unaware of his crapdom. <br /> <br /> Finally, there must be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said it. If you are going to make a crazy horror movie, do the murder. And if you have one hot and one semi-hot girl, one of them should at least show a little booboe. <br /> <br /> So, as the summary says, "Scarecrows" skip and watch yourself. You will thank me.
