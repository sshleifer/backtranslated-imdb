A friend and I have chosen a phase of crazy horror movies in the video store a couple of years ago for an evening's entertainment. For some reason I eventually bought this one (probably v. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The inexpensive synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There are also some very amusing scenes. Among them is a scene where a man is attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, which made me laugh (it doesn't look so funny in retrospect, but you're going). <br /> <br /> In addition, it's overall crap, you think. But probably worth a watch if you want movies like 'Chopping Mall'. Yeah, I saw that too.
