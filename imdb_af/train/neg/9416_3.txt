Steve McQueen definitely has many loyal supporters out there. He was definitely a charismatic fellow, one of the most charismatic screens ever known. But even McQueen can't save this turkey from a movie, shot with what looks like a brownie camera in real places in St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new kid with no criminal record in planning. of a banker by one of the other gangs. There is more than a hint that there is a gay relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. He does not like the other heist members, especially because of his lack of criminal resumption. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a girlfriend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something is going down, especially when he begins to hang all the rough characters with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke. It would probably have caused my suspicions. <br /> <br /> The Great St Louis Bank Robbery had two directors, Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim mostly did documentary programs and Stix didn't do much of everything. One of the two jokers decided that Steve's performance was best served by doing a bad Marlon Brando imitation. <br /> <br /> This movie may deviate as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen. I am willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions have already signed up for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can't believe they would have seen them. <br /> <br /> Or they would have seen something. the public would not have forgotten, except for dressing for this turkey.
