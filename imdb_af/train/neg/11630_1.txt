Worst movie since Open Water. Don't be surprised if you completely miss this movie on release, as I'm sure it's not going well at checkout. This movie had a lot of potential, but it fell short of short. Not enough character development, uncomfortable actors and the upside of this movie were nudity. Boobs. Amazing. If I had to see this movie again, I would go to POSTAL myself. << < <<
