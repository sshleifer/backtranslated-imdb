'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is a struggle to go through, even on a slim 76 minutes; Even more of these terribly boring and pretentious Euro horror trips and I came in a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco once again delivers a truly horrible 60s trash that apparently by a cast and crew from their heads on class A hallucinogenics, since no one second of this mess made any sense. Apparently, is it one of the better of its 180+ movies? It is hard to believe that there are worse efforts there. <br /> <br /> The incomprehensible plot deals with Franco's usual themes of sex, violence and lesbians and throws a little S&M for good, but still manages to be boring boring by mind. <br /> <br /> I can leave it quite a while before I enter the world of dodgy Euro Horror again? Life is too short to spend to see so.
