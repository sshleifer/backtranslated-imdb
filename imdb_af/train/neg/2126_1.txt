Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it is ridiculous to throw him into a cozy romantic lead. The fact that he is dancing so well, crowns so effectively, and throws himself all the way just so he looks cleaner. In his more handsome moments (with the girl in the station, in the final number with Rosie), I couldn't remove my eyes from him, he was so repulsive. You expect him to solve the beautiful man and start sniffing. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only show better than the 1963 movie. By the way, if you watch a production of stage music, the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie, you see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, the same songs to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical thing I've ever seen.
