As long as you can suffer! If you want to watch people wake up, get up, dress up, shower, eat, watch each other, get sex in the dark, go to bed ... if you have smaller apartments, narrow bedrooms and kitchens, long minutes of silence. If you feel bored for two hours, feel the thrill of the "real intimate false art" then you will love it. But if you don't, just try to watch a good movie, there are thousands. "As long as you're here", but do we want to stay? This German film has been awarded the Torino-gay film festival: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision, as the festival featured many talented films. Maybe it's nice to be with a German, as they don't often get awards? Well, "The life of others" has ... but this one is excellent, but not gay. So maybe it's a matter of fashion. Germans are they in again? No matter what? Or maybe just for a hustler's look of some directors?
