I really wish I didn't write this review. I'm a Christian, so I was anxiously waiting to see this movie. It was wonderful - a Christian movie with some fairly well-known stars and a plot that was intriguing (not that I buy the Bible code itself - you can tell it all you want, but I believe everything in the Bible). So I sit on the edge of my seat and enjoy the previews when the movie goes on and manages to destroy my mood in a few minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop commenting on the terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater (I would be torn in pieces by the people who cheered on the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and the insight before obvious and predictable tension scenes, I'm sure). However, once the final credits started rolling, I could reflect. There were many parts of the movie I liked - some mostly unexpected plots, some effects that were indeed special (I don't count the Visions. It was poorly done), and some interesting technical work - faded, put it type of thing. Unfortunately, I got the clear impression that if I read the book of Revelation for an hour and could put the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could get a better script. And the music was cheesy (even for a Bond fan who likes cute music in plays of action and plot). So I wish I could be in the theater like everyone else - like the people who came out and wept because of how incredible it was - but I'm not someone who can be satiated by a writer who has a few words about a biblical watch and slap a Christian seal on it. I needed a good plot and credible dialogue before I could enjoy most movies, and it just didn't. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. And that's the tragedy. When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction? It must be somewhere ...
