I read in the newspapers that W.Snipes has broken, so do not wonder that he would take parts in low budget projects such as The Contractor. He is just the next action star to join a growing club: the inexorable action stars of the 90's (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he starred in a cheap action movie shot in Bulgaria. (We must believe that the place is London, just as a complete moron would buy it.) The story is one of 1000 other movies. man is hired again by the government to do a wet job - then the government wants to get rid of him. good man gets away after murdering bad guys (was it a spoiler? Don't guess!) The star of the movie: the girl (Eliza Bennett) performs everybody else from the movie !!! One star is for her plus one star for the candy Lena Headey, make 2 stars. Only for the hard Snipes fans! Everyone else: avoid!
