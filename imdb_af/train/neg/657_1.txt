PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> Targeted by: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> Starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> Plot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) saw the death of her whole family in the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who loved her a little. Now she prepares for her senior prom with her stupid, annoying friends. Once there, they die one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna, because her prom is apparently too important to interrupt. <br /> <br /> For: I have some good laughs from the movie due to the terrible dialogue and the stupid character. <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the guy who's strange to her (she doesn't look so big) escaped from prison. Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her before her friends. LOL <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Let me start by saying I'm a big victim. Usually I can enjoy with even the bad. I even like PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that it is a dumb slasher movie that is PG-13 has nothing to do with me to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> First, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher movies that don't even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. It's about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her whole family. A few years later, he tried to make it to her by destroying her prom and killing all her friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone who cares. Claire (Jessica Stroup) fights with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I can't care less. It should have been a lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... it's a treasure movie with terrible deaths. I don't even care, it's not a pity, some of my favorite slides (Hallows, Curtains, the original PROM NIGHT) weren't sorry, but they still had effective murders. Here we have half of the characters being screened in the same hotel room, a woman stabbed several times without stab wounds, and a close-up on a bad actor's face as he screams. I'm sure ten-year-old girls were scared, but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hated the characters. There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee that you will never meet a boyfriend who is sensitive in your life unless you are a gay man. Then we have Donna's annoying friends, Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the wizard-girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEAD PROOF were annoying, try to watch this movie. And don't start me at Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me back to Usher's performance in SY ALONE. <br /> <br /> Add to it all that predictable plot, a terrible soundtrack and a great lack of respect for the original material, and you have quite a stinker.
