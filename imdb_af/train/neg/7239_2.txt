This film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy. It's not smart or romantic, and it's certainly not an effective comedy. The fortunes of the well-meaning but pathetic character, "Tom," oscillate from an extremely embarrassing disaster to another. The only savings are the capable performance of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we see Paltrow's pleasant face. Overall, should be avoided!
