Holy @ #% & this movie was still hot and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to look at this pile of waste, but found it easier to cut my wrists and lower a Lysol floor cleaner than to endure more than half the shit on my screen. I rank it well underneath everything I've ever seen on film or television, and that's something to say. I once saw a cowshed in a field. I watched the steaming pile for an hour and a half, who knows ... it might move or something. Well, it was time spent better than watching these three. The play wasn't there, the plot was different from this movie. I think I saw an early cut where the plot managed to escape and drove off in the background of an old bakkie heading to Portland in the hope of becoming a Steven King shi77er. Please tell me that the director gets medication that he so desperately needs. It is pretty clear that he needs heavy medication and I would like to submit the money needed for his lobotomy reversal. Bah ... I can't give this review because it's nothing that can painfully ever do justice in typed words. Let me just say that if you are looking for a movie to go for a while and you see this Chilton on the rack, walk to your car, start the engine and slide both of your fists straight into the fan until it can't feel you legs vibrate more. Make sure you also have your wallet in hand because you are going to waste the cash anyway. You can also have the privilege of wasting it yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watched it after a "friend" sent me his girlfriend so I could see it. He didn't come, she did. What's worse is that she had to watch this $% & @ thing TWICE! I heard they were married now and he got his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
