Okay, how about the TRASH, right now? The "Witch Mountain" should be one of the most incoherent and insane Spanish exploitation theaters, yet it is also strange. There is absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt that there was ever a script to work with, but somehow I couldn't turn it off. The scratch of your head with confusion starts right away, with an opening sequence about an angry little girl who killed her mother's cat. So you think this movie turns on children owned by evil forces? Heck no, because after this intro the girl and her evil are simply not mentioned anymore. Then cut to a man, with the most impressive cut mustache you will ever see, breaking in a rather awkward way with his girlfriend. When she asks him to spend his holiday with her, he immediately calls his employer and requests him any kind of assignment! Great move. The movie is now starting, as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks. Although he does not pick up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and take her topless photos! Throughout their journey, all sorts of strange events occur which? you guess it ?? is never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, plays loudly petrified music everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! Really, motor jacket witches? Apparently a covenant of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on offenders. It's as close as I describe the plot, but is there a good chance I'm gone? More important here is the atmosphere! The "Heksesberg" is sometimes very creepy, with its haunting music and interesting cinematography. The supporting characters all seem rude and the surprising Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. This is the kind of European horror movie that could have been legendary if someone just bothered to write a structured script.
