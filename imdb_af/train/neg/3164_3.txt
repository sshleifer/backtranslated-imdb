Obnoxious Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an image of an angel (without wings) falls on her from the back of a truck and kills her. She then tries to destroy the relationship of her former friend with his new girlfriend, a psychic who can see her. <br /> <br /> Clear, unauthorized movie will not be bad in a clich√© way, except that Longoria's character is hateful and unpleasant that she has all the fun from the movie. It's like cleaning your ears with sandpaper. To be honest, Longoria, or anyone else in the casting or crew, is not the problem, it's the terrible writing that goes down the proceedings. It's just really really stupid.
