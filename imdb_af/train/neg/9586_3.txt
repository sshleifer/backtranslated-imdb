Following the catastrophic Revolution, this film was almost the last nail in Goldcrest's coffin and thus the British film industry. The film is absolute pants, it is full of pazz music in the mid 80's and was based on a book and writer that was popular at the time and truly returned in the dark. Temple searched for ages that Suzette tried to find and 8th Wonders, Patsy Kensett, gained another person who was short of popular at the time. By the time the film came from post-production, Jazz revival was over, just as Kensett's career and the film had a totally unconscious movie audience. <br /> <br /> Moderate would be an over-statement for some of the worst / campuses / Cheesiest who are ever looking at the British silver screen, seeing it for almost 20 years and the movie is really cringeworthy.
