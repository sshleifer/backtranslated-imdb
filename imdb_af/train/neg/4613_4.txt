Well then, what is it? I found Nicholson's character level and unfortunately uninteresting. Angelica Huston's character drained my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty, no good slut. It's not that I don't get it. It's not that I don't think some of the ideas could lead to anything more. It's a movie with nothing but the idea that we have to accept these ideas and that's what the movie is about. That Nicholson falls to Turner is absurd, but then again. However, it doesn't stop me as a.) Funny, or b.) ... even remotely interesting !!! It was a waste of my time, don't let the hype get the best of you. It's a waste of your time! With all that being said, the open church series is pretty pretty ...
