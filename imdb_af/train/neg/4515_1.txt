"Piece is Cake" is a defeatistic, revisionist history of the worst kind, whose only point is to unfairly prejudice the reputation of (indeed fictional) pilots depicting it. It left a remarkable bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> On the 1989 plane, Roland Beamont has a passing condemnation of the way the RAF warrior command is portrayed in the TV mini series. Some of his remarks are worth repeating: <br /> <br /> "There was no sense of defeat at any time in any of the squadrons I saw in action and a total absence of the naughtiness in "Piece of Cake." It would not have been pathetic for a moment ... ... The prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that of a good rugby club, but with more discipline. no sense of "death or glory" training demanded that we be there to defend this country, and now we had to do it - no more and no less. <br /> <br /> "There was no discussion of 'bravery' or 'cowardice'. People also had guts or they did - but mostly they did. But we knew fear, it acknowledged in ourselves and in each other, we have condemnation to control it, and then started work ... <br /> <br /> "I couldn't feel a" glory. " but there was a sense of greatness, and none of this had the slightest likeness to "Pie Cake". <br /> <br /> In his own words Beamont was a fighter pilot, unlike the author and manufacturer of the recent TV series, there were. "<br /> <br /> Beamont served with 87 Squadron in France and the BoB, before becoming one of the leading exponents of both the Typhoon and Tempest, and a war test pilot. <br /> <br /> "Piece of Cake" is an absolute, total misrepresentation of the way pilots acted in the war. It's nothing short of complete and absolute shame.
