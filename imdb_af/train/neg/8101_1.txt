It is often said that movies can never level the original book. Well, in this case the movie is not as good as the book, but it is an insult to the book. I'd rather see that Milan Kundera's novel was set alight than in this "something" that the director probably calls "adaptation". <br /> <br /> All the beautiful philosophy that asks, "is it better to put a heavy burden on your shoulders, or to cope with the unbearability of being?" all the movies are Daniel Day Lewis (sexual adventures) with his stupid wife, his mistress and his other mistress. Fran√ßois Truffaut has said this: bad directors make bad movies. Don't waste your time and money. Rather read the book, it's really worth it.
