Where to even start? The terrible play? The nonsense plot? The bargain basement effects? The completely horrible characters? The cunning editing? The headache-inducing Casio keyboard score ??? The terrifying racist remarks ("Watch it, Charlie!", "Back off, Jackie Chan !!" ??? The constant misogyny ??? I am a lifelong horror fan, and I have no problem with the current "torture - the" tendency of movies. However, it is a bad piece of garbage. I think I watched more pain than the characters died of! If you forced girls to eat stir-fried penis, it was very poor soft core porn and thought lines like: "I'll find those b **** and her c *** stamp!" is smart, LIVE FEED is for you. <br /> <br /> As for me, I feel the need to to go wash my eyes with a cleaner to avoid ever seeing this movie again!
