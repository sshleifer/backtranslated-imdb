I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but thought, "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching". I'm getting fixed. Everyone involved must keep their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I realize there are not very big roles for women of a certain age, but the writing on it was so unclear, cut and surprised that I was. surprised that it ever came into being or that me. Keaton thought she could make a wallet from this saa ear. None of the characters had any credibility and was so incredibly unstoppable. The play looked like an exercise in a BEGINNING class - I watched in open mouth most of this miracle "What were they thinking?". Many, very sad, that it came to this. Don't waste your time.
