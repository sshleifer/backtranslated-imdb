The only reason I rented it was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this movie look like. Well, it's not. It was a very boring, amateurish written and directed film. All the actors in this movie are terrible, except Faye Dunaway, who is always a pleasure to watch. But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with the ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a thick Argentine accent, you can only understand every few words he says. Also at hand is Nicholas Pauls, who plays the ultra-blatant love interest for Gina Phillips. The bottom line: this movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and it's the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given this one star, but I gave it three just because I love Faye Dunaway so much. But even she wasn't so good at it.
