Kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book can succeed to cover its horror! The plot is so confronted and incredible. . . start feeling guilty of a little child saving her pain! Then we have the conspiracy of at least six and perhaps more people (including clergy) involved in what a crime is everywhere. Then we have a woman who seems to be relatively happy about the speed of a ferry ride. A very unpleasant and coo coo mother, helped, attacked and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving the area around an island along the coast of South Carolina didn't help the story, though it helped the filmmakers budget. The many beautiful buildings that presumably retained the monastery do not seem logical to an island that is small enough to require golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger, who I really like, is painfully thin in this movie and her haircut definitely lasts another decade. There is simply no chemistry between her and one of the male leaders. I didn't see the book from which it was taken, but read it all. The movie I was constantly following up had to leave when that sachet music got too much. Unless you like an amazing story, woodworking, a shortened mix of religious / mythological / allegory, my advice is to beat this one. Oh and maybe a little carping criticism, but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scenery
