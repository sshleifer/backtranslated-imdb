The Cowboys can leave you a little sore in the hall. Certainly not one of John's best movies. Don't get me wrong, with any John Wayne move there are always good points. And this one has its righteous part. But all over the picture is moving slowly and not just living the aspirations it could have been. Bruce Dern does an excellent job as the villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. The children in the film were average, but could be thrown better. It would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen-year-old filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Watching your kids would be a good family change. Just be aware, there are a few scenes you might want to watch before showing the little ones. But most of the children I know have seen the movie. Maybe it's because they get kids, their age does all the big work.
