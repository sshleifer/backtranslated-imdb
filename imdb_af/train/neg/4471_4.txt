The best thing I can say about this movie is that it was sometimes almost amusing and that it was a sufficient killer. Unfortunately, this movie is so annoying that I want to hit these characters. It's the kind of movie that's so nice, it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I think, but things become terribly exhausting if the dialogue is so misleading. If the two leaders are not on the screen, it is not bad at all, but be afraid of those regular moments when the beloved couple starts talking to each other.
