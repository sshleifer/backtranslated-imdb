The writing is so funny ... it makes the actors' lines sound stiff and unrealistic and are not believed. There is a repetition of phrases - "my dearest little girl" and small variations of the line that come to mind ... and it's just messy soap opera dialogue. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the music is so wrong. ! In addition, the main bluesy theme is a spectacular feature and is completely wrong. And it feels overused, mostly because the theme, texture and arrangement of this theme never changes, even when the scene's emotional context does. <br /> <br /> Then, when it looks, it stumbles like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The music is grainy, and it is as if the writer is writing music for a soap or a sitcom - a low budget 80's Canadian sitcom at that - and that makes us feel like we're always on The edge is to throw at a commercial. <br /> <br /> It's so flawed, it's very persuasive and it's a real stretch that so many of these characters use only ONE type. of NY accent - a thick Bronx accent. I don't know if it's a matter of the actors' limited capacity to only know a * NY accent - whether it's a director's ability to see such a clear anomaly. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the amateur script with its lead lines that make this whole "movie" ... blow. When a foundation is shaky and unstable, it is impossible to build on it without revealing errors in exponentially more harmful and unobtrusive ways.
