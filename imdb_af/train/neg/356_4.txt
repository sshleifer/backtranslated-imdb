The shape of the film is that of a stress shock. There are surprises, twists and turns, turns and excitement. Sometimes it's actually a movie of a "seat". But it disappointed, and it was a serious one. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is not credible; his character disagrees. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but will only say that the character we met at the beginning just couldn't be what we see at the end. <br /> <br /> The second major disappointment of the movie is that - eventually it gets a little more than a bloody slasher movie. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the "Friday the 13th" movies. Not that every film should always be tasteful, but sometimes this movie drops. <br /> <br /> Although the movie contains beautiful Sean Connery, it is not even measured by its standard, and often looks like walking.
