This is the biggest flop of 2008. I don't know what the director is, is his mind to create such a major disaster. The songs were added without situations, the story stretched to fill the 3 hour gap and most disgusting are the action points performed by the actors. It is as if everyone has superpowers that can run between bullets, fire and nothing happens to them. and one person fighting 100 people. Just the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man. He is always at his best to play the role of villain with a comical act that Hinglish speaks. Akki is also a good job. But the movieee just forgets it.
