Sorry, guys, I've already written my opinion of this movie, but today was the first day I looked at the other reviews. There are a lot of people who agree with me, but what's terrifying is that there are some people who really like this movie. I don't like writing nasty reviews or criticizing other people's opinions, but I think it's just fair to warn someone who might debate whether or not this movie should be seen. It's not a good movie. I really like movies and I will just look at anything, but this movie made it happy on the incredibly short list of movies I watched. If you are really incredibly seduced, look at the trailer ... that's the mistake I made because the whole movie is mostly in the trailer. Then there are no surprises, just a shockingly bad dialogue to waste time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and will hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to stop other people from wasting hours of their lives on a movie like this!
