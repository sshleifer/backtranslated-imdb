In present-day Eastern Europe, life is difficult, and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one that is reluctantly taken by Melania. She attracts the attention of an American, Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her, and pays more and more money on time with her until he eventually wants to buy her. She has two pimps with different emotional attachments to her and she is generally passed like a piece of luggage without any feelings of her own. However, we are in the "modern art house theater" area, so conventions such as the narrative structure, the illumination of the subject so that it can be seen, camera techniques that add rather than distract from the action and a vague consistent plot, can all be deserted. Much of the time I didn't know what was supposed to happen and very rarely did I care. People started to leave the show almost before the last arrivals arrived and I don't think I've seen so many people. <br /> <br /> Images are important to the director - characters come out slowly or disappear In a dark screen, we get long, long shots of nothing and one sex scene takes place in infrared. In fact, for such an unconventional film, the sex scene was remarkable; Transmission positions between naked people in bed were abundant and there were no drugs or related weirdness. But perhaps this ordinary habit is unconventional. <br /> <br /> Overall, almost entirely without merit. <br /> <br />
