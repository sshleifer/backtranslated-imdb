Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was, of course, received in various ways: some were terrified, some were shocked, and others were closing in on courage. However, I am totally unaffected, bored and cannot stop asking myself why the performance of incoherent, inconsistent images revolving around a central theme is regarded as an intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What was this movie really about? Growing sexuality in a woman? I've seen good movies on this subject, but it's not one of them. How can one try to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person, not just as a narrative to dreaming dream (in the nude) of animals. Where there are no characters, there is no character study. The woman persecuted by the animal was not adolescent, the girl has sex with the black butler (is he also considered an animal?) Has a great attitude towards sexuality, so where is the consistency? Is this a film about religion? If so, we would need a little more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire for two young boys. <br /> <br /> Is it about bestiality? The metaphorical feel of the film prohibits any realistic investigation into bestiality, especially since realistic investigation requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. Some mythical cattle and two priests talk to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the subject? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I do not know. I just know it shows a firearm, doesn't make a movie a war movie. Managing a topic should mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme. <br /> <br /> So look at the controversy. Don't be scared by the bestiality, nudity, ejaculation, masturbation and things. I'm not. Look at it if you look at any other story and you can discover that it is a bad, poorly edited, poorly acted, really poorly written (okay, some pictures are pretty pretty and the main character is a very pretty girl) Cerebral masturbation by a director who thinks in a hypnotic slow way to beat the bush will make a story intelligent. That doesn't mean that. It makes it boring.
