I'm a fan of B movies, give me a genetically mutated bat and I'm in heaven. These movies are good to make you stop thinking about everything in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, who was so terrible that I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark man, after which the film was barely touched. To make sure the viewers were interested, they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During one attack, the camera shifted from the attack, but you saw how a bucket of blood was thrown through a stage hand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what fantastic special effects). Back to science, I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were kept naked and the test equipment required to be monitored by their breast tissue. Anyway, this movie has poor plot development, horrible story, and I'm sorry to say bad acting. Not even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs can save this stinker.
