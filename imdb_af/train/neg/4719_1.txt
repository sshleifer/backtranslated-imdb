I just want to say that this production is very one-sided, breaking the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits from the people they interviewed, so you can't have an idea if they are worth hearing. <br /> <br /> Tell the story from just one point of view. Doing this is very dangerous, because the following generations learn the bad idea and therefore wars continue. I know this is not the only reason for wars, but it does not help either. <br /> <br /> You can watch this documentary, but rather read a lot in the internet. Balcans are complex like human history.
