I didn't like this movie for several reasons. Within the first ten minutes of the film I was extremely disappointed and concluded that if this movie were to save itself, it would have to get me out of the huge hole it had dug. Unfortunately it didn't happen. The two drawings of the movie were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I don't know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to be interested in what she would bring to the movie. Then I just felt disappointed in and for all three of them, even though there were "moments" in each of their performances. I suggest that each of them found "moments" was a very difficult task, as there was an incredible lack of character development and uninspired dialogue. Although the plot is an interesting one, the movie is generally so poorly written, directed and edited that someone's performance would suffer and be affected by an actor. The irreverent way in which sexual abuse has been handled, and the miserable and insulting view of small-America, I think, were the two main reasons why this movie failed to hit the point. As one reviewer noticed and I agree, the movie is almost impossible to market, as it is finished. I suspect, or at least hope that (in the case of the actor's case) some real gems are on the cutter floor. Sad to us, but if that's true, the actors can be in a hurry and feel somewhat good at giving their talents and time to such a flop. Oh yeah and another thing ... I just wanted to see an American movie once that includes the incredibly vanishing but wonderful bucolic institutions like the one in this movie where the main characters were not absent and / or disrespectful of the country side with pop cans, rubbish CDs and other such trash!
