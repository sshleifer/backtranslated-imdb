It was clear that this movie was designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience, where I was a couple and enjoyed the most. However, it was a very annoying attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who became annoying in her own). Her acting was exaggerated and she appeared to be over-shadowed compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This movie might have been more because there was a suitable budget for institutions, actors and a decent story. My wife and I both agreed that in the end it was 'Muck', as the film ended at a painful humiliating height! Congratulations next time, Mrs Graham hopes to stick to the kind of films she's falling into like hell.
