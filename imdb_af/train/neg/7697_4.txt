This mini-series is actually more entertaining than some with much larger budgets and bigger aspirations. SOTD falls somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" on the entertainment spectrum. If it wasn't that long (almost 3 hours), I think children will want it a lot. It has adventure, action, cliffhanger scenes, and not too much romance or other "icky" stuff. If you're young, you're not too critical about the curvature of rubber bands, camping players and repeated scenes. (At least two scenes are replicated identically in the movie, just as done in parent-time series to speed up the audience.) Finally, children are more accepting of American English dialogue coming from the mouth of Asian actors. (Not to mention the fact that several actors are played by non-Asian actors.) <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this movie three stars, but I felt like the director, producers and role players. Earn extra extra credit to at least go through the project. This movie is not art, but like painting your home, it really needs time, effort and discipline to make it. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a recommended use for your time, but it might stay The kids entertained while in the minibus. <br /> <br /> Oh, yeah ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is the preference and traditional spelling. Your spell check shows that "dialogue" is the correct spelling. While "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and the OED regard it as an alternative form.
