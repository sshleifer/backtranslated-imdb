As someone reading the book, I can say that it is much inferior to the great American version with Gwyneth Paltrow. There are several reasons for this. First, Emma is too unpleasant. Yes, she has mistakes and is not the easiest person to keep - but the viewer shouldn't despise her straight. Secondly, Mr Knightly is unsuccessful. His breeding and melancholy in this version is better suited for a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen, and throws the mood of the whole thing down. Thirdly, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress who is rejected by the role of Harriet; and why was she made to look so sick? Harriet must be blonde and flower - not to look as if she is going to be used in the next scene. Fourth, the structure was refurbished and screens cut. In the end, when Emma decides she loves Mr. Knightly, get it over as completely staggering, because this story was not shown adequately and performed in the film. Fifth, what's going on, exactly, with Mrs Elton's accent? She tried the sound of an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning, all out of the US halfway through, and then again in English at the end. Eventually it dragged to the end. The book and the big movie version ends with Emma's wedding. Knightly. This version delays confusion after announcing the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> All in all, a random effort. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version earlier
