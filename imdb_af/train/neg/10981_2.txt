Or listen to the matter. Even the soundtrack is a drill. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it's not the worst gay movie I've ever seen (it was Billy's), but it's very close to the bottom of the bar. <br /> <br /> Drag and drop this thing. It's not that the plot is wrong - in the hands of a good writer it may have worked. . . it could have been much more entertaining. There isn't one plot point you can't see coming down the road for ten miles. The dialogue is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to injury, it's full of one-dimensional, stereotypical gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or relationship of the two leaders was possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamic, in fact no evidence of why the leaders loved each other. . . We are just telling them they are in love. Difficult to figure when they have nothing in common and not sexually compatible. They like the same book? Huh? <br /> <br /> The acting is not bad, but the pacing is extremely slow. I mean, almost Jarmuschot, but without Jarmusch quality. In fact, it will be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch movies, avoid this one.
