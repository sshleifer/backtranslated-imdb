"How does she move," first jumps to life when his high-energy, talented riders kick their heels and bang their stuff for the camera. Otherwise, this steel-striving-suffering-and-success story is low on energy, low on originality, and low on anything the movie can draw from the dozens of other parables that have come before. <br /> <br /> Rutina Wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner boy who finds the best way to raise her private school fees through step-by-step matches, but both her and her fellow actors are poorly served by writing on-screen screen and unintelligible direction.
