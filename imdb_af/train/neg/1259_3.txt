Thanks Hollywood. Another movie classic completely destroyed by a cheap, level, effect-heavy and excess remake. The original "Planet of the Apes" was an intelligent and thoughtful film with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounded very dim, but it was actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie, on the other hand, has done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a wonderful movie, we get an incredibly stupid two hour movie. Dialogue is minimized, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it is extremely difficult to figure out what's going on. Instead, we get a lot of useless action scenes, a little funny one-liners and some very hollow, quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the monkeys is wonderful, and the sets and backgrounds are also beautiful. However, this does not detract from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, full of paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and an almost non-existent plot. Please keep Hollywood, stop destroying big movies by making them in pointless blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Oh, the end didn't make any SENSE WATSOOP. <br /> <br /> * from **** stars, mainly for the footage <br /> <br />
