I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or stealing the modern jargon "retellings", but this movie really cut me off. The original Prom Night, while I was not a masterpiece in my humble estimate, still realized what it was ... horror. There are a few simple things to remember when making a horror movie. Suspension is essential to retain the importance of the audience. Sorry, but a white knuckle movie it wasn't! The scarecrows were cheap, and were terribly predicted. (A good example of horror now done to click the remains is the cat jumping out of the closet, shortly afterwards, but an unexpected appearance of the villain of the movie). This movie couldn't be successful, so how can I expect to fulfill any of the other horror movie conventions. There must be a good hero or heroine. This movie doesn't have one. The person I identified the most was the chief detective. His tranquil attitude, but a level-headed approach to the escape of a killer, is the more films this ilk should have. Common sense approach to occurrences. (If you walk from an Ax wielding psycho, turn and turn in the opposite direction. Do not jog while looking back for three seconds, bringing the killer's progress just to travel across every branch and lifeless object your way.) If your friend disappears, you're not just looking for them. And if you suspect a fake game, tell someone, don't investigate. These clich√©s are tired and well-survived. In the horror genre in general, and especially in this movie.
