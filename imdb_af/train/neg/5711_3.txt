National Treasure is roughly overestimated and overheated as they come. Nicholas Cage is by no means a credible action hero, and this movie is not Indiana Jones. People who compared this movie to the Indian Jones classical trilogy fell seriously off their rocker. <br /> <br /> I really can't figure out what kind of target audience this movie was. Perhaps the pre-teenage audience will like it, but I found it absolutely ridiculous. I also can't imagine adults or young adults finding it as big of a movie. Simply put, it's just OK at best. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is unforeseen and uninspired, and borrows what it does from "The Da Vinci Code". I would recommend waiting for the movie to be released in 2006 and this nonsense will pass. <br /> <br /> The whole idea to easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run it all over Washington DC and Philadelphia (while never being damaged) while fighting the "bad guys" and experiencing what "non-stop action" is, is absurd. I especially loved the scene with the Declaration folded in his tube in the middle of a busy road while cars were blowing through it without damaging it. O brother! <br /> <br /> Remind me of the episode of the Brady Bunch where they go to the amusement park and Brady loses his architectural plans. Besides, that episode of the Brady Bunch was much better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such a huge treasure that nobody believes is buried in a secret US downfall, is foreign. Literally, there are a thousand undiscovered "valuable" items in this treasure chest. Yes right! Ridiculous !! <br /> <br /> Even worse, the speed and accuracy of what Kage finds and figures that are supposed to be "difficult" clues for these ancient puzzles are pre-posterous !!! Oh ... humanity! <br /> <br /> The performances by Cage, Voight and other actors in "National Treasure" are as stiff, wood and flat as they come. However, if you work with such a bad dialogue, it's hard to blame the actor's 100% for it. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is an OK movie to see once. I can't recommend it and will definitely NOT buy it over the top fancy junk hunt. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you have to see it first .......
