The Haunting. A remake, of course. The original was a creepy psychological thriller, and one that improved over time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no character development here, just caricatures (the slut, the authoritative brain, the "I'm going to get out of here", the o so sensitive bookworm). But since I saw how the bank was the "star" on the special effects, I think that characters with which you can participate are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the consequences are ridiculous. Surrounding cherubs, stretching doors, annoying dead children who can't speak clearly ... and an idiotic juicy end what it means, it is best to give you a new lifetime of butterflies and rainbows. I take my Skittles verbally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I loved you since "The Cowboys". Stop it.
