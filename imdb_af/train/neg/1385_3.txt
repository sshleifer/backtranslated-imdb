"Hak Hap", or "Black Mask" (English) was a disappointment. I said it was a kind of "Japanese version of the Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The movie was either duplicated or the soundtrack didn't play in time with the movie. Another thing is that the dialogue was rather bad. There was very little thought in the English version of this film and it just appeals to the "senseless action" genre. Not a movie I want to see again.
