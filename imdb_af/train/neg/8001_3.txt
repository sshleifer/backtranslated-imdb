SAMPLE - He was wonderful; I loved the special effects this monster created that looked like an updated version of "The Creature From the Black Lagoon." The scenes with these cattle roaming the land and catching people ranged from good to jaw. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENT: Much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as doctors (at the command of the government) report that SARS-like disease is out there. In a nutshell, we get the well-known government cover story. You know, I expect this liberal paranoid attitude with Hollywood movies will always paint our government as corrupt, but it looks like the Korean is copying the format and it's very boring. It takes away the excitement and tension of this "monster". It just dragged off the movie. The main family appearing in the film has to be viewed from afar, while the young girl in their family, suspected of being dead, has been distracted by the creatures. <br /> <br /> MORAL: A typical "pollute the water" message because it's what can happen - a terribly mutated monster. It used to be the anti-nuclear bomb message from the 1950s when radiation ants, spiders, fish or whatever in those scuba science films caused. Now its "environmental issues" are the focus. <br /> <br /> THE HUMOR This was mostly stupid. I usually laugh at slapstick, but it wasn't funny. I don't know if the Korean sense of humor is so sorry, or the film has deliberately been trying to be ultra-corny with a recording on the old "Godzilla" movies. Let's hope this is the last. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - The transfer of the video was good. It was a spectacular picture, and the sound was decent with a lot of loud noise. I watched it in Korea with the English subtitles. This might have been a mistake, as the Korean sound sounds became annoying after half an hour. <br /> <br /> GENERAL - It had a promise, but seems to be a great fall and even boring in too many spots, which is relentless for a contemporary monster movie. Two hours was too long for this story. I don't know how these movie records went in Korea. They should not have much in the role of movies to enjoy and support.
