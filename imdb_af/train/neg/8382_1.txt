There was a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled "Baby Buggy Bunny" which was actually this plot. Baby-faced Finster robbed a bank and rolled the money into the wagon and dropped into Bug's rabbit hole. He dressed like a baby to get into the hole of Bugg to get the money. The scene in "Little Man" where he looks in the bathroom mirror, shaves with a cigar in his mouth, straight out of the cartoon. It was a hilarious 5-minute cartoon; not so much a whole movie. If you're really interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original for the first time (1954). Plus you'll get a lot more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to get started!
