Poor acting, no mini-dissertation, no plot, no convincing killer, no tension, no original essay, it uses the same closet / under the bed / person-behind-your-in-the-mirror tactics over and over and repeats it and boring, and NOT in a prudent way, and the fact that NOOD is ever "really" killed (at least not on the screen), which in turn makes a tension, can call it straight and make everyone spring more cheated for spending money on their entry ticket .... it's a horror movie without any horror LMAO. Most of what you see is what seems to have taken a ketchup bottle and sprayed it over a plastic plate. <br /> <br /> You have to be a teenager shouting in the theater and frightening yourself to enjoy it was whether you were high / drunk at the moment. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life and do not bother to write reviews unless I really hate or enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> But this movie is AWFUL and I feel I have a duty to warn you not to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of movie again! <br /> <br /> It's one thing to buy a "bad" movie at a Weinsteins safe, the other if you have to put it in a theater. <br /> <br /> Also, if you want imitation nostalgia, forget about it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a reminder. It's not scary or tempting, and doesn't satisfy enough to be "funny" as others claim on IMDb. It's just old and boring. <br /> <br /> Here's what you'll take away from this movie: remember the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech should have a sexual relationship with JS Cardone of "The Forsaken" was given a different role as a murderer (because he is as scary as my poodle and is too cute to just kill anyone) for some reason (all) never going to the hotel package again Don't come back. What kind of person will NOT be concerned at the prom when deciding to announce the prom and king candidates, and the strong competitive girl doesn't show up in one way or another? This is my warning to you. Don't waste, you're money like I did. The "original" also sucks, but is more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, but not as bad as this piece of shit (sorry to be vulgar or rude, but once you see it, you'll understand Why i say what i say).
