As a history nut especially interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed with the movie. Granted, the costumes and plays were pretty authentic, but the Hollywood depiction of this "British Little Big Horn" was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of film material dedicated to marching or parading troops had to be unprecedented in film history. Eveytime I heard triumphant background music, started, I knew I had to prepare myself for another difficult scene of meaningless stuffing. It was clear that the producers invested heavily in staging and were determined to get their money's worth. <br /> <br /> Despite the outstanding cast, their dialogue was again boring and their characters never developed. When Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster completed a scene, I would be disappointed. Their given lines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe it, were the same two great actors who portrayed Lawrence of Arabia and the Bird Man or Alcatraz respectively. <br /> <br /> There are worse epics, but this one is not much better.
