Outside the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious push, his performance is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing about Lopez was ever funny. I looked at his point of view and never had a deal with a laugh. <br /> <br /> His stuff comes across as revenging and his hostility towards white people comes from every single pore of his body. <Br /> <br /> I laughed at white people's jokes of a lot of comedians and loved them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a grudge that won't end. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for Hispanics who only have this show to introduce themselves. <br /> <br /> The show stands are always cookie cutters with a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> Cans are laughing at the stupid comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> Maybe this show is repeated at 2am.
