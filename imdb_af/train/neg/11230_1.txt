In the sixth grade, every teacher I decided made it a good idea to make this film the curriculum for a whole semester. Every class has something to do with this terrible show. We looked at it in English and wrote in newspapers as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics we talked about maps and other sea crap. In science we talked about whales (which was actually a bit interesting, so it wasn't a 100% waste of time). The whole day was torture daily. Not only that, but they will submit to this horror twice a day by showing us in the hall. I could see if it was a new series or something, but it was '93 '. I'm still trying to exclude it.
