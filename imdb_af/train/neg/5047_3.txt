I didn't want to respond, but then I thought I had something to say. I saw this movie two days ago and although I don't think it is a complete waste of time (it may have been money for the producers), it is clear that it has serious problems. It has really good cinematography and (little) nice music. A lot has been said about Ana Cristina Oliveira, but let's be honest about what? She is not actually an actress and she is constantly balancing between overworking and deadly workers. Her performance succeeds, because there has never been anyone like Odete in any other movie: crazy? heart broken? childlike? a fraudster? no one knows, friends. So she did the rules here. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was also a good example of the problem most Portuguese films suffer from: soundtrack. There is a permanent NO to dubbing and the result is this regular mass noise coming from the blue. People in other countries may think that Portugal is the noise of places. However, what excited me was that some of the dialogue was bought, but it didn't necessarily solve the syndrome. Bad dubbing too, I have to say. It is strange to watch a movie in which the first thing that looks at the first scene, when the first character speaks, is: it is called. And all this to say that the movie has technical problems. <br /> <br /> It also has scripting issues. It tries to be classic from the first to the last scene. There was a desperate fear of having things suspended and showing them. The author apparently tried to get everything straight and he did ... it shows !! All dialogue is too exponential and there is not one single voice that sounds like a line out of a movie. It's all a bit raw and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie is a total mess, I have to stress. I just think the good parts are so obvious that I prefer to concentrate on the bad. <br /> <br /> The board does little to do with the poor script. All shots are classic and non-innovative, but they are beautiful. Great work by Rui Po√ßas, incidentally. <br /> <br /> Now, what I think was the problem, the one people love to believe this story and laugh in the movie, rather than take it seriously: The guy who plays the man whoever is THOSE is not an actor of course. Actually, it's a very important role and I can't see why non-actors are thrown into such parts. This man is not an actor or a beautiful man. This means that the whole movie role is in the mountain, since we never believe one second that this beautiful woman is obsessed with him, even though he is gone, and that his brave lover who survives actually has a bad time about losing to come, when everything We see of this character is apathy. Sorry. The world is full of beautiful people who are even nice seductive lovers. The world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and are able to make people obsessed after they're gone. The world is full of big movies and neither of those big movies. C'est la vie!
