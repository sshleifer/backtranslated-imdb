"American Nightmare" is officially tied, according to me, with "Dis Pat!" for the WORST MOVIE of all time. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely like the K-Mart version of the "Friends" movie) gather in a coffee shop to listen to the American Nightmare, a pirate radio program. It is presented by a bearded man. This is the most exciting aspect of his performance. Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the bad one-liner squirting gang, all take turns revealing their biggest fears for the bearded DJ. Unknown to them, listening to a crazy nurse / serial killer ... <br /> <br /> Crazy Nurse goes on to torture Ross and Rachel and ... is waiting again ... to bring their fears to life. These fears include such sticks as "voodoo" and are put down by dentures with old ladies. <br /> <br /> No. Really. <br /> <br /> This movie was in a word rotten. Crazy Nurse's deadly spree has no motivation, there's nothing to make the viewer "jump", hit the end and voodoo again? <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you care about your loved ones - even a little - go to your local Blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide it in your freezer.
