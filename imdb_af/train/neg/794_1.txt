Unless you are already familiar with the pop stars staring in this movie, save yourself the time and stop reading this review after reaching the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> Remember you've ever pushed it up. FILM AND GO WHAT ANY OTHER. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /> <br /> Lame vehicle for Japanese teen idol-pretty boys with nonsense, intricate plot that pulls out for a impervious amount of time until you are ready to shout. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie makes sense. It is an endless series of people expressing different emotions, from joy to anger, from joy to tragedy, for no good reason. Of course, we can see something that happens to be incredibly "dramatic", but we just don't give a curl, because there is no background. <br /> <br /> By the time this movie is over, you'll be sick and tired. of these silly, slender, girly stars' faces. You will be rebellious by giving all the time to see how they smile, cut, cry, look mysterious, be serious, and any other useless expression they slap on their faces. <br /> <br /> That some moron is ever going so far as to refer to this piece of careless trash as the soul of any of its "actors" must be beyond the shadow of a doubt the fan and countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you: <br /> <br /> Only the "reverse," wise followers will like this movie, the majority of teenage girls with pathological worship for anything androgenic. Freud would have a field day. <br /> <br /> Unless you are one of these bad "followers", hell stays away from this horror.
