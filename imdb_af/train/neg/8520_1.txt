When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcast in the United States, I was excited. I then had the accident to see the darn thing. I adore M. C. Beaton's books on the wonderful Scottish Constable. The characters in the book are entertaining and very well written. The powers responsible for this mish-mash apparently never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has anything to do with the series. In addition to the lack of well-known characters, I find the whole show very loud. The actors seem to feel they have to shout their lines and shout at each other. If you like M. C. Beaton's lovely Hamish Macbeth, you're not wasting your time on this garbage.
