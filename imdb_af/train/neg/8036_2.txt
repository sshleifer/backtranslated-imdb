Want to know a secret? This movie sucks. Well, I really don't know, because if you allow yourself to be original movies through plagiarism versions, you might find this movie amazing. (This movie is a plagiarism I know you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the film is based on a typical story environment; A lot of the so-called cool teenagers entertain their vacation in Florida and act by acting as much as the youth they are. The only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director has succeeded in illustrating a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. The second half hour of the movie gets some momentum and begins to start with the not-near-unknown murder. The third half hour of the movie will definitely be a mystery to me, because I switched it off before I could further deceive myself into thinking the movie has something interesting and original to show. As far as the story is concerned, it can be easily explained in a few lines. A lot of teenagers go to Florida on vacation. As they are partying, they are slowly (and I mean mean) started killing because they know a fool secretly. The only thread to the murder is that all victims were matriculants from an ordinary high school. However, one thing that surprised me about this movie was how much betty (I don't know for sure her name, the blonde character) looks like a spoon. Another thing that surprised me about the movie was that it made me jump out of my seat a few times. Does this make it a work of art? absolutely not because my 12-year-old cousin dropped me a glass of orange juice because she made me "boo'ed" when I just had to go through the guest room door. What is the difference between the director and my 12-year-old cousin ???? <br /> <br /> Want to know a secret ??? I'm not sure about your guys, but I don't.
