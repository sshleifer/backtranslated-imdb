It is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's. This is in today's day as we see a base in Afghanistan that is being prepared by the UAV. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly where the movie jumps. UAVs are not armed. They may be, but I don't think it's ever been for real. We see the computer that manipulated this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We were introduced to "hacker" Will Farmer (he's good at chemistry and electronics that doesn't make him a computer hacker) and his love interest, Annie) & Will's first attempt at hacking is not just a complete failure, his IP address was also recorded and Annie guessed who it was. We also meet Wills mom who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Wills taking money from his neighbors' bank account (Mr. Massude) is not a hack (he helped him set up the account), then we got a nod to the original movie where they decide to play Global Thermal Nuclear War and they play The Dead Code. The track that the RIPLEY office is underway is NOT on Will, but on Massude's computer, so all the evidence they gather was useless against Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly why RIPLEY shut down Will's machine is not explained (he just plays an online game?) and also why it was necessary to shut down all the electricity in the whole block. he also lived. Why a counter-terrorism agency would see it as a viable target is extremely questionable. What does RIPLEY activate its phone? I don't think it wasn't connected to the computer and the message won't play unless he actually answered the phone. There is also more bad "hacking" science. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude's home. , get him away & Will gets an envelope that apparently contains a lot of money. Looking for the license plate of the car that Massude has taken is not a hack, as you never see it breaking into the DMV computer. The RIPLEY agents grabbing Dennis at the airport while searching won't have authority to arrest or arrest him. Will's mother also doesn't have "stolen chemicals & bio agents". And even if she did, they had no right to arrest or arrest Dennis. Patriot Act of note. <br /> <br /> I don't know why Will was worried about arresting any crime in Canada as a completely different country with different laws to the US. <br /> <br /> The computer has become rogue and all the actions against Will, his mother and Dennis have not been approved by a state agency. The phone profile we see will be the first show of any hacking skill in the movie. We also get a hack in RIPLEY that looks too easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> The "guy" running in Annie at the airport and also watching them in the street was nothing to do with RIPLEY and the ridiculous idea that RIPLEY could follow a cell phone while underground was stupid than the idea that a computer reads lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original movie when they replace Stephen Falken as the RIPLEY system designer, replaces the Joshua project. We find out that the "guy" who ran Annie was Falken (who was not played by the original actor) who blasted his own death. <br /> <br /> We also see WOPR as "what will they help" beat RIPLEY and they used the same voice. Falken & WOPR are being destroyed too soon after they are almost not used (the same blast must kill Will, Annie and the Russian. The country from which it works. <br /> <br /> The whole "Decontamination" plot and idea is absolutely incredible, such orders will have to go through the president or joint head of staff. ridiculous and incredible idea. <br /> <br /> Will not do the IP hacks against RIPLEY, he only contacts one of his friends who suggests and implements the idea. just because RIPLEY's operation is being raised Temperature: Having Joshua as a back door in RIPLEY (especially after being blown out) is an incredible cop-out and screaming from a very desperate writer who had no ideas and wanted this get over and over. <br /> <br /> There is a terribly good place where RIPLE Y plays Dead Code and we see a countdown (say 17 minutes), and then RIPLEY says "Decontamination in 30 minutes", how crazy it is when they can't even keep up with their own timer ? RIPLEY's attack mission against Philadelphia comes to a standstill and decides to attack Joshua in his internal circles and direct the missile to a Philly to Washington where RIPLEY is stationed. The idea of ​​the Core Exchange to make RIPLEY realize what she is doing will not work (surely she already knew if she had her Joshua insider as he already taught this lesson in the original movie?) Another nod back to the original movie. <br /> <br /> Their cop-out to repeat RIPLEY. Joshua's exactly the same words form the end of the original movie, just to show how many original ideas they couldn't find. <br /> <br /> If you want to point your fingers to bad and stolen ideas, men should blame Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. It's a horrible movie and is best avoided.
