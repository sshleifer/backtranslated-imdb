Released on DVD in the UK as Ax, The Choke is a teenage shooter who almost fails every section: the story is almost non-existent, leading to a movie mostly made of people wandering around a dark building; With the exception of two characters (who are clearly planning to be the survivors of the movie), they are all extremely difficult, which means that the viewer cannot care less when they are slaughtered; the deaths are not enough (unless a short shot of a pound of ground cattle cover in fake blood changes your stomach); and the free sex scene features no nudity (an unforgettable mistake to make in a slasher flick). <br /> <br /> The waffle-thin plot sees members of a punk band appearing inside the world to be the biggest nightclub (there are endless dilapidated corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever had seen where they are picked up by an invisible attacker. For a low budget effort, the production values ​​are good, and the players seem to be quite capable actors, but with almost enough horror stories, a reluctance to get really messy (that's a treasure, where is the graphical explosion?) , too much dreadful dialogue (especially of the non-dead-fast drummer) and some badly advised to use tough video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the movie becomes extremely boring .
