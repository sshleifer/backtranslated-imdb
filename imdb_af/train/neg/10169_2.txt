It's 1978, and of course there are too many black players on the team! Fans will be upset and definitely the 75 000 seats will be full, less happy, there are so many black players on the pitch! Made for the TV Super Bowl movie is viewable. It is not much more, but it is really surprising the role-play of talented actors that make an appearance (for the time being), probably Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, any luck brings Selleck on the screen, is quickly plunged by "actors" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid story about super-bowling. PJ Jackson is charged with "New York" (read mafia) to ensure the match ends for their favor, in this case a $ 10 million bet. PJ is innocent enough, and apparently understands a bit by buying a few people here and there. But things seem to be falling apart. Another person, the fearless Lainie, takes control. For a while, the mystery of murders is not known, but apparently it is clear in the final murder that Lainie is the new antagonist. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie but is viewable. The acting is decent, and the filming is OK. At least there wasn't a stupid, typical 70s car hunt (they just got their place here). Just keep an open mind about the past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 2.5)
