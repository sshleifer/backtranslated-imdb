I like Batman: Dead End. A dark edgy movie-noir setting for Batman was perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. It's not. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start with the acting. None of this is really that good. The best will probably be Clark Bartram as Batman. But it doesn't say much. He is good at first glance, and then you realize he is what he is, a bodybuilder who is a tolerant actor. But especially the problem is that Batman does not fall into the daylight, he looks like a freak running around in a Bat suit. Instead of a terrible scar trying to make mistakes. The daylight also reveals an annoyingly dull shoe on Bartram's face that never leaves in Batman: Dead End and is unthinkable, probably due to the darkness required in this trailer. Bartram seems to think that sly and stubbornly shakes his head, acts, it's not, it's quite the opposite. It's called positioning, something real actors avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood why Collora threw the builders of the body as leaders. It makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it, rather than a bodybuilder who can really manage it, but HE HE LIKES LIKE THE COMPECT! Of course, they might have done better if Collora's dialogues didn't leave much. <br /> <br /> The whole trailer (yes, trailer. There won't be a full movie) Superman than Batman. But everything on the Superman side is corny, cloying and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He was standing, smiling, saying his lines. It's about it. Although I am not surprised as he is just a bodybuilder, they hired and possibly received some plays. Again I say to Collora, ACTORS. Not bodybuilders. Actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact that they don't look exactly like the cartoon. <br /> <br /> The costume is what you expect from Superman. As for the Batman suit. Well, I think it just looks good in the dark. I say this, because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies in this movie. But that's not a good thing. These shots look especially amateur. This and much of the whole movie looks like it's shot with a VHS camera in their backyard. <br /> <br /> The best shots are a shot of Superman taking a car in his hands. And the last shot of Two-Face and Batman in the end. For those who saw the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. Now if he could just stretch that shot through the whole trailer. <br /> <br /> Finally, I ask. Why if you try to show your ability as a director would you make a trailer as a short film? It proves nothing if it's a real director story. My only advice for Collora here is, there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End didn't feel amateur. I can't figure out where it went wrong.
