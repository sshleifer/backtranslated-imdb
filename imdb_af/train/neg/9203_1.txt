Many people like to watch this TV movie shouting with the big legends of Hanks-philes that Tom did indeed make crappy movies (I think "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The movie focuses on a "Dungeons and Dragons-style game" that eventually drives our young Gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is atmospheric early in the 1980s, focusing on the threatening threat to our youth played by the evil role play. <br /> <br /> I prefer to see "Mazes and Monsters" as the turn Show in "Whatever happened to Chris Makepeace?" story. We all remember him as 'Rudy the Rabbit' in 'Meatballs' and as the fearless Clifford in 'My Bodyguard', where he gave us all a popular excitement by knocking out the shit out of Matt Dillon. Few can argue (especially those of us who regularly read "Dynamite!"). Those great things were available to him. <br /> <br /> Then came Rona Jaffe. The rule between bad acting and bad writing is razor-thin, so I give it to you to decide whose fault Makepeace's performance in this is. All I know is that the last big release I saw him was "Vamp" and it was 1986. He played a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and the Snowman", but by then was the Brat Pack torch <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie with good conscience. See if it's just a younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace, before Rona Jaffe celebrated his soul.
