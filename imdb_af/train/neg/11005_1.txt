This movie shows a series of sketches, which partially pass into one another. I realized that passing was late in the movie, and it first irritated me. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes in this movie come together without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to strangle it, using absurdity and obsession. The attempt to stay comedy without any funny pieces failed. <br /> <br /> My staff and perhaps subjective result after watching this movie (My God, it hurts me in my head every time I call it "movie"): A pressing effort to do nothing in anything good to change. But this failed. At least the director made something out of nothing. But it's not good. <br /> <br /> Many movies didn't turn out as funny as they were planned, but this one is all covered. This is the real-life manifestation of the worst-case scenario of film making. No. To improve myself, it's even worse than that. A movie with gags so bad that they are not funny at all. It is not even fun to watch the main actor, writer and director (all three same men casually) disappear by drowning in the sea of ​​bad movies. The movie is too bad for that.
