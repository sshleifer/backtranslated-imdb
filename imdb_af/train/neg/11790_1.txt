Deep SH .. is more like that! The eel was just filmed over the film. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" meets "Leviathan". Very tough. <br /> <br /> No character or relationship development. So-called "romantic" scenes are very stingy and predictable. An interesting idea but a poorly written writing and LUXURY special effects make it a definite must-miss!
