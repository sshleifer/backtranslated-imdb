I actually saw this movie in the theater in the original version. It was painful to see Peter Sellers harming him so much. The story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was just sad to see how the mighty case fell. I won't say I'm a big Peter Sellers fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Pink Panther series and I felt he had a strong performance in Being There. But this film should never be made. From what I read, he strived to produce this film against the advice of the people around him. Good, but it still doesn't apologize for the studio that actually releases the movie.
