When I first made news this morning, I thought, "Wow, finally, a little entertainment." It was slightly amusing for a week or so ... But we have to face it, these news reporters (if they can even call it) have too much to play around. <br /> <br /> First, I thought Jillian was breathing fresh air. But seriously, this woman did not have the least journalist in her. She is very unprofessional. She interrupts Steve when he begins to inform viewers about a news release. It's just really annoying to the point that I can't see it anymore. <br /> <br /> Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves a celebrity. Therefore, she is immediately transformed into a well-known personality around celebrities whom she is supposed to interview. She is not very professional and sees her relationship with celebrities more important than being a just insatiable journalist - and that's all I can say about her. <br /> <br /> Also (disappointing), this show has more entertainment news than essential news stories around the world, government, USA, or something that will benefit the public's best interest. They are focusing on sensation that everything they talk about comes as a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly tolerant ... <br /> <br /> I believe "Good Day LA" is for young teens and celebrities, and it's certainly not for people who actually care about the news . <br /> <br /> PAGE NOTE: (I'd rather look at KTLA, but they're trying so hard to entertain sometimes. They're still a bit dull. Oh, well, I'll be at NBC "Today. "ABC's" Good Morning America "is also okay ... as long as Diane Sawyer doesn't get too serious.)
