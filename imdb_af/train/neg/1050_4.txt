Nathan Detroit performs illegal craps games for high roles in NYC, but the heat is on and he can't find a safe place. He plays the chronic streamer Sky Masterson that Sky cannot be a primary missionary, Sarah Brown, with him. Sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in the store. <br /> <br /> It's one of those expensive fifties MGM musicals in brilliant color, with huge sets, loud music, bigger roles than life and performances to match; Broadway photographed for the big screen if you want that kind of thing I don't. My biggest problem with these types of movies is simply the music. I love all sorts of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway shows songs in swing time with an endless pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet thriving at the end of every fourth bar, not my cup of tea. It is written by the team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a few Damon Runyon stories), and while the plot is quite pleasant, the songs are weak. Blaine's two numbers, for example, are identical, unnecessary, don't protrude the plot and grid on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that kind of thing bother you). There are only two memorable songs, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you would expect) and Sit Down, you are Rockin 'The Boat (beautifully executed by Kaye), but you have to sit for two hours to get. to them. The movie's trump card is a young Brando giving a thoughtful, lazy performance; He also sings very well and dances even a little, and is equally appropriate with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence where the two of them escape to Havana for the night is a welcome break from all the noise, crowds and vowels of Noo Yawk. Fans of musical can dig it, but in my opinion a musician has to do more than just film the stage show.
