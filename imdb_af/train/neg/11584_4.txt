About twenty minutes into this movie, I was already bored. Quite simply, these characters were pretty boring. Sometimes something pleasant will happen, but then things will slow down again. Fortunately, my patience was finally rewarded, and the end to this movie was not bad at all. However, it was not good enough to justify the first ninety minutes. So, I would say the movie was mediocre, and with all the talent in the movie, I would call it a disappointment.
