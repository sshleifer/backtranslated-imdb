There really wasn't much of a story in this movie. It released him from the events in the first Lion King movie. It's supposed to be how Timon and Pumbaa met each other through their loneliness. But there's not much more than that. <br /> <br /> It mixes some scenes from the original, then it's ab-libs about how this movie changed a bit. But still it is? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all I have to show is an empty plot with little explanation. <br /> <br /> I think you'd like to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe, so it is. But unlike this, it does little justice to the animators. Disney should really stop these direct-to-video productions. It was really boring and could have used Jason Statham. "D"
