This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. It's one of those movies that shows them on a rainy day at school when you can't watch out for recess, and you'd rather watch anything, anything else. At least that's how it was when I was in primary school. I just remember HATING this movie. Granted, I didn't see it in 15 years, and they probably won't use it on rainy days, but I just want to warn everyone: You'd better use it to make your kids sleep than entertaining them. Believe me, choose anything else. Although the subject is so controversial, the plot is so slow and slow that I can't remember anything, except that I didn't like it so much, that 15 years later I needed to warn you all about it. .
