The screenwriter is so stupid that it hurt me to wash away 2 hours of my life. I will never come back (where have I heard before). The acting is so-so. Things often change enough to make you look and wait for something cruel to happen. Yet there is no single original thing in this movie. While the first cube was a nerdy horror movie, which ultimately didn't make much sense, cube picked up zero about it and tried to repeat exactly the same story, except this time making it an unnecessary point to try spoon feeding statements for every detail that first movie did not answer. The comic thing is, the director recovers the exact screens of the first movie that was somewhat weird and trying to explain it. But the screens are only copied, there is no coherence whatsoever. This script is so useless. I can imagine it being written by a half-white 15-year-old with a baseball cap and a beer pack for a class project. The best part is in the end, they mutilate the 'good' wunderkind man and he becomes the delayed man in the first movie, and you see him when they find him ('this room is green ..') in Cube 1997 Goodie throw, slap bang, what a twist. First of all, if you didn't see the first one, it doesn't make sense to be a nitwit director. Oh, another good idea: instead of the numbers to identify x, y, z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time it is 3 letters, each giving one of 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. Except that permutations no longer make sense, so let the letters disappear before anyone can use them. I want my money back. <br /> <br /> I think I had to write it down as there are just as many bad, conflicting, or just stupid ideas in this movie. Directors / authors should be required to possess talent.
