"People I know" are a clunker with no one to root and nobody should care - despite the talents of a talented cast. <br /> <br /> Pacino is delivering its regular tour to Eli Wurman, a former publicity agent who was taken out by a lifetime of moral corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone, it's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, his dilemma, or his fate. <br /> <br /> The film traces Eli's preparations for a benefit to a liberal political cause, while being distracted by a client (Ryan O'Neal, well in a subordinate part) the latest "dirty" laundry "- in this case, a TV actress companion who got involved with the wrong people. Tee Leoni brings her regular strength to this supporting role, although the script doesn't give her much to work. Like Eli's sister-in-law, Kim Basinger manages sympathy despite indisputable plot mechanics. <br /> <br /> This movie is strict for those who like to watch Pacino prop up his pieces and enjoy the other principals. Unfortunately, between the writing and the direction, "People I Know" is strictly amateur. Hence its limited scene release, and fast travel to DVD. Consider yourself warned.
