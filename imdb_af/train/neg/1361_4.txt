I was excited to discover this late sixty comedy that some of my favorite people are staring at - Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and of course Peter Ustinov. My disappointment, therefore, is to discover the movie, not work as a comedy or a perfect movie. Ustinov is playing a tiny rogue just out of jail who establishes his sites on a large US corporation in London. Blublind turned his way CEO Karl Malden and technology geek Newhart, Ustinov succeeded himself as a computer expert and immediately planned the 'perfect hoist' part of the film. To do this, he must have passed a security system that manages the corporation's mainframe. And here's a problem. His perfect plan just works because everyone in the movie is remarkably trusted and stupid. His lame excuses are taken at face value and it should be the only computer center where not to be bothered with video cameras. The second problem takes place in the first 30 minutes of the movie, which robs the rest of the picture of much dramatic tension. Unfortunately, Maggie Smith is mistaken for Ustinov's neighbor neighbor / secretary who just can't work. I love Maggie Smith, but she just seems to be composing here, the part has called for more of a crazy, physical comedian. In addition, Ustinov and Smith don't have chemistry together, maybe it's the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, due to real romance as it is, is still creepy. Ustinov wrote the writing, and it was well thought of at the time, but I found it indecent, winding, and a sad waste of a great player.
