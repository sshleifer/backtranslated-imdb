It seems to me as a recent film school graduate that in these times of New Zealand film new heights, the general public seems to think every New Zealand movie is made wonderful. Sione's Wedding proves it's dead wrong. <br /> <br /> It's completely over-rated and not funny, and far from the hilarious movie, other IMDb users have commented. The only very funny thing I found in this movie was Derek, the wannabe black man, but otherwise the jokes were recycled shit we've heard before. <br /> <br /> To be half-Samoan decent, I wanted to see the film deal with Polynesian representation. It was a full ball. I know it's an alleged comedy, but I didn't feel the characters had anything new about Polynesian identity, even though it was in a tongue-in-the-cake way. I was most disappointed at the end of the film and the resolution of the character's relationships. Mikaele was the player who had just chased white women, came back a little when the "Dusky Maiden" came to town, had an epiphany who might have to start looking for a stable relationship, and then rejected it at the last minute and he accepts his position as a Polynesian Playboy for palagi women. I didn't understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see that it was a good laugh, but eventually it was really bitter to pay to see it at the theater. The jokes are at its best, the acting, especially of Sepha's friend, APPALLING, and frankly I would have been happy if I had my hands on one of the movie's pirate copies to save myself the $ 15 ticket price. /> <br /> I think the only good thing to come out of the movie is that it is the second step (behind No 2, of course, a far better movie for this one) at the birth of Polynesian theater. I hope the Pacific filmmakers in the future of Sione's Wedding can learn how to NOT reflect Polynesia and say something more meaningful and meaningful. Even if it's done in a comical way.
