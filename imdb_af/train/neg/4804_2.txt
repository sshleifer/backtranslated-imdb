I don't watch much television and come across this show. Reality Program? I hope it's not really. If I were a man and had such a night and was so married to such a man, it would be a reason for divorce. I think she sets a bad example of how a person should handle a person who loves them. It is one thing that is wrong with our world now, so many people in bad relationships, selfish and do not know what it means to really love another. It is self-sacrifice and not something that should be on merritt. It doesn't give anyone a very good feeling to watch what should be in private counseling. If his personality is on the show for real, then he deserves someone much better who will show true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this display a reality or made up for ratings ???? I really want to know. Sincerely, GB
