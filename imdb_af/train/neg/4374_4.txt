<br /> <br /> Entrails of a Virgin are so bizarre and incomprehensible that it can interpret the viewer subjectively, apply anything he wants to his inexplicable violations of sex and violence. If it was a deliberate feature of the movie, it would be a postmodern glamor work, but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without getting too much in plot summary, let's take a quick tour of the events. On a secluded cabin, an orgy is underway, which also includes the best casual wrestling and diaper. Loss of late arrivals joins the orgy, but they are unconsciously followed by a monster I like to call the "muddy ninja". This monster precedes killing one by one orgy participants, except the proverbial virgin (if you do not count oral sex) who receives his seed and thus becomes so passionate with the desire that she masturbate with someone's cut hand. <br /> <br /> Eventually she pulled out her bowel, and then there's a scene that turns out to be pregnant with a baby muddy ninja. Do you have everything? If you rent this movie, it's better if you don't speak Japanese and have no captions. In a season filled with boring Hollywood movies, it can be the movie-like equivalent of shock therapy in your video recorder. It will definitely be something different.
