Born from heaven, a gang of horny naked female angels (with large plastic corridors) established themselves in a haunting forest where they feed on any fearless souls who have to wander. It's not long before a group of friends fall victim to the bloodthirsty babies on a road trip? An independent low budget fever made in the United Kingdom is an interesting prospect, and it boils down to the worst sightings, effects and direction I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> Director John Roberts sometimes shows flair behind the camera? The screens in the delapidated house are pretty tense and there are some handy shock moments - but mostly the movie is technically amateur. Throw some amazing performances from horror icons, Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have one really bad movie on your hands. <br /> <br /> Some fun can be deduced from the movie's sheer hardness, and there are plenty of female nudity for the guys to enjoy, but most will find it a task to go through.
