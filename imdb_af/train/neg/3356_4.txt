The Shirley Jackson novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' is an atmospheric story of terror, which brings supernatural phenomena into an old mansion. The atmosphere is well set out, and the cold fever is well behaved. A ghostly masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The 1963 chiller "The Haunting" now stays with the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, it's very little, and so the scare of the book and the chills are even better performed on the screen. The black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the film. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And then Jan de Bont made it. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting hit the theaters - if you could call it a remake. Why they had to make a repetition of the 1963 movie is in itself a mystery, but for the moment we can look at the movie itself. <br /> <br /> It starts averagely, as most horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful, and oddly mysterious, and for a few minutes the movie seems to be a pretty repetitive one. And then comes the first fright: A loose harpsichord thread cuts a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). It's hilarious, and the truth is being told, it almost made me tear. <br /> <br /> From then on, the film just rolls down. The play looks a bit like the movie is underway, with Owen Wilson's character particularly annoying (so it's such a relief when he explodes through the smoke fly). <br /> <br /> The special effects make this movie, it's a pity, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. Examples are many, so I will not bother. <br /> <br /> All in all, along with hundreds of others, I strongly recommend that you look at the original radiator, or alternatively, buy the novel by Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away from this. And if you decide to watch it, watch it on the TV. Many of the channels love to screen this movie, not the original one. Or rent it cheaply, but don't buy it, whatever you do. Don't waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final rating: 4/10
