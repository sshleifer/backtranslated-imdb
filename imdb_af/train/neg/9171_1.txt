What can I say? I ignore the reviews and saw it myself. Condemned the reviews were so right. Considering a waste of money on the budget. <br /> <br /> Well, I went to see Kill Bill after this one. <br /> <br /> Watching a very scary movie will be Crossroads! <br /> Bottom line - I like "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this crap.
