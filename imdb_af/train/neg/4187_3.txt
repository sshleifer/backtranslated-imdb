A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale", is no more than an 87-minute music video created on a dozen or so songwriter's works. Instead of dialogue, the film rests solely on Young's lyrics, which are heavily tortured with socio-political commentary, to tell the story while actors work out the scene. <br /> <br /> Given the hammy performances and the clumsy grain Of the picture, the effect is the equivalent of Young who blows some of his own home movies and releases them for public use. Although there is allegedly a "story" running through the film, we really have no idea what's going on, thanks in particular to the uninhibited appearance of the movie, the lack of dialogue and the amateuristic ineptitude of the play. All we get for eighty and seven minutes is a bunch of obsolete hippies that quietly move through an incoherent story, while Young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. The whole thing becomes a boring exercise in self-denial. "Greendale" gives off-Hollywood, low-budget film-making a bad name.
