Although I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie particularly timely. Perhaps because I come from another era and another country, but I have found Crosby's constant references to the Good Old USA, pleasant, only after a while and then finally irritating. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American - but it was as if the English couldn't do it right and / or this brave, oh clever American visitor needed to show them the way. It's a "fish from the water" story, but unlike most movies of this kind, this time it's the "fish" that prevails. To be honest with myself as well as the movie, I spaced it a few times over a few years and got the same impression each time. <br /> <br /> (I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and it also gave me the same reaction. And to my surprise, even my wife, who is worth American's value American Crosby's "in your face" attitude found it annoying, too much reference to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned , it is unique enough for its day and the supporting role is of course very good. The scenery and music are also good, just like the great costumes. Although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wedge on William Bendix looks awful (photo Tired of The Three Stooges). <br /> <br /> All in all, it would be a much nicer picture without Bing Crosby's attitude, but being virtually every shot, it's pretty hard to put this movie.
