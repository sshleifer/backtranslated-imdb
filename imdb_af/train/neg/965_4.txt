First, I like the movie. It was a nice comedy with a few stupid moments. The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best !!! Same as wonderful set designer Robert R. Benton - this guy really had a very good taste! But the writing writers disappointed me. The best end will be the scene on the ladder, but instead they decide that the father and his daughter should be together. Don't like the end. The father becomes a boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it right. It would be good if, for example, the writers of scripture say there is another soul in the body, but they have not, they just robbed him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cyber ​​Shepherd was beautiful, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dance scene :))) ... But some of the moments even spoiled the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after her husband's death, waited for him for 23 years. It was a long time! She was trustworthy to him, she didn't love anyone, and when she met him and was just about his love, to a scene with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she had the man she longed for so many years, betrayed very easily !!! It would be a good movie, if not the end and some people's psychology missed.
