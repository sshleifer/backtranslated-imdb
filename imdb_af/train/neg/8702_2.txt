This is one of the silliest movies I've ever had to watch! I had expected it after I saw the first two, but I still like these movies with the idea of ​​"Maybe they did it right." No, not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? How about the special effects ... To give an idea of ​​what goes on for SFX in this movie, a soldier at one point shoots a "Raptor" while walking in a corridor. Even with less than a second screen time, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail who is apparently tied to him to walk around. Bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> What about the acting? If that's what you can call it. There is one character I'm supposed to be from the south. But after six years in the south I have never heard this way of speaking. Perhaps he has some kind of strange disability - the inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent. Therefore, there was no reason why the actor was trying to do one. <br /> <br /> What about the plot? It's pretty basic - Raptors escape, people with rifles hunt them. I'm wondering why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to be in the nearest tunnel system ... won't they stay outside to hunt prey? Oh well, at least they have the good sense of appearing very little in the movie that is allegedly turning around. <br /> <br /> Other things - Let's say you are in a building and you know there is a man who eats raptors walking around in it. Would you decide to take time to have an argument about who is better - Army of Marine? And then decide to have a weapon match game to fix it? How about the idiot idea that they have to find the raptors - split into two groups. Didn't they watch any horror movies (or at least a Scooby Doo episode)? In short, this is one of the brave movies out there. Miss it if you don't want to groan your way through a movie.
