With that line, a stupid, boring British science film begins. The Big Vorelli of the movie "Devil's Head" just builds a teleportation machine to cut off its funding through Blanchard, a bearded man who has a thing for bow ties and men with big eyelids. When his experiment fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the grants in the world, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to get himself into Blanchard's house with the help of his fine laboratory assistant, Sheila. Needless to say that something goes wrong and he looks like a mess. The rest of the movie is devoted to the good orange-haired doctor who walks around London's shocking people with his mutated hand and wears a diaper on his face. There are more murders, some modest paperwork, and eventually the doctor disappears wherever the doctors go. Fortunately, no one decided to make a successor.
