Thank you for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES were fun, but this low budget correction made me grow. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (the poor man's Kevin Bacon) drives around Mexico with a surfboard that features a hidden compartment with his vampire-lethal gear ala Antonio Banderas's guitar case in DESPERADO. He picks up a few lame "hunters" along the way (including an annoying feminist-infected girl taking pills to change a vampire), and they go out to stop a female master vampire who gets no background no less about her or her quest (to walk in the sunlight by stealing the black cross and doing a ritual to allow her to do so). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen it and done much better. <br /> <br /> Recently, John Carpenter is responsible for very bad movies. Frankly, I think he is over his head and unable to make another horror classic. The only decent movie he did since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. All others are complete crap, to the incredibly cheap search and delayed GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this waste of celluloid. Where are more sizes such as DISTRIBUTION ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK AND THE THING? <br /> <br /> Carpenter Crony Wallace proves he can't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper -The manuscript full of throws, greens and recycled gags from the original. Did I mention that I hated every character in the movie? There wasn't a single memorable character in the whole movie. How does this happen? This movie didn't recommend anything. Not even the DVD presentation is good; The menu looks awful. <br /> <br /> For comparison, JASON X: "FRIDAY THE 13th IN SPACE" was a masterpiece. Now it's how to make a sequel and (again) activate a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as an exciting DVD menu.
