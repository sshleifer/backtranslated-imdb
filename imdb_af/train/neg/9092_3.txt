Friz Freleng's "Speedy Gonzalez" was the second cartoon to hold the title character after Robert McKimson's "Cat-Tails for Two". In that cartoon, Speedy is an ugly little creature with a big golden tooth, but at its second appearance, the familiar design has already been adopted. Despite being much more attractive, Speedy never developed much of a character. A great hat, tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent don't make a classic character and that's pretty much all Speedy has ever gone for him. Nevertheless, the cracking flies mouse became very popular and he went in many shorts, including some rude films from the studio's last days. While these early Speedy shorts are better than the later atrocities in which he is regularly (quite strange) mated to Daffy Duck, they leave much to be desired, depending on predictable gags usually based on a similar hunting formula. In this self-described episode, Speedy is recruited by other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory, which Sylvester cat preserves. Although he brings the extra weight of a star, turning to the cartoon, Sylvester's role here can easily be filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is sown by being forced into the predictable. tireless role of persecutor. It was always a problem in the Tweety cartoons, but Speedy made an equally duller opponent thanks to his horrible haste and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester will be forced to appear with Speedy for many years. Despite this, a pretty basic formula and minimal lag followed, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and a thorough star was born.
