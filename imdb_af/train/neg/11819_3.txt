Despite unfortunately he thinks (a) intelligently, (b) important and (c) interestingly, fortunately this movie is mercifully fast. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of ​​the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strange, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never leave him out of music. His performance is unanimous and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing being said is that Harvey Keitel manages to make a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would just show how bad good actors can act, but graciously his actions are limited here.
