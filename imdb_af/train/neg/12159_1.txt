I can't believe I actually watched it, but I think I just wanted to know if this movie would be unintentionally more beautiful and funny. and it did. the climax was the worst performance ever given by the defense lawyer - so from real life it was too strange for a fictional story. no way anyone on this planet can act before a court like she did. and probably the worst prosecutor on earth. Why was he in court anyway? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to make her guilty. A simple search for her home would have led to the discovery of the rings. but don't go. he chose to say "objection" 2 or 3 times throughout the trial - that was it. The blonde lunatic was given a dignity to prove her innocent, but not Brett. The villain had almost an Brett altar in her home that could prove her sick obsession. But don't go again. During the courtroom, I felt the silent urge to take the needle out of her hand and clap her several times. even real weirdos don't look that stupid fake "I'm innocent" as she did. and what does this movie tell us? Don't marry a woman with a life insurance: as soon as she falls off the stairs, her husband is thrown into jail, guilty or not. Evil, bad people.
