This movie is hilarious, not in a good way. The battles are done badly, sometimes trying to shock you by breaking bones, and even it happens only two or three times, certainly not enough to call it a shockwheel. A gunfire means that a hero in an open field can walk with 10 people shooting with him on uz, picking up a gun, starting shooting and not getting hurt. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, you wake up, lose its memory, start fighting it is where it is good. Five years later memories come back, revenge blablabla. <br /> <br /> Not worth your money, not really worth your time unless you are drunk and bored.
