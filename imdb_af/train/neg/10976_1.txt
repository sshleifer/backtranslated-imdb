A horrible movie that is supposed to be an independent one. It needs some reliance on something. <br /> <br /> This totally miserable movie deals with the interaction between Irish people. Were they trying to imitate the wonderful movie "Crash"? If so, this movie has collapsed completely. <br /> <br /> There is just too much going on, sprouting a bit of walking and throwing rocks into buses and cars that naturally cause chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is just hooked to work. One woman lost her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister was ripped off by a sworn. This causes the former sister to become a bitter grease and walk in clothes that are not worth believing. The older sister is also embittered, but soon finds romance. <br /> <br /> Then we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob a bank. Obviously the robbery is going wrong, but there seems to be no punishment for the crooks. Perhaps the punishment had to be on the authors because of the failure to create a coherent film.
