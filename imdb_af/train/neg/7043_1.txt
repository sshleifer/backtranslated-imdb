I was prepared to laugh through this movie like a Mystery Science Theater experiment, but it was just boring. It appears that the producers had many biker enthusiasts friends, and from time to time decided to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It's often irreconcilable. Many footage of cyclists ride on a gravel road, with the same music repeatedly played. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is hardly in the movie. Harmon would probably have tackled things. Perhaps she had other obligations on the day it was filmed. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bikers terrorize a small town. Fighting, murder, a cowardly policeman, a goofy mechanic, etc. One of the cyclists always wears a soccer helmet, a poor attempt to distinguish him from all the other offenders. <br /> <br /> The writing has nothing to offer. One scene has a biker who attacks a woman who screams in the woman's face. "You're all the same! You're all the same!" We returned to the scene a moment later and declared again, "You're all the same!" Can't the writer think something more creative is to be said? <br /> <br /> In the end, the good guys killed the bad guys. We also learn that the marriage between middle-aged mechanic Joe and young Susie was canceled. Susie goes to college, and we suddenly learn that Joe's wedding is still on (but with another bride). End.
