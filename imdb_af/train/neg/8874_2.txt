but there are not too many of them. Probably the worst "big release" movie I've seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. There is no point in commenting on the plot, cast or play. The problem is above all. It lies in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind (not the funny kind) of everything on the screen. I don't know why I gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably, because of Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom - 95 minutes was rinsed in the toilet with some brain cells. Avoid at any cost.
