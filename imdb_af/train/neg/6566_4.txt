I watched this movie after I had so much trouble loading it through rapidshare. And I must say it didn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so hip, I really look forward to seeing it. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those movies that fails to meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, despite a great story. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "On the Waterfront". <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was annoying, especially when he came from America. <br /> <br /> Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% Sure, they'll make a sensible movie out there. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that Parinda was bad. It just wasn't good enough.
