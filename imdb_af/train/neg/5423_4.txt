I've been using IMDb for a few years now, but I've never written any reviews. However, this movie has disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I couldn't stop. <br /> <br /> Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so affected by noise pollution that he adopts an alter-ego as a vigilante, The Rectifier, and vandalizes any cars he has with a car alarm sounds. <br /> <br /> The movie name is somewhat misunderstood. Although one or two other sources of noise are being addressed or mentioned, the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, motor alarms. There is really no other focus. When the film tries to link other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it just seems to be thrown in to give merit to Robbins' character. <br /> <br /> Yes, we're all upset by noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course, we all have the internal urge to take a baseball bat on a screaming vehicle, and this movie uses that fact and virtually the fact alone to sell this movie. I say 'pretty much' because there's also a blatant, confronted sexual relationship (including a completely unnecessary threesome) that is obviously being thrown in for the filmmakers who need such things to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it is an eyeball. <br /> <br /> Robbin's character, very short in the movie, becomes completely incomprehensible. It seems less he decides not to go into the noise anymore, and more so by focusing so much on the noise that he has lost his common sense. The first half of the movie is basically the story of how he just changed from an evil, car-bashing man in this hero of the little man, The rectifier. But ... the transformation doesn't take place. He renames himself. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a while. Annoying generalized social commentaries come in every now and then to add the pretentiousness of the movie, and the self-supporting smirk that never leaves Robbins face also helps. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to do, as it has pretty much stuck in your throat, but I think it's a big failure. Just one man's opinion screams.
