The only scenes that made me laugh where the people with Christopher walked in (the crazy movie director), the rest of the movie was just boring. In the first hour or so nothing really happens. Shouts that are supposed to be funny are not and zeta. jones douglas is really too much. Julia Roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck (yes right!) In the girl next door (where did I see it before?) Who gets the man who would happen to the main characters. If a suicide attempt really fell off the building, the movie could be more interesting to watch.
