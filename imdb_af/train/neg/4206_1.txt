I was in this film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the show, when the writer / director and some role players offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask any questions. Rarely is a film so poorly directed (why on earth are random frames cut out from some screens?), Dealt outright (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional spectrum from A to B. bring a lunch) and completely useless. Characters are out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. Finally, the movie comes to a completely random and useless end that is supposed to really make you think. Unfortunately, what makes you think is: "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life, I never come back."
