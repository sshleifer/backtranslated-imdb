Well, this movie is incredibly terrible. I was sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they didn't write their lines. Which is sometimes delivered with a light sarcasm, which makes me believe that they don't take this movie seriously, or anyone who looks at this tedious beating sword. While I watched this "Creature Unknown" I couldn't help but there was not much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew. But if you're going to watch it for a laugh, you'll be happy, the movie is shameless to mock itself because I can't see anyone watching and being proud to pump it straight to DVD click, action thriller / horror reveal movie fightfest.
