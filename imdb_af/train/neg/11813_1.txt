Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the everyday biggest comedy team, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a range of cheapest. Many of these were parodies of great Hollywood features. Following a dispute with Anderson, Laurel continued the informal series of parodies at Joe Rock's smaller (and more needy) production company. <br /> <br /> At the time, most of Laurel's parody films were just pretty funny and even less funny. for modern audiences who have not seen the original film parading Laurel. 'West of Hot Dog' is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot-em-ups. It is marginally a specific parody of 'West of the Pecos', an oater released two years ago, without major actors. Since 'West of the Pecos' has never been a great success, it's hard to see why Stan's movie unit has chosen this particular movie as a target for their lamp selection. Much less why they waited so long after they were released to parody it. And where did they get the title 'West of Hot Dog'? Perhaps it is under the impression that 'Hot Dog!' was a sexual interjection favored by American fighters in the 1920s. (As in the beginning of the play 'Machinal'.) <br /> <br /> 'Joe of Hot Dog' was produced and co-directed. Among his many other achievements, Rock Laurel introduced Lois Neilson, and he was the best man at their wedding. Full disclosure: In the last years of his life I had the great privilege of talking to Joe Rock and talking to him. Almost ninety years old, Rock's memory was impressively clear ... but he didn't remember anything about 'West of Hot Dog', and I can't blame him. This movie is actually forgotten. <br /> <br /> The front lady's character is called Little Mustard: If it means a parody of something in 'West of the Pecos', I don't get it. There are a few 'impossible' gags here, including Laurel's method of riding a horse. For just one moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly broke in a while. 'West of Hot Dog' is vaguely similar in the subject and shows Keaton's short comedy 'The Frozen North', but Keaton's version is much funnier. The plot of this movie expects a situation in Keaton's 'Our Hospitality' function, but (again) compares: here, two tough heaters are expecting the Last Chance Salon, but the previous owner bequeathed it to weak-footed Stan. However, the brothers will become the legal heirs if Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, though: such a bequest legal? As soon as Stan takes possession of the property, any further queries of ownership or heritage become his decision, not the previous owner's decision. I had enough time to consider such points while looking at this dull comedy. <br /> <br /> At one point a gag involves some rough animations that are drawn directly to the movie stock. It looks cheap and is not funny. <br /> <br /> This 'Hot Dog' is no winer, and no winner. It's just a shutter. My rating: one point out of 10. Hang on, Stan: in a few years you'll be half a comedy legend.
