I read IMDb a few times here and thought I'd give this movie a look. Disappointed. On the positive side, the male lead is good, and some interesting photography, but overall it fails to convince. It seems as if it is full of its own self-sufficient interest to say something meaningful, but briefly short and all in all is an unconvincing mess. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films classified as a movie. noir that can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> A film noir is characterized by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, threat and cynical characters. <br /> <br /> Well, this is the story here: 3 losers stumble upon their collective problems that include mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, guilt, and so forth, and their conspiracy to kidnap a child and persuade each other . <br /> <br /> Would have been a much better movie if the story was more limited to kidnapping instead of kidnappers' kidnappings. I thought the female lead was out of her depth and acted as an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> During a few good moments I felt like I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> 10/04.
