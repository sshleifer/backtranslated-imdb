This horrible movie collects every Asian stereotype you can imagine in a boring package. Money red, fake Japanese businessmen send goofy but sweet policeman Pat Morita to recover industrial secrets in Detroit. Here he meets an abyss at the heel of Jay Leno, who immediately referred to a murder victim as a Jap and named Morita Tojo. It's already downhill from there.
