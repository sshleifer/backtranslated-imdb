Drilling, long, pretentious, repetitive, self-centered? this move feels like a bad date. Worse, the boring art school direction - with a heavy-handed use of the swinging shoe that gets so exaggerated, I almost got up? - is constantly screaming to be noticed. Add the thinnest plots and virtually no dialogue, and the movie begins at about 30 minutes like a four-hour epic feel. It gets worse: instead of dialogue, there are poorly written voice recordings. AND quotes and songs that are all too clear to comment on the characters. Really hard opera music. Give it all to the director. <br /> <br /> The actors are all pretty good. The main actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is especially suited for movie stars. He and the other actors have some erotic moments. However, even this gets boring after 5 minutes, and one wonders if the director audits for a Bel Ami porn work. The beautiful college campus architecture as a place in Mexico City is inspiring. How come universities in the US so dirty (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this movie. You will want to use the shear button? many.
