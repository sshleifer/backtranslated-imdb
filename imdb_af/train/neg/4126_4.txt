Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, excitement-less thriller directed by Amenabar's regular colleague Mateo Gil. The film, which somehow deals with the effects of boredom and the quest for excitement, actually produces no one and looks like an exercise in boredom. The only frivolous moment is the film's climax, which takes about 30 seconds of the entire agonizing 100-plus minutes, and is solved too easily. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the story unfolds, arbitrarily and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or ingenuity. If you are fans of the genre, rather see "Tesis".
