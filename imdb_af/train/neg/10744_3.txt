In the first one it was especially giant rats, but there were also some orphans and a giant chicken. However, this one is just a giant rat period, well giant rats and one really growing little boy. This one is about this growing boy and a scientist trying to help him, so he accidentally creates giant killers. You know how it is. This movie has some manslaughter and its moments, but I find it equivalent to the original. I just prefer a variety in my giant creative films. Well, that's not true ... I'm actually like "Empire of the Ants", maybe I just don't care about giant rodents. All in all, there is quite a deadly movie, but it does have a strange event in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre. I just can't recommend this one.
