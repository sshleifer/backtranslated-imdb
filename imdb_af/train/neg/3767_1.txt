Budget, decent actors ... who knew these things were important. Don't waste your time on this piece of junk. The effects are crap. The acting is shit. The only thing that made it even tolerant was a little cheap T&A and it disappeared in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only even remote quality of this movie is the very uncomfortable curse. It was as if they had found the only 7 people on the planet who had never cursed. Hate! <br /> <br /> If you want to see someone in a bad suit, go back and look at old prom photos. The only way a Bigfoot movie can be any good is that it has a big budget and some actors who didn't come from Frogballs Community Theater.
