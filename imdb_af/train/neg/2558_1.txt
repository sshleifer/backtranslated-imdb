I had to review it for a website, and I looked with optimism that it might be a cheesy, entertaining rip anyway, and it didn't even do well. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen. (Worse than "Godsend") with scenes ripping from "The Omen" without shame. The end is even very similar to the way "The Omen" ends. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the acting, writing and story are all just cut. If these movies make money, I'm sad to see where Asylum is heading. This is embarrassing.
