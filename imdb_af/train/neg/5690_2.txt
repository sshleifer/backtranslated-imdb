Firstly ... I never saw myself as a yours Boll Hater, since I think I've never seen one of his movies, but after seeing this cheap apology for a movie called "Seed" (which is the name of the serial killer, go over this movie) I'm close to joining the hats club. This movie makes absolutely no sense ... the plot is a joke and although Boll is clearly trying to get attention by shocking people, 90% of this movie is just boring. You can summarize this movie as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. Hooded killer watches clips of animals are tortured on TV. It is a real footage of pelagic farms and the film, with the ridiculous reason of a humanity statement, is underway and given a Peta address. Since this movie has no message at all and the worst piece of torture is porn exploitation, you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> 2. Electricity with an excuse giving away what happens later on in this movie, so every delay gets it. <br /> <br /> 3. Police watch videos of animals, babies and women who are hungry and disbanded in Seeds cellar, have stupid nightmares and cry in their whiskey because Seed is such an evil bad mofo. Although the play is OK, the movie takes a dive every time it tries to take any emotions ... <br /> <br /> 4. Cops Bust Sowing in his home, stupid and slashing in the dark . This sequence reminds me of a video game, you hardly see anything except flashlights. Seed is a super killer that occurs all over the place and all policemen are brave enough to kill ... except for one who busts him. <br /> <br /> 5. Seed gets the chair and we see its electricity as long as everything else in this "movie" ... it won't die and we are reminded of the opening statement that it should be released as he survived 3 electric shocks. Guess what ... they just bury him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. Seed comes from his grave, kills everyone in another broken section and then seeks the headquarters to take revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman gets her head with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view, just for the fun and shock value of it. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed catches the police family, lures him to his home, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun, police shot him in the head, considering what Seed wanted (it's hard to get in the head because he doesn't just wear his mask in jail, but never turn a word out ... the movie hardly has any dialogue at all, and doesn't care. <br /> <br /> 9. Boll goes for a nihilistic shock where Seed enters the daughter with her dead father to rot like the people we saw on video 3. <br /> <br /> That's it ... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background, except a stupid story that Seed is burned as a child. <br /> <br /> This movie rests purely on a few keys and their shock value. I hardly remember a movie that is empty of any emotion or message or entertainment. It's like looking at August Underground ... it's good with me, some people will enjoy this mindless sniff. But what is really hard to stand up for is the pseudo-message in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well-made is too good for this celluloid waste due to camera work, effects and even the play. <br /> <br /> So how does Boll get to make such "movies" as thousands of talented directors work on budget costs? "Seed" is not only the essence of ridiculous, its living proof that the free market is flawed. Fortunately, your German taxpayer pays much of this waste to get deductions.
