This show is terrible. How will George have his mother's death funny? This show is terrible. The parents are apparently terrible and the children have to be taken to children's services. The girl is a witch with a b and the boy is just a full blow. George is not funny, especially if he speaks his hard and unpleasant trademark of Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but I slapped him at least a few times, but especially how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in a terrible, despicable character. Certainly, her husband left her, but how anyone can laugh like she has treated George as a baby is outside me. <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain to me how George's head is big is funny? It's not that big! I pulled in characters because they are too terrible and it will take hours for me to write and I honestly don't care. I don't care to tell anyone about this and wonder if they want to see this show or not, or this show is an excuse for a sitcom and it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I give it start 2 because the woman is extremely attractive.
