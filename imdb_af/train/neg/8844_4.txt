I watched this movie after seeing other comments on IMDb, even my wife convinced it was a "unique horror movie." I wanted to keep this movie, but couldn't. <br /> <br /> The "love story" was good, but the horror aspect was pretty bad. If the story is just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia, it would have been a better movie. <br /> <br /> The care center stretched the credibility beyond the boundaries, was quite ridiculous. The doctor happily ignores privacy laws and professionalism. A nurse goes into a room for a routine nutrition of a dangerous patient (without security counseling), and drops the tray and runs out of the room and screams for no apparent reason. The forensic patient (and the film's villain) is tied up in a standing position fully dressed - apparently for years? None of them have much sense. <br /> <br /> The movie even had some actors I liked in other things, like the detectives, but I can't recommend this movie yet.
