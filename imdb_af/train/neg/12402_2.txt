I always thought people were a bit too cynical about these old Andy Hardy movies. Some of them were not bad. Modern film critics are not those who usually prefer to dislike, as well, two footwear movies like this rarely praise. <br /> <br /> However, I can't defend this movie either. You can still have a dated dialogue, but still laugh and cry about the story. If you see it, you shake your head, ask yourself, "How stupid can you get?" It is ant as corny, if you know what I mean. It's so bare, I can't see too many people who actually sit through the hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The story is basically 'Andy' (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of jam because he makes a story about what's involved in some New York City debut as if it were the ultimate. People were much more socially aware in the old days. You would hear the term "social climber" as if it were rich or beautiful people who were the highest achievement you could make. This is of course already uncertain, and looks even so today. <br /> <br /> It's about innocent and clean a story and series (half a dozen of these Andy Hardy movies were made) as you can find. Also, if you want to hear Judy Garland sing, then it's your ticket, as she sings a few songs here and she crowns her way to Andy's heart. Oh man, I'm almost writing so much about it!
