If I saw a triumph of will, I can only say this movie is cruel, even measured by historically low "standards" of the time. Of course, all this is completely manufactured and detrimental. This is what you would expect from the German propaganda of 1930. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself has been broken and cheap. It is also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary Germans have to leave the theater with their noses. In a genre known for its basic appeal, lack of originality and improper injustice, this film does not even qualify as 'bad'. This will have to improve significantly to reach that status!
