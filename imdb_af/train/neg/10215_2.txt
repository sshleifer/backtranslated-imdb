A terribly useless and worse, boring movie. Stranger than Fiction is nothing new to say about anything, no characters beyond the most impressive stereotypes, and relies on some central concept that is not particularly original or vaguely innovative. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell be completely wasted in what he supposedly hoped to be his answer to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and replace his usual calling routine (albeit funny when you discount Talledega nights), though. , pretty much nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is no more than a little annoying (some reviews I've read here are ridiculous for her Oscar nomination) while Maggie Gyllenhaal is a sensible one with a very poor writing which allows nothing but to establish her character as a former law student who challenged Harvard to become a baker because she wanted to make people happy. Please. That she eventually falls for Ferrell's "character" is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's efforts to jazz up the movie using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired material he needs to work. <Br /> <br /> I had the choice to either watch the Prestige for the third time or to see it. I wish I had chosen The Prestige.
