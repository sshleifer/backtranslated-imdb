Think of a darker version of one of those kids programs like "Power Rangers" and you have this 1990 movie, "Robot Jox". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and everyone who comes from their country wins. The robots are big and look slightly better than those of those shows, mainly because they are less colorful, while this movie is not good, it is not bad to watch. I remember two robot battles in this one, one that ends badly and the final build up. There is a plot to turn the road, as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing to keep with you any time after the picture is taken. The battles look like giant toys on the rampage, but still nice to watch. This movie will also grow some other movies with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. So it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that.
