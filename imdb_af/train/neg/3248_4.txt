Why did I go and watch this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was there and in the past he made hilarious movies that made me laugh with laughter. So, did you really accuse me of expecting it again? In addition, the foreground, the funny trailer, his fellow star, Jennifer Aniston's involvement, and the fact that it was a massive hit, encouraged me. <br /> <br /> But as my "one line summary" suggests, I was disappointed. For various reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It wasn't funny. In a 2 hour movie I laughed about 5-10 minutes. For the rest of the time I sat thinking, "I really should have an ice cream." I admit that maybe it's wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes Gem's such as The Truman Show, Liar Liar, Me, Myself and Irene, Dumb and Dumber '' The Mask 'and' Ace Ventura 'movies then produce in Bruce Nolan's own words such a mediocre film? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role is criminally endorsed. I mean hello! She has been in the public eye for ten years, and in this movie she has about four lines to say. Wrong. <br /> <br /> Reason 3: One word - Clich√© <br /> <br /> Reason 4: An immediate deployment of specifically American references - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite's sweep week - is a guide to the film's specifically homemade appeal. "A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education - it's a miracle! Do you want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle!" God tells Bruce, a heavy-handed sentiment that has been spoiled in the US, but may experience stronger resistance in markets that are foolish for subtle retention. In addition, I'm still going to school, and that statement sets me up and all my friends' miracles. Or maybe it just means we have brain? <br /> <br /> In this movie there are enough funny Carrey moments to make your face and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total disaster, but you are advised to revise your expectations down.
