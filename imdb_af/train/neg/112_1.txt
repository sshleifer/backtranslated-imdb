This movie is just terribly terrible. John Ritter falls pratt, 75% of the actors deliver their lines as if they were reading cue cards, poor editing, terrible sound mixing (dialogue is difficult to pick up in places over the background noise) and a plot that really go nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say it, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others who suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started wondering if she wasn't dead. Even Bogdanovich's children are horrible (the oldest one definitely reads her lines from a cue card). This movie is really terrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project 4 years later. Please do not look. If you see it in your television lists, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, review your friendship. If your spouse wants to see it, you're better off finding another soul mate. I'd rather sort out my eyes with lawns than to go through this piece of garbage again. If I could summarize this movie in one word, the word would be: Suckotrocity
