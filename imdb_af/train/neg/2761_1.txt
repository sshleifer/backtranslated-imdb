Everyone does things they regret later. Things they want can be blamed on drugs or alien possession. Things that seem to be rational, later, show that they are buried invitations for suffering and endless denial of stupidity. <br /> <br /> For some people, this is the note for the new Hummer, for others who are picking a killer, because other people are sending their bank account information to third world millionaires who are secretly tied to cash. <br /> <br /> To me it was a movie. <br /> <br /> D War: Dragon Wars In retrospect, I had to guess how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recovered, this movie will be evident from its stuttering and repetitive title. But with my willing suspension of unbelief intact, and a na√Øve belief arising from the cool looking poster in the lobby, I really wanted to work this movie. Unfortunately, the old man in the pawn shop explained the entire background, fifteen minutes in the picture, and I had the sudden, sinking revelation that comes from every plot point of an unseen movie. And even worse: I knew just how much every point everyone would suck. <br /> <br /> Let me be quite clear here. The English language does not have enough nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe how bad it is. movie is really. <br /> <br /> Like knowing all the twists of the movie, I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla films, whose scales are not worthy of this one, it comfortably triggered extra subplots every time the main characters were threatened by the ghost of meaningful dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was contaminated with close calls, miraculous escaped and concentrated deposits of poorly explained anxieties. <br /> <br /> This movie is what would happen if you gave the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers produce access to the national defense budget. And lots of liquor. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you can get hold of all the coolest pieces of successful action movies of the past decade: First, take the rasta talk of amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they ready to beat Navy Seals. <br /> <br /> Now follow the approaches of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (You can even call him Ethan as a "subtle" nod for the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them a lot of film noir narration so no one confused as they try to follow the puddles deep in their minds. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a grumpy villain in the pointed armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings meterals and some giant cobra, who are angry at their scenes from the latest version of King Kong. remove and in no particular order in modern day Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Now go to the drugstore to get something for your sudden migraine. If you come back, purify these ingredients until any transferred hint of originality is dissolved in a homogenized mass of cheese and served half-gelatinously. <br /> <br /> At several points during this photo I made myself heard aloud, Stop the bad movie, "and break into tears. <br /> <br /> To call it a B movie , it will be an undeserved promotion, after the summer school, and lots of physical therapy, it might be a C-level movie if you can sleep in one way or another. <br /> <br /> In short, If you ever find yourself having money and brain cells to burn, and the need to punish yourself for ominous, unspoken sins against humanity, Dragon Wars may just be the movie for you.
