Well, I can end the question once and for all: "What's the worst movie ever made ... ever?" It's Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Certainly there are many famous bad movies, but this one takes the cake because it takes itself so seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a Romanian movie that speaks just how far Romania has to catch up with Bollywood. It also speaks to just how completely without intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel offended after watching it and needing to cry in the corner of the shower and because you know nothing makes you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> It's just released on video. (I can't imagine why) and I suspect the workers had to make the DVDs carry protective equipment and receive regular counseling.
