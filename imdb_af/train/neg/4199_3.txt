Very poor effort that doesn't offer much to everyone, but a hardcore fan of Stanley Tucci, who tries to save the poor structure, dialogue, direction or talent of our leading man. <br /> <br /> Very good The only trick of this plodding story of a naive new salesman for an alarm company is its quirky side characters. But without a realistic background, such characters are useless. <br /> <br /> Nothing to see here, keep moving ... <br /> <br />
