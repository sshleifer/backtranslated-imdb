Terrible movie. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are Just Filler. The movie was bad. Why should I expand it, I don't know. It's been a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The play sucks and the writing is just moronical. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie is Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even so, it was destroyed by a terrible and unnecessary rape scene. The movie is a poorly confiscated and incredible piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> OK, now I'm just picking up on IMDb for this stupid line of 10 line text minimum. First I waste my time watching this waste. Then I feel compelled to warn others, I just create an account with IMDb to discover that I have to write a Friggen set on the movie just to express how bad I think it is. Completely unnecessary.
