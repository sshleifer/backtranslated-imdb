I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was awful! Every clich√©, violent, rich boy-fantasy was in front, you just knew how it would end especially with all the shots of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the Q&A with the director / writer and writer / manufacturer they tried to come as intellectuals, but you could say they are the types that come out on violence. I bet anything they regularly do brothels and do drugs. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. I had to stay away from my boyfriend.
