Encouraged by the positive comments about this movie here, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ movies and it's really one of the worst of them - it's almost terrible in all ways: editing, pacing, storyline, play, soundtrack (the song's only song less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely was I so pleased to see the end credits of a movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 1-count is Harvey Keitel - while it is far from its best performance, it's a bit of a hassle anyway. One for Keitel's obsessive only.
