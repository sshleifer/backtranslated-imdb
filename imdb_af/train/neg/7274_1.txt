"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is simply the worst movie ever made, chosen far beyond even the rude "Plan 9 of outer space." <br /> <br /> The Lampoon movie is told in three segments, each supposedly a ghost of a conventional movie genre, but each landed on our feet with a sickly death. There is no rhyme or reason for these excellent vignettes, and no noticeable story lines. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good thing about the movie is the naaktonele. True, Miss Ganzel and Dusenberry flash a little meat, and it's also very tasty. But the directors do not realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it. There is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is the last one with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see Benson as a young, eager-bever policeman who is accompanied by a cynical old-timer who is played by Widmark. And for a moment, those of us who are still watching this grim film exercise are saddened by the notion that we are about to see a redeeming story about how the young, idealistic police are a pure change in the old -timer's approach to police work. But not so much luck. As we have said, this film has no value-changing values. It is sickly all the way to the final blur - which is extended perversely longer than it should remain on the screen. Apparently, the filmmakers knew they had done a bad thing and wanted to make the least of it.
