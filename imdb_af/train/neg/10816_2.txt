Oh, just what I needed, another movie about the 19th century England. It's almost like ordinary England, just no one's vandalizing soccer stadium. In this picturesque setting of gentlemen, ladies and other randomly chosen titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg deliberately walks around like Jane Eyre. From that novel no one ever read willingly. Jane usually hangs out. in mr. Rochester's manger, where she tries to teach a French girl to look at a blank chalkboard all the time. One day Mr. Roochester (William Hurt on the car pilot) back in love with Jane and everything it does, but there is still the case of his fruit cake wife locked on the attic. Oops, it wasn't in the brochure. After some people have been weighed and some have spread carefully (they probably hired the set), the movie finally comes to an end. Everything really looks authentic, it's something I think. But again, no.
