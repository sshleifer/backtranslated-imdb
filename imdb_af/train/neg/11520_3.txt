I didn't enjoy this movie at all. Because I only found it rough and vulgar, without reason. I also felt it was misogynistic (against women.) The movie didn't really look like anything, and I didn't find any of the characters. There seems to be no point. Although I miss something, but for me this movie is quite a waste of time when I could have done something more productive and enjoyable. I used my face as a pen cushion. James Garner is in this thing, such as C. Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell. Everything was wasted here, and I'm sure it was a low point in each of their respective careers. Jennilee Harrison (of the later years of Three's Company) is also in the movie, and it's nice to see her in a non-German role. But otherwise she can 'I rise above the mediocre script. For me, Tank is a 3/10
