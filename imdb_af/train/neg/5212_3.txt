I had this movie on my shelf in a Mill Creek collection for a while, and one night I just decided to watch it; although not expecting much. As the beginning credits roll around, I'm surprised to discover that this film was made under the Filmirage company. Filmirage brought the world as amazing stinkers as Troll 2, Ator the Invincible and Quest for the Mighty Sword, so I was obliged to watch. <br /> <br /> If the movie started, it could be pretty decent, though it was original. The gore screens could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent. But after a while in the movie, the pace began to drag and I thought to myself, "Well, somebody better murdered soon" or "Someone better mutate". However, at the start of this suit, when I had these thoughts, although someone might have been killed or mutated, it was not as good as shown. What made the matter worse was that the scene transitions were confusing; example: first dr. Houseman will be at the zoo, then he will have a flash back to kill someone, eventually he woke up in a cold sweat in bed - so the audience asked, "Was he the dream he was with the zoo? ". Like the movie's pace, these scene transitions are getting worse. <br /> <br /> I can try to say the character development of dr. Houseman was pretty good, but by the end of the movie, I saw how the doctor metamorphosed, hopefully you'll laugh - which is really the only reason to see this movie at least once; The movie of the um, thing that Doctor Houseman becomes, can also be seen in Joe D 'Amato's "Quest for the Mighty Sword" made. in the same year. You love Filmirage movies, they always use the same stuff!
