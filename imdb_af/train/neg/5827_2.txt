Don't get the impression of other reviewers that this movie doesn't stink because it's ambivalent about the Japanese whale industry (which is morally not worse than the American flesh or the Scottish haggis cull), it stinks because it's pretentious, the kind of its own - back-guff that gets modern art a bad name. It is said that there are wonderful images, but there are great images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so it is no reason to see this nonsense. What happens in the movie happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that looks like a cat gut, and then, just when you think it's done, it starts again. I saw it in a porn theater in Rome that was rented for the weekend to show Barney's film works. It's a pleasant and clever way to find back what was previously a local flight of dirty old men in Macs. brigade, but if the new-fashioned and slightly older bearded Bjork fans were honest, everyone would have had much more fun if they showed just one of the porn!
