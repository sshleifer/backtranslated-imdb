It's a movie that has been alive. on the year of its release, legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I heard nothing but bad things, especially a plot that was criticized for being too complicated. <br /> <br /> To be honest The plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word "plot" is used, because as far as I can see there is no plot as such. There is something Russian gangsters include, a character called Pete Thompson who tries to conceive his wife Sarah, and called an Irish block Sean. How they all fit into something called a "plot" is not certain. It is difficult to explain the plots of Guy Ritchie movies, but if you watch any of his films, it is certain that we can all agree that they all own one, no matter how complicated they may be when first viewed no. Similarly, a James Bond movie though the plots are stretched out with action scenes. You will have a serious problem believing that RANCID ALUMINUM contains any kind of central plot that can be explained with caution. <br /> <br /> Looking at the castel list, you will call enough warning bells on what kind of movie you will be watching. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made over the past 15 years and she does nothing to contradict. Steven Berkoff gives a bad name (and he plays a character called Kant that makes up the white of this movie) while one of the supporting characters is probably played by a TV presenter, because no serious actress will die in this < br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's completely forgotten. I saw it a few days ago and immediately after I looked, I wrote a very long critical review warning people what they were seeing themselves by, but now I mainly forgot why. But it does not change the fact that I remember very much denying this piece of the accident
