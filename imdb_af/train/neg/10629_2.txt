The only reason I didn't record it is that Sibrel shows that he is the technical aspect of making a movie. It's a technically sophisticated film. <br /> <br /> It is said, it's a movie based on lies and distortions that are fairly easily condemned. Most of the documentaries are spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program, rather than the real fact. And Sibrel's "irrefutable proof" that the landings are forged is easily refuted if you know something of the orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it, but if you do, see it for free at google video. Don't make Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity.
