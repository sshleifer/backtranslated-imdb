Justin goes home to stay with his strict, stubborn police detective dad, but Dad seems to have the top floor in three makeshift apartments, each with bizarre tenants living in it. Direct idealist Justin is drinking in the world of occult, murder, elderly, and other turbulent things. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, did I see the same movie that almost all the other reviewers saw here? Smart, compelling, original, intense, smart, genius ???? !!? I saw nothing of those things. What I saw was an uninteresting, bare, thin, extremely clicked low-budget thriller that was full of unpredictability and no tension, as the killer is being sold into the movie as soon as he gives his monologue / debate / discussion . And where are these humorous laugh-out-loud moments? I've never had so much time, maybe because I was too busy struggling to sleep through the movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Audio commentary with director Dave Campfield; Second comment with various contributors as well as isolated music paths; 4 featurettes (Make, on the set, turn 1 room in 4, & Inside the black circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Desiree Gould, & Raine Brown; Alternative scenes; bloopers; a music video for 'addiction'; A trailer for this movie; And trailers for "Shock-o-rama", "Chainsaw Sally", "Skin Crawl", "Sinful", "Bacterium", "Creature from the Hillbilly Lagoon" and "Millennium Crises"
