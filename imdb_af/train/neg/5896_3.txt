A missed call, another Asian-based horror phone. I recently rented a Korean horror movie based on a phone called "Pon". One missed call was just as boring as that one. Maybe phones are just not scary or something, but this move was dull and dead. No tension or excitement for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and rude. The movie was dragged into many parts and felt too long. Didn't keep my attention. Telephones seem to be difficult to make frightening, it's like trying to make a pop-up vending machine honest. And it is ridiculous to compare it with "The Ring", it looks like every Asian horror movie is being compared and so far I haven't seen any measure. To take horror directors - take the phone off as a horror device.
