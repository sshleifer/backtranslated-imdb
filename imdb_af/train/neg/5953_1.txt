How did this piece of shit stay on TV for so long? It's terrible. That makes me want to shoot. It's so false that it's actually worse than a 1940s sci-fi movie. I'd rather have a stroke than to see this nonsense. I remember remembering it when it first came out. I thought, it might be interesting, then I found out how absolute, insane, ridiculous, it was. It was so bad that I actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table. <br /> <br /> Please people, stop watching it and all the other reality programs, they are the rubbish busting the networks and the cancellation of quality programming that requires some thought to create.
