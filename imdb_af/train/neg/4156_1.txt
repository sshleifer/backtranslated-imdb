Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it doesn't enjoy any benefit whatsoever from its own title! In the ENTIRE film, zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice. In addition, we are never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One can argue that they have tried to "put it down" or "make it realistic", but it just ends up boring. More than half of this movie takes place in a car. The screens that are nowhere else are not much to boast about. There is also no clear antagonist, and finally you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> But I would say that for a movie this low production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly suitable and instrumented (with either an original score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /> <br /> I'm all for independent movies, but it doesn't seem to be a mass audience (if any) intended. <br /> <br /> "worse than scarecrow."
