I can't believe I've actually been through the whole thing. This movie is the worst thing that happened since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here's a brief outline of the plot: The movie starts with Jojo and the other chick sitting on the beach and "hungry" over a skinny blond-haired beach that looks like he's not a day in his life at the gym. Somehow everyone knows him, and every chick in the movie wants him. UH OH! Here is the competition! The stereotypical hot chick and her best friends, driving an ugly pink car. Jojo's mother soon came to work in Australia, which meant that Jojo would have to move and leave her best friend (oh no, I think I'm going to cry). A big storm comes and fills their pool with nasty water. Somehow, for the apparent reason, the little one falls in the pool and comes face to face with, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This is where the "story" really takes off. Basically, they want the mermaid to fall in love with the "hunger". <br /> <br /> It's a preteen movie with observational sightings. This late 80's looks like the highlight of Oscar-worthy performances. This movie has all the clicks possible ... the best friends, the "hunk" everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and her bitchy friends, the scary old man ... you call it, it's there. I took one for many by looking at it. Consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice for you. Please, see this movie. Don't do that, I suffered in vain.
