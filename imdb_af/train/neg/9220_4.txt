When the movie started the first 4 minutes, it looked like a travel report from California. I wondered if I had mixed the tapes. Then I blow a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. It is noticed by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about his behavior, so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I can do without the beast, the robot role play or the incest. There is one good sex scene, between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
