The third installment of the "Carnosaur" trilogy has a lot of Keystone Kops quality military commandos that kill two Velociraptors and a T-Rex. I give it a 4 out of pure sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs. The movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really can't be taken seriously. More importantly, when I watch this movie, I can't help but notice some interesting parallels between the "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogies. The first installment in both franchises is a dark, disturbing movie that has become a cult classic, the second is an "Alien" ripoff, and the third is a tongue-in-the-cheek, almost lapstick (or intentionally or not you roll on the floor and laugh. Also, like the "Xtro" franchise, all the Carnosaur movies are completely unrelated to each other. They only carry the franchise name to enter interest in the "persecutors", I think. It is clear that "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" here have two different production groups at work, but if you already have three movies from both franchises seen, you find yourself between the two back and forth.
