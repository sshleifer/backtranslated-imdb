I bought this movie at my local movie gallery last weekend. It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one so I picked this one. Horrible mistake. Read the box as if it were a very good movie. Well, it's starting to be this big movie. For about 5 minutes, that is. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who is killed to save her beau, Jack, from a bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a farmer who is afraid of the townspeople. He assumes that Jack Laila killed because she was suspected of being afraid of this bull, and went on this hunt to get him. It was the first 5 minutes good. What follows is only getting worse 100 times. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to travel on some sort of acid or be something because nothing else made sense so much. Jack is up and running and find this travel radio DJ named Mary who gives him a ride. I think Maria is supposed to be a virgin Mary character. You know, Jesus' mother. But, who knows, I can't make heads or tails. As they run, we get bad guys, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc. ... And all these things are done so that your brain hurts trying to figure out what's going on. Needless to say, I took the movie back and exchanged it for something else. It's terrible, I'm telling you, horrible. And there is absolutely no battle in this movie. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. Hope I helped keep other people from wasting their time on this movie.
