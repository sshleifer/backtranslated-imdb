In 1993, the visitors were a huge hit in France. So, the order was inevitable and this sequence is unfortunately among the worst ever made. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that doesn't keep its promises. Indeed, it's supposed to tell a only story. Jean Reno must go into the twentieth century and Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages, so that time can usually follow his course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and so makes him back in the Middle Ages, is quite difficult. Instead, the movie goes on several other stories without following the lead plot. As a result, the movie sometimes becomes windy, sometimes a bit of a mess. <br /> <br /> But the movie also suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap they can avoid in the first movie: they get over and get annoying. Why did Jean-Marie Poire use the movie maker Muriel Robin in the female lead? He made a mistake because she looked uncomfortable and absolutely sad. The other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel is non-existent and Christian Bujeau, unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie contains some good moments with effective gags, but it often falls into vulgarity and simplicity. Certain sequences and dialogues are affected. It also looks hollow because Poir√© takes back elements that ensured the success of the first film. So, a young girl takes Reno to a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding. <br /> <br /> A labor and disappointing follow-up. Anyway, what else is the interest of this movie commercially? <br /> <br />
