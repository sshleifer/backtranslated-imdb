The incredible meltman plays like an elaborate episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nudity. I know this movie is a bit nice, but I found it impossible to dislike it. <br /> <br /> The acting and script are not the best. But the bonds are good for a $ 50 budget with a $ 50 budget - the title character takes quite a while to actually melt, but when it does, it's pretty impressive; We also have an ingenious image of death that includes electrocution. Also from the note is the music, it is insane - a cheese-tasty medley of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Famous Highlights: <br /> <br /> * Be amazed by the slow nurse who jumps through a panel of glass for absolutely no reason whatsoever. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised about a day in the life of a cut head. <br /> <br /> Beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoids. Called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised when our hero takes a break to hunt the melting chick to get a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This movie is just for 70's for me to hate it. It's tough and trashy, but I thought it was fun. You can do much worse.
