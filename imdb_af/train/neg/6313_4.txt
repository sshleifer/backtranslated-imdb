Well, it's not often that in the United Kingdom we made a film about the inner life from the point of view of the Afro-Caribbean community. The last example I can remember was the subordinate Babylonian road back in 1980. So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a film that was named the British version of La Haine! Well La Haine is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film a genius that has been missed in other British films, but my concern is that this movie is predictably struggling. <br /> <br /> The film intelligently deals with the growing problem of black on black violence that unfortunately occurs in London, but I'm worried that filmmakers are now using similar works compared to characters that are equally harmful. Saul Dibb had a wonderful opportunity to make a film that would be entertaining and inspiring to us all, but unfortunately missed and created a movie that only strengthens the idea that a young black man in London is the only future violence and tragedy
