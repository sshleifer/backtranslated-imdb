Mix exotic tropical places, babes in skimpy clothes, explosions, beautiful Dudley Do-Right clones, a movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), some martial arts and a sexy villain (Tracy Lor .... , sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you will think you'll be some fun-loving. Not so! It is a brave TV movie and although it would like to promote it as a Charlie's Angels deal, it is nowhere as good as the original series or even the gawdawful, irreparable stupid, recent C.A. movies. This horror is best described as a Third Prize by Andy Sidaris. Nowhere near as much fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket to Hawaii", although some of the fighting scenes are decent enough. The girls are spending too much time on appointing and trying to look, and it becomes irritating after a while. There are better genre things out there. Oh, and the "babes" aren't as hot as they like to think they are. Terrible soundtrack ... when it's there.
