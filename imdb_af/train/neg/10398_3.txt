There is nothing wrong with a popcorn film to keep you from the streets. It's just that some are better than others. It's very poor. The acting is terrible, the writing is bad; and overestimating the special effects. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat its audience with so little contempt? And why did they make a successor?
