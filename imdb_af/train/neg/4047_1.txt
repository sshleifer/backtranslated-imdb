***** WARNING, MAY BE INCLUDED IN THIS SPOILERS. THIS THIS TRIP. **** <br /> Here is some good advice for anyone living in the UK. When Channel 5 has a comedy of the old 80's, late at night, read a book instead. I'm currently recovering from a seizure because of some of the comments on this movie here. I'm actually shocked by the fact that someone actually said this movie was realistic! All I can say is thank God, the Cold War never escalated, otherwise we could have given the commission's boundaries. I found this film in the extreme pretext, maybe it's just my British perception of what makes a movie funny. , who knows? But in all respects this movie is not only terrible, its teeth are frightening. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan of Bill Murray, and his rubbish like this that justifies my feelings towards him. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ghostbuster's, which was only made three years after this movie. But it really summarizes Bill Murray. I can safely say that I didn't waste my time so blatantly as the first operation Delta Force is over here, although these two films are more in common than you might think. For one thing, they both have terrible action ranges from start to finish, and 2nd. They are both confused with Clich√©'s cheesy. <br /> <br /> Here's one thing, these guys have to be in the US Army. Yet they are allowed to turn their camp, Willy Nilly, to seduce female military police officers, and then fool them into the Generals Quarters. Talk about Random! This movie is just terrible, because I'm scared. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a feminist sympathizer, but the fact that these two women actually fall over heels falls in love with the two characters shortly after being arrested, let them go free ... Two Once it is just offensive. to the female race. The fact that a tatty haired, fat lips bum (Winger) and his fearless sidekick Ramis can just as well speak in the MP's underwear that they fell in love with, is nothing short of ridiculous. <Br /> <br /> Then there are the exercise scenes where you meet the group "Phycho" who unknowingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or her well, followed by the overweight blocks (played by the late and big John Candy, who claims he joined the army to prevent him from paying $ 400 for riot management classes. Leading to loud mouth Murray paid tribute to the "Giant Toe" (WTF?) "Drill Seargent" who honestly couldn't organize a pi $$ in a brewery, let alone his band of recruits. All this scene doing is to fight many battle scenes, with people saying "way to go hole hole!" all the time, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> The screens then continue displaying the grinder that makes themselves on the assault course. This leads to a scene where one of them somehow jumps into the air Passing birds with an assault rifle, a watchtower with dots. (Likewise, Yep told you this movie is random ... He also miraculously goes undisciplined ...) Ultimately, lead the passing parade, where the unlucky team turns a magic within two hours. (Bugger me, Miracle!) Thanks to some wise words from Murray, then they set up a massive military dance routine before a Geriatric 'General' in front of the rest of the groups. All this to the great pleasure of their two girlfriends in the gallery, who had to really arrest them ... Everyone has already laughed. However, this bit is nothing but wonderful. He then chooses them to guard a new motor vehicle in Italy in a new Million Dollar Prototype Vehicle. It just seems to be a mobile home that has been painted green with numerous gadgets on the inside. It claims: "This is exactly what this army needs!" right ... <br /> <br /> Then there's the dire final, where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this top secret prototype Military Vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany. Then the Hapless Captain (John Larroquette) finds out and leads the group of fresh recruits on a recycling mission for this vehicle. Then they take a wrong turn and land in Soviet-Czechoslovakia, where they are caught. (As we have not seen the coming ...) So start a rescue effort by Ramis and Murray + Birds in hand, where is a big battle, lots of hips and bladder shoots. With them come back as National Heroes, humiliating the Russians by their "pussies", etc. Etc. To name a few. The end. That's right. No courts Martial, nothing. They just stole a prototype military vehicle, drove it into a Warsaw Pactland, and almost caused an international incident that could lead to WW3! <br /> <br /> This movie is honestly more fun to be diagnosed with a terminal illness. . I know it's meant to be a comedy, it has all the right actors for it, but where in hell is it? Can Channel 5 cut out the pieces? The only redeeming feature in this movie is the repetitive use of naked women who use showers and female mud. (as I said, randomly) Not that it distracts from the fact that it is of course a very crap film. This film should be realistically aimed at immature 9-year-olds, unfortunately we should rather look at it. 1 star out of 10 - Total Tripe. My advice, do something a little more useful with your time. Like you ...
