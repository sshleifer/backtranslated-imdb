It's hard to believe that an "action-packed" Jet Li movie can be so boring, but it was transcendant waste. The plot is a merger of other Hong Kong chopsocky movie. The martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent. <br /> <br /> It's a comic book story about a group of superhuman soldiers who have to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of them (Li) who owns an incompetent army to save and rebuild a life as a pacifist librarian. The rescued murderers are revived with a quality chart from Austin Powers to take over the world, and Li sheds his new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was mentioned, and it could be the stock of the wafer-thin plot and comic book 25 cents special effects. But I suspect that even the 8-year-olds who had Ninja Turtle eighteen found this app and hollow.
