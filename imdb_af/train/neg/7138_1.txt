Acting is terrible. This film makes Fast and Furious look like an academically-acclaimed film. They throw a few boobs and kicks in to interest you, despite the EXTREMELY poor and far-fetched story. There is a reason why people on the internet don't even download this movie. This movie sank like an iron tower. Don't waste your time or even download. This movie is and will always be a PERMA-TURD. I'm now stupid because I watched it. In fact, this title should be referred to as a "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Calling it a movie is a travesty and insult. horrible, horrible, horrible, terrible, beastly, cruel, despicable, unpleasant, disgusting, terrible, frightening, terrible, fairy, terrible, terrible, terrible, grim, eager, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, mean, horrible, terrible, furious, mean, horrible, horrible, furious, mean, disgusting offensive, offensive, repulsive, repulsive, rebellious, scandalous, scary, shameful, shocking, sicky, terrible, frightening, wicked, unholy, unkind
