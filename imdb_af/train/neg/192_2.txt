The only good part about this movie is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister had to retire from the pulpit when his son Paul came down from the teachings he had preached. How many times can his sons use the Lord's Name in vain in this movie from a Presbyterian background? It doesn't fit. I wished Paul, without a boat, had pulled down the river from the beginning to save Paul's stupid, blatant, selfish story (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsorist who wants to save Norm, but not so. It is very uninteresting. We see that the biased whites rose by Paul because of his American American girl. It was the only part that had a little interest and could perhaps have developed into a true 'wild west'. What we just see is a sleepy village where the two clergy 's sons have nothing to do, but 1. Norm drives a lame friend and deals with her family and 2.Paul makes stupid stories at the newspaper shop while he is head tight and take lots of swings and bind many flies. I'd rather watch a show about the fishing of that movie, which will never be.
