The ALARMIST was so abysmally written that you think of yourself, why an emerging actor like David Arquette agreed to be on earth. It must be one of the worst plots I've ever seen and without any humor, it borders on the edge of boring. It bumps into a terrible conclusion that apparently just happens because the director got bored and just wanted to turn around to go home for his dinner. Stay away !.
