My mom worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention an office shared with him. When it was announced, he was BTK, she was shocked. All day she had just told her stories about how she had never seen him as the Wichita Killer. I heard she had told them many times. I asked her about many things, and went to all the interviews she was asked to check. I read the whole book written about Raider, Wichita is my home town and I was amazed that something could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> There was not yet another BTK movie on TV, and I thought it would have been better to portray Dennis's murders. Perhaps he has even intelligent touches on his motives. <br /> <br /> I'm going to be very dumb with the mistakes in this movie. It is based on my mother's portrayal of him, all my readings on him and the video tapes I saw from him. <br /> <br /> First, the camera angles were terrible. It looked like it was shot on a home video camera. The acting was terrible and I couldn't even see it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and was a "follow the rule book" kind of man. He wasn't as nice as the movie made him look, he was very polite and suddenly. The same goes for his murder, as far as we all know. If you saw his confession in court, you can guess it. <br /> <br /> And for the obsession with the butchery? No. I never read or did Dennis Raider confess that he had a problem with animal cruelty or people who had bugs. In fact, he trained on cats and dogs for choking methods. Still, he put the whole movie through the whole movie. He placed animals in the faces of his face and acted as if he cared for their welfare. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never killed the people he knew, he admitted it, but in the film in his first murder he tells the woman he knows. <br /> <br /> I really don't even want to go to this movie, and I'm already jerking. It is NOT what you want to see if you are interested in the actual events of BTK. It is NOT what you want to see if you want a good horror movie. If you want a bad half-hearted, with a few punches, serve the side, then it's your kind of movie.
