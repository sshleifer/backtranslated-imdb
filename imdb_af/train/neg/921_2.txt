I hired this one to see Vanesa Talor again. She can act but doesn't get a chance in this clunker. The opening sequence is an extensive crane of mountain landscapes. Must come from a stock archive because the movie is shot directly to videotape. The production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There is a lot of casey animated statue, but no other effects that are noticeable. This movie is bad but not amusing. The players will do well to not mention it.
