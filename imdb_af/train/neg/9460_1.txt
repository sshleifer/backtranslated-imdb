This movie made me upset! If I think of cat in the hat. I think of cat in the hat books. You know, one of a few years back, parents are reading to their children. Well, obviously, this movie will be so much! But many to my surprise were nothing like the books! Insted it is more like a young adult humor film. In one part, a cat talks to a gardening tool (how) cat talks about being his hoof. The name of his car, I was a little unpleasant for a children's movie. under the rating you will find: soft cude humor and some double entenders. I think briefly it means adult humor. I wish I could return this movie! Wal-Mart said they would not because the movie was opened. If you are considering buying it, I suggest you rent before buying.
