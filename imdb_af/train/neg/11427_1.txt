I don't know who the director of this movie is, Sue Kramer, but I have a strong suspicion that A) is his lesbian and B) she has somehow violated anyone involved in this project to participate in proving that they are not homophobic. br /> <br /> I imagine everyone thinks, "My God, it's awful. Not funny. Pedestrian. But their mouths are closed off with fear, they will be labeled anti-gay or they will not get the gay lifestyle. (That's probably why Kramer does NOT throw gay people playing gay people.) Anyway, it's not even worth reviewing. The actors are all set to play every scene all over the top, so there is no sincerity or credibility in anything they do. It's full of clich√©s and there's nothing about this movie that is the least amusing - much less funny. <br /> <br /> I hate it and I'm not afraid to say it. The bad people who gave Kramer the money to make this bomb were not so unfair in their judgment.
