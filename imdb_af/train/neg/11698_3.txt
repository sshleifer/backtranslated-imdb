This move reminded me of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. It has the same kind of idea that people get what they deserve. I think it's always in a Crypt story. The same goes for the bad acting. Very bad acting. I enjoyed the movie because I knew most people didn't like it and I didn't expect much. When I watch a Stephen King movie, I don't expect much, because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were good books. I like how Carrie played, as it was a real story and the whole book is a lot of reports and theories and so on. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels were nothing like the movies. The ends were very different from the movie versions. I accept from the two novels that all his novels have changed and the ends are always cheesy. I'm ending in Thinner's worst. So Cheesy. I want to read the book to find the right end. I suggest anyone who is planning to read Stephen King's novels to see his movies beforehand so you can compare. And so you will be very pleased with the book. I intend to do this with all his novels made in movies. I'm sure if they were made in movies, it was really good books ... and the script went awfully wrong.
