Terrible movie with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here he becomes involved with a dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Soon Rome will be hired to find out what happened to a woman. Of course this is the woman under the sea. Her roommate, Lainie Kazan, soon died on the floor. <br /> <br /> An aging Richard Conte plays a police officer and friend of Rome. When a local club owner is killed, the blame falls on Rome and becomes an interesting chase. That's how bad this picture is if you have to rely on a chase scene to deliver the action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch plays the beauty to her neck in intrigue. Her acting is a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, you don't know why the girl was murdered. Don't bother first.
