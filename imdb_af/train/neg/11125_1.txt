Hey look, handle it, there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black America than this. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor performance of the story I mentioned. <br /> <br /> It was created in the mid-80's and is horrible in the music / counting department. It's funny to see Oprah as a late-night crack whore. <br /> <br /> The scene where Bigger goes to Elizabeth McGovern in the incinerator. Pure classic theater. First, I don't care how drunk you are, you will respond to 1200F grade flame (no matter how bad your acting is). But they really milked that scene ... it was comical. I'll tell you already, I've had great satisfaction burning Elizabeth McGovern in a faux death; she irritated me.
