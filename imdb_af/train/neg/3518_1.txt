I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the whole thing so ridiculous that it was a pity. (For one, as Stallone himself climbs out, it is not necessary to carry any gear, but I think those carabiners hanging like that look like "mountain climbing", so let's throw them). For the lobotomized people who think that Colorado looks like anything like the Dolomites in Italy (where the film is filmed), the Hollywood maggots have a lot more ridiculous and dirty smelling things for you to swallow.
