Raymond Burr stars as a lawyer trapped in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his love for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). It was a full year before he started doing Perry Mason. The movie may be of particular interest to its fans if it were the inspiration for its decisions. <br /> <br /> There isn't much else here, though. Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one-dimensional and the motives for her crime in the riddle are quite obvious. There is an interesting show by Lamont Johnson as a painter who is also in love with the "femme fatale", but the Burr character is pretty simple. It's frightening to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his steady delivery doesn't really match his character, as in most movies I've seen him. There is no mystery at all, and the whole tension is supposed to be the title of the film and the way Burr's character sets the Lansbury character to engage herself. (Double danger hinders her from being the original murder again, presumably). He does this with a very large tape recorder that she doesn't see when she gets into the room I think. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could be done for TV.
