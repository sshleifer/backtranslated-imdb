over and above the fact that there are crazy people and there are religious nuts out there. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, the characters don't make sense. <br /> <br /> The movie has no rights, middle or end, and nothing has ever been explained. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a young man, with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, apparently returning from a stint in the army. <br /> <br /> He takes a trip to a two-story house that is in extreme disrepair, windows left over. He goes home, walks around and finally writes a note he leaves there. This scene comes to nothing and we learn nothing further about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It's never exactly explained who's home or where people went, but we get the impression. Hazel probably lived there at once. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to a city. Why - we don't know. As soon as he arrives in this city, he writes down a name and address he sees on a bathroom wall, and goes to this woman, who is a surprisingly thick hooker. He sees her for a while and then he no longer sees her. Like everything else in this movie, it comes to nothing and serves no purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch tries to befriend him, but Hazel isn't really interested, though they still cross roads. br /> <br /> Enoch is about as crazy as you can get. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzee is and talk to them abusively. <br /> <br /> We never really know why Enoch behaves like he does, or why Hazel behaves like he did, past Hazel's overdose of old, scary, fundamentalist religion through his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Later, Enoch is worried about a man dressed in a gorilla suit and manages to get the gorilla. unpack and walk around. <br /> <br /> Slightly wounded and apparently in constant anger, Hazel does a little street preaching. I have the impression that he is freeing himself from the untruths of the religion drilled in him. <br /> <br /> He has several meetings with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions never really matter, and there is no plot line. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Hazel picks up to complete religious zeal and begins to self-harm. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange movie. Interesting in this is strange, but otherwise it is absolutely nothing to go for it. <br /> <br /> The film does a great job, but this film doesn't leave a stance or storyline. <Br /> <br /> The movie also has the characters wandering around the N word from time to time, without any connection to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
