If 1977's "Exorcist II: The Heretic" did not favor him, it is hard to imagine what the extraordinary Richard Burton saw in this fatigue exercise in non-excitement. You've seen it before: Burton plays an author who discovered at an early age, he has the power to move ominous objects through his mind (and you thought "Carrie" had no influence on Hollywood not!). Although adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" plays like recycled goods, although the special effects in the cathedral are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the supportive cast is very poor. Burton is hammy but tired ... not even telekinesis can save him at this point. * 1/2 of ****
