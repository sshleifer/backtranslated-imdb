my friends and i saw this movie a week ago and i feel it absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least those who read it) that this movie is not just the top five worst movies i ever seen didn't, but actually had the honor of being the number one. I've seen quite a few movies, but nobody beats this one to be stupid. you can say I watched it look ... my only excuse is that we waited a few hours and couldn't go anywhere without freezing our buttocks. I do not recommend it to anyone. I first thought we'd watched some very bad porn movies, but it found out after 10 minutes. That is not the case. It's not a comedy, it's not drama, it's not action, it's not horror, it's just awful!
