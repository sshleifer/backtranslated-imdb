I just gave it. I don't want to waste too much time on this, because most posters put it better than I ever could, but I wanted to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I didn't know which was nicer: Redgrave chases little moths and pulls over her nurse; She had a dream that her "precious" son (who she and the gentleman decided to be a drunk loser) became in the road box. that deaf-deaf Ann shocked Peggy Lee; or the awful CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie looks at her younger self! <br /> <br /> I never bought Danes as the younger Redgrave. Nor did I buy Richardson and Collette as sisters. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, she gets better Mama to give her some lessons! I have no idea why a girl (or buddy) would make them foolish about vapid stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are as shiny and ungrateful as she is, Luc is a delayed slacker on crack, and I haven't given up on any of them! That night, Chick Flicks gives a bad name!
