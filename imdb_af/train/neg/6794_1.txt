Friday the 13th step over! There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there. I won this movie in a college game, and it was a waste of money, even if it was free. Jack Jones stars as a really terrible singer trying to find some killers or something. At least Friday, the thirteenth never bore me. I'd rather pull my fingernails than see it again.
