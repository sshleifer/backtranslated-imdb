Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a great game depicting many different brothers and sisters, but only Winningham can play a convincing or material role. Leigh, bar band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, leans constantly on parenting Georgia, a well-known folk song in the Joni Mitchell form. Perhaps because of her dual duties as a co-producer on the film, Leigh seems to keep herself in a corner: she is not credible as a singer, and even if intentional, she gives too much screen time to the microphone . Probably he hopes for a tour-the-force, Leigh is pulled and nervous and caught; But we simply don't see any talent in this character (of course, Leigh is a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that turn us away). If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might buy in the concept that she gets the (small) breaks she does. As it is, the likelihood of ever getting up on the stage is slim. Director Ulu Grosbard crafted some intense dramatic sequences, and editing at the final puts Sadie's bar performance with Georgia's chosen arena performance - both singing the same song - and it's a sad nuanced moment ... but really, what is the show? * 1/2 of ****
