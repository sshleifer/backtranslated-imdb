I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker's Adrian Zmed couldn't save this successor. I went through half of the movie and thought it was a spoof of the original. Then that wild and crazy motorcycle scene came (note that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch regulates); and unfortunately I realized they were trying to be serious. I got a kick from the fact that the opposing gang, after losing their "wheels" because of their gambling habits in the original Smear, was forced to use motorcycles in the second movie. I got hurt by the putz character Carrington, but I would hate to see what they would later retreat: Mopeds? <br /> <br /> I've never bought the chopped theme: Hunky-Australian-Boy-Can't- Fit-In-Out-dominated-school-ergo-go-for-to-guy-with- stupid biker helmet-looking. It was Disney's story that went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems you can ruin a good thing by putting a bubble gum putting Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical slap. The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of ​​how many points out of ten to give it.
