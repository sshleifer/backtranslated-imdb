Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerners. He was a good actor, from here to eternity, and the man with the golden arm proves it, but he didn't have the body of a western hero, you identified him as an urban man. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho. The fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) The story was too unusual, especially in the sense that Sinatra behaved more like a villain than a hero in the movie. In a genre where people were kind of expecting a certain pattern, to break away from it, the movie must be very good. b) The story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole village will allow Sinatra to do something he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. Even when a man shows him a special holster opening sideways, he should not pull the gun, you wonder if it makes him invincible, why didn't all gunmen accept it? I think this movie should not be retracted, because any movie with Sinatra is worth seeing, and despite its shortcomings it is still nice
