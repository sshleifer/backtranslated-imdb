Imagine the worst sketches of Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90 minute movie. Now imagine that all the humor in those bad sketches is removed and replaced with stupidity. Imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Do you have it? <br /> <br /> Now, look at The Underground Comedy Movie. The vision you just had looked like the funniest thing ever. UCM is the only worst movie I've ever seen. There were a few cheap laughs ... very few. But it was lame. Even if the intention of the movie lame was, it was too cumbersome to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not angry at wasting my time watching it is someone I know bought. He wasted his money. Vince Offer wrote or directed nothing else, and that's no surprise why.
