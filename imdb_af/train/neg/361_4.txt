After reading the book, I loved the story. Watch the movie. I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It is understandable that books and movies differ, but these were two different stories, only the names and some of the book's story remained. Read the book and you'll understand the movie better. The book gives you a better development of the characters. These characters are very interesting and care for them. The places were indeed in line with the book's descriptions. Some characters are not included. Television has brought so many fantastic books and stories to the microphone, this is a perfect example of this. Author input does not always ensure a good movie, but it can sometimes help.
