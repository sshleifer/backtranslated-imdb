If you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, don't go on the series. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May this year, and I'm almost done with book 10. I dare say the movie is a piece of garbage that doesn't even make the series a sniff of justice. While "Left behind: the movie" just follows the story of the "Left Behind" (the book), the characters are not even close to accurate. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford never acts on his feelings for Hattie (he is about to know when he was informed of the finishes); Buck Williams is a blonde haired magazine writer, not a TV reporter; Chloe is at Stanford, and much of the book details Rayford wonders if she has 'survived'; Buck and Chloe did not meet much later, at a meeting in New York, compiled by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never in the book, rather in Rayford's retrospective thoughts; the roads were so jammed with wreckage following the rapture that Rayford and Hattie had to have a helicopter back to the suburbs ... etc, etc. ... <br /> <br /> And that's just the first movie; they will release the third. Please, even if you don't like the movies, give the book a chance.
