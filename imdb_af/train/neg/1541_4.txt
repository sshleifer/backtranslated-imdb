I thought this movie a lot and left behind at the scene where the loyalist gang was shot by the British. The film effectively blames the people of NI as the cause of their own problems. It suggests that the 25-year-old war was a matter of intolerance and nothing to do with Britain's partition of Ireland and domination of its history, ie NI was created by Britain in 1921, regardless of the wishes of the rest of Ireland . <br /> <br /> The characters are portrayed as careless fools, although I despise loyalist paramilitaries, they fought for a cause. They retained their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a well-known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to preserve Catholics and to demoralize republicanism. Nineties' values ​​about 'machismo', masculinity, etc. Converted in the 1970s. Belfast is portrayed as part of the so-called unique Irish 'psyche' that leads to violence. The silly song of the woman in the club - old Ireland of green fields ..blah..blah .. - is given a symbolic stature, ie poor young fool fights for an impossible cause. Involuntary, historical, cheap and nasty garbage. O'Sullivan made a personal statement about a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
