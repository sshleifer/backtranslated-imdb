I just hired it because I loved the first movie. It calls it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick to let you rent. He is actually executive producer and has nothing to do with making this movie (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) <br /> <br /> A tragic story, horrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter of of all time. It's not even comical bad. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, what we have is a dull, unfinished movie with a terrible script and irrevocably bad and clumsy. It's just a range of low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the Bubonic plague.
