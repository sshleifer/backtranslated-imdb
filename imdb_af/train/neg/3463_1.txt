The other night I saw the movie and I must honestly say it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The play is fair, but the plot is completely ridiculous. A killer is born because of all the "energy used to make the movie" and if the movie is burned, will the killer die? How incredible is that? The characters were underdeveloped to say the least. For example, the man suddenly says, "Aren't you completing the movie because your mother couldn't?" So, we're supposed to go with it? We didn't know it was her daughter halfway through the movie. The film did not put anyone on it. We didn't know anything about the most important people who survived, except that Ringwald's character was a great actress. The man was on the scene when the people died and Raffy wanted to be the director of her mother. . Don't really dive to know who they are. Blessed things are rushing to get to the murders. The whole plot is far too weak for my taste and I was very disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap should of course learn a thing or two about making movies. I can't believe anyone will vote or die on this photo. It's not funny, it wasn't scary and was cliche throughout the movie. I predicted what would happen to each scene, which you believe I was not difficult to do at all. It's a disgrace and I'm very sorry to have wasted an hour and a half looking at the mess. 10/01.
