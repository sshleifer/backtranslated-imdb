I have seen many good Korean movies, including thrillers and darker overtone movies, but this one sucks. The director seems to be a sadistic sister, who got someone to produce some junk. The movie has some kind of entertainment value and is not even a thrill. I can't believe anyone really made such a movie. Although play is OK, the story line is and the feeling it leaves is terrible. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I'm not going to see any movies from this director. No sense for movies, and a big disappointment in the fact that there are moments for the excitement. All of these show screens with psychopath that spill the roles with a bad lap screen and allow more blood and violence to make thinking exciting. Very disappointing movie and I strongly recommend hitting all the movies of this kind.
