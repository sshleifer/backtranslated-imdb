Disappearance is about a couple taking their family on vacation in New Mexico and finding themselves in trouble after taking a detour from the highway to visit a town that apparently was missing for unknown reasons in 1948. The town of Weaver presents us harmlessly and appeals to tourists until the family is stranded overnight and they have good reason to suspect others are having their fatal consequences with fatal outcomes. The Henleys watch a Blair-Witch-Project-esquire video diary left by the town's last victim, which ironically shows the best performance of anybody in this movie. Although Hamlin and Dey's performances are much better than supporting role-players, their emotional effect seems "flat" to me throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Disappearance calls on most of the movies, as there is a lot of tension and good direction. The plot, however, takes unexpected and indisputable turns that seem to make no sense. Worse still, it's really no understanding of what exactly happens in the movie, which makes the bizarre end less tolerant. It was important to me that the filmmakers were so focused on making a stream of exciting scenes, that they threw away all the elements of good story entertainment: plot development, gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a coherent solution / outcome. <br /> <br /> The hardest part of the movie for me was that the first three quarters of it was spent building tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly done away with as if we didn't deserve it ‚Äù an explanation: <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of the Indian symbols on the walls? What happened to the original Weaver people? What was the relationship with the people at dinner? What did the Sheriff know? What did the missing boy discover? <br /> <br /> It was, I believe, a bad move, as it caused anger. I invested quite a bit of brain power to assume certain probable statements for some of this plot turns and strange events. Just to end the filmmakers simply makes it without giving any answer to any of these. It's a couple of beautiful rock hangers for the end of a mini-series that will be recharged next week, but a completely frustrating and inappropriate ending for a single movie.
