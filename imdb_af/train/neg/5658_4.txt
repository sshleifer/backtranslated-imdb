"Laugh, Clown Laugh" released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown called Tito. Tito raised a founder (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to maturity and called her Simonetta. Tito raised the girl in circus life, and she became a full-fledged ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual big show, I couldn't pass the fact that Tito, now well in his middle age, has the dots for the young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he raised her like a daughter. The kind of "ick" factor is permeated throughout the film. Tito competes for Simonetta's love with a young and attractive Count Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls to the young man, but feels guilty as if he is leaving Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole assumption of the movie is ridiculous, and I find it wonderful that no one in the movie Tito tells what a stupid old fool he is (until he reveals it himself). The movie is just remarkable because of Loretta Young, who will have a good career. While worshiping Chaney's brilliance as an actor, this whole movie seems to me and just really stupid.
