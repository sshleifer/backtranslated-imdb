A dumb rich man about 1800, wants to visit a nearby spiritual asylum to see a well-known doctor caring for his patients. In spite of an initial hostile reaction, he is soon kindly invited and given a good doctor's tour. And as the doctor shows him, he speaks and speaks and talks !!! And as he speaks, wages run amok here and there is nothing really productive about. While there and there are a few actions, and it's very disturbing, it's amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is - lack of life and energy, which is strange to a horrible movie. Even a man who thinks he's a chicken and dresses like one is pretty tiring. The further this tour takes the gas, the more disturbing it becomes until finally you realize that the prisoners have taken over the hospital and tortured their guards. However, despite this twist, the film is incredibly lifeless in many places - especially when it is moving very slowly, like a bizarre ceremony or people just wandering about the set. Only when the workers of the asylum were found in a prison cave hungry, the film has any real impact. Considering this plot, it's hard to imagine making it boring, but the people who made this cheap mining movie! Now with the same plot and skillful writing, acting and direction, it could have been an interesting and valuable film. <br /> <br /> You know, now that I think about it, it was the plot of one of the episodes of the original "Star Trek" TV show! You know, one with "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are captured by this crazy man and his mad followers. <br /> <br /> A final note: The movie has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene, so be warned - it's not for kids. In fact, considering how worthless the movie is, it's not for anyone! But with the version included in the "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", the pressure is so incredibly bad that it is difficult to see all these flesh because of the fact that the pressure is so dark.
