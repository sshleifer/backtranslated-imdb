I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure it would have been a good movie if something happened to it. Do nothing. It is short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I scanned the remaining 20-year-old minutes. Ongewenig. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor - who has not yet worked - examining a part he can play as a cash clerk in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing happens. She decides to give him home and they go to an Arby's, a Target, a car wash. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Ever. <br /> <br /> I don't get it. But I also don't get the Bill Murray flashes "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers". If you like those movies, you might like this. Many people find movies like these whimsical, charming or - for reasons that escaped me - fascinating dialogue. A common feature in films of this ilk is to have a long silence / silence after an actor delivers a line that is supposed to be meaningful. We know this is meaningful because it is followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. Sorry, I have to be a philistine. I don't get it. For me, these kind of movies aren't funny or charming or thought-provoking. They're just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. No tension. No laughter. No tension. No action. Nothing to watch. In short, nothing of the things I'm going to the movies for. I can be bored for free. I see strange characters in real life. I go to Target, and fast food restaurants, and car wash. These elements do not make a movie, even if stars have done this. I pay to be entertained. <br /> <br /> If you love Morgan Freeman and just like hearing about nothing about it, enjoy it. If you want to fall over Paz Vega, you can listen to her. But nothing happens, I promise. A total snooze test.
