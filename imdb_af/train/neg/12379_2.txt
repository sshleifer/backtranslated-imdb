With confidence in the positive reviews above, we saw a free view of this last night. Now I know that filmmakers are planning positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could write it. "Determine to become a" classic "cult? The theater is packed, apparently with friends and families of the production team, because only a few of us went out for the first time. <br /> <br /> The songs was the most literal I ever heard in a musical ?? "Don't take the short cut, honey, there's a wolf in the forest." Debi Mazar's eyes sounded furious while struggling to sing. Most of the songs lasted for only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, who's playing the wolf in this story must be charming and seductive, instead we get Joey Fatone, ex N'Syncer , which remains his last name, as he is not well-aged, he is not exactly foolish with his extra 50 pounds and junior high-school make-up and out-of-tune singing. The rest of the actors are semi-sufficient, but can't do much about the spectacular screenplay. You know, it's possible for adults at the same time and writing children ?? see under "Pixar". <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the virtual sets look pretty and well integrated with the actors. And it wasn't as offensive as "Crash".
