After reading the reviews, it became clear that everyone has this work skill. How totally boring. Oh, how about the good oil days and there was nothing like that. Of all the comments, no one expressed any emotion to this work or anybody else. <br /> <br /> I grew up just after the end of the steam age and this film, along with Dan'l Boone, matured on Saturday afternoon. It was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing, yapping, farting, giggling, snot monsters like myself or myself. And it was a movie filler at the time. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that every criticism contains something about the plot. Problem is, it was rather a template. Here we go. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) collects friends and defeats the evil people. Hurray! <br /> <br /> All of our kids found out that plot before we set our quarter to see it. It was just about the plot line of every Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers movie ever made. If you take the time to go back and review every movie, don't just ask for surprises. <br /> <br /> One should remember the context of the times. There was no or little TV. No for children. There was school. There was the great outdoors. There were toy guns. No cyber time. And the steam age just collapsed. But movies like this provided entertainment and filled the imagination of young whippers. Even the girls came in. <br /> <br /> This movie was the entertainment. And it is just as indifferent as something produced today. It was originally a goal to be propaganda. But children quickly became movies. <br /> <br /> Our fathers experienced the right thing. And it won't be until Sam Peckinpah lasts a decade, ultimately following the red splashes of counterfeit blood in realistic and abundant quantities. Not to his legal advice, someone slowly disappeared, with great pain and misery. Until Peckinpah, war and rifle battles were a very bloodless matter. Thanks Sam. <br /> <br /> To see a movie had little or no blood, the adults didn't mind. They wouldn't have patience what I think. No intestines spray the plant's life. So this movie had all the glory and nothing of the gory. Gung Ho was then suitable for children. <br /> <br /> You'll see that I've awarded a four to this rating. Why should I do this? Good. It's a terrible movie. No matter how I love it. I like this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood. But it's not as good of a movie in quality. Basically, Gung Ho has become a romance novel for children. <br /> <br /> Must people see it. Of course. I'm not saying to stay away. Realistically, however. The plot is simple. The characters level? they are shots. You can love a bad movie.
