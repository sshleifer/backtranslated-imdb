I'm soooo glad I didn't spend money going to the theater :-). It's nothing more than compiling elements of some other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc. In a rather dull and meaningless scenario. I really can't figure out what the purpose was to create this movie - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline that is also meaningless. In addition, there is nothing to watch - the FXs look like a second-hand store. You've usually seen it in other movies. But it's definitely a good lullaby.
