I watched it today, partly attracted to the all-star cast and partly because I enjoyed so many other movies of this ilk. However, this is one to avoid. There are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity just doesn't flow, the billiards challenge at the beginning. The fighting tones with the natives are just as good as you would remember in those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you see a spear flying through the air and cutting camera to a dead native that is motionless on the floor, and it likes his thigh. Is that instantaneous death? There are also several fairly unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, as the girl is saved while collecting flowers. The very heavy animated clay toys are too painful to watch. If you see this movie, the crabs moving the thumb forward at about 5kph are the highlight. Somehow, one manages to crawl David McCullum and give him a nip. It is as if there was no time to get out of the way, as when the obelisk in the city was overrun, the indigenous all the time in the world left a 2-step, but he did not shout and it did not fall. I just give it a 2 because of Ekland. And why does Mccullums vote develop a stutter as the film progresses?
