I usually like comedy movies. I really enjoy them. But I really don't get the point of "Envy". I mean, it has a dull content / subject, and it's not really funny. <br /> <br /> Although the play is generally good, it is not enough for the movie to get at least a little interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this movie. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to rent a comedy, I suggest you definitely not go for this one. Unless you want to get bored and I can see I'm not the only one with this opinion, even Jack Black apologized (see Trivia).
