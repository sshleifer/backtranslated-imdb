I thought they should have called this movie "Whites" instead of "Heights". Good-natured ... the kind of movie that makes people hate, New Yorkers. People who are so self-disciplined and think their lives are so important ... give me a break. Such a lily-white cast that Glenn Close was the ethnic character in it, screamed the movie for someone who really came in and stole it. And so they suggest it, a character even whiter than the rest of the throw (I thought he was first an albino) who is supposed to be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher that accent! Intellectually dishonest ... this movie is the kind of movie that so many people can deceive to think it's worth it because it has the ambitious aspects of something more ambitious. Better to fill the theaters with MI5-10 than with this pretentious crap ... must be better played because you can't fall off the floor.
