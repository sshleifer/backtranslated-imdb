Spike Lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help. I watched my watch and often hoped the movie would end or come to the point. Lee's first movie with a white-and-white role is a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? That Italians swear and love funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I would go to a Scorsese movie. The amazing lamb Godfather character just adds to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admired several of Lee's films, especially "Do the Right Thing". This movie is a waste of time.
