... was that I could tell everyone in good conscience how terrible this movie is. I barely got there twenty minutes before I started thinking about myself, "Wow, it's pretty bad." And to be honest, I would have given this movie 1 star if it wasn't for Esai Morales (though he had very little screen time). He is the only role the role plays in the film. It's a pity because I really like Gil Bellows. Or at least I thought I did it. <br /> <br /> As I saw it, I started thinking about his role in "Shawshank Redemption" and realizing it wasn't as good as I thought. Problem: his prison-house / difficult old-fashion seems like it is, an act; his dialogue sounded like he had a very bad impression. Did he ever meet someone who speaks like his character, who was SUPPOS? I doubt it, but maybe he should. <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, they managed to spray a small prison house philosophy and it doesn't look like it, especially if you consider the rhetoric was sprayed by a "rasta" Its accent was so strong that it looked unnatural. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't normally have such a movie, but when I saw the movie, it has a reasonably good review. I felt I was cheated and lied, and I thought I should try and save someone the misery to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
