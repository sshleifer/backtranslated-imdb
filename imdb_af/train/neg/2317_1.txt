The direction clearly stated that this film's idea and plot is completely original. But what those who have read 'slam dunk' comic can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even jokes ... <br /> Another note is Jay Chow himself does not know Kung Fu, just won't impress anyone if he tries to act the way he can. Many people today can see the differences. Fortunately, the movie does not contain much of KunG Fu's fighting and many are captivated by stunners and visual effects ... <br /> <br /> I think Jay's play is still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone in the movie so much better. The only reason I think Jay is the main actor is simply his popularity. <br /> <br /> In spite of how difficult I want anyone to stop watching it, so this "original" movie doesn't have to do it, it's one of the best budget movies in China for this year.
