I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version of her television she saw. But the version on DVD was a disaster. The lighting was poor to non-existent and the whole scene was simply cut out. In one case, Adele is asleep, and we immediately cut to another scene - in the middle of the sentence - where it is the next night. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason are never even introduced, and wondering if they got rid of the movie for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The DVD we saw was manufactured by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $ 6.32 it was a gypsum. <br /> <br /> Be careful what version of this movie you buy! We'll send this one back.
