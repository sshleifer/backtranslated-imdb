The annoying mouse and lullaby really got me and really has nothing to do with the story. It's something I would do my 1st year in film school. Very sad. In addition, the story just looked like there was no clear reason to drag. There were too many things that were just thrown there that had nothing to do with the story, which made me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were. or just that it should have been shorter ... that would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I just watched all the episodes last week, I would have to say that it was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one.
