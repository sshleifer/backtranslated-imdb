We brought this movie as a joke to a friend, and could be our worst joke to play. The movie is barely vigilant, and the play is bad. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff gives a substandard performance. The plot is disgraceful and on the points we were so bored we wondered what the hell was going on. It tries to be gruesome in places, but is just laughing. <br /> <br /> Just awful
