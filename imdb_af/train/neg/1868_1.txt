This movie is terrible. Each line is stolen from 8MM (the Italian baptized version, at least). If you like trash ... real trash, try it; but beware: this is not the "so bad thing" kind of movie. In its cheapness it may look like a porn, but believe me, if you are looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go find something else in the store ! I tell you, because the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting, acting, dialogue (the only good lines, as I said earlier, is the one they stole from Joel Schumacher's 8MM!) a few minutes and the "happy ending" is absolutely rebellious! I will give it one star: a half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after the victim's monologue (also stolen from 8MM) and a half for mother and daughter's sexy bodies (who didn't succeed not to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey!)
