Knights were just a start of a series, a pilot, one could say. The plot (I really don't call it, there wasn't a plot) was not logical at all and there were many errors, such as [warning, I am collecting the plot]: <br /> <br /> In At the beginning of the movie someone said there were only a few of the cyborgs (but the bad guys), but after the climax Nea realized that there were many more of them. And it has been suggested that cyborgs were difficult to kill, but after a month's training, Nea could kill them with a single shot. <br /> <br /> The movie was just pure kicking. I was not surprised when I found out that the front star was a kick boxer. <br /> <br /> There was ONE positive thing in the whole movie: it really laughed a lot when it looked and talked to my friends. I recommend looking at it if you're in the laugh.
