Many themes or parts of the story are the same as in Leon, then other parts feel like another movie, I don't know what, but there is a familiar feeling about the whole movie. It was nice to watch, but it would have been fantastic! if the story had been more original. The theme little girl, Leon's bad killer, has just been tackled a little. The opening styles are really good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the movies :-) My biggest problem was remembering what parts of Leon, Nikita and if they were from the French or American version. If you haven't seen Leon then it's a good movie. If you like this movie, I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Best regards / Rick
