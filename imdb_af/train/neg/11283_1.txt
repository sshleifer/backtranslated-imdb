I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a total waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing. The prestigious series of players had a terrible dialogue and extremely dubious accent. The camera was working on some experimental sites and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey, it just made it harder to look. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the overuse of narrative throughout the film, almost like the whole plot is dictated to the audience. The best performances were nothing to do with acting. In fact, probably, the most convincing performance of Dani Behr is of all people, though it does play the stereotypical office secretary. Under no circumstances should you see this movie unless you need a reason to get some lost sleep, there are definitely better ways to spend your hard-earned cash.
