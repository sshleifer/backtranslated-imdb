Normally, I tend to enjoy low budgetgonzo movies, but Darkman III is so disconcerting that I feel nothing but contempt for it. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a TV show, and a particularly clumsy one. The sets are sparse, the lighting complex, the score and the effects are apart and the camera work is film school 101. There is no plot to speak, the characters are one dimensional and the actors sleep. Most of the role players look like they should do soft core porn. In fact, the only reward I got from this debris was the thrilling Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna of Star Trek: Voyager) faced. without her Klingon bumpy head make up. Her skin shows about two shades lighter than it is in Voyager; either she was blamed for this role or darkened for Voyager. Quite strange.
