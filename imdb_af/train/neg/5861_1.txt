I saw this movie when it first came out in 1978 when I was a high school in high school. I took a date to see it. I did not "get", needless to say, because the film was so bad! Joan Rivers' career has never been as bad as it deserved after he made this terrible, unpredictable shit. In fact, unfunny is not a serious enough term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You run out like any laugh that may have occurred is beaten out before it can happen. It is not worth looking out for curiosity, or for any reason that it is "so bad-it-good." Not even the gang at MST3K made it worth watching! The fact that Billy Crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
