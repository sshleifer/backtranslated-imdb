I'm not sure what HK films the other reviewers have looked at, but the Eagles are nowhere near the top of hope in HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be happy to find working in HK, as he cannot act in a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with the leg than her father), but her acting skills are also sub-par. In fact, all the English dialogue (90% of the movie - even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switch to Mandarin sound just about me the misery of the bad dialup and the redundancy of the English to save. subs. Certainly, there are some decent rifles (but nothing we have already seen) and good cinematography, but the candles visual effects really spoil the action. <br /> <br /> It is said to be the admission fee for watching Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Urquidez. Spectacular, and almost worth watching the rest of the movie. Ultimately, you might see some scenes that look familiar to you, especially a shooting at an outside market (think Matrix) and Fitz dive out of a black fatigue helicopter (think MI: 2). Guess someone thinks that at least some things in this movie were worth shaking off.
