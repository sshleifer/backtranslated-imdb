This movie was poorly thought out, badly acted and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is extremely annoying and cannot escape the same Napolean Dynamite routine. Self-obsession and ignorant. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton also plays the same manic, excessive obsession mother, who cares too much and yet does not care enough about the lives of her children (see I said this). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I usually like her, also plays a vapid idiot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is over, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Keep this film if you want to keep your soul.
