Come in this movie, just as it started, at an afternoon where I was at home with flu - otherwise I would have missed it. It would probably have been the best. <br /> <br /> I saw the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good artists - and thought it might be worth it. It seems to be to some extent, but just because it is one of those stories that is so horrifyingly fascinating. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan has little talent to recommend to her, except for her Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson-like bosom. Unfortunately, her acting skills - at least here - leave Mansfield and Anderson as if it were Garbo or Davis. <br /> <br /> The young gearbox's white gear, the owner's cat, the young nutshell put out by the owner. and held in her own home, and a bunch of christening houses (including the young note case) walking around on a bio-danger facility, and the absurd conclusion. I was still waiting for at least a scene or plate element to at least some degree of realism, credibility or being able to give any empathy - but it was in vain.
