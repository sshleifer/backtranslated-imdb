I'm not sure why Spike Lee has wrecked this train of a movie and has the poor Stevie Wonder in the eternal couple involved in his beautiful music with this theater spot. I also distort the way he uses profanity as part of the normal prose of professional blacks. The abuse of his grip on ethnic filmmakers is a shame. Scenes that seem blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes, play as if a schoolboy wrote it. I am modest especially the ridiculous scene where the two lead, not at all, and the police come up with Snipes. The overwork of the clues makes one feel like Spike has no respect for his viewers, or he has no idea what a movie is about. The final scene seems to have been thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to indicate a point. This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in an informal conversation. I hope he'll realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as those he doesn't grow as a movie maker. I think his trade union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move. He must keep making documentary programs like the Four Little Colored Girls. Shock films don't make an Oscar.
