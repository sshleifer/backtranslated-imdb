Woody Allen lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable. This is the case with "Melinda and Melinda" where all the characters speak to Allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and have problems and views that are not related to anyone outside of a four-block radius from where Allen lives. They also share the same curious condition that they are able to afford multi-million dollar Manhattan apartments designed by professional decorators, whatever their financial situation or what they do for life. <br /> <br /> The only character out of this dull disposition is Will Ferrel as the mandatory Woody Allen surrogate. Although he not only comes down to just making a Woody Allen impression (like Kenneth Branagh in the divine "Celebrity"), Ferrel misses the charm or charisma that Woody had when playing the role in his best movies. . . <br /> <br /> The end result is another in a series of self-reliant drills from a one-time movie maker that has been trading on its former reputation for years.
