I was kindly interested in this movie as a trashy cannibal movie. I was thoroughly disappointed. It was the same kind of disappointment that I felt the 13th on Friday: Jason takes Manhattan. Wasted so much potential! <br /> <br /> The opening scene is a decent grab. then grind it to a halt. abundant breasts and cheerful 80s fashion can't help this movie. The only things eating cannibal monks near this island is the piranha! I am not asking for a 'cannibal holocaust' level of gore, but I was looking for cheap top-end gore. I had nothing of it. <br /> <br /> I found some parts of the battle scenes somewhat interesting, hence the 2 stars. I don't think it's really worth the time to look at it. I could see it pointing at a party where no one cares about what's going on and you just want something in the background. but I won't tell anyone, "Oh, man, you see this movie." It's not good enough or bad enough to pay close attention.
