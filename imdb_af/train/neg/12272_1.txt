Simply put, this is the worst movie since police academy: Mission to Moscow. (If you like that movie, you'll probably like this one.) What were they thinking? Some ideas should stay the same, an idea. The fact that this idea itself can be film must be an offense. <br /> <br /> What was so bad about what I heard you were asking. One word ... ONLY. <br /> <br /> Cost to rent: $ 4.50 Time to watch: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund on both!
