Someone probably heard from Alberto Tomba. A former policeman, a former air champion, and now a terrible actor. "Alex L'Ariete" is planning to be a mini-series, but Italian television itself has refused to show the movie on its channels. Now it's a, believe me, ridiculous movie. The writing is simply hilarious (it is supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 year old children's work. But what you're really blowing away is the amateur-like play: Alberto Tomba, who was not credible as a policeman himself, is playing a very stupid character: a special operation Italian policeman opened in open doors! ("ariete" is "ram"). This superman will try to save a young nice girl life (a real Italian "little" TV showgirl, married to the singer Eros Ramazzotti): beautiful but absolutely incompetent in the acting. Lose this one and make yourself a favor. A film that is a disgrace to the Italian cinema industry: only John Travolta in the Earth attack came close.
