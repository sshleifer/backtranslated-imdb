This movie is really brilliant. It is haunting by banality to shake so fast, you don't even see good sense and common decency to pass humanity. But it doesn't stop there! This movie hits the bottom of the walk so hard, it jumps back to the point of ridiculous comedy. Look like Kor the Beergutted Conan wannabe with the abundance of neck hairs, brace his stuff swinging his sword as if there is no tomorrow (and the way he swings it, I'm really surprised) was a morning for him, or at least for his beer drop). Don't miss this movie, it's a fantastic skirt through idiot, and mere bloody mindset! And once you have looked at this one, dry the tears of joy (or tears of frustration with such an unclear attempt at storytelling) from your eyes, because a few dumb voices gave these people another $ 5 to make a successor make!
