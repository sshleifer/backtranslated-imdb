This is by far the worst horror / thriller I have seen in my 29 years. If anyone offers it to you for free, tell them NO. This movie makes you a thinner person to know you've watched it. The plot is not even the worst part of this movie. It's the acting, camera work, lighting and sound. There is absolutely nothing to keep from this movie. whoever paid to make this movie is now broken. I hope the director never gets the green light for another movie. In his defense, this movie was made quick to try to capitalize on the actual BTK killer's capture, but I saw a movie of the weeks that looked like Oscar winners.
