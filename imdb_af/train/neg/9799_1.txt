Power Rangers, the amazing children's show of the 1990s, continue to be young children with its complete cheesiness and terrible settings. <br /> <br /> This show was not entertaining, it was an excuse to show children's violence to children how to fight each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> The toy was a further demonstration in how to promote a violent television program and such. <br /> <br /> I've never been able to find out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous performance was. <br /> <br /> As such, it remains one of the worst children's shows ever made.
