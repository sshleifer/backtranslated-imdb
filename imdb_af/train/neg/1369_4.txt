Amy Heckerling's second film, Johnny Dangerously, is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton stars as middle-aged gangster look back at his hard-hitting life when he catches a child to steal something from his pet shop in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) is having health problems. Keaton therefore falls into a crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Fargan Richard Dimitri is playing a competitive crime Lord, after Boyle and Keaton eventually rise by the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yes that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother, District Attorney, Glynnis O'Connor his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's minor. The movie looks remarkably cheap, and it looks like a television program instead of a movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts well and is expected to slow down after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogue and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it quickly loses steam and falls in mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the beauty with his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are just unpleasant, not funny. Once, Piscopo does too much. Several supporting actors are trying the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a sergeant and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous mother-in-law. The second half evolved into a hit or miss television show type show and never restored. The closing scene used by The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, such as the Call of The Wild Clark Gable movie previously seen in the movie. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the target audience would definitely be aware of The Roaring Twenties' actual 1939 issue date. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
