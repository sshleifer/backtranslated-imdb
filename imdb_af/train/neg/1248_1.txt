This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was kind of a remake, but then again, not really. I was very disappointed with the tools Tim Burton had at his disposal. He has great make-up and CGI available and a lot of money ($ 100m) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original movie made for less than $ 6m? Heck no. So in this regard, the film failed. <br /> <br /> At least in the original movie, the scene of freedom scene was shocking, but there was nothing shocking in this movie even the final scene, because you could see it coming. And by the way, if you thought so, and I did, you can find out how the end would come. I just wanted me to hold back the time I spent on it. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been great and fun if it stayed in the lines of the first movie and adopted part of "Under the Planet" or "the monkeys". Here's how I would have written it: <br /> <br /> An astronaut (it should have been more than Marky Mark, because he's not good enough to give a movie himself, so I would have three guys put in) would land on what they would think would be another planet, meet people (not mice), hunted a monkey city, make friends with good monkeys, find out they were on earth by finding ruins ruin runs into the crazy mutant people living under the earth, breaking a war between the mutant people and the monkeys, and then .... let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it. <br /> <br /> But my point is that there could have been so much more to this movie. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He is a rotten director who inspects what people think. He is trendy so he must be good, the thinking goes. Sorry, but no. If someone else did this movie, it would have been much better and would have been far more satisfying.
