Why such a generic title? Father Christmas ??? So lean and unpredictable. Movies before attempting to spend cash in the holiday spirit, especially "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians," were at least entertaining to watch because of the campsite's stuff and all the supplies are being used ... for some reason that seems to me happy. But this movie just screws Christmas in the butt and screws the joy of all the kids. Santa's living in space? His enemy is a devil named Pitch? Santa gets help from Merlin's wizard? How random it is? Well, since it was made in Mexico, some of you could understand the way the movie was made. I had to admit that some of the effects were just awake for the time being. It was an all-out cluster of madness! Although, despite all the trouble with the movie, it still feels like a Christmas movie. Good overcoming evil, and Christmas is still part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world, or possibly universe, thanks to Santa Claus, conquering the Martians. So, I think you should try it, even if it is one of the worst holiday breaks of all time ... although it should put a smile on your face every day.
