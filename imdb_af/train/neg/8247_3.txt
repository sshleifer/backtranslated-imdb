Another British romantic comedy that looks audiences all over the world has a ravenous appetite for it. This poor effort is an unintended parody of the genre. All the classic click screens are here of ridiculously extensive misunderstandings to run after you leave to declare your love. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, except for Love-Hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion into the film. Things threaten to be out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses; Our divine suspension of faith eventually comes down to the ominous end. If you are looking for a Bridget Jones Notting Hill kind of experience, you won't find it here.
