Having seen a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was amazed that it was more credible and well-behaved than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I also think other reviewers have mentioned it, namely what exactly is the nature and motivation of the Chris Sarandon character? Has he raped other victims before? Is he totally psychotic or an "average" sociopath? How did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister? Is this character credible, or is it just a matter of more background needed? He looks almost concurrently an uncomfortable credible character, and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching work that puts him in touch with young, vulnerable girls. It seems to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with his performances, which are terribly convincing. The film occupies an awkward position between mere exploitation and half-way serious treatment of the subject, without even correcting it. Not the worst movie ever made, but not so good.
