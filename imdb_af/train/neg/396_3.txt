I saw it when it was in the theater. It started so strongly. I mean back in 1980. It was a fat film and the special effects were excellent. Now you should have been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point, because the study of film has historically lost the mind that was then the expectations and other related psychological factors. Now, as I said, the movie was exciting and very entertaining. It builds up to an excellent climax then .... It ends I mean the person who described it as a water balloon break in your hand before being thrown, except to be a very poetic description. In my experience it just wasn't strong enough. My wife and I were good ... how can I say that? We were upset, I mean we paid money, invested the time watching the movie that was excellent. "We both felt that we were ending with an end, which convinced both of us to run the production company out of money and not get enough money to finish it properly. In fact, my wife said best, it didn't ended, it just stopped!
