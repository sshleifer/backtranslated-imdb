Many other reviewers here, including many whose opinions I respect, keep this slice of European sleaze horror in high regard. Personally, I didn't like it at all. This is an incoherent attempt at an atmospheric period between sex and violence. Jess Franco at best makes these kind of movies very good. Unfortunately, the notorious exploitation filmmaker Joe D'Amato does not. D'Amato's best-known films are notorious for their high-eradicating quotient. This, an early film by him, does not have the constant disgusting scenes she did more infamous "Anthropophagic" and "Beyond the Darkness". Eventually, it is an incoherent film that does not involve the viewer in any way. Without the sleazy factor, it also becomes very boring. As I said, others enjoyed this movie, but I just found it a perfect example of amazing lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are a few pluses for the movie. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is in it, and she looks pretty warm and is often naked. However, cultural film icon Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot, without any connection with the main film. He seems bored with the role and does not have the manic intensity he does at best. The music score is nice and there are a few short moments of inadvertently funny gore. Yet it is a pretentious and useless film that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
