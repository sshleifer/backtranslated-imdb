This is a good example of how to NOT make a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little meaningful dialogue, no context for events and constant cut between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, unobtrusive viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas offered are meaningless without listening to the director's comments. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot to do with human atrocities and tries to show how wrong it is with the emphasis on child abuse. It contains some images of real, horrible acts of violence, including war performances. While working in the context of the movie, I feel that the ideas behind the movie can be presented without using such extreme content. This movie is absolutely NOT for the poorly disturbed or easily offended and should under no circumstances be shown to minors. <br /> <br /> The climax is anti-climax compared to the content of the rest of the movie. If you do not listen to the comment as it happens, you will probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's comments were a one shot, "put the man down and let him talk, no cuts" comments. Although not necessarily bad, the director ends a lot and often spends minutes at a time on his college, filming conditions, co-producers, bad movie and a dozen other things. The constant negativity detracts from what is otherwise an essential tool for understanding the film. <br /> <br /> Over a very low budget, the film was shot at 16mm and Super8 movies many years ago. As a result, video and audio quality is poor. This alone does not make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie worse.
