Overestimated and only for the people in their 20s who wear thick rose tinted glasses, who never saw it in the first place, because they were young. Awful animation, dialogue and a tired narrative. A true product of the 80's, the new TOY of a puzzle TOY (that's right, TOY not the absurd, pretentious and child-wearing "collectors action figures"), sell at the back of a poor cartoon and other accessories that the bought toys when they were "real" children in the period from '84 'to' 87 '. It has become cult because the same adults are immature to abandon their memories. Avoid.
