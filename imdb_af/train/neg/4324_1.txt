The goofy Griswalds win the T.V. game show "pig in a poke" grand prize, and everyone flies to Europe where they can cause one dumb one after another. Of all the ridiculous, unpredictable money-spinning successors this one beat the lot. Harold Ramis's 1983 movie was a below average misadventure in which the awkward family went on a nightmare "Vacation" across the United States. This time, Amy Heckerling, who seems to be a disastrous "comedy", will irritate you more than it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Hughes script (with Rob Klane) is awful and you wonder why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo bothered with such a deadly project because even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca had the feeling to refuse the offer. Even an almighty Michael Palin cannot establish proceedings at any level one can call. <br /> <br /> Yet, as impossible, "European Vacation" seems to be successful enough to justify a second successor! It cannot be as intolerable as this one. You know I saw another worthwhile National Lampoon show. Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
