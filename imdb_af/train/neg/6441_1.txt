When I looked at this year's Wrestlemania game card, I was so lit and I couldn't control myself because I was full of excitement. <br /> <br /> It starts ... and it ends. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, angry with hell because of how much I got back my money. I mean, you see Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) going as a classic and then expecting the same and getting the average rubbish they have every now and then. The one moment in the whole show that ruined me was when HBK pulled out !!!! That moment that HBK loses to JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / postman. It almost destroyed Wrestlemania 22 when he beat TRIPLE H! I couldn't watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to see it again (fortunately). I once again believe in WWE to Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I have ever seen) that was a purely classic Wrestlemania. It certainly did for Mania 23 and we also gave very memorable moments. <br /> <br /> If you've watched any of the Wrestlemanias in front of this one, like those that change you to fans (Wrestlemania 20 I turn into a fan), please don't look and make the same mistake I made and leaves WWE behind. And when you see it and are angry, it starts to look again and watch Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
