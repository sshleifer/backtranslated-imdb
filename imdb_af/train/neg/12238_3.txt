A concept with potential, and it was nice to see these two holiday icons together, but ... <br /> <br /> Rudolph's glowing nose doesn't need the "explanation" presented in this movie not - like The Force in Star Wars movies did not need the explanation of "medicolor in the bloodstream". But especially the film made me cold because of Winterbolt's over-complicated plot to destroy Santa. He has the power to suggest suggestions in people's minds, so why does he do things in such a roundabout? Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, frame Rudolph threatens to melt the Frosty family ... The comedies exaggerate plotting Pinky and the Brain and Phineas and Ferb's Dr. Doofenshmirtz (who has deliberately done and played that way) looks simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt's, which is expected to take us a little bit. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly (and amusing) strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy, like boomerangs. I understand if they don't want guns in a family movie, but why do they have guns in the first place?
