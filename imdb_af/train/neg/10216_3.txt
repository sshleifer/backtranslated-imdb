STRONGER THAN FICTION made me so angry, I signed in to IMDb just to write this review. STRONGER AS FUNCTION is a surprisingly complex, touching and thought-provoking film to the end. Once you have fallen out of logic once (why did Will Ferrell not hear Emma Thompson's voice ten years ago when she started writing her book? "The phone rang. The phone rang again." How could she not knowing that he is calling him.), the thoughts of mortality, fate and sacrifice are challenged. <br /> <br /> The short history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman must especially entertain former English majors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, although Will Ferrell can just as easily be an ax killer as a clumsy soul. Her quick confidence in him is a mighty big leap of faith. <br /> <br /> Oh, but the end. To the end I would have given 9 of the 10 stars to this movie. The film as a metaphor for the journey of life, as a tribute to the idea of ​​'writing true', as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy but not both is outstanding. The whole movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrell's fate. And no matter how a character he may have become, we know well why we will accept the end. The last act takes place, the screen turns white, the credits roll. A deep and powerful end to an almost perfect movie. An end that would have been discussed for weeks. <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!! No credits rolled. Say it is not so. Say Hollywood didn't go a further 10 minutes from the shit that completely undermined the film's integrity and heart. Dustin Hoffman did this when he said: "It's no longer a masterpiece, that's right." An appropriate review of the movie. Except for me it wasn't even OK. I was so offensive about the betrayal of 'writing true', about the decision to pander the film, which I actually burst into angry tears and explained it to the movie house from the movie house. I don't cry often. I can give less about most movies, but I'm still angry about this one. <br /> <br /> My questions to the author, Zack Helm, are this: did the original movie end when the screen became white? And were you forced by the vapid movie forces - what should you do at an endless infidelity at the heart of the movie? Or did you testify the maudlin, ending up on yourself? I read that you are brilliant. I hope your original script ended the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know Zack Helm will never see this review, and I couldn't find a contact for him to ask myself. But please, moviegoers, am I the only one who feels this way about STRANGER AS FUNCTION? A good thing has come to see this movie: I am now imagining LOS IN TRANSLATION now.
