This movie was terrible. I gave it the highest score of 2, as I experienced worse but very little. <br /> <br /> Starting from the beginning of the movie at the beginning and returning to the beginning of the movie, this film uses everything in the box of the tricks used in filmmaking just for the sake of It's like a child with too many toys. There was the endless, boring repetitive narrative, slow motion, freezing, flashback and merged images, etc. No one made a dull movie. <br /> <br /> It is called 16-year-old alcohol, but there was little drinking or drunkenness and no portrayal of withdrawal with the film jumping all over the place without coherent meaning. The story was poorly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is unfortunate that people have more money for more films by Mr. Jobson, who used to know that they are in a garbage group and makes so much sense on TV as it does <br /> <br /> I saw it a big battle to see it to the end, but in the hope it gets better, i went to the bitter, but it was really a waste of time and i would have been better off not bothering.
