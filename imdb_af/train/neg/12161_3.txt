"The Lethal Look of Love" is essentially "fatal attraction" with a few turns on the back half. The end will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three films of the week. It's another cautionary about the temptation, and it doesn't add anything to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is busy with a beautiful woman who only has a substantial trust fund. Although he has it all, he can lose everything by starting a steaming bee with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a shining blonde from Cedar Falls, is having trouble with Brett and doesn't take it very well when he gets rid of his involvement. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett died in the main bedroom of the large luxury home she shared with her new husband. When the Brett police question asked, he immediately pointed his finger at Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to be at the moment - not that she was previously the image of stability. Her defense attorney (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is bent to prove it. <br /> <br /> Did she do it or didn't she? How will it end? You can find the answers to these questions next time: "The Lethal Look of Love" air on your local station. And be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs, and women are crazy.
