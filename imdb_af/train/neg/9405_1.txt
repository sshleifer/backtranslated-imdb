I just watched it on TV and what can I say, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm ashamed of being Melbourne, where the movie was made. Diabolic acting amateur-like makeup effects and a VERY bad soundtrack. As for the plot, it's even more stupid! Some of the screens just amazed me how bad it was. There is a reason why they put this kind of movie on late-night TV - because they're junk! Avoid at all costs.
