The highlight of this movie was without a doubt Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he was definitely thrown at type and he showed that he could handle an uncontrollable (for him) role. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you love, admire and root. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that, in the context of this movie, he considered himself somewhat noble - his purpose is to avenge the murder of his wife and youngest son. Yet he was already a gunman and murderer before the murder. So Hanks played a role I wouldn't have expected him, and he pulled it off well. <br /> <br /> The good performance of Hanks, but I definitely can't call it a pleasant movie. After an opening that I best describe as mysterious (it wasn't quite clear to me) it became a very bleak movie, about the intricate relationships Sullivan developed as a gunman - largely by Rooney (Paul Newman) , which is a kind of mob boss, and tries to collect his own two sons and keep them "clean" so to speak; isolated from his business. After the older son testified to a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him silent, get the wrong boy (and mother), and leave Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. Although it ends up with a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the overall context of the story), it's really very dark, with the mood boosted by Many of the scenes being shot in the dark and rainfall. I must admit that while I appreciated Hanks's actions, the film as a whole didn't just pull me. 4/10
