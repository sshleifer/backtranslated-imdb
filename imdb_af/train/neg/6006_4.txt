I did not agree with any of the theories in the Left Behind series, yet I got the books and I read 8 of them. Clearly good writing and interesting story. However, I didn't have very high expectations for the movie. There was no way to fix it. Hollywood would record a Christian series and produce a large-budget film. So it's done independently ... and it just felt like I was watching a very long TV show. It just didn't feel like a movie; It didn't have that movie "experience" about it, if anyone knows what I'm talking about. So the film suffered from it and the low budget, the poor special effects detracted from me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I feel that Gordon Currie was abusive as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of NC, was that he was this charming, dazzling, incredibly attractive man who spoke English with almost zero of accent. So I thought someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found some Clay Aiken pencil cuts that look like Best Buy's month employee and gave him a very bad neck. So there were a few stars for me there. A movie just isn't convincing if the big villain doesn't look or sound like he's supposed to. <br /> <br /> The play was okay, but nothing to write home about. Some of the screens - like one of the converting context (can't remember which one) - were real seat squirmers for me. And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was, was out of the way for some of the scenes, as in the one that Kirk Cameron prayed in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, this was not a bad movie, but it just didn't. Stick to the book, people, it's much better.
