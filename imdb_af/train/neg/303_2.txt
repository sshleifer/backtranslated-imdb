It is impossible for me to consider this film objectively. Not that I didn't try, but I think - but I sit down and I pop in the older VHS and I look at the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old and cling my own Care Bear and watching the movie with open eyes and eager heart. <br /> <br /> I can objectively see that this movie is a BIZARRE combination of cuddly baby merchandising mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that have a thin story and uninteresting animation. But my inner five-year-old goes, "Yay, Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So, I just want to recommend this (with caution) to those who saw it during their early youth and can see the tremendous power of nostalgia as I see it (like me) OR the lovely cynical Gen-X / Y people who deliberately after the wonderful bad / strange (a category in which this movie ... definitely belongs). For those who are actually looking for a compelling movie or healthy family entertainment: You might want to continue watching.
