Okay, first the good: Cher's performance and cinematography. Although I'm not a Cher fan, she gives an excellent performance and her part is well written. The recipe: a thin plot, Nicholas Cage's performance, and a totally inhumane and poor effort to portray an Italian-American family from New York. First, every time Kage opened his mouth and I cut it. I don't know what kind of accent he's trying to use. I honestly didn't think it was a New York or Italian accent I ever heard. It was quite surreal. And it wasn't because I had a stick for accuracy, his voice just grinding in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances. Second, it is pure anecdotal, but I have many Italian relationships, friends and acquaintances in New York. I honestly said more laughter and felt more joy in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family. And it will be at a dull night at home. What a drop.
