Greetings again from the darkness. What ever happened to the big Barry Levinson? He arranged two of my all-time favorites in "Avalon" and "Diner". He also had fine movies ("Rainman"), but has always been of interest ... until now. I believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is the definition of boring. Never from a huge fan of pure dumb and dumber, I was just amazed at how terrible this movie is. In the whole thing there may be 2 visits - if you can pay attention for so long. The best part of the movie is the song of the title song by a Redbone sound. If the movie as well as the song were written, it would have been acceptable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize they all want to make comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exposes one weakness. SNL rollid Amy Poehler is usually on top of her role as truck waste that princess has turned. The disaster of the film is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work that collaborates flares a promise, but then their chemistry disappears because of poor writing. This writing is like most of Jack Black's character's ideas - not a bad idea, but no hope of success.
