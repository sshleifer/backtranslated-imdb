Fine performances and artistic direction do not make a good movie. This movie is so sad and depressed, I can absolutely feel no joy about the "happy" end of the union strike. The attempts at humor involving Lake's pregnancy are absolutely disastrous, and any movie that has a Baldwin brother already has a strike. On a positive note, Lang is still one of America's major underrated actors. He alone makes it almost worth staying in the VCR. I give it a 4.
