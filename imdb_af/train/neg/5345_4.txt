If you can make it through "classic Meyer" titles / intro, you can blow through anything. But do you want? I didn't find much to dig my teeth there. I think if you go with low enuff expectations, you'll be delighted (a la Charlie's Angels.) But for my money, I want to move a little more, more visually, more. More. I feel like I'm begging @ the foot of the master. the men have the goods. but he just won't share.
