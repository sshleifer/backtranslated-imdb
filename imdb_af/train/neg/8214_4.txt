It does not move the depths of Creepshow 3, but it comes close. It also uses the same technique of using the same actors in various roles through anthology, which is the least distracting. <br /> <br /> This is also quite annoying. The Twilight Zone (with the bookshop comparable to Serling's later night gallery). Unfortunately, producers and writers forgot that Serling would build sympathy for his characters before they left. None of the characters is particularly sympathetic or interesting to the last segment. <br /> <br /> Entry story: Adam West is ... well, himself. He's not going to the Bruce Wayne / Batman Campy 60s, but he rarely does. He simply plays the not-so-mysterious "Jay" (there is an ominous backbone name that is compared to Dr. Terror, Eramus and The Cryptkeeper), and makes a little uncomfortable / unpleasant statements. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Watched Rod Serling's "A Stop in Willoughby"? Then you saw it. The red hair of the nutso-woman is introduced without any purpose, but even the main character's friend identifies him as a wimp. Arranged as well as expected, but basically incoherent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Recalling various Serling travel stories mixed with Steve Allen's "A Meeting of Minds." Most of the actors are not bad (except Josh Astin as Cassius, who manages to walk, talk and even breathe uncomfortably), and the idea is slightly interesting. But like Abernathy, it's not going anywhere. The main character gives some reasonably reasonable questions, bugs from a little (what wouldn't?), And for some reason he ends up on a nuclear world. <br /> <br /> Living Replay: Not a bad little piece, and managing to predate both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose it says something fascinated by the magical features of remote control. The main character is slightly sympathetic. Nothing essentially innovative here, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> Roadside: You see the turn a mile away, but like the main character, it has a heart and it is a decent story of defeat and redemption. /> <br /> Final: So ... why do people pack in cold storage in silver lame? Do not know. And don't make sense. So ... all the protagonists are wandering in the bookstore and getting caught up? Kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks guys!), And the man in the first segment died. So how did he get stuck? Did he visit the bookstore before he died, trapped and ... didn't die? What? Huh? I suspect it is not expected to make sense because it is supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> Overall: basically no different from the two newer Twilight Zone series, or a few episodes of Tales From the Darkside of Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth it. But there's nothing really spectacular here.
