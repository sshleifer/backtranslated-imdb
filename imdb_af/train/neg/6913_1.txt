Believe it or not, "The Woodchipper Massacre" gave me full blown gonorrhea! That's right, I got rid of a rainbow, just because a group of kids played with a video camera and somehow made a deal with the devil and got distribution. It is beyond my understanding how a person with moderate intelligence can tolerate this mortgage load of a movie. The only reason I managed it (not without several suicide attempts along the way) was because I was bored with boredom for the first time, and the second - I think I wanted to further investigate this new-found type of hate. This movie is a "shoot-on-video" horror / comedy about three brothers and sisters staying over the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt. The youngest child ends the accident with the Rambo replica knife. They then get a lady with various tools (it's not just a drop of blood in her body!) And get her in their dad's hired woodcutter. Her convicted son then stopped by looking for his mother and the kids also ended that jackass at meal ... I never remember a role play of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea. Seriously, that one blond chick voice constantly threw me into pain. All the actors were really scary - they just had a screaming dialogue and crazy jokes that had to be written by a chimpanzee who just didn't mind! Now I can usually appreciate independent efforts, but only those who can realize that other people than their family members can follow it! I don't need to see a 3 minute shot of a car coming out of a roadway and a painful, painfully long lawn mount with some ridiculous, fluttering music playing about it. Plus, why does the box of this movie have a bloody piano? There was a piano in ONE scene and no one was killed near it! I was reminded of this movie. Unless you like insatiable shit, I'd recommend someone with half a brain to avoid this trash.
