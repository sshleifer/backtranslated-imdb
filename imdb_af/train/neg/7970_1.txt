Whether you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life depends on how you like your horror movies. If you love them so much, they are hysterical, look away. Jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in my life (and I've seen 'Long Time Dead'), and I say this as a fan of the low-budget horror / gore genre and have seen a few to compare it. I'm not even going to go into what makes this movie bad, because the only good thing is that it's so horrible it's one of the funniest things I've seen for years. If you can find it cheap to rent, it is definitely worth looking at, if you are involved in making it - ashamed. : o) IMDb must specify a 0/10 position, especially for this movie, it deserves it thoroughly.
