This is a low-budget "Scream" movie. "Maddy" is a new worker at a striking nameless office where she meets and starts a relationship with her co-worker, Chris. During a hot bath party, Chris and his friends convinced Maddy to belong to a "murder club" where everyone killed someone for kicks. When Maddy loses it and actually kills someone, hyinks come. <br /> <br /> The movie looks good, and there are the necessities for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe a few cameos of slightly larger stars than the cast), but after the credit roll you'll find yourself ask why you spent 80 minutes of your life.
