Geez, as a Gay man living in NYC, can be thankful that I have never seen the gay culture of Gay Culture portrayed in this movie - and I'm happy about it !!! Had this movie been broadcast on TV across the United States, there would be a huge anti-Gay blow and I cannot say I would owe them. The people in this movie do not represent the average Gay American or even the average Trandgender American, which they represent, is a mere and complete nightmare. The inclusion of obviously minor characters is frightening and the obvious racist sentiments (anti-white) are blatant and disturbing. Society cannot get guilty for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film's "cast" Action of these people is not acts of despair, but rather a rejection of anything that looks like personal ambition and willingness to make something out of your own.
