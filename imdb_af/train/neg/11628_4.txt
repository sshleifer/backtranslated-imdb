Wow You are too good !!! Corny, Corny, Corny That's how I feel about the movie. It started well with a good idea. A man (Edward Asner) escapes from prison dressed as Santa, a lot of children find him and she believes the right santa so the false santa helps the children help him get a bag of stolen money. The movie is like a Christmas version of "Whistle in the Wind". The movie starts out well, but it gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that it is eventually ridiculous and you just can't take this movie seriously. For example, you get the Scrooge-type character called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois) who is a total Douchebag that treats his young son like a pile, a litter, he treats his son so badly that he doesn't even buy decent clothes not, the poor child wears jeans with cavities in it! but a 45-second scene with Fake Santa visits Sumner and at the end of the movie you are all happy to sing Carol Carol and hug his neglected son ... Yes, that's how Corny is. .. I'm all for a good movie especially during Christmas and I'm a big fan of the seasonal TV movie, but this one is too over me, it's a pity because it started well, but the second one half of the movie is a supernatural element that 'does not match the rest of the movie. It's not quite bad, there's a lot of action, especially of the kids, but there's much better Christmas movie.
