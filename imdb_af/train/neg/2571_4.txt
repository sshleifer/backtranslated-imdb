With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie you see, it won't go wrong. But what can I say? It was a terrible fire. The film is about Peter Sellers as an older man who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a very strange man, not to mention an attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is incredibly untouched and I didn't understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this movie does not prove it. <br /> <br /> The song about ?? Arabella Cinderella 'is pretty cool, but it is. I only recommend this movie to people who want to watch an extreme novelty movie, this is almost the definition of one. I think this movie is more than anything else a sign of times, in terms of definitive experimental and overall unconventionality. The problem is that the quality is completely shot and that the writing, not to mention, the direction is just as out there. <br /> <br /> In particular, Peter Sellers is hit and miss, he goes from dr. Strangelove and be there throughout his career, silent films like this and the magical Christian, much like those in context and style, but that movie had a few funny moments. This one is pointless, and I'm sad that someone as big as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.
