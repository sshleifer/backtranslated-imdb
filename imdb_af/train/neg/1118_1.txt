I was really shocked by this horrible movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a creepy musical score. Really promising! Indeed, after ten minutes you really start to sweat and feel uncomfortable because you start to fear the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a real nightmare, and what's worse - it all comes out. For an hour and a half, I tried to combat complete boredom and fall asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a frightening picture - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence and, above all, your wallet, as the idea of ​​spending precious money on a movie ticket for this inexpensive amateur video is the greatest horror of all.
