it's not one of those movies, it's one of the biggest pieces of the slide I've ever had, the camera work is trying to be flashy, but it really just looks like the whole thing like the red shoe books, but without the sex The only reason I bought it was that I wanted to try DVD and it was the cheapest one I could get, possibly the worst buy of my life, and I could turn off DVD forever, the soundtrack is VERY tough and the Most of the movie is made up of endless repetitions of tracks from the first two movies, why anyone wants to make a movie so terrible if it is outside of me, if they really tried to make an original movie and fail, I would be more beautiful in this review, but they did not only have the rights to reproduce the first two material and then edit it and repeat it in this movie. Perhaps it's under 1 3rd original footage about the standards of film school students. DO NOT purchase this movie. The only entertainment this DVD can offer is if you have to keep it in the microwave and see the flashing lights! OUT OF OUTSIDE OUT OF OUTSIDE INCREDIBLE GARBAGE! 0/10 if only the voting system will allow it.
