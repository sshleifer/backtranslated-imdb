I know you've read it before on many other movies, no matter if you read the comment here, but the voodoo academy is still the worst movie I could find. No doubt the really bad people aren't even available to buy or watch TV, yet I feel it is fair to qualify that I'm not just a stupid tenant who chose badly. <br /> <br /> I'm "I saw two-thirds of the under-100 classified movies here on the imdb, and I notice every chance of the rest. Most of these are head and shoulders above this ... outlook in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I really like to evaluate really bad movies (like people with no humor, how bad they are) by how many people you have to look to make it through. If you can see it yourself, it's not that bad. If you can see it with a single friend, it's bad, but it can be much worse. <br /> <br /> It took 5 of us to make it right through the voodoo academy. and not even the usual fun moments to watch bad movies (eg the ghost microphone, for example, 3 times in this one if I'm not wrong) can take away the dry taste in my mouth. yes i watched it, but i also forced 4 of my friends to see it with me to reach it. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray that we have seen the directors cut ... to think there could be a 20-minute version of big eyebrows with baby oil glands that rub their torsos, just hell out scared me. so much of the film centers on this. <br /> <br /> I welcome David decoteau for managing this movie in two days on a short budget, just as I applauded him to convince people to pay him to make what is undoubtedly a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but this is not a good movie. The original horror shop was shot at the same time for a comparative amount of money (taking into account inflation) and was a mature jewel. This is not an excuse for how bad this baby is. <br /> <br /> Forward spoilers ... <br /> <br /> it is not even worth picking up the plot holes, or knowing all the hero characters. The pacing of the film ... is insane ... nothing ... is interesting for the time being devoted decoteau to the pectoral self massage. no matter what your alignment or sex is ... rubbing just can't keep that kind of screen time. <br /> <br /> The acting is cheese ... but not excessively amateur ... I've seen much worse in better movies ... but somehow it's the semi-capable delivery of some of the worst lines you'll ever hear in a movie that really stirs. <br /> <br /> rent it if you, like me, have a fascination with the worst of the worst, and only if you are going to look with a group of people willing to work through it . it's not ha ha ha the set wobbled affair. This is an endurance test that you probably want to hit. <br /> <br /> I'm sure there's worse ... but I won't be surprised if it has the name of Decoteau.
