I wanted to see this movie since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it on Saturday night at 07:40. I regret the day my ticket spilled on this trash when I could see something better. The beginning was already a lot of sex waste and cliches. They exaggerate the way love works in reality. All the girls were stereotypes. The boyfriend was too stupid for his own age. The passing gasses that the pregnant girl kept, barely laughed. The bank robbery was completely boring with gags used in other movies. Their breakaway engine was an old beat Chevy from what they claim to have no break. Hi why didn't they get a nice girlish vehicle for the robbery? This may have encouraged the audience's opinion on the movie. This movie was very low low low budget because nothing was damaged or destroyed. This movie had many things in it that would manage Christian people's nuts. Hey, I even expected a car hunt scene, because all the bank robberies have a car hunt, but I have never been there. So I rate this movie b which stands for low budget and 1 out of 10 stars.
