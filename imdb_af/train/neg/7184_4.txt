It wasn't really a very good movie. There were many unpredictable and predictable things that happened during the film ... but I think most reviewers are missing the reason why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience. THIS FILM IS PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Isn't it enough to inspire us all to watch this movie? A film produced by a former NBA star doesn't come together every day. Beautiful stupid babies in a big house are cut by an ax wielding psycho. Every clich√© led us to complain. Teen sex. And it's all made by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can't say enough about this movie! Teen drug use! College hijinx! And it's all made by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
