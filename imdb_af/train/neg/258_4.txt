It's the first time I've ever seen a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it'll be my last. I didn't see him being funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or to say, "I'm going to shower." <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes to the good guy. The good guy has a wife, so the bad guy uses her. In between, the officers move on. The final scenes are absolutely incredible. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a man, but you don't do your homework to solve a trivial mystery? <br /> <br /> There is no big play, there isn't much of a plot or storyline, and the shooting is done MTV style. Don't waste your money on this one. <br /> <br />
