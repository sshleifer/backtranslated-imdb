I went to the movie as a Sneak Preview in Austria. So I didn't have an idea I'm going to see. The story is very normal. The movie is very long, I believe it can have cut up to 1/2 without causing any problems with the story. It's the kind of movie you can see in a boring night that you want to make more bored! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is OK. The film talks about US coastguards, how they are trained, their lifestyle and the problems they face. There aren't many effects in the movie. So if you want to see it, you don't have to waste your money and time on the Cinema. It would be more effective to watch it at home when it comes to DVDs.
