Without effective concession from the supernatural or poetic motivational nuances of humanity, all this creative team must hope for the effective use of its means, unauthorized elements. 'Party of Five' maniacal, then genetically inevitable, there is little interest in roots because the single non-murderous element is a second time, is a scary 'Wes Bentley' mopester. In fact, all the plays are deep. Although the dark-haired women appeal, the salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also lacking enough buckets of blood. All sensations are kept at a teasing, safe distance ... an unfortunate fact, taking into account the name of the directors, is "butcher." Only the soundtrack, the drone angsty alt-land and the tense fluctuating score give any tangible tension. Sometimes some static storyboard compositions make attractive low angles that add to the malaise ... but for a movie that calls itself abominable, I didn't even fly once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on social rejuvenation through blood intake, scenes with different geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness by the family's malicious or falling sympathetic characters, should escape to escape their dilemma, would have improved my opinion, but it was not a good start with my horrorfest trip.
