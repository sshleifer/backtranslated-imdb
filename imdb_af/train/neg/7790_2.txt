Like some of the other people who reviewed this movie, I also nostalgically raised it ... before I had the accident to actually see it again. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this movie were completely unreliable, and the dangers of Pauline are now being revealed to be embarrassing in banal, racist and boring filming. Even the presence of old forwards Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas cannot overcome a shaky script, a terrific theme song and some miserable 'special effects'. In addition, the stereotypical images of African and Arabic characters make painful performance, especially as it is produced in the immediate consequence of the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldon's original psychotronic encyclopedia reports that Pauline's dangers were originally made for television, but inexplicably eventually became a theatrical release. Judging from the results, this is a completely credible (and confusing) scenario.
