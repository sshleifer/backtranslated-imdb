Annie's wig doesn't look good. she is not cute and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie sticks out in the movie, as her outfits look like Halloween costumes. horrible acting and terrible plots. This movie is such a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger and smaller girl should play the lead. Ashley Johnson depicts a very young boy Annie. Not attractive. At least, the deciding director managed it with Daddy Warbucks. Miss. Hannigan was also ignored. Camilla Belle played Molly. "Warning" this movie can make you angry, so you might just want to show it to many young children. 8 and younger. Some of the plots are too fictitious and can hardly happen in the real world.
