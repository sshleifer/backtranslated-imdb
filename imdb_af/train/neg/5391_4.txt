I hate most end of world movies. They show what Hollywood people think of the rest of the world, and they clearly think we're a lot of sadistic idiots (or at least that the look of sadistic idiots is somehow amusing). I was often on L.A. I have a family working in the show business, and I just want to say that it is the * last * people we need to look for in a reality check. Some disaster films paint at least a clever image: Children of men, 12 monkeys, but usually the message just "people will do anything to survive, everything is dark and sad and aimless, we must all be ashamed of us." /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of ​​a story exploring the system of social order and testing people's mettle in the face of horror and I believe some people will be portrayed like this movie, but sadistic idiots aside, I seriously doubt that society will only solve in every person for itself, it is just insulting.
