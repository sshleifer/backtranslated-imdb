This movie is probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, and I encourage you to see that movie earlier. <br /> <br /> The movie has two strong elements and that is: (1) the realistic acting (2) undeserved good, photo. In addition, what strikes me the most is the endless stream of clumsiness. Lena Nyman must be the most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupidly and with all nudity in this movie ... it's unattractive. Compared to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced by stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I will say it because of the difference in ideals between French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> A movie of his time and place. 10/02.
