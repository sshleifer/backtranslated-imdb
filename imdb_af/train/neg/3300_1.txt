Very typical of Swedish films of this type. Strange that the acting was so bad, these actors usually give a good performance. The casting was poorly done, it made you expect something (I won't tell you). The main character was terrible ... I don't know where to find her. Anyway, stay away from this and go see "Third Tray" instead, it's Swedish action in is prime.
