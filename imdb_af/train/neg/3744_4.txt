This film is an attempt to present the Jared Diamonds theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel", and explain how the Europeans dominated much of the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw of this documentary comes on 2 discs covering 3. hours. I think the information could be presented in 20 minutes. There are completely useless scenes from: Binoculars, Jared Diamond, who is being watched by a binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond, who did not use a bow and arrow properly, shot Professor Jared Diamond a sharper. Was this documentary supposed to make a hero from "Professor Jared diamond"? This part of the documentary was so bad it could be a spoof. The worst was when Diamond was shown to break down and cry when he visited the malaria ward in an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of "guns, germs and steel". VAT, "Guns, Germs and Steel" is said about 100 times. "Can the European guns, germs and steel get them out of this difficult situation? Stay informed and find out!" When he finally comes to business, his theory is equally interesting and completely boring. Europeans conquered the inhabitants of other countries because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wood weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me? The parts of his theory explaining how the Europeans came to get the benefits that allow the conquest are interesting, but the cover is paper thin. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the documentary just tried to convince me that non-Europeans are as good as Europeans. If I'm not racist, I already know it. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond won't convince me with his bumbling use of native implements. <br /> <br /> I don't think adults are the intended audience for this documentary. Children may enjoy it more than I do. I read that the book from which this documentary document is much better than the documentary.
