Well, I recently got a chance to rent it and conquer Christmas the martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a Spanish command in Spanish 5 we all had to look. I will tell you, usually when we watch a movie, we all just talk and eat food, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept jaws up there and wondered what the evil Mr. Pitch will do next. Will Merlin help Santa Claus!?! or will his robot reindeer come and save the day? I suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen and I love it. : D
