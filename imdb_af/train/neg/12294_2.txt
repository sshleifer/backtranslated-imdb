I just watched this movie for the environment. It's filmed in an old hotel where a friend owns shares. The plot was predictable, the acting was at its best, the scarecrows were all scum, not warning. <br /> <br /> I don't remember much about the plot, and I think that's because there's not much to remember. They didn't even use the hotel to offer the full potential. The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on a peninsula. At low tide you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, which is actually a terrible sight, the first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind cries through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is with the remote control in your hand so you can move forward (and use that term loosely) scenes and break into the beauty of the environment!
