I really wanted to see this movie and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it appeared in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very sad disappointed, which made me angry again. I will give any movie a chance, even if I want to go out of the theater / press 'stop'. I looked at it all the time, but got nothing, but frustration. <br /> <br /> The acting was very, very good, but it was about it. Nothing is explained; While we understand that Mathieu gets depressed and comes into a soul clinic of some kind, we are never given insight into his 'downfall'. While we understand that he and Cedric are breaking, we don't see it again, or WHY it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric revealed that he had once deceived him, but that was not a major problem. I expected to see it in flashbacks, but nothing. We also get the tips that Cedric was the one to bring Mat to hospital - but AGAIN, we don't see it. <br /> <br /> I know some movies are a 'take it as it is' but this movie honestly disapproved of me. When Pierre, Cedric's former president appeared in the club and started having trouble, we didn't see any shelter or hair from near the end, and it took me a long time to find out that Pierre is the former ex. His personality at the club and when Mat finds him is completely different. I can even be wrong to say this, it was so confusing. <br /> <br /> The movie expects you to know everything and move along with its unfounded, out-of-place and confusing pace. I can keep up with movies like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other movies that have left / right flashes / flash forward, but CU has not captured and held the style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane' you know what's going on and discover the answer to the main puzzles. CU just hangs you out. It has a sense of pretense in his "we are not going to tell you a damn thing, think of yourself". It's like reading a book with the chapters converted and pages missing. <br /> <br /> Good acting, as I said. I like the characters, but the whole story was just too disappointing.
