After the debacle of the first Sleepaway camp, who thought a franchise could be born. SC II is better than aspect. More inspired murders and just a lot more fun. While it may not say much (compared to the first movie), Sleepaway Camp II is worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Benefits: Entertainment, does not take too seriously as SC I. Inspired Killings. Cons: Crappy acting and mullets are abundant. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
