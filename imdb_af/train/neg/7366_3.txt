What the F * @ # was what I just watched? Steven STOP !! Please! This movie is careless and silly. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Seagal now (of course) the wish-them-vampire 'like' creatures with a super human power. OK? Oh, and their eyes shining in an inhumane way sideways? Wow! Even in this movie, to avoid Seagals, the last punch-and-no-one kick-my-a $$ ego, HE is somehow stronger than they are. But all the average people are crushed around him. Come on, I can understand the big bully or drug dealer in the mouth, but it's super human strength people. Oh, and get it, Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues, because he and his cohorts believe in the movie he is Wolverine! Oh My GO ... And worst of all! Yes, there is a worse than that. He has a voice over the changing voice in the middle of the sentence as we look at his face. Of course, they don't sound like him and I believe this can be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always look at a movie to finish. It's a long time low, even for you directly to movies Steven. Awful! Awful! Awful! Two thumbs off! Redemeption qualities? Well, I think so, I'll be fair in that aspect. At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like the choice of wardrobe for actors and actresses. The women all were quite attractive IMO. Still, and I still said, it doesn't matter to the blatant X-Men, Underworld, (add your favorite zombie, vampire movie here)! The director, writer, producer, ALL must be banned and exile from the movie business. I think I feel the way most people feel about this movie about Blood Rayne (and just about all your other Boll pictures). This is my $ 1.00 on this movie. See if you dare.
