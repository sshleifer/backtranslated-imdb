This is the only thing I can say positively about this movie. Cleveland is the star, I was there and never saw the city look like this. Beautiful river and urban landscapes. <br /> <br /> This movie moves so fast ahead, they hope you won't see the lack of real world relevance. People run around and shoot guns without any consequences. For example, there is a shooting at Rob Lowe's character's home. Two cars are stolen, yet the police do not appear much later in the movie. Murder of rents never looked so innocent. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this movie must be on the receiving end of one of the movies countless wandering bullets. Many of the actors in this movie are so much better than that. I looked at the date of the movie just to make sure it was not written during the authors strike, but that was not the case. This movie is currently in rotation on Universal's HD channel - unless you want to drop down on Lowe, there's no reason to watch it.
