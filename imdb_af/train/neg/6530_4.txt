** Possible Spoilers Forward ** <br /> <br /> Gerald Mohr, a busy B-movie actor during the forties and fifties, leads an expedition to Mars. Before arriving at the Red Planet, we are entertained by a romantic patter between Mohr and scientist Nora Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and the view of Les Tremayne as another scientist playing a billy goat beard. The Martian exteriors have false backdrops and tints ranging from red to pink? - The "Cinemagic" process is highlighted in the ads. Real cool monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eye insect, a great Venus Fly-Trap and the memorable rat / bat / spin. The whole bizarre adventure is repeated by surviving Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. The ANGRY RED PLANET reportedly followed quite a cult, and it probably picked up most of its fans during the psychedelic Sixties.
