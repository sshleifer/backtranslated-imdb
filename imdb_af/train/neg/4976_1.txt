I watched Grendel the night and was obliged to put together a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem. The sci-fi channel has a growing catalog of inadvertent and uninteresting movies, and the previews have made an uncomfortable low-budget mini-epic, but the one refused to make me switch. It was exaggerated, overwhelming, bad. I looked into the train wreck in fascination and horror, you couldn't pull your eyes away. I reached for a notebook and managed to capture part of what I saw. The following may contain decay or perhaps just save your common sense. You're warned. <br /> <br /> - Just to get it over, Beowulf's warriors had audiences heard. Trivial issue compared to what came next. It also appears that the helmets were in a container and handed over to which actor next time went astray. Fitness, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> - Marina Sirtis was apparently at the scene of the movie by the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey circus. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns did the rest of her makeup. <br /> <br /> - Ben Cross pretends he's not ashamed of the king. His character, Hrothgar, only became king of the Dane a few minutes before he opened the film. He didn't have the chance to change the crown, to fit him. <br /> <br /> - To facilitate the actors' returns Waiting for their day's work tables, there was no need to change their hairstyles. The variety of hair included cornrows, sideburns, buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to derive from the dialogue. To prove that it was a multinational role, everyone was encouraged to retain any emphasis they chose. <br /> <br /> - As usual with this kind of movie (at least since Mad Max), leather weapon was a requirement. In this case, it was strange, sick and brand new. <br /> <br /> - The female love interest, Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, follows a long tradition of hotties to be watched. with the volume completely turned off. <br /> <br /> - The unintentional focus of the movie was a repetitive, composite crossbow with explosive bolts. It never has to be loaded and even had a setback when it was fired. It succeeded in destroying the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, historical fact and plot reduction in itself. <br /> <br /> - Instead of being a Norwegian long hall, Hrothgar's palace, Heorot, was apparently designed and built by Atlantis artisans. <br /> <br /> - Beowulf arrived at the Dane's homeland in a two-speed thrown ship that was originally part of a set, the other two being Santa Maria and the Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Prince Unferth observed Beowulf's ship's telescope approach. Before you can recover from that amazing innovation, you need to see the ship from its perspective. Judging from the corner, the prince was in a kind of plane. <br /> <br /> - Fun Fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (from a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you can see the actors' breath or inside or outside. <br /> <br /> - Fun Fact 2: Dark Age dance in Denmark looks like slow dances I went to in the 8th grade. <br /> - Fun Fact 3: You can also make a catapult with an explosive explosive explosive. But don't expect it to hurt. By the way, Beowulf was apparently a veteran of World War II, shouting "Incoming". To destroy any remaining suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> - Grendel was so upset and always in a cut, because as a completely CGI creation he couldn't leave footprints. Even in the snow. - Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in a bad mood because she was a single mother and junior, her wings were not inherited. Recurrent gene, I suppose. By the way, we can now make an educated guess that Grendel's doll was probably Swamp Thing. <br /> <br /> - Latch and mom decided to kill randomly, fly away, or tow their prey, based on a close read. from the next few pages of the script. <br /> <br /> - Fun Medical Fact: Being defeated by a mythical animal that is hard enough to throw fifty feet against rock causes slight facial scratches that don't bleed too much. /> <br /> - The sword of legend Beowulf who sent the Hag was as long as he was tall and had enough steel to place a second deck on the Golden Gate bridge. Fortunately, the wobbling has driven out some concerns about its weight. <br /> <br /> - Best rule of the movie: Prince Unferth has just been painted by Hag and spits a quarter of blood about six feet. Princess Ingrid put him softly and said, "You're going to be okay, my prince." So much for that work at the triage clinic. <br /> <br /> I feel better now.
