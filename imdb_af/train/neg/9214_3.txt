Many things become apparent when watching this movie: 1) The acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the older-child-conflict border soap opera-ish. The other two boys: an excessive kid-kid and your stereotypical I-a-babe-but-I-really-sensitive-inside blonde dream boat; 2) the film as a whole is depressed and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (acted by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is a strange choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) The strange lines and sidewalks are not made better by the terrible acting; and 5) this is a very bad movie. Expect to be disappointed - and probably disturbed.
