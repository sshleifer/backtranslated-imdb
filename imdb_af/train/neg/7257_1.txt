I expected to have a B-movie French musical. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès was superstars of low-budget French films of that time. And this is in color! But I have hallucination in this incredible one hour of pure mediocrity. Music numbers are terrible, and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? Which songs? It's just a succession of bad numbers, one after another. The only rare thing about that thing is the nakedness of women. It wasn't known then. In fact, some numbers are just there to show our topless women. This adds to mediocrity! And try to find young Michel Serrault, the future big actor of the French cinema, in a bit of a musician, in his very first movie. Strength!
