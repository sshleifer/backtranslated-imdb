My wife and I thought the movie with this role and director would at least be worth watching. We were wrong. In fact, we gave it in 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone is British but with American accent, was impossible for me to get past. It's hard to believe it's England when nobody speaks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to associate a previous comment, the idea is that Cooper and Crawford suddenly announce their love for each other, for no reason, ridiculous. There is no reason to care about any of the characters. That's why we threw the towel halfway through. I found it hard to believe that Hawks had corrected it, as none of the actors with the Hawksian brand spoke gear-a-tat delivery. So save your time and save this one.
