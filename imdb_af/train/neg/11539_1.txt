It's the biggest load of shit I've ever seen. The last time I hated such a movie was while watching "28 days later" and "Magnolia". There is absolutely no mention of this movie, except to see some very sick and twisted sex / rape titles, while Gillian Anderson relieves herself on the side of the road, and every single sentence of dialogue needs the "F" word at least a few times in it. It performed extremely cheaply and is very low budget. My friend and I finally switched off the movie after about half an hour. We tried to give it a chance, but nothing can save this litter. Don't see it !!!
