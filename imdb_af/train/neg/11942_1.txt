Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It is getting worse and just getting worse. Katherine Heigl is filthy in a Lolita roll and Leo Grillo is struggling with what is essentially a cardboard cutout. The only role player with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who picks him up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role. The script is frightening, scary and big enough to drive a double-decker bus! It's also the most sexist movie I've ever seen! Katherine Heigl's character is completely unsympathetic. She is seen as an evil, indifferent seducer who lures the poor, innocent married man to deceive his wife. It is implied in the film that she is a minor, and the message associated with the plot-string is merely fraudsters' beliefs! In the end, she can't even save herself by shooting the man who obviously (ha!) Dementia is of anger and guilt, but the scripture enables him to kill himself and thus, in the eyes of men everywhere to redeem. Horrible. Don't waste your time.
