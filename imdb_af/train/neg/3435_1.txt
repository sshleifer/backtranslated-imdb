I ordered this extremely scarce and highly overrated film on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. As an everlasting fan of horror, from American 80-year-old American slashers to European zombie movies, I told myself it would be great! I can't tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it would be pretty much gorier than it actually was. After all I heard about this movie, I was almost scared to see it. The murders are boring. The acting ... forgets it, there is no acting! The story, even if we don't care, is incredibly bad. They seem to be trying to get your attention with some strange sexual scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately this doesn't help the movie. Why? There is no atmosphere, and this is the worst thing about this movie. It's just bad movie making from point A to B. Although it's very funny and fun to watch with your friends and lots of beer, don't bother getting your hands on it. There are so many movies in this world, don't waste your time watching Necro Files!
