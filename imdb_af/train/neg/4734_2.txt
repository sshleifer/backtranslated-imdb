You like beautiful girls? Yes me too. What is bad about saying beautiful girls / women? Nothing imo, so why would I give this movie only 2 stars out of 5, although it got the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really want to see nice people, I want to watch MTV or something. It's a movie, a so-called action movie. So, by definition, doesn't it really need a plot? I don't agree 100%, but let's say yes. So what does it need? 20 minute footage of part 1 (I might be a little exaggerated, but it has more than 20 minutes of feeling ...)? It would be "No". But then you never know again, the people who saw one might not know what they ate breakfast this morning, so let's remind them ... hey, maybe they remind them twice? Just to be sure, they won't forget ... at least to the credit, of course !! <br /> <br /> Forget about the story, about character development, about real emotions, about the "scene" (and no, I don't think women in skirts walking and / or fighting are accountable for acting!) ... what is it leaving? Yes the action scenes. The action scenes aren't bad and that's why I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! I gave this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / see, believe me ...
