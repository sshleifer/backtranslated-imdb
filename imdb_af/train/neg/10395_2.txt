What the manufacturers of this terrible adjustment are trying to do is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> A group of top-quality actors, in the lead (with some notable exceptions), give pretty good performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as aunt Louise and just as well is Joanna Lumley as Diana. Everyone does well with the scriptures they have been given. <br /> <br /> So much for the good. The average will include the sets. Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although the house they use for the Dower House looks bizarre, remarkable as it looks. So it is clear that the Dower House is too big. In the later parts, the authors decided to bring the whole story back to the UK, probably to save money, but with a little imagination I have no doubt that they could be re-created Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now bad. The script. It's such a terrible bad adjustment is hard to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in Britain's battle, but survives, blinded. He makes a short look and commits suicide - why? Loveday has changed from the young woman, completely in love with Gus, to a sensible farmer's wife who can give love her life with barely a tear (less emotional than brief encounter). Gus, a man in love with passion, is willing to give up his love without complaint. Walter (Mudge in the book) turns from a plain treacherous man to a dedicated family man. Jess is made in a psychologically disturbed young woman who does not speak. Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem, but now without any justification. The Dower House is occupied by the army for no other obvious reason than a very short scene with Jess having fear of armed soldiers. While Miss Mortimer's breasts are absolutely beautiful, I couldn't see how their performance moved the plot several times. The beautifully named Nettlebed becomes the everyday Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing the list. <br /> <br /> There is a successor (who has lost all interest to look at this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the sequel to the story. It's hard to imagine that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were bought.
