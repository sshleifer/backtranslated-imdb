The brain that would not die is one horrible piece of film that stinks from the openings. It has all the classic signs to be bad: incredible plot line, horrible acting, low grade sets and lighting. The plot line goes as follows: When a doctor and his fiance are caught in an accident, she is beheaded and he picks up her head and takes her to his laboratory where he puts her head in a pan with a special liquid that it keeps alive. I would have to spend Virgnina Leath bet, which played the head in a pan, very awkward time to carry the pan around her neck and scratch under a table. Anyway, the doctor tries to get her a new body, and hires two strippers so she can choose one to have her new body. Very badly, so badly torn at Mystery Science Theater 3000.
