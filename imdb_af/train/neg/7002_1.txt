I saw this movie and the other one. Trinity is my name and I find this one worse than the first one. I have no idea why they even made another movie, it was stupid and useless, sorry to say I have everyone. I put them several times and it still drives me to turn it off for 5 minutes in the movie. I love Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie just drove me to the wall. If it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy, it might have been worth it and the five bucks was worth it, I bought all the movies. But you make mistakes, so I'll say your money is saving and don't trust this movie or any of those that go with it, trusting this one.
