This game was ruined by potentially big games that were cut very short. <br /> <br /> The opening game was a waste of the Doom Legion, but I think the only way they could be eliminated by the Demolition was a double DQ. Otherwise Mr Perfect would have to sit overtime. Kerry von Erich, the I-C champion, was wasted here. And that was the third ppv in a row where Perfect works. Remember, he never lost a game before. <br /> <br /> The second game was very good, possibly the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and the Undertaker were excellent, while Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights and pinched the Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put a new heel over (remember the Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). It was a shadow of Bret Hart's single career as he came back from two to one and the game almost survived. He and DiBiase set up a wrestling clinic and we forgot that the point of the game was DiBiase's boring fever. With Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although the Visionaires were the first team to survive all its members (and only the second since '87 to have four survivors), this game was not a squash. It was the longest game of the night, and Jake did a repeat of his '88 show when he was left alone and dominated. I think he could actually have gone wrong. These days the game would have been the other way round. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest SS games was also one of the most surprising. Perhaps the most underrated wrestler ever, Tito Santana is the inspirational wrestler of the night, war paint and Boris Zukhov, Tanaka, and even the Warlord in the last survival game. It was so strange to see that he was so overwhelming, and then went straight back to his mediocre career. Sgt. Slaughter also did well to get rid of Volkoff and the Bushwhackers, but it was just not a surprise. Tito was. <br /> <br /> I think the only point of the survival match was to win Hogan and the Warrior at the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and the games were also short. The Undertaker's debut was cool, but Tito Santana is why I will remember this one.
