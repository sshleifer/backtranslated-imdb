What was it supposed to be? A remake of Fisher King? Why do we care about Sandler's character? What a slow, brave, boring, what-give-a-damn-over-this-people movie !!! Just painful to go through, I switched it off before it was over. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; As I said, can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character function in its daily life? We are not supposed to think so deeply, I think. Why does Cheadle Sandler give a chance to make him violent? If they were such good friends, how did they go apart? If Cheadle is so in control, why does he seek the advice of shrinking on the street? We are never told. That's why Fisher King is a better movie at so many levels and why it just struggles. Almost 8 out of 10 average score? I do not agree. Some Sins. Even the best movies are happy to get such a high average score, and this crap doesn't have to be with them in the same universe.
