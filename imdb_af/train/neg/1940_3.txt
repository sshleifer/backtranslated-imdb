The writing of the journalists and the required opposite, reckless press officer and sneaky grandmother were ham-fisted and clich√© driven. <br /> <br /> I can't blame the actors, but surely someone should have said, "Are you kidding, I can't say it!" <br /> <br /> This episode has a perspective and police perspective, while the police perspective was standard enough, the perspective and characterization were exaggeratedly over-emphasized and insensitive to points at points. <br /> <br /> I see it was a HBO co-production. If so, perhaps the sledge hammer stereotypes may be explained in the light. <br /> <br /> I was totally in the press conference scene. It had no credibility and did not call remotely. 40 minutes in the first episode and I'm still waiting for the tension. <br /> <br /> Skip Five Daysthis. The 2008/9 production with these characters is much better and more exciting, even if the crime is over. <br /> <br /> This story has unforgettable moments that can only be described as surprisingly amazing. <br /> For a press officer to start a press conference without an investigating officer present to take press questions. <br /> <br /> It felt so incredible like an amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Then I started looking for journalists called "Scoop" and Perry White to make an appearance. <br /> <br /> I saw the 2009 hunter before "five days" made it to Australia, didn't realize it was a prequel and looked forward to Bonneville and McTeer going around again. <br /> <br /> Head shaking scary.
