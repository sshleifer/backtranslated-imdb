Watching this movie is to eat a meal of nothing but meringue. Initially, it looks good, but ultimately does NOT give any satisfaction - nothing. <br /> <br /> The plot is a confused mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So how about this basic plot AND Robin Williams that the movie still gets so bad? That's because the picture looks completely without substance - just like the terrible Popeye picture Williams did at the beginning of his film career. The film cost a fortune, but perhaps there was not enough money left to acquire the graduates of graduate school. <br /> <br /> The movie is one indecent joke going on and off. I'm really not sure why it was made in the first place - it's certainly not made to provide any kind of entertainment.
