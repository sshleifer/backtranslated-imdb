I have never been impressed by JD, and Final Justice (which I did not see before his MST3k aviation) seems to be no exception. It's not that the character is less equivalent to Mitchell. It's just that there is less that Geronimo ('Call me' Heronimo ') doesn't like. <br /> <br /> In fact, one suspects that Mitchell and Final Justice were all. schemes from a revenge-seeking agent of Joe Don are trying to get the star killed by causing a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Joe Don must have found a new agent, as he is now a comic relief in James Bond movies. The problem is that it's difficult to tell the difference between his comedy characters there and his "serious" characters in his action movies like that. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot. - What plot? They repeated the same pieces so repeatedly that you would think you watched Groundhog's day. 2. Presumably the fact that they are using the same scene of Geronimo to get out of jail is supposed to be similar relief. Ummm, yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the Malta scenery is pretty beautiful, so it kicked me to a 2. licking Maltese tourism again for a few decades.
