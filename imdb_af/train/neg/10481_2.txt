The movie was badly cast, except for famous old Hollywood names. Other performances by unknown names (ie Jennifer Gabrielle) are uninspiring. I have seen other films by this director, unfortunately it is one of his worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the script? <br /> <br /> In a positive note, Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita's performance saved the film of oblivion. However, I enjoyed Pat more in Karate Kid, though. There are many good movies to watch, and in short, this one is not one of them. Save your money and the celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
