I'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a movie Richard Donner masterfully performed. I'm also not alone in the scrum of Richard Lester's Superman 2. This brings us to the Richard Donner section of the same movie. Unfortunately, it's still an absolute horror. <br /> <br /> Superman's world is one where the suspension of It's unbelief in strong doses, but Superman 2 extends things too far. No matter who directed Superman 2, the scripture insults the intelligence of a first degree. In a sense, there is no plot, because the characters have zero motivation to the way they do it, as opposed to the original superman. With or without his powers, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) is handled in the least credible way. There is too much to criticize, so I won't bother. I condemn this movie ... Maybe the slapstick in the Lester version is more suited to the moronic script on which this movie is based. Super-Duper bad.
