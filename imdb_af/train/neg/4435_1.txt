God, I haven't seen a movie for a long time. Maybe not since 'The New Guy' or several Freddie Prinze Jr. movies not. Yes, it is incredibly terrible. Mira Sorvino's empty and woodwork must be inspired by Freddie. The movie station was uncomfortable (like a play, and the feeling of childbirth doesn't work well on film). The actors had no idea what they did, especially Sorvino. Her accent was terrible and her sex appeal didn't exist here, so it was painful to mislead her other characters and beat them. And what was the appearance of a lively audience in grass chairs? Nonsense! I had to turn off the DVD player, it would be a pain to complete this movie.
