it might be a good movie if it looked more interesting than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if it was the meaning of the movie ... it's pretty predictable not to mention that the two girls like the Russian group tatu does not look. ..coincidence? I do not think so. There is nothing original in this movie to support it, so they should use something that is already known. You know the recipe. The other actors ... well, I just don't know what their role should be. Most of them are well-known people in Romania, and I have to mention that some are not even actors (eg, Mihaela Radulescu). So to sum it up: "girl band tatty" + desperate / publicity that "actors" need + a non-existent plot + the opportunity to use bad language to shock. Love is sick ... bad ... The idea was good, though ... and I'm serious about the comments of the title ...
