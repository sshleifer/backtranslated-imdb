All I can really say is that I'm happy to knit socks while watching the movie, or I'll be very angry because I wasted 2 hours of my life. The acting was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were a few scenes meant to be serious about my husband and I laughed out loud. I recommend this movie to people who would like to use their own version of MST3K.
