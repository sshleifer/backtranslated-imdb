Can anyone, except Pixar, do good CGI movies? I mean really, the animation has outdated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they have already spent their budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their reasoning, the story really sucked. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - rinsed in a toilet. Yes I know, looks stereotypical. But then the sewage aimed at London - to some extent. Make a promise of jewelry (????) and an evil (?) Frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment. <br /> <br /> I want to say something that entertained me. Maybe the connection is in the movie? Or maybe the happy-ever-to-rat ratio. But nothing has. It had the talent, but it blew up. D
