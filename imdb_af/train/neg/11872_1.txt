The only way this is a family drama is if parents misinterpret everything with the message. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They feed a deer for a year and then kill it to eat their food after killing his mother and initially pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions. They blame trees and deer for "misbehavior" by eating while not taking responsibility to use adequate locks and fences, or even to shoot instead of twice animals and leave them asleep.
