Bah. I thought it was strange that their old book was made on curses using a general font font instead of handwritten. The acting is sometimes so apathetic and so dramatic. Why would a "demonico" kill the two suspects who helped him to make him immortal? Just for the shit? And is it really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle when she's out somewhere. We get it! You've spent some money renting a third-point cross missile. That doesn't mean you have to show up all the time! The "Faith's" lair looks like an old school Battlestar Galactica that changes with a few last minutes. There is a scene where we were introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before being murdered without any clear reason. Everyone is a discarded character. Forgetful characters and an even more memorable plot make this one of the most thoughtless movies I've seen coming out of the SciFi channel. Stay away unless you are in bad movies.
