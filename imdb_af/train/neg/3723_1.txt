The sects that make use of this film are known for claiming the "message" of the Bible without any change or biblical influence. The existence of this film is merely due to the fact that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what the reborn branch of Christianity was forging in the seventies, just look at the word 'rapture' in a dictionary of cults and sects. It's faster than putting this celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> Poorly acting, unequal sound quality and a script that can just as easily be written by Jack T Chick (paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those not familiar with the Gospel scene). You can't really put it in the 'so bad' good category, so its only audience is either those with a pamphlet collection looking out or the extremely paranoid.
