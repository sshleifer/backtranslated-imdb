The Broadway musical, "A Chorus Line," is probably the best musical in the theater. It's about the experiences of people living for dance; the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make. Every dancer auditioned for parts in a Broadway chorus, but what comes from each of them is stories of how their lives led them to find dance as a break. <br /> <br /> However, the movie version does not like the passion or beauty of the stage performance and is probably the worst movie adaptation of a Broadway musical, because it is lifeless and without love for dance at all. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was made to give the director's work to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose guidance only offered the right touch and pacing for "Gandhi". Why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a reasonably limited space? <br /> <br /> What brings us to the next problem. A Chorus Line takes place on stage in a theater with no real sets and limited costume changes. It is the smallest of Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. However, it doesn't translate well into movie, and no one really thought it would. For this reason, the movie had to take us into the lives of these dancers, and had to leave the theater and audition process. The singers offered their songs in other environments and even offered flashbacks to their first ballet, jazz or slap class. Heck, they could have danced Broadway in their lively imagination. Yet, not making a surprise of imagination in making this film, Attenborough's complete indifference to dance and the show itself is evident in his denial. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are quite uncomfortable as the dancers tell their story to the director (Michael Douglas) whether he wants to hear or not. Douglas's character is fickle to choose for whom he has a sympathetic ear, and to whom he has no patience. <br /> <br /> While filmmakers claim to be true to the nature of the play, a few heretics have changed. The very beautiful "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love" - ​​a wonderful stage number that the dancers traced back to their adolescence - has been removed and replaced with the horrible, "Surprise", a song so bad it nominated is for an Oscar. Surprise to injury, "Surprise" just remembers the same story as "Hello, Love", but without the white or pathos. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie unless you want a lesson in NOT to do when you transfer a Broadway movie to movie. If you want to see a movie version of this show, Bob Fosse's brilliant "All That Jazz" is the next closest thing. While Fosse's daughter is in "a Chorus Line," he is the Fosse who should have been involved as director. He would have known what to do with this material, which deserves much more respect than this sad effort.
