Is there a book entitled 'How to make a movie with every' Man vs Nature 'Clich√© Imaginable'? If not, ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on lethal insects. Mane does not have a pinch of originality found at any point in his 100 minute time. I think the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched out the film after 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-quarters, the dead scenes and the way the ants are presented, have been done before any number of times? and in most cases, much better. It's amazing that so many of these insects were made on a Rampage movie in the 70's because they're all basically the same movie. <br /> <br /> And can someone please tell me what in God's name Myrna Loy does in this monkey-bell of a movie? A woman who was talented and stylish like Loy earned better than Ants as one of her final films.
