This movie fails to present something new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross-cultural love story shown by politics in the mid-20th century / before WWII. The British and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true Indians are good. Certainly such clich√© images of the British are quite over. <br /> <br /> Apart from the drama that burns the second part of the movie, the story is predictable, the play is pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the ruling obvious and unthinkable. <br /> <br /> The story really had to be dropped and would certainly have benefited with half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narration more depth and give the viewer something to take some investment. . <br /> <br /> All in all, rather uninspiring. Oh, and Linus Roache just can't do tragedy - cross-eyed with emotional pain just doesn't work for me!
