First, to get rid of my own personal feelings, let me first say that I hate the so-called comedies where every character is written and played as if it's so stupid that you're rocking if it is the result of inbreeding. /> <br /> Now I will say that I have seen the first three American Pie movies and while they were not the most wonderful movies I have ever seen, they have everything good (and straight masterpieces compared to the three American Pie Presents "movies", I still feel compelled to ask what the hell they thought when they made this movie. <br /> <br /> I also have a few other questions. <br /> <br / > Who thinks it was an acceptable use of studio funds and means of production? <br /> <br /> Who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)? <br /> <br / > And lastly, why did anyone think it was deserving to be released in theaters, where the average cost of admission is between $ 10 and $ 15, depending on where you live when going straight to the Blockbuster or Wal Mart? br /> <br /> There is so much error with this movie that I can't write a very comprehensive review of it, t this will exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so that I will only touch the biggest things that are wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is generically uninspired and stupid and characters are all so interesting to see how paint is dry for eighty minutes, but the biggest thing I can see wrong with this movie is The Play. <br /> <br /> While most of the movies are talented, it is no longer what is likely to be forgotten in a few years. <br /> <br /> The only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all the time on the screen, knowing his face that says to the viewer: "I know this is not. is funny and I'm wasting my talents, but hey, I'm paying for it so he cares. "He doesn't even try to make jokes (he deserves better than this garbage). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, most of the rest of the movie is terrible, although some of them were really big TV shows in some, Tyrone Savage plays (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) a character that is so unbearable and illegible (there are things he can teach about tropical skin diseases). He wished he would die a slow and painful death on the screen. Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just depends on screen and wastes what talent he has in this movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the next movie in this series is just a soft core storyline storyline so they can get the MPAA and a R rating this movie goes all out with useless nudity vulgarity and meaningful sexual content detract from the X rating (the rating board had to be drunk or on drugs when they judged this film for his rating). <br /> <br /> It is interesting that twenty years ago when Wes Craven submitted a nightmare on Elm Street to the MPAA for a review, they forced him to cut twenty-five seconds of footage (I believe it was part of a dying scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it) to prevent an X rating from being obtained and he has no choice but to do it or the film would not be released < br /> <br /> But this kind of unnecessary offensive trash can get the R rating today because it's all done in the name of comedy. If this movie was a drama or horror movie with this kind of content, there would have been a big stink about the content and that would be the dreaded X rating. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really annoys me is the writing, this movie was written to play out like the wet dream of a twelve-year-old child with a highly overactive sexual imagination, it is very youthful and extraordinarily scratch, almost every display situation that is supposed to move the corpse At this movie, a plot is so telegraph that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and so-called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes , no matter the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels as if this film was written by an incompetent first-year chess in a low-rent movie school writing class. <br /> <br /> The long and short of time is to kill this series before it's stupid. scratchy and offensive, this cake is full of apples.
