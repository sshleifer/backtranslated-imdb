I have a question for those who have thought of this idea. Why? What they thought was making a second movie of this. If memory serves, does Cinderella not end with "They've all lived happily ever?" I'm pretty sure it did, or it was implied. Wait a moment, if they have ever lived happily, how can there be a successor? Unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history, there could be no successor. I mean, they can sing Cinderella for nonsense for two hours, but why? A movie that ends in "happy ever" cannot have a successor; If that does happen, they will never live happy! Something should go wrong that causes problems with the first end! Why? It's not right, it's angry. This is my last word on the matter.
