Well, I'm honest with all the audiences I bought because of Kira's sex scenes, but unfortunately I didn't see much of them. All six scenes were short and haphazard with all the strange and crowny background music, just like any other B movie. It doesn't look much like two people who have sex. There's a little plot at the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa !!! how shocking !!! Why don't we nominate this Oscar award? I can't imagine how bad the movie would look if it's R-rated. (Mine is imported from the UK, rated 18). Conclusion? Put it down and walk away, so you won't end up being a moron like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
