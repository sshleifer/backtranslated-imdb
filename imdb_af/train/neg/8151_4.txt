Leslie Sands's stylized play Deadlock is a poor choice for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, just after their joint success in "All About Eve". After murdering her husband, a maid is visited by her husband's best friend, who leaves him as her husband as soon as others start at home. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors of her early years, is unfortunately unable to elevate this ludicrous material, in which Davis retired in a strange way and confined to the scandalous final. Production and support opportunities are strictly dual; only for Bette Davis finalists. * 1/2 of ****
