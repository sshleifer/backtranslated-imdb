Simply put, the movie is boring. Cliché on cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems the director is uncertain whether a film or a documentary should be made. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, get caught and warn the prince (why?)) And that's why some elements have been added to make the movie more interesting. So a child dies, leading to the "natural" reaction of the father: to advise the person who is indirectly liable for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him, why nobody knows. Some children become suicide terrorists and blow a ship. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. I was not entertained or intellectually challenged. I didn't laugh or cry, I didn't get any understanding, and I wasn't obliged to learn more or take a case. It didn't matter to me, which in my eyes is the worst thing a movie can say.
