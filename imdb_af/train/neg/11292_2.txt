Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells are looking for the sunken treasure in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The treasure hunters led by Wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute strings on their hungry faces. Wild and his cheerful men need to get a way to get themselves out of the menu so they can start excavating an old Spanish gold-plated gallery. <br /> <br /> After the crew engages in a little eternity of push, argue, and listen to Wilde's annoying health tips, 5 crazy prisoners control the boat and complicate things. Now it is a battle of mind about who gets the treasure and who gets to see how the inside of a shark's stomach looks. <br /> <br /> At least Wild is in the form of exactly the same thing he wore. 'The Naked Prey' 10 years ago and he was in excellent condition. <br /> <br /> Made on a 75 cents budget.
