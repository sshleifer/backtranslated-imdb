Seriously. I just wrapped up my first viewing of Demonicus and words failed me. <br /> <br /> I remember a time when I would see Charles Band's name on a movie and race my heart. He was never a West Craven or a John Carpenter. He was a bastion of hope for the little man. The man whose movies came to the video store instead of the multiplex, but they still blew harder than most of the latest junk we had to endure. <br /> <br /> Now ... this. <br /> <br /> A painfully obvious California walking path doubles for "the Alps" and an abandoned railway seat is actually supposed to be an ancient cave. I mean, they didn't even try to tackle the thing with moss or film in a way that indicates it's something other than an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a creepy demon gladiator, as the cover implies, we are treated to a man wearing the latest in Wal-Mart Halloween clothes. There is a nice, cool look that occasionally comes to life to bend and wrap his fingers, but he does not even learn until the last five minutes. Why can't he be the villain? Instead, we have frat son Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such a triad. I love movies that are so bad they are good. Hell, I sometimes enjoy a movie that's so bad, it's just bad. However, this one is just infallible. A perfect example of making a buck, rather than a quality movie.
