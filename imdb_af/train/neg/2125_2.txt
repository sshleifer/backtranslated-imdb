If I hadn't been forced to see it for work reasons, I would never pass it by for the first 10 minutes. And even then, I admit that I was quickly transferred through parts. The '63 movie version was in all respects much better. Yes, I read this one is more faithful to the original play, but what a wise thing it was for the author to change the writing in '63! It's been dragging over, the songs in this version and not the movie version are boring and imaginative. The version of "Kids" in the '63 version was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor. In this version, the Kim is too old, the Conrad is * totally awful * to see (when someone pulled his shirt off him, I closed in horror ... the director of this version has no idea how sexy it is. ). This Conrad can't dance, can't sing (he can't even stay in harmony) and is just repulsive. If Elvis Presley had been so real, his career would be over before it started. As for the other actors, I kept waiting for Alexander's toupee to fall off while he was dancing and Daly was completely over as Momma. See Stapleton's performance in the movie version to perform the same role properly by someone who understands comic timing. This TV version is nothing but a total waste of anyone's time.
