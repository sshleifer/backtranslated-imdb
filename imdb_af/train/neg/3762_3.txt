I have this movie from Blockbuster in one of those shelves where you can get like 5 movies for $ 20. I have to say I have my money's worth on this one. I expected terrible dialogue, crappy monsters, and shaky cameras. Well, like Meatloaf said, two outta three are not bad. <br /> <br /> The play is bad, but not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I watched so many low-budget movies, I recently lost perspective. There are a few pieces where the play is horribly horrible, but mostly it is at least high school level. <br /> <br /> The CG for the Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man would have been better off. Clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better. <br /> <br /> So you can ask why I call the CG the second worst part. This is because the worst part of the movie is the sound effects. They are hard, irritating and constant. I camped, I know which insects sound in the bush at night, and while they can be hard, they are not deafening like the cacophony in this movie. Usually, if the "background" sounds drown out the movie's dialogue, it's a bad thing, but what I've caught from this movie's dialogue, I didn't miss much. <br /> <br /> The action was irregular and boring. The tension was non-existent, just like any empathy with the characters. Talking to the characters, they were all cookie cutters and blends. The only frivolous addiction was between ... actually I can't think of anything. There was a line or two that made me smile, but it was about it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was decent, a step or two that you would normally see in a movie. However, it still had the "home movie" quality that you get with movies on business change and prayer. <br /> <br /> If you're like me and get a kick from the budget of the budget genre, and you see this one in the dollar bucket, think about grabbing it. Otherwise, stay away at all costs.
