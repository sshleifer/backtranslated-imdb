Disney hasn't yet met a movie. It can't make at least two successors. And this one was no exception to the people in Disney giving a bad story to receive a quick reward. Somehow, though I didn't pay to see it, I was looking cheap by looking at it. <br /> <br /> Ariel is now big and has a daughter. Yet, the daughter does not allow to go into the sea because of an unintended threat made by the sister of the deceased's witch. So here we go again. <br /> <br /> Of course, the girl is attracted and helps the witch. After a non-glorious struggle, she is defeated and mermaids and people live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to see here. Go back to your life. "D"
