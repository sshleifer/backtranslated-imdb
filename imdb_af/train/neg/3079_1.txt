My favorite quote from Crow was when the car was off the cliff: "The movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out!" <br /> <br /> It had to be the funniest movie I've ever seen. It was seriously out there to scare you, which made it even harder! If it wasn't for Mystery Science Theater, I wouldn't be here today! :-P
