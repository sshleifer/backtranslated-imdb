This movie is a bit more than fake fetish porn, and it says a lot about the similar shit made in that era. It was recommended by my friend as a "unique movie experience." He was right. I think he meant it as a joke. Not disgusting, not even so shocking. Only mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock. A little camp value, although I do not believe the creators of this movie intended it. And yes, as a previous reviewer mentioned, it's sex with a guy in a bear suit. Don't spend much money on this. Try to borrow it if you need to see it. Or contact me, I would like to sell you my half price copy. <br /> <br /> I may have to see one of these specific director films as he seems to have a certain next one. But if that is the case, I will regret my life for another two hours.
