This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic, Romantic on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> The story line is more or less the same, but is contemporary. Govinda plays a sharp witted man who replaces the man on the journey. While Rani plays the woman's college friend, she does the same favor. They are apparently trying to catch each other while the real man and woman are trying to travel in Bombay. <br /> <br /> On the trip, Govinda misses another girl for Sanjiv's wife and spies on her in love with the overwhelming Rani. <br /> <br /> Liver plays a dual role of father and son, both lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They are annoyed against each other for the fighting couple. <br /> <br /> It's a poor attempt to copy the original classics and the songs are pretty awful. The comedy is a stick stick and won't make one laugh too much.
