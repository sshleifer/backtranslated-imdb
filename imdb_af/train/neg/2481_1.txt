I've never heard of Larry Fessenden, but by trying this in writing and directing, he must keep his day as a traveling actor. Like many others here, I don't know how to categorize this movie, it wasn't scary or creepy, so it can't be called a horror, the plot was so thin, it can't be a drama, there was no tension, so it can't be a thrill, it's just a bad movie you just have to see if you were a fan of the Blair gate project. People who like this movie use words such as "ambiguity" and complex and subtle, but they read in something that wasn't there. Like the Blair witch, people were frightened because people assumed they should be scared and bought in a guff that was scary. This movie actually started well with the family who met the locals after they hit a deer. It seems to be a modern day liberation, but the next 45 minutes (more than half of the film) didn't happen. The family potted over their holiday home. It was very nice and dandy, but not the least fun. It was clear that the residents would somehow be involved, but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build a movie. Finally, when something happens, it is not even clear how the father was shot, how he died, (the nurse said his liver is just grazed) and the whole wendigo spirit shows it in a very clumsy way with 3rd degree special effects. The movie is called Wendigo, but it is not attempted to explain it in a clear way. The movie ends with all the confusion and makes you very dissatisfied. I would have to break out by 15 minutes, but I wanted to see if this movie could leave. It didn't.
