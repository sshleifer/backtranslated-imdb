Platoon is on the Vietnam War, as Rocky IV is for heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so excessive, it's laughing. While most or all of the events in Platoon took place over the 10+ year team of US military involvement in Vietnam, these things indicate what happens to a small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks). a terrible skewed picture of the war. In Platoon the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: American soldiers killing civilians, American soldiers raping civilians, an American sergeant killing another American sergeant, a US private murderer from an American sergeant, US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire, 90% + killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try this movie, the typical experience of an American soldier in Vietnam is a shame. Two Vietnam war movies I would recommend are Our Soldiers (the TRUE story of probably the worst battle for American soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
