In the opening tone of the "Malta Story", Mr. A.Guinness made such an exciting deal with Noel Coward that I expected his first words to be: "Some women have to beat regularly - such as gongs" or such a world that is tired. his dialogue is almost deadly prose and even the Master would have had trouble bringing it to life. The Guinness wanders through the picture as if searching for a focal point and not finding one. And in it lies the deadly weakness of the whole movie. Mr. J.Hawkins also gives up early and ends up giving a Jack Hawkins performance without a gram of individuality. It could be split from any of a dozen British war films. Many of the early fifties that usually appear suspects and do their sktick to very little purpose. The Luftwaffe failed to submit Malta in the submission in much the same way it couldn't bring London on its knees. The courage of the Maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognized by the King and the island granted George Cross. Valuable topic you might think of for a movie, but "Malta Story" doesn't even qualify for the term "worthy" in its most protective sense. It seems like it's suddenly stuck together to reach a deadline, perhaps before the actors want to live.
