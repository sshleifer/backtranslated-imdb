Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he made after 'Crimson Tide' seems to be one step closer to being the worst job. Michael Bay may fall into the same category, but his big, stupid, fraudulent episodes entertain on some primary perverse levels. And like other Hollywood biopies ("De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", for example, to proclaim the lives of predictive, overestimated, or shallow levels that gave an aura of "mysticism" through a society) on the juicy behind-the-scenes details, "Domino" is a movie that starts with little potential, and dashes that are infinitely ahead of the sixty-minute point, with an already alienated 128-minute running time, the movie feels twice as long and spend time with characters unnecessarily superficial and forgetful (unlike the superior rules of attraction, attempts to irony the proceedings by solving Domino's smack, self-conscious-rich-girl voice over Just pay attention to the movie's sledge hammer flawlessness) becomes an act that only masochists can find. appearance) is sick of the vl Acquire the rich and famous in Los Angeles, featuring gruff bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting trade; Along the way, there are double crosses, shootings, media attention (thanks to Christopher Walken, in his trademark sleazebag), and nice tips on novels. Scott cuts the film into segments that rarely last longer than a few seconds and swap the resolution to make the movie a neon-soaked nightmare that is actually unpleasant to watch - if Scott had an opportunity to create an image shake, or twist it in some way, he will do it; but all this solid stylistic overload overshoots what small plot, characterization and tension the movie has (to say nothing about its, ehm, "entertainment" value). Most characters come off as either despicable or stereotypical, often both (note the unbearable segment of a few minutes, where an African American launches a new list of racial categorization on "Jerry Springer") and I wanted they will all get to the end of our protagonist's coin at the end. "Domino" is utter, unobstructed trash - whatever interest in this individual was. Scott was hoping to inspire in his audience. It is a few minutes in a sea of ​​migraine-invading neon pretense.
