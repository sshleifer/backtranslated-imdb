OK ..... This is the third in the carnosaur series. Let's star with the dinosaur dolls! In the beginning of the movie you can't see the Dino's cause when the body setting starts. You can only see the Dino's eye vision, pretty clever to hide the bad dolls! And maybe in 16 minutes ahead on the film a special power team with Scott Valentine as leader Rance, walks the team in the warehouse and then begins to find their body parts and deadly body to the Dino rampage, after a while comes a big box fails on the team and you can hear a velociraptor screaming, pretty creepy !!! and then a black girl goes ahead and now one blooper is found! It appears a bird of prey and hits her face, but when you break when the raptor comes, you can see it's just a man with a puppet! WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorists' attacks, a truck, caused them to be. There were some weapons in it. 2. They're dead if it's wrong, and it's ten tons of raptor and one giant t-Rex. How did the t-Rex fit in there ??? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Unfortunately, some blind girls told him he was alive. (4) Holy raptors the raptors have wheels on their feats! 5. The dinos are now on a boat in the Pacific. 6: Strange, I didn't know the t-Rex had a strange thing on hes's neck? 7. THE END. The movie is good if you want a good laugh.
