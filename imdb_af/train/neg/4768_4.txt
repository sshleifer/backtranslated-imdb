I recently stumbled across nine dead and read the current reviews and thought I could handle an average movie. However, this movie was slightly lower than average but viewable. The script was poorly written and the acting was average for a B-level movie with an outstanding couple. The plot borders that of Saw, teaches people what they did wrong in a situation and tries to appreciate them more, but that's where the comparison ends. Nine dead are trying to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main mistake I found in nine deaths was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashbacks that took place 3 minutes in the film and was completely unnecessary and a completely insufficient end that people will not see, a bad way. To avoid any spoilage, I saw the worst of bad movies and even they didn't do it badly. Decent movie, bad acting and ending ...
