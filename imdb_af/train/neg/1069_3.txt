I watched this movie at the AFI Dallas Festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy drama, but I didn't. These are stars Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, who is married to Molly Parker. All three actors do a good job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity with the third. It all takes place at a multi-family house and it looks great. The film wants to treat his subject as a comedy first and then a drama, and I thought it should be the other way around.
