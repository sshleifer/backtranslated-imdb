I have a few notes on the FIRST POWER, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990 satanic serial killer Yuppie Hell-fest ... <br/> <br /> 1). Lou Diamond Phillips was recently charged with beating his wife and serving time in jail. I just hope he can get Armani jail to go in style with: One of the guilty pleasures of this movie is that his police detective in $ 4500 designer coats, a $ 7300 designer suit and his $ 3500 / dressed in Los Angeles month. bachelor path loft with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) Leading lady Tracey Phillips has beautiful porcelain skin, flowing red hair that always looks style even when mussed, and wonderful breasts that are relieved. in the second half of the film by a designer, his jersey was unhappy over her torso, even when she was willing to be sacrificed to Satan. At least back in the 1970s, our demonic killers pulled out their victims before they left, although something has to be said to leave the imagination a little. By the last 10 minutes of the movie I can think of is what her breasts are likely to look like. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional psychologists living in Los Angeles can afford $ 4 million condos on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles. with a view to Brad Pitt deciding that he was. In fact, the apartment used in this movie looks exactly like the same in David Lynch's MULLHOLLAND DR., Which at least had the good sense of making the apartment a successful movie director. The only professional psychology I found outside of this movie is anyone serving jail sentence. <br /> <br /> 4) I forgot his name, but the villain in this movie is wonderful and she "How is it" Buddy Boy? "line can be the best overtook movie phrase since" THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE, LADY !! "From CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> 5) Among large metropolitan cities, there are huge barrels of acid that struggle, which will explode into large fireballs if someone throws a light Zippo lighter into them. large public waterworks plants all No smoking signs have plastered all over them, although the idea of ​​smoking water is dangerous, is of course ominous, and since Zippo lighters must be filled manually with lighter liquid that can often leak and be absorbed by the clothes, the idea of ​​a portable one in the pocket of your $ 7300 Gucci lace suit seems to be much more dangerous. <br /> <br /> 6) The stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least, and one of The fun thing to look out for is that you keep yourself from not having computer-aided special see effects, but the real stuntpeople who dare life and limb to contribute to a movie that received almost universal BOMB ratings from critics when released. <br /> <br /> 7) Movie satanists always amaze me: Here is a man who, in a certain Luciferian bid, used force, yet instead of using it something useful, like making himself make or make models to engage in free form sex with him. Rather, he has business ladies and lets them live outside of people's apartments. Speaking of a man indestructible here can fly, and can sit inside of other people's bodies - yet he forced star Lou Diamond Phillips with a common fist fight in the film's conclusion, but did not have the good sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to ensure he wins. <br /> <br /> And over and over ... Looking at the company of sensible friends while consuming beer. You will have fun as long as you refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
