<br /> <br /> Although the main actress is STRICTLY beautiful, the plot is not a chance to be accepted, because too many distracting details see the audience during the unfolding of the story. <br /> <br /> One might think middle-aged teenage girls in the 1950s easily donated their virginity without thinking of the marriage to 30-year-olds they hardly know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> One can believe that young high school teenagers are highly confident and confident as they interact with complex social situations with their older people, but my experience is more often than not that teenagers feel very uncomfortable and clumsy feel when they are experimenting in the adult world. <br /> <br /> One can believe that an experienced medical doctor would not know the sharp or of Stroptomycin - the smelly fermenting by-product of busy earth microbes - and don't notice some lifeless flower powder is fake, but I don't . br /> <br /> One can believe that 30-something-old wedding-makers can come in and go inside, a public school hall at a school social and make problems, but I think school socialists are traditionally a protected environment and parents, chaparone and school staff will be there to prevent it. <br /> <br /> One final nit, right across Hey Babu Riba, called the five teenage friends themselves as the foursome. There is probably an explanation why the FIVE was the VIERSome, but because it is never detailed, every reference derives from each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie didn't come true for me.
