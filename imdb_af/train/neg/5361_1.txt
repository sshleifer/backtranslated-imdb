See this movie when it only came out in the 1970s and hated, hated, hated! Easily the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. Don't know where Leigh got his inspiration, but it's one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to help them open and communicate their mouths. The title says it all because there are no savings in this movie, just long, long silences with people who are unable to articulate what they are supposed to. If you want to see something that will drive you to drink, then this is the one for you. If you can do nothing better for two hours, then put a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more enjoyable than you will get! Yes, Leigh came a lot later in the course of his career, but gave this one a miss.
