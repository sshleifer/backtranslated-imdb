I was recorded on this movie, curious to see how they adapted Hubert Shelby's brutal novel. I thought a literary piece of such depth, with rich tapestry characters, critical situations and social criticism, could not translate into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is a horrible movie experience, not for its content, but for its form. Director Ulrich Edel, in my sincere opinion, does a terrible legal work that does not justify the original book. No wonder Edel is a TV director; This movie looks and feels like a bad "made for TV" movie. Some of my views on this bomb (** spoilers before **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of case creativity. The screens are slow, slow to feel, look poorly shot, and barely move from anchored position. The only freedom they take is in the film area, with a nice dark tone. Other than that, the movie has the same technical creativity as a TV soap. <br /> <br /> - All the actors do a great job of portraying these unlucky characters. The problem is that the adaptation does not address a basic element in the development of the plot: MOTIVATION. All these characters move like robots, without a clear motivation for their actions. They look like blue things, like robots, for no reason. Edel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the character's motivation, and avoiding developing every character's personality to its fullest. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is blatant on Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight plays a good job of playing this tragic prostitute, but her alcohol-induced decision to violate the sailors is not explained. It looks very silly as we see this character from the blue. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The movie also has many secondary, token characters who do nothing, feel nothing and add nothing to the plot. I'd love to hear more about Harry's wife, and the interaction between the two. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel only approaches character development with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover, to only screw it to the end, and not clearly explain his motivation. The thugs are also joking in their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst things I've ever experienced. Terrible work by Mark Knopfler. I expected more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his work in this movie was seriously lacking. Sometimes, as in the struggle between the union workers and the police, the music looks completely separate from the movie. It also feels completely poor and anachronical; I can swear the entire soundtrack is made with a Casio toy keyboard. This results from actual action. <br /> <br /> - The book adaptation by Desmond Nakano is so literally that the point of the story is eliminated. They seem to have tried so hard to keep the action action story in the book, they forgot to actually develop the characters and explain their actions and motivation again. <br /> <br /> I'm serious Can't recommend this movie, not even a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. It's a very uninspired effort to customize the novel and show very little creative input.
