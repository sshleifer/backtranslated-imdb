Kris Kristofferson, on his dry peak in the mid-70s, hardly finds himself next to the screen next to La Streisand's humongous ego and discount shop feminism. None of the characters is really. pleasant; I was so happy when Kristofferson's Ferrari went over that hill and crashed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about rock and star stars, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (just about a year and a half after this drink).
