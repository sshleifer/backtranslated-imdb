Tom Wolfe's stunning, brilliant perceived satirical novel of life under the New York snobbery gets a glimpse of it, but is not well served. The movie does not only suffer from the miscarriage of every man Tom Hanks as a rude Yuppie, Kewpie doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis (?!) As the sweetheart of New York's literati. The most serious mistake was in the director's chair. Robert Altman created life in these indifferent characters and made it interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all his visual sophistication, never looked at the nuances of human experience. The resulting film looks good, but looks like the subject of dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if a satire doesn't make the viewer angry, what's the point?
