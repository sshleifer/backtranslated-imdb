Zu Warriors definitely had to be an animated series because it looks like a movie like an old anime on acid. The movie just starts nowhere and people just fly to fight with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something. Whether this princess is a god or an angel is past me, but soon this flying wind comes in bad man and kills her while the man with the razor wings fights another mystical God / Demon / Wizard. The plot line is also not there or very difficult to follow, must be intelligently intelligent to get this movie. The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal appointed by this god to fight the evil fly, princess who kills bad man and soon we have a very heavy choreographed Uwe Boll like a battle scene full of terrible martial arts on a mountain or something. is. Even the visuals are strange that some may say they are beautiful and colorful, but I'm going to say they are vague and sour like (yes, it's a word!). I watched it both baptized and with captions and both were equally bad and difficult to understand .... who am I guessing I didn't understand at all. It felt like I was watching episode 30 of the 1980s anime and completely missed out on how the story started or I started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because I have no idea how this thing started where it went or how it would end, I have been all the time. I can honestly say it was one of the worst movie experiences ever, it was like watching Inu-Yasha at episode 134 drunk ... yes that's right, you don't know what the hell is going on. Don't waste your waste. brain trying to figure it out.
