This movie was not that bad, compared to the first two pursuers of the original. It was directed by Martin Kitrosser on Friday the 13th. The acting is indeed very bad, but the gore and special effects make it interesting. It's one thing I like about Screaming Mad George (make-up movie artist), its effects are so out of the wall and weird that they'll make you look at a bad movie just to find out how crazy they will get. The movie is not really a pity, but there is an extraordinary nasty eyeball spot in the middle that encloses a toy power (what !!!). Mickey Rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about, but needed The money at the moment, possibly? If you like the weirdo 4th installment (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably have this one. I liked it better than the Matrix! Enjoy.
