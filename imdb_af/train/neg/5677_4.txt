"Seed" is torture pornography ... no doubt about it. But strangely, Uwe Boll wrote, produced and directed a more polished film than any other he made in the recent memory. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch a Boll movie, I feel that some pages of the Script must be missed. There are only big gaps in the story and dialogue. Of course nothing makes much sense either. The movies are somewhat surreal in this regard. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Why do the six police arresting police divide seed and go their separate ways when they go to the darkened residence come, unlike real police who enter and clean the house in pairs or three years? Why doesn't the police ever use their radios? How can the bodies decay so quickly, a process that will normally take many months? (I KNOW it is time-lapse photography ... but Seed will never be able to stay on schedule to kill people if he always waited for the previous victim to fall to the point shown.) How's Saad coming wearing bib overalls and a mask while waiting on the doodry instead of typical prison gowns? How can Seed enter a maximum security prison, walk around the cell block, and then run out again without being stopped or even noticed? If nearly 80 people (according to some newspaper articles in the movie) were murdered, why is there only one investigator working on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide to go to Seed at Seed's home, where he was originally arrested and where he killed his victims? (Didn't he think of doing so earlier?) Why did the police detective do it without a backup and even let him know what he was doing and where he was going? <br /> <br /> This is particularly frustrating when Boll goes a long way from making sure we understand why the electric chair is not working properly. He spent several screenshots to set it up when he could spend the other aspects of the movie at least a little more logically. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> In short, the movie serves only as a framework for a variety of scenes (maybe Boll will his "visions" think of a cruel death by disruption, head shots, electrocution, and the skins of living creatures raised for their fur. (The opening fields of animals being laminated were indeed unnecessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The hub is undoubtedly the killgeoning of a middle-aged woman by Seed using a greenhouse. It is clear that much time has been spent on this and it reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", though without the Steely Dan soundtrack. Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Only if you are a devoted fan of the martyrdom or if you are absolutely determined to see an example of torture. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this movie is pretty disgusting and can be sick at points, it's really much more capable than most of Boll's movies. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a movie maker. I can only hope that he goes beyond torture and goes further into the vein of "Post".
