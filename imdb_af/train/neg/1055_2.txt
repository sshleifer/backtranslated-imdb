* Spoiler warning * <br /> <br /> First, I rated this movie 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the movie, failing to make it the psychic drama it could have been. First, she never fights alone. After an initial very strange doubt from her mother (who is not credible if the mother later in the film is so supportive and loving) the rape victim is not alone. <br /> <br /> She is also incredibly naive, always falling into the crew's strange fall. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly nasty. <br /> <br /> The thing I find amazing is that Ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinion. Ethan is very much the leader of the Crew (hey, they even say it) and people seem to think the other guy is a while, but if Ethan changes his mind, he can't just convince one single person in the Crew. that he is right and that his previous friend is wrong. Everyone just hates him ... why ?? The movie does not give any explanation. How did he ever become the leader? <br /> <br /> A funny note is that my girlfriend thought I was watching Beverly Hills when she came in. Two actors from the same successful TV series .... a cheap way to get viewers?
