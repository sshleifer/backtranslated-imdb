If this movie was a comedy, I'd give it a 10. Oh me, where do I start? Put it that way - I've seen a lot of horror movies, but this one makes Troll 2 like a private Ryan, which makes a special saving. It is as if a group of porn movies decided to make a horror movie, change their minds in middle production and decide to do a comedy, then they went back, and then they decided to just hold onto porn. Everything about this movie is simply awful: the musical score (someone shoots the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), the script, the director, the cinematography, the acting. There is simply no word to describe it. Oh wait, yes, there is: Holy $ *!
