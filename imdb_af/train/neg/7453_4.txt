Wonderful actors. <br /> <br /> Lousy script and not too big direction. My biggest problem was that I simply didn't care about any of these people. Not the killer not the victims. The institutions were pretty dead. Dennis Quaid's character was so poorly written, I didn't even mind when the end came. He got his child back. Great story! I wanted my money back.
