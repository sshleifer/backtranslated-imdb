"Mistress of the Craft" Celeste works as an agent for the London branch of Interpol's Bureau 17, which specializes in (I think) occult criminals. She has the Eye of Destiny, good in her hands, dangerous when someone else gets it. <br /> <br /> Bureau 17 captured a California Satanist, Hyde (no relationship with Dr. Jekyll). LAPD detective Lucy Lutz flies to England to bring him back to the US. Lutz is in touch with the former Witchcraft movies, previously played by Stephanie Beaton in Witchcraft 9. In Part 7, Lutz was played by another woman; In 6, Lutz was a man! Lutz's role in 9 wasn't very big, but she's one of the main stars in this one. Although left behind her high heels and short skirts, she still has tops in this one. And this time she has naked and sex scenes. Beaton is pretty attractive in the role. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a number of sex scenes. An anonymous clubmate has a fatal threesome with two vampires, the Satanist and the main vampire get it with a few kinks, Lutz finds an English pel, and Celeste and her boyfriend make love. <br /> <br /> The main recurring character of The Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in this one, although Lutz calls him agent 17, agent Dixon, in a vampire conversation. She also calls her partner Detective Garner (sections 6, 7 and 9), although we didn't hear his end of the conversation. <br /> <br /> A group of vampires led by Raven pushes Hyde out of jail. , because a Walpurgis ritual has something to do with a god called Morsheba (I think). Hyde delivers all its lines in a very flat way, while Raven switches to a camping degree. The battle scenes are terribly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The sound in the movie was fairly poorly recorded, and poorly edited. In addition, some dialogue is lost among leaf music or sirens. Cinematography is also not nice. However, setting up the movie and actually shooting in the UK was a bit of a novelty, at least for this series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good like Celeste; Attractive, surely, but more importantly, she is easily the best actor in the movie (despite the bad tones). I'm quite surprised that her filmography is so small. If there is ever a Witchcraft XIV, and I'll make sure it'll be, they'll have to bring her back, even if it means they'll transport her to California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available alone or in the DVD. collection Hotter than Hell with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated films.
