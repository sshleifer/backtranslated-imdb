Um ... Okay, I think I get the whole shaky camera, gorilla style filming technique, but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie ... This thing was just a complete mess. Bad acting, bad direction, bad story and horrific cinematography. How this garbage disposal was released I will never know, but it has and unfortunately I watched. On the spot in Tennessee by Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd) directing team, Five Across The Eyes, I'm supposed to look at a Blair Witch-type movie, but it's getting short ... Well this nose dives off a cliff. I was really embarrassed by these young women, which I promised promised Hollywood, but ended up in this mishap. The dialogue is ridiculous, and actually worsens when you listen to it. How it is supposed to be a horrible movie is another mystery because there is nothing scary about it, except for the fact that I watched it. Try this one for size. There are 5 of you and 1 of her, do the math and beat her ass ... "The end". Wow made it up to 95 minutes of mental stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free and wanted my money back.
