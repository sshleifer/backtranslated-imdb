I almost called HBO and asked my money back for the month just because they broadcast this movie. I can only look at the movie performance that is running around, "Okay, we have to come up with something like Home Alone. We'll just add a lot of money to the kid, rent cut actors, and oh yes, we'll have it much less make fun! "<br /> <br /> Well, maybe not the last part, but it's basically what you got here. Not even worth seeing if someone else is renting. And as a movie for kids? Forget about it. I won't let my kids see it, not necessarily because of bad jokes, but because I don't want them to say, "What did you think to show us what a piece of garbage, Dad? !?! "
