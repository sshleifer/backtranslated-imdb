Anyone who loved Edward Ormondroyd's two classic novels will be disappointed in this movie. All the magic and romance has been modernized from its original story of a girl doing a good deed to a mysterious old lady and in return giving 'three'. Three what? Not three wishes, but three in the 1800's on a naughty lift ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time at the Top. The second is all in good time.
