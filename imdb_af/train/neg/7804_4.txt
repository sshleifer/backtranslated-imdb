The TEMP (1993) hasn't done much theater industry, but here's the direct-to-video rip-off you don't want! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new woman at Millennium Investments, a high-level brokerage firm, who receives tips from the wide-eyed secretary Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre seems to be an ambitious daddy's girl who won't stop moving the corporate ladder, including a top broker she can't stand and murder someone who gets on her bad side. She cuts skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to cause trouble with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills while she appears to be responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to help her to obscure money from the company. <br /> <Harris and Kelley perform well, the supporting wheel is good and it is pretty good together, but it doesn't fully compensate for a roadmap that leaves a good road and offers few surprises.
