Here we have a movie that pretty much fails every way it is possible for a movie to fail. Terrifying script, mean acting, amateurish directing, laughable special effects ... it's just a horrible movie. Not to mention the fact that when you come to the end you will realize that the whole thing doesn't make sense. After the whole movie wondered what is going on in the world when things are finally explained, you realize that the story is built on a foundation that is ridiculously impossible. In one of these horrible "villains explaining the whole movie" we tell us that our villain has done something that simply cannot be done and which makes absolutely no sense. Oh, and then we see that there is also some sort of jell-o-sample involved. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would like to pretend that this movie never happened. If you're ever tempted to look at this movie for some wicked reason, I may suggest that you hit a wall for 104 minutes. It will be a much more enjoyable experience than sitting through this garbage.
