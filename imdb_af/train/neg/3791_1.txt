I can't vote on this because I won't waste these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I feel it is my civil duty to help people stay away from this trash. Go to the forums on this movie and read where popular members are trying to act as they watch the movie for the first time. One man even responds to himself ... with the same name! There are shills in the forum that say it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not even close. If it's the company's 2nd movie, it should be better than the first. This means that the 3rd film should be much better. Not so, I've seen it. All I want to know is how you spread this garbage with the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie this weekend is good ... but don't try to market that garbage on the market!
