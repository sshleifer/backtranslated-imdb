When I list the absolute worst movies I've ever seen, this movie is always on it. It has no redeeming properties at all. It took an act of wanting to sit through the whole thing, and I would rather waste my own blood than to put it through again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? Let me tell you the story of my trip to see it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to a midnight show on Saturday night. I was the only one in the theater, and a bunch of hard-witted, rather irreconcilable teenagers, who sat behind me. Of course, they were having a good night on a Saturday night, and came to this "comedy" for a couple of laughs. Before the movie began, they laughed and chatted during the previews and commented aloud with a great old age. It was irritating; If they continued their unbridled enthusiasm in the real movie, I could have said something, but I was tolerant and empathetic of their enthusiastic fun, so I let it go. And they settled down when the movie started. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling it all? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" by the effect it had not only on myself but on this rough bunch. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, not one person laughed at the theater. Not once. Not me, not the boyish ones. Absolute silence, apart from the soundtrack. And when the film was over and the lights were on, we all, all of us, filmed slowly into the theater in slow, gloomy, absolute silence. It could be a funeral. <br /> <br /> This was the effect this "comedy" produced. Not laughing, not enjoying, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing movie, and not the least funny. Preachy, self-sufficient, depressed, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I consider Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles" to be shortlisted for Funniest Movie ever. It still seems that the same gentleman was ever responsible for the very funniest movie ever. <br /> <br /> In short: if you feel too happy, this movie gives a whirl; Otherwise, don't say I didn't warn you.
