Kubrick meets king. It sounded so promising in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the movie came out, and the Kubrick cults have struggled with the King cults ever since. <br /> <br /> The King cultures say Stanley Kubrick has made and destroyed a horror story. The Kubrick cultists don't give a damn about King's story. They talk about Steadicams, the detection of shots, camera angles. It's a movie, they insist: it should be considered on their own. As it happens, both camps are correct. Unfortunately. Considering it purely as an adaptation of King's novel, The Shining is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of flawed narrative gambites. <br /> <br /> I used it on Kubrick's scriptwriter. Author Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) has a reputation as a novelist of social ways. Perhaps she was chosen for her subtle understanding of marital relationships or family dynamics. But the small blue town of Sidewinder, Colorado does not exist on any map in its Francophile universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick the Anglophile found her pleasing. He is, of course, the right author. And on his own merit, his writer considers "The Shining" - with his mishmash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism and implied reincarnation - not just logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I'm willing to consider Kubrick's "Shining" in his own terms. I'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror genre movie. But it does not succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation and madness. Somehow analyzed, the film almost fell apart. <br /> <br /> Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel real? Or are they just in mind - first as former nightmares suffered by Danny Torrance, then as the father's hallucinations? One sees how Jack Torrance is seen with a "ghost" he looks in a mirror. One watches how the hotel 's frozen archery maze appears to symbolize Jack' s cramped, twisting psyche. Very deep things. <br /> <br /> But if the War's "ghosts" are purely manifestations of Jack Torrance's growing madness, then, who puts the captured Jack in exactly the hotel kitchen's dead bolt-on locker? that he can go on his climax ax ration? <br /> <br /> And anyone with a straight face can explain the black-and-white photo (courtesy tagged "1921") of Nicholson as a puff-up party - go out of the left field and into a hotel ballroom wall during the film's last seconds? Do we seriously have to conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness arises from a kind of past experience? (And if you swallow it, since when are reincarnated people to be exactly, physical replicas, their past themselves?) Maybe Kubrick didn't care about his storyline. Maybe just wanted a mind of horror. Anyway, the film tries to entrench its narrative commitments - to have it both ways, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a mess. This movie has not improved with age, and it certainly does not improve with repeated views. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that a few moments of fear, claustrophobia, and general creepiness have been spread all over. , long movie. But those who are repeating the repetitions of Blood, who are repeatedly seen in the small Danny's visions, are absurd and lax. And Jack Torrance's infamous branding lines ("Wendy, I'm at home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") Just point the dramatic tension of the movie and lower its narrative energy. (I know: I've been in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief: "Whew! We shouldn't take these things seriously!) Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea - or totally cynical - during the scenes in which Wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband is trying to purify their son. A porch full of mummified guests, all dead in their party hats? Yikes, now I'm really scared. <br /> <br /> gloss over the years, one can only assume that he has just given the kind of eyeball roll, eyebrow wiggling, scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted. "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, "is best conveyed in silence. <br /> <br /> This movie simply doesn't succeed in it - not as an adaptation, not in its own terms. It probably earns a 3 out of 10, but I give it a 1 because it is so GREATLY overestimated in this forum.
