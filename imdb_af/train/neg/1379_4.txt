Monika Mitchell's showbiz satire laughed a bit and some preconceived violence. I don't want to say with blood; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character actor who has a strikingly adaptable on-screen presence, but he has a terrible record to be chosen for the parts he is going to. There is always a producer's cousin or seemingly trivial reason why he is not given the role he is looking for. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition. Max is obsessed with such thoughts. The rewarding career is just a swing, push and shoot away. Other role players: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and Comeos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, it's show business ... or is it?
