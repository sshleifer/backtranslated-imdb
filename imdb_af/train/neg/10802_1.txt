Let me give a quick summer of the movie: A rotten, rude child named Max bumps into a radio containing Kazam: a rapping genius. Like all geniuses, he gives 3 wishes, but he is also a good grace, and also helps Max with his personal life, as he has to deal with bulls and a father in organized crime. During all this, Kazaam raped from time to time (also showing Shaq's deadly rap skills). <br /> <br /> This movie proves what we all know: Athletes need to keep sport. I admit it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie, but ONLY about this waste of film is terrible. The characters are either unlikely or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialogue is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel played Washington Kazaam, this movie will still be a joke. I know the movie only pulled ANYBODY, because Shaq was so big at that time (no pun intended). I honestly can't think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time. Shaq had the time to use this movie to practice free throwing.
