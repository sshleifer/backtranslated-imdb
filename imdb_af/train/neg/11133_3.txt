Except for the better than average acting skills of the two leaders, this movie is really bad. The cheap production values ​​do not help. Of course, you will not really see that the production values ​​are cheap if they do not try to convince you that they have a production value to start with. Even for a B-movie genre freak like me, this movie really sucks.
