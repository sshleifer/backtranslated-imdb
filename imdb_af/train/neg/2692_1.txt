Nacho Vigalondo is well known in Spain. He's a kind of bad showman who can make you sick ... Very embarrassing. Nacho made some ads on TV, I remember one in which Nacho Paul Mc Carney searched for Madrid (the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like a Nacho's commercial: bad story, bad direction and terrible performances. I can't believe a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho could have made this movie because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman who relates very well to Spanish TV business men.
