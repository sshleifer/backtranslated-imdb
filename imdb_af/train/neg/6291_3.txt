Now, I recently had the hangout to see the hilarious comedy bachelor party, one of my new favorite comedies, laughed until it just hurt some movies. So of course I wanted to see the successor, hoping it would have the same laughter, but instead, Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation was made by the American Pie generation where it is tasteless and defeats the hole goal of the first movie . Yes, the first movie has nudity, but it doesn't show in every scene. Also the plot is exactly the same from the first, it's not always a complaint with me, but it could have been a bit more original. The only thing is that I am glad that at least no old actors from the original appear in this movie, as it would be harvesting or really stupid. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are engaged 2 months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a rich family, but they are pretty happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd, is afraid Ron will take his job. So they go to Miami for a bachelor's party and Todd will make sure he drops Ron into a picture that will change Melinda's mind about marriage. <br /> <br /> 2: The last temptation has a few laughs here and there, but everything fails to deliver what the first movie has achieved. These guys, Ron's friends, were more offensive than nice, except for Seth, he was so funny. The only similar characters, except Seth, are Ron and Melinda, all else coming just about your nerves. Do you want to see this movie? Just look at Girls Gone Wild, it's just the same, it doesn't try to pretend it's a movie. Stay at the original baccalaureus party, it's the movie that will get you in tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
