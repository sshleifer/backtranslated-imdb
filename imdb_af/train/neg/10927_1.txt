Reviews for this movie were at their best lukewarm while expectations were sky-high: a huge budget, tons of popular faces, a funny idea and a major actress who loves everyone. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's so-called humorous journey in the fantasy world fails to entertain the audience in every respect (I have not heard a single laugh throughout the presentation), go through the page-thin story line and one-dimensional characters without a single spark, not a sign of the magic he wanted. The 90 minute movie here is sterile with awkward direction and some good actors do their best to come as professionals in a feature that certainly doesn't look like an idea on the set, let alone paper. 'L'Odysee d'Alice Tremblay' is a collage of comic sketches, linked to a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
