I totally hated the movie. It was so delayed. They need to get some plays. No, wait, it won't help because the Naked Brothers Band slows down. You know why I'm here, even though I'm a Naked Brothers Band hater? To warn people before watching the silly movie, so that the NBB doesn't get the money out of it, they can no longer make amateur silly songs that are so delayed that any old man can write it within 10 seconds. Not only are the songs delayed, they are singing badly. Okay, I love coming out of the movie ... anyway, it was boring and they acted horribly. It was not funny at all, though they tried very hard to be. I think they deserve some credit for this. Well, the movie is not worth it. Just look at his rating. The movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who even has half a brain. Seriously, if you like it, you should watch movies where the actors really do, and not their lines in a monotonous chat. I'm at the drama club at my school and some people are actually better than Nat and Alex. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of doll. I don't even know why I even went through half of that movie. I don't think it deserves even called a movie ...
