John Pressman (Micheal 'I had to call Ditech' Lerner) works as an orderly at a doctor's office. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotized him of the people who saw him thinking he was wrong. But it seems to be a movie in a movie, but the lines soon fade as John is going to make a movie to kill. Ask a man watching the movie to do the same. Lerner is above the top, but Zelda repeatedly repeated the rules of the dialogue. It gets irritating fast. But not as annoying as the two girls watching the movie in a movie. Like a horror movie, it fails, it's too busy, trying to give a message and apparently forget a slasher movie, a sense of tension, or at least a jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of treasure: an art house. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
