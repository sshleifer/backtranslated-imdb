Once in the Indian theater, a movie such as Sholay comes together that changes the way the audience sees a good movie. And only once (hopefully) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own. A standard so low, it can never be broken. Ram Gopal varma manages to make a melting pot of talent and make a dish so old that you can smell it from afar. Taking and sneaking a classic like Sholay is totally unforgivable and I can't believe he has called the movie RGV ki Sholay almost. Although Sholay had many folklore elements in it, the film managed to build on its plot by simply defining the characters so clearly that they lived forever. What Aag does, take these characters and waste them so much, you will need a game to choose the worst. The realism element is completely lacking and what the movie ultimately offers is a bunch of "actors" merged into a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events. One star for this movie is a ridiculous waste of a voice. its time for HSR to wake up to the reality of its failure and create another "plot" that can be categorized under the theater.
