This TV movie tells the story of extrovert Frannie who suddenly returns to Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but unaware of her mother's death. Her sister runs the family home, but intends to sell it and move away with her new husband. Frannie strongly supports the idea and vows to keep the family heirloom as it was, by getting a job and maintaining responsibility. <br /> <br /> Coming in Ruben, the two soon fall in love (like you), and it is from this point that I have a lost interest. <br /> <br /> Farrah Fawcett is more than just the blonde hair and looks, she can portray a character very convincingly when she has her mind and it is definitely proven here, as well as some of her previous efforts like Extremities and Small Sacrificies - a great show from the legendary Charlie's Angel. Silk Hope is the kind of movie that never shoots away from its cheap and cheerful TV image, and you know there was a budget limit, but it's not the worst movie ever made. The positive aspects are there; you just have to find it.
