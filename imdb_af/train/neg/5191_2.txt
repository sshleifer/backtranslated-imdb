Agh, which is dull t shows and pilots merged in the 70's for equally dull t Movies! A few examples would be: Riding With Death (the most hysterical-cheesy of fate), Silence in the Space (confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International (terribly dull and incredibly confusing) and this delightful little Quinn Martin shine. <br /> <br /> Shooting in Hawaii (although you won't know it from the outside), it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show. The real problem is that you don't like most characters, including the deadly main character, Diamond Head, who looked half the sleep for the whole movie; his boss, aunt Maria, who had a very strange delivery of his lines and had white white hair, as well as a brown one that looked like it was snatched up; Diamnd Head's girlfriend / co-agent (hell, I can't even remember her name) A skinny, timid woman with a flat talk that is just not sexy or interesting; and the vocal piano-Zulu (again, I can't remember his character's name) which was not bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane, who sucked as a bad man, but still proved his acting cakes. All the chores that this so-called 'chameleon' used to disguise themselves were just nice. I have absolutely no idea what he has done or is trying to steal from the laboratory that caused him to dress as a South American dictator with American General. I don't care either. The plot was simply not interesting to keep your attention for even ten minutes at a time, let alone the hour and a half or so it continues. Just call this one - Hawaii Five No!
