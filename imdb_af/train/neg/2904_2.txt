If you don't realize in the first 10 minutes of this movie that the main character writing a life advice column will have the tables - oh-so-smart and learn valuable life lessons, then there's probably something wrong with you. The setup is so predictable that it can ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie is good (which it is not) <br /> <br /> There is almost no chemistry between the leaders, and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It's hard to believe that Binoche's character would have any interest in him. Then it's finally so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. Isn't that the great America!
