I expected it to be much better. I love Tim Burton's work, so I was very excited to see these short films. Well, they weren't what I expected at all. <br /> <br /> I don't really know exactly what I am. I think they are just as boring. The sound bothers me and most characters, although I loved Roy the poisonous son and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The Match Girl episode has hurt me the most, but it was quite funny. <br /> <br /> I also don't like the way some characters die. Like how Match Girl basically ignited the petrol station, or how the Girl Who Stares died, in general. Roy's death was surprisingly surprising. Killed by a freshener. Very original ;-) It made me laugh so hard ... <br /> <br /> There are a few things that aren't suitable for kids. Just some language and gore. It's about everything I have to say! 10/03
