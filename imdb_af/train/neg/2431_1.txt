As a Turkish man now living in Sweden, I have to admit that I regularly watch Scandinavian movies. Most if they never understand me. I think Scandinavian actors work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a movie called "The Polish Wedding" with a Polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched. Unfortunately I was wrong this movie "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can perform, not the female so-called star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that no one can believe it. I think the whole thing is a mess from the beginning. very bad acting except from Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
