I gave this movie an increased rating of 2 stars, as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the movie. In this scene, the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "50 Dollars..your Drink and Talk", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could. Therefore, I refused to do so talking about sharing. I was slightly starstruck because it was my first movie experience .... and who knows ... these lines could have ended up there with lines like "I'll be back" and "Fairly honest to me Dear, I don't give a damn ". If I spoke that one line, my name would appear in the credits Rancid Aluminum as "Heavy 1" instead of the name Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> As time goes on, I feel lucky that my name is by no means associated with this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I spent the whole day on the set, in South Wales hotspot Barry Island, no one can tell me what the real storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all agreed that it had a lot of curse and nudity in it ..... things could have been worse if I ended up bald in this scary movie .... <br /> Yet ..... On the positive side .... I talked to Rhys Ifans during a break. I had no idea who he was, as "Notting Hill" had not yet been released, and not an impression he could be Welsh. Made several inappropriate comments on how a terrible pit of Barry Island has become since my childhood in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed that I realized I was in a quality production ........
