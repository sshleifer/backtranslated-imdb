Everything in this movie is bad, the story, the acting, the effects, but it's funny, funny, funny! Scott Valentine with the 10-size army force is so bad with the permanent effort to shoe his face as the leader of a special ops group! The '' terrorists '' are as frightening and realistic as the '' birds of prey ''. It's so nice and bad for everything you try to laugh. The part where the giant T-REX sniffs somehow aboard a ship and is somehow blown down and you see the metal pole standing up, where its head is, is the perfect end. If you're in bad movies, it's the pot of gold, the mona lisa of bb-bad !!!
