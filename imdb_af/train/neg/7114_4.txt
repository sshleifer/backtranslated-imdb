As far as filming is concerned, this movie was pretty good for the mid 50's. There were a few times that the lighting was too hot, but the shots were generally in the frame and remained in focus. The acting was above average for a low budget thinker, but the direction was terrible. Several scenes have been dragged too long in an effort to detect and the effects did not exist. The attack by the skull in the dam had to be completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick packs and strings. I also couldn't help but think the budget didn't allow them to provide the house, so they made referrals to the movers and that all the stuff in the store should be up and running soon. Honestly ... it would have been more fun if it was a worse movie. It wasn't bad enough to be a "good bad" movie, but wasn't good enough to be "good" as well. Get the MST3K version ... it's better.
