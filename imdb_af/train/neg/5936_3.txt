This movie was a disaster from beginning to end. Interspersed with performances by "the next generation of beautiful losers" are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the artists themselves. It leaves little time for the tracks of Leonard Cohen himself, who sits on everyone else in the film with his reign, but gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest is too busy to canonise him as St Leonard or as Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances are forgetful over-interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright's) or mere underperformance. Only Beth Orton and Anthony had some self-control within the striking distance of Leonard's own versions. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled across the film - like from the superimposes of red spheres on many of the concert and interview shots, shaky blurred camera work, using digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen's remarks It is harder to hear what is said) and a haunting, pretentious low drone among many of the maintenance segments (an attempt to add additional gravitas). For the right thing, see the songs from the life of documentaries made by the BBC in 1988.
