Except that people apparently buy in this garbage! As a "Moral Orel" showed, even if you tried to make the most outrageous, exaggerated parody of evangelism you might have imagined, it would not come near the grace of this show. It's hard to tell what even goes on when you look at it. Is it a news program? A talk show? Who knows!? They start reporting on various international news stories, but on seemingly random points, the news is interrupted by this strange, troll-like little man with a forehead larger than his entire face, muttering and laughing and generally creepy. <Br /> <br /> Pat Robertson doesn't even look like a bad guy at first glance. He looks just like a senile but harmless old stocking that sticks to his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who has called for an assassination. He befriended and gave no help, but TWO murderous dictators, who used illegal donation money to feed diamond mines, who supported forced abortions in China and which often imply those Caucasians (especially American American Caucasians in particular) better than any other breed. <br /> <br /> Still, it will all be funny except he believes a large enough support base has his small performance on the air 40 years later (or enough money to get some TV executives to buy that doesn't give a damn what they show). The idiot of the show becomes worrying when you realize that some people have to look somewhere and hang on every word. Even when Robertson repeatedly showed how corrupt he was, people still listen to him. I don't know if it's funny or scary. I think a healthy mix of both.
