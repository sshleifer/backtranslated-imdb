Falling into the movie category of "Too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution sections that need to be taken seriously". While screaming if you know what I did last Friday, the thirteenth or my boyfriend knows they're bad, scarecrows. Angry Death sets such a high standard for the comic horror on a budget genre, those Scarecrows are simply out of place. <br /> <br /> Suspected inexperience is immediately underway, as there are no hints of noise or vibration in the hull and cabin of an aircraft. The repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc, but nothing comes. Although the men are of course the scarecrows, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie is too serious is too serious. I don't remember Joe Bob Briggs ever previewing Scarecrows, but I don't think he'll break down these layers. But with an IMDb score of over 6, there are many people who disagree.
