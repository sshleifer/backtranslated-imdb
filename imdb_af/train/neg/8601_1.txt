Okay, where do we start with this jewel? Mutant snails take over a small town in New England (?). Just one man can stop them ... and that man ... is Mike Brady! Now, if it wasn't enough enough, rest assured. <br /> <br /> The footage of the snails is what is known as stock material. No matter who attacks the snails or where they are, the same hips of snails that are everywhere are shooting. Keep in mind, this simple shot occupies at least half the film. <br /> <br /> The play in the movie was down, dragging out, stealing your wallet, pushing your girlfriend, killing your dog, BAD. I'm sure there's worse, but you're going to be hard pressed to find it. The only jewel was ... you guessed it .... MIKE BRADY! He had to take a few night classes at the YMCA, because he was the best in the bush. <br /> <br /> As for horror? This movie should not be taken seriously. There is no horror! They are snails to cry out loud. The whole rising action could be avoided with a shaker or two. Just look at this movie in an MST3K-type environment, otherwise I can see some great damage to the brain.
