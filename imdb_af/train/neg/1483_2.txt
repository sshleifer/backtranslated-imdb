I just gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several well-known pornstars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, presumably on holiday in Ireland, but actually in Canada, runs a cannibalistic inlaid mutant or something else, and the plot is more or less right out of the hill, and that's wrong. Only problem is, unless I missed, there is only one mutant on the screen, and he's not that impressive. About five years ago, like the scribbled mummy in that homemade movie. Some stingy but stupid death help, but that movie is strictly amateur night and boring. The end is predictable and killed. No pun is meant.
