It must be the most beautiful, twisted holiday movie I've ever slapped, and it says something. I know that Mexican people have some strange ideas about religion and mix ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their day of death is not as scary as they take on Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So.Santa is not a little fat, red-fit alcoholic (look at the rosy cheeks somewhere!). On the contrary, he is a shiny sociopathic pedophile who lives in Heaven (or the heavens, whatever), with a lot of children working harder than the one in Kathy Lee Gifford's sweat trade. They sing cute little traditional songs from their homelands while their clothes are so stereotypical that I was surprised there was not a little African American boy in the black face who sang "Mammy". This Santa is a Peeping Tom pervert who watches and listens to everything everyone does from his 'eye in the sky'. It is so that he can tell who is naughty or beautiful (with the emphasis on those who are naughty, I want to bet) <br /> <br /> There is no Mrs Claus, no elves (what does he need for elves for when he has child labor?) and the reindeer is mechanical wind-up toys! This floating freak show hangs on a cloud, presumably in its silver lining. <br /> <br /> Santa's nemesis is ... the devil? What is it, Santa, our Lord and Savior? Strange. Anyhoo, Satan sends one of his followers, a sharp, fleeting devil named Pitch, to try to screw Christmas. Let me get it straight - the forces of the purest evil are trying to destroy a completely commercial and greedy holiday? Looks like redundant, or not? <br /> <br /> Pitch is completely ineffective. He tries to talk to children to be bad, but doesn't have much luck. I was greatly affected by the story of the holy girl Lupe, whose family is very poor. All she wants is a doll for Christmas, but his parents can't afford to buy her one (they have spent all their money on the cardboard they've built out of their home). So Pitch is trying to encourage her to steal a doll. In fact, this is the only way a girl who would ever get a puppet poor, because it is sacred and prays to God and Santa, does not really work. But Lupe resists temptation and tells Pitch to get you behind her, and so being rewarded by being a doll so discouraged, you just know it's Chucky's sister. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Pitch will get to get Santa. stuck in a tree (uh-huh) from which he was saved by Merlin! Merlin? You gotta joke me! Since when do mythical Druid figures appear in Christmas stories, or does it have anything to do with a Christian religion? And doesn't God reject magic? A few hundred years ago, they burnt Merlin at stake, and didn't ask him to save one of God's Aspects (or that's what I assume Santa should be to go up against Satan). This movie is a long HUH? from start to finish, and it will make you wonder if that eggshell you drank was not nail or something. Probably this was because this movie is like a tall giant DT.
