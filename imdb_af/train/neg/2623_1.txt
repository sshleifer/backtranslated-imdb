Sly Stallone is hardly the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother Frank ... well, those awards roll out now! Mullet haired, muppet Frank seems to think every part he plays calls to do the role of an American / Italian wise refugee from the "Godfather". Please, someone makes him an acting offer "he can refuse!" This movie just stinks out the place, even through the terrible persecution in this, stealing Frank still acting dishonours. All the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms, gesturing in a silent style with silent movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, which is there, does not make sense like a meteoric land and turns all the women into sexually-fussy novelty, but since it is 15 certificate films, it just means they are wearing their underwear and sound like dogs on heat. What ultimately happens is not quite sure, because I have lost the will to finish long before the film. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague and watch 'Deep Impact' for a reasonable movie about a meteor to hit the earth. <br /> <br /> Note point of order: if one of the women's strips leads to her underwear, she has her clothes under her hangers / belt belt, these are clippers over the hangers so women can go to the toilet with less fuss . A trivial point, maybe, but show how stupid this movie is when they can't even get it!
