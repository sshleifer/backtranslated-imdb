It is a rather dull film about a scientist who creates a teleporter device and is terribly disfigured if he uses the machine to transport himself. Simple plot done earlier in the fly and others. Not only is he abused, but he can also electrolyze people with a touch. What is really stupid about this movie is that we are expected to believe the place this man works is against him. He can probably make millions for the institution he is working on, but the head of the institution is trying to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way. In the end, the projected man for no reason had three people, then he went behind those who did wrong him.
