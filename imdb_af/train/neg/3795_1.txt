I really wanted to keep this show. I really did honestly. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers get their own version of "The Bachelor". With the help of his compulsory "hag" Andra, James, has a nice, well-done and thirty something the chance to love with 15 suitors (or "friends" as it is called in the show). The only problem is half of them are straight and James doesn't know. If James picks a gay one, they get a trip to New Zealand, and if he picks a straight one, straight man gets $ 25,000. How can it not be nice? Take my hand, run: <br /> <br /> The clearest problem with this show is the bachelor self. James is your typical young and successful gay man with a nice smile and body, the one you probably give two tins to your local bar before grazing for greener pastures. Why they chose to throw James as the foremost man is outside of me. God knows there are so many other hotter and lively gay men who die out there on TV. <br /> <br /> Apart from his rather average physical appearance, James is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even as such, he has this arrogant, smugly condescending aura about him. However, if James were standing against an empty white wall, he would enter it upright. I honestly can't remember a single interesting or notable thing that James said during the show. He is so boring and forgetful. In fact, one of the friends who was flat, advised him not to have a connection. I thought it was the best part of the show. James also speaks with an extremely annoying lilt. Sounds masculine or sound male, but don't put senses in the middle of sentences ... so painful to go through. I hate him a lot through the whole show I keep thinking. "Please choose a straight man and humble yourself and your unhappy look." <br /> <br /> Then we have the judges. A remarkable mix of men who don't care in one way or another is what happens. Equally foolish it seems as if they do not distinguish one guy from the next, except: "Hey, the man has blond highlights or oh, the one has curly hair." Again, incredibly improperly decisive decisions seem to be the purpose of this show. Although it can be cramped to form roleplaying games, it would have been much more fun to watch this amorphous drone. In all their banality, however, they still succeed in James (which is not so difficult to do anyway), slightly. You know you have a problem if some of the defendants are actually hotter and more interesting than the front man. And the fact that the authors look EVERYTHING like they are more fun than with the leading man? Very sad. <br /> <br /> Also, I just thought Id indicated something on the message boards, which I felt was really true: the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring. In fact, I found some of them very cute. It's just that overall they were just BLAH compared to the men you'd see on shows like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many times I quickly move forward during this show. I can accept a main character that is as interesting as a cardboard box. I can accept the everyday, apathetic suitors, but PLEASE, because the love of God only entertaines me a little. No luck. <br /> <br /> If you expect drama, intrigue, sex or excitement, you'll be VERY disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the writers can have another boyfriend in New York (scandalous!). As titillating as it may be, I guarantee you, this is the only thing that looks like a conflict in any way. <br /> <br /> Certainly there is the twist, but if you have a ghost of Gaydar in you, one can easily distinguish who is (it wasn't hard at all, I was just wrong once) This show saves so many of its slides on the turn that it doesn't deliver anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We see James & Co plowing along such exciting activities, such as learning how to study, buying gifts, visiting a petting zoo, and gay karaoke. To yawn. Sure you sometimes dance topless, but that cares when everyone is boring anyway. This is one of the main problems with the show: No one seems to enjoy themselves - they are just trying to get a good time through the motion. And you can't really blame them, as the events are very unattractive and lame. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical aspect is not there. There is no hug, no caress, no kiss (!), No trouble of any kind. It's just Ok, it was a boring date. I'm going back to my ugly, tough Sydney Opera House, a quick cock on the lips, CYA. " This show is so important. It's ridiculous. I can understand that they don't want to play the striking indiscretionary nature of gay men, but come to the ****. People who watch the reality TV shows are going to seek more than unwilling hugs and chicks. This view refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry if it had flown for a long time, but I felt it was issues that needed to be addressed. I recommend Bravo to first set up a show of this kind, but the surprisingly incompetent way in which this show was handled is indignant. To summarize my three points: Drilling + Drilling + Drilling = going to do something else. You will have more fun at a doctor's office for an appointment, at least they have interesting magazines there.
