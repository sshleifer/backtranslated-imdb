We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character withdrew his fingernails. We weren't despondent - we only went for an hour from this drift and just knew how it felt. To say this movie was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious, it would be to praise it! How did people sit, let alone, by this confusing, slow, depressing pseudo-angle of a film, nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looks as sick as we feel him. What did he think? Oh ... and what was that with those captions? - Did we just have a dud DVD or was the original movie done - sentences hanging in the air? The movie was also difficult to follow. I'm sorry the cast, which apparently did their best with the available material.
