First, sorry that you even give a score of 1 to this movie (nothing less than that available). The film fails in every department whether it is showing, directing, characterizing or acting. <br /> <br /> 1) To start with, the name of the movie is really C-class (although the movie itself is the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to live the character, but the poor writing along with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay, Gabbar Singh rewarded him 50,000 (convincing). Here in Aag, the figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called hero and has only a few men's bicycles to commute (with all automatic guns). To get a Sholay movie in Mumbai make the setup in modern times not convincing 4) As far as Nisha Kothari is concerned, someone should tell her she doesn't know. Why does Ram Gopal Verma turn her back and forth? 5) Mohanlal was good, but there is almost nothing for him to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are good actors are being wasted in the film. 7) Legendry role played by Lila Misra (Mausi or Basanti) in Sholay is being replaced cheaply by some Gangu Mummy in this movie. Ramu please grow and understand that there is some sense in your movie. Enough of silly characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) Do not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru..patternies. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comical translation of original classics. Please do not waste money and time on this movie. I think Monkey Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than seeing this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and unlucky directions. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Saurabh
