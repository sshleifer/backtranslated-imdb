Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save these dead fish from a movie. For the beginning, the writing was definitely written to be made in a B-movie, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to lift himself out of television) and Hutton (looking for the " two "of a one-two punch" He hoped he would define his career as "Ordinary People" attached to the picture. Cheese-like lines, big bad nappies from scene to scene (Come on - who's using nappies after the 12th Grade Telecommunications Class?), And the old bad scene is sinking this movie. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad play this movie is. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material. I have to admit Duchovny's pain as he reads the lines that voice-over. While I laughed myself to laugh when I was sure the director wanted me to be terrified, I didn't prepare for the finish of Duchonvey's voice over: "If you ever need a doctor, you should 911 call. " If only the studio called 911, this dog could never be made of a movie. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
