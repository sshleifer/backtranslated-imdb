The good fellas in Webster's dictionary define Logophobia as the "fear of words". I can only be Logophobic. For no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a movie, the credits contain the words "Produced, written and directed by:", and are followed by a single individual's name. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few jack-of-all trades. Even the most seasoned of directors such as Speilberg and Scorsese seldom take so much control over their films. But there I was, everyone in my theatrical chair, popcorn in hand and over the Order to watch as it flung me like a Nolan Ryan fast ball, the words 'Produced, written and directed by Brian Helgeland'. Whoa! <br /> <br /> As a movie buff, I knew about Brian Helgeland. As a writer, his filmography over the past 10 years as a dotcom company's share price will be graphed in 1998. There were so many theatrical discomforts (Assassins, The Postman, Conspiracy Theory), as there were critical and award-winning successes (LA Confidential, Mystic River). They look like an alternative? One good, one bad, so knowing that his last movie, BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood's career, I breathed and hoped for the best. In retrospect I should not breathe. <br /> <br /> Commander Heath Ledger (Helgeland's A Knights Tale), such as Alex Bernier, a priest in command called the Carolingians, who is summoned to Rome when a fellow priest is murdered under circumstances that the Bow Bishop thinks ?? curious'. Along with Father Thomas (also of the Order and played wonderfully by Still Standings' Mark Addy), they left behind the riddle in the aftermath of the priest's untimely death. <br /> <br /> Complicating issues are a subplot with Mara Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon) who escaped from an institution that resulted from her efforts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings towards Mara and for some reason unknown to the audience, they travel to Rome. <br /> <br /> Nary, sleeping well, going through and Alex is confronted by William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann) claiming to be a centuries-old sinner. A Sin Eater, as we are told, is the one who eats the sins of a dying individual when the church does not, allowing access to Heaven. William, as luck would have it, is tired of healing life and is looking for Alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties. Alex is reluctant, but after the death of his new love, Mara, Alex judges the ritual of the Sinner Ether to save her and the transformation is complete. Alex then looks for answers to his many inquiries, while Father Thomas announces the Vatican plan behind the transfer of authority to his co-investigator. <br /> <br /> The Order is not a terrible movie, but it is terribly boring. There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene - that of Alex entering the dying Mara - is pale and thin and leaves no emotional response to the couple's fate. Everyone looked so quiet and ominous that the film lines and smelling salts could be administered to keep me from getting a quick nap in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> So, Mr. Helgeland, I plead with you not to try it again. Share your vision with others and help those who are more experienced to guide you in directions that aren't as meticulous and self-serving. Until then, there is nothing resulting from the performances that you are able to do anything more than a defective grade. Two stars. <br /> <br />
