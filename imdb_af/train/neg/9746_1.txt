I remember this movie, exhibition in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for a week's time. Although it may look incredible, and I can't explain it, this movie is featured in a theater dedicated to ... movies of great quality (that is, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and ... The projected man). Few people have seen it (happy people, no doubt) and no reference to this very boring SF movie can be found in the Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopedia or about the author of the original novel. Very indicative. I remember, after all these years, a no-story, very special effects that actually look ridiculous and no longer. It appears that the run time in some countries is 90 mm. and at anothers 77 min. Well, that just means a little more pain.
