I hired the dubbed English version of Lensman, hoping it came from well-known novels, it would have some content. While the movie was hinting, it didn't usually rise above the level of the kiddie cartoon. Perhaps the movie is a bad adaptation of the book, or it has lost a lot in the print version. Or maybe the source novels are even lightweight. But for whatever reason, there wasn't much there. <br /> <br /> I saw many details that were distracted, sloppy, poorly dramatized or otherwise flawed. Some examples: The opening styles borrowed from the 2001 star gate scene and the Star Wars image of hiperspace. The robber on the combine looks like an anthropomorphic "R2-D2". <br /> <br /> It starts trying to borrow its comic relief style from Star Wars, but graciously (as the humor doesn't work) gives up on comedy and plays it seriously. In that respect, it is better than the Star Wars franchise, which started with a clever sense of humor, and ultimately deteriorated to Jar Jar's annoying folly. <br /> <br /> Agricultural details are apparently drawn by someone who has never seen a farm. The harvester drove through the untouched center of a field, which placed silage on untouched crops, rather than working from one side to the other and pouring silage on overall rows or in a truck. Wheat (maize) poured out the cereal, but the farmlands were drawn like a wheat field. <br /> <br /> When it was time for Kim's father to see his fate, there was no dramatic weight to the scene. This may be partly the fault of the English-speaking voice factor, but the drawings did not show much weight either. Kim's reactions to that scene were not convincing either. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when a character named Henderson was murdered, Chris showed very little response, even though they had to be close. (Henderson's death is no destroyer; his name is not revealed until his death scene.) She seems to forget him immediately. Someone's expression of sympathy shows more than she does. I think the voting factor earns the most debt in that case; There is at least a hint in Chris's drawings. <br /> <br /> On several occasions crooks fail their orders. A villain leader often punishes the failures with unfortunate deaths. I can't say whether this is being lifted from Star Wars, or if it comes from a previous source - possibly the Lensman books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene where a spaceship crashes. As it goes to the ground, parts of the ship break down. But so many pieces fall off that there will be nothing more when it lands. <br /> <br /> In most cases, Chris looks like a skilled, difficult space hero, there is a scene where she shouts like an unskilled girl in need. Someone who is hard enough to get Henderson's death so fast must at least scream, "help, it's got me and I can't reach my gun!" instead of just screaming. <br /> <br /> The character with the most personality (almost too much at times) is D.J. Bill. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, the D.J. in American graffiti. I wonder if he was so well spoken in the original language. <br /> <br /> Two planets in the film exploded. The explosions were unimportant and seemed to be too much inspiration for Star Wars. However, the cause of the explosion was quite different from the star's primary weapon. The dialogue had a good, interesting explanation for the cause. Many other explosions in the movie look good, just not the planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from a late 1970s video. Some of the images look like primitive video games, and a little influence from Tron is also visible. On the other hand, the sound effects are often fairly decent, but it emphasizes the cheese-sounding parts. The art is also good, especially if it stays away from the often exaggerated graphics. <br /> <br /> Finally there is the story. If a movie tells a good story, it can get away with many shortcomings. But the plot here was pretty lightweight. A na√Øve boy tries to help someone on a crippled spaceship and gets a great strength he doesn't understand. He and his ally of very virtuous companions are fighting against a powerful irreparable evil enemy. He makes friends, learns about his particular strength and growth in a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous, he can even defeat the evil enemy. Details along the way may increase such a story above the simple exposition, but there is much more to it in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a kiddie cartoon. But then, as it seems the primary intended audience is older children, it may no longer be.
