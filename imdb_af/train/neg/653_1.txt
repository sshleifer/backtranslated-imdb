If I could give this movie a proper rating, it would probably be in the minus numbers. While respecting the fact that someone has to keep these horrible horror movies, seriously, people, buy a ticket for this movie a waste of money that you can spend on something that is worth your time. <br /> <br /> Despite being a horror movie, there's nothing scary about it, unless the idea of ​​seeing how many horror clichés you can fit into one movie scares you. If the rating was higher, it would probably have made for a better movie in the long run. <br /> <br /> Whoever made this version of Prom Night has screwed you. The actors could probably have done a decent job if it wasn't for the dubious essay. It was a terrible waste of a cinema. I will soon see 'One missed call', at least that had a plot.
