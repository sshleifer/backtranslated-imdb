The opening shot was the best aspect of this movie, as it gave you hope that you will see a passionate, well-crafted independent movie. Damn that opening shot for filling my hope. As the "movie" progressed slowly, my mind was in proportion to this "movie": Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors pay the director to be in this "movie"? Did I validate my ticket at the Box Office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! This is the only exception I will make about watching a movie at home about a Movie Theater, because at home you can turn it off. Were there any redeeming values? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college "nerd" had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Otherwise, this "movie" went from a comedy to a family drama to a spiritual amplifier. It didn't succeed on any of these fronts. Oh, and the girl was really bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
