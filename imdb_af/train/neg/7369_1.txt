I had a feeling that after 'Submerged' this one would not be better. I'm right. He must search for champagne money, and not care about the final product ... His voice is repeatedly baptized by a stranger who does not sound like him; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateur. It's nothing more than a B or C grade movie with just enough money to hire a few talented cameras and an "OK" sound designer. <br /> <br /> Like the previous poster said, it seems the issues in the post appear-production (... voice dubbing, etc.) Bad, because the plot is actually good for a SG movie . <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG movie unless he asks for my emails. <br /> <br /> Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> - jimbo
