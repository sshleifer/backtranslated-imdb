I remember loving this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, had a Commodore 64 and loved playing Rambo on it. So I was very excited when I bought this movie really cheaply. I got it in my video recorder and started: Man this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the whole movie (except for that horrible sentimental speech at the end), and has the same expression on his face altogether. And that stupid love thing in the middle, it's just as incredibly predictable. I just ended up fast forward the whole thing and going to swap the movie for something else.
