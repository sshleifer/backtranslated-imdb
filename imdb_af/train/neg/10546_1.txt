<br /> <br /> I recently saw this horror in my movie program, and I thought it was terrible, as I said in my tagline, it was pretentious, thin, small and phenomenally self-evident. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a fan of movie, and all the things the movie has to offer. If I want to watch a documentary at the Cannes Festival, I'll watch A&E .... and they'll probably be much more objective about it. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it. <br /> <br />
