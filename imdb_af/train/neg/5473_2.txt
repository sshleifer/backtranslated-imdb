I have never seen one of these sci-fi originals before, it was the first. I think it's just fair to judge the acting, direction / production, set design and even the CGI effects on other sci-fi movies. Comparing this with your typical Hollywood production is unfair. However, I would say that overall Aztec Rex doesn't really remind Werner Herzog's masterpiece Aguirre, the wrath of God. <br /> <br /> I'll start to notice it, yes, I acknowledge the fact that this movie is more about culture clash than it does with dinosaurs. In spite of being a TV slide movie, there is some underlying context to the story I will investigate. The symbolic elements included are clear enough. <br /> <br /> Accordingly, as a student of history, theology, mythology and film: I found the dialogue furious and the plot themes become somewhat offensive. I don't ask mea culpas on behalf of the producers - as I said before the movie is what it is. But as far as I'm concerned, many of the younger demographics for this movie are likely to rely on television to teach them history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem manifests itself most visibly with the character Ayacoatl (not a comment on Dichen Lachman's performance, but merely how her character is written, though, I will say she has a little work to do to do before she receives Emmy nods). It is by her character that the actions of the Spanish Europeans are justified. Her feature in the movie as Rios' love interest confirms that the European way is the right way, simply because they are European. There is really no other reason. It's really only supposed that the viewer should associate with the Europeans about the Aztec because their dress, language, ideology, and so on. Known as the Aztec - the Aztec is portrayed as contradictory and backward. . "And it's not just that the viewer is left assuming due to ethnocentric perception on the viewer section, but it seems the story tries to convince the viewer. As if the Aztecs couldn't reach a plan - if not a better one - to lure a dinosaur to his death on a bed of punji sticks. <br /> <br /> In fairness there is a subgroup of Spanish portrayed as pillaging temples and planned Abusing the Natives MesoAmericans There is also a scene where we have the Christian holy man in the Aztec achievements: "They have agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc." - But in the end it is still the Aztec warrior portrayed as the main antagonist of the movie, even about the 'thunderlizards' (later later), he proposed as treacherous, plowing and attempting to send the romantic European Spaniard through him in the use of hallucinogenic thoughts This is an important spiritual component for some aspects and religions of the native Meso and North Americans (later later on) that he can hold the woman he feels, belongs to him and away from the Spaniard. <br /> <br /> Now to analyze the true nature of the story (to leave the obvious Christian vs Pagan themes from the table) from a symbolic point of view, a viewer can make these so-called thunder lizards easily represented. of Meso-American ideology / theology, depicted in this movie as one purpose: blood thirst, mercy, cruelty, ungodly, perhaps even evil? In opposition, we have this group of Christian wanderers, led by a young Hernando Cortes depicted as naive, but total noble lambs caught in the dark heathen world of the Aztec. Also the name of the film is Aztec Rex, which leads one to believe that it is about dinosaurs eating people. But what Aztec Rex translates is Aztec King, the head of the Aztec state, or in this case state of being. (Hence, why the title of the movie has changed). And so, what do we see as the new Asian king in the end? This is the remaining Spaniard, Rios. Aztec Rex refers to the new European ideology that has been overcome by disease, bloodshed, war and famine, Native Americans. Rios symbolizes the ideal European - as the presenters of this film want them to be remembered (as opposed to Cortes who represent the "practical but still noble European"). But if you are exploring the Holocausts of the Americas, we must be honest: don't the symbolic components of this movie's story have it backwards? <br /> <br /> I have to say that Aztec Rex is, at worst, a little racist, or being kind, ignorant at best. <br /> <br /> And yes, I know it's just a movie, Everything is meant to be fun, I understand, but in the end we are behind the idea that Rios was the father of the last remaining Aztec lines? I wonder what native MesoAmericans should think about this end ... as for myself, I thought it was a bit too self-assured. <br /> <br /> Best supporting performance of the movie goes to Ian Ziering's wig - though striking - it has at least changed Ziering's appearance so I didn't think I had watched the yuppie from 90210 which was a bunch of conquerors in the heart of darkness led. Ziering actually proves himself as a more than capable actor in this movie, I actually bought his performance, or at least I forgot, it is Ian Ziering anyway. I don't know who his agent is, but he needs more work. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it was also a pleasure to see Jim McGee again. I have been in Scrooged since 1988 for his stealth performance. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
