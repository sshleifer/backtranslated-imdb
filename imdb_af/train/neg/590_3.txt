I was sadly disappointed with this movie because it felt fake and the characters were not strong enough to make the movies a bad attempt at horror. The basic idea for the film was interesting, but unfortunately it was not possible to excite me, really scared or shocked. There was one part in the whole movie I thought was gruesome, but even that didn't fix it. At the end of the film, I made Kate look as if she had softened and eventually became a little more realistic. The character Jeremy Sheffield played was not really needed for this movie and I think the director / writer has turned away with the many characters that have been used for no purpose, if he left them at the basic characters, it has more of a solo effort on Kate's side. It could have worked - Jeremy's scene was wood to say the least and I felt uncomfortable looking at the bad on-screen chemistry - or lacking it. Such a pity. Disappointing.
