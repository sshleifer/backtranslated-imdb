I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt. The opening moments, with a naked woman, sprinkled and a painter, Diana, was going to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain, so she could use it for her art, giving the impression that it was a kicking ass can be. vampire movie. Show that this initial impression is false. Oh, Troma, the sign of a lack of quality: sometimes they offer something that is dirty, but funny and with at least some skill in the rubbish (or sometimes not). It's a case where it's not even a lot of fun to watch since his attempts at humor (ie the protagonist's father is an old vaudevillian who does Jimmy Durante's impressions?) Is poor at best and any unintentional laugh by Sergio Lapel's interrupted bargain basement. <br /> <br /> It is not without him to try, oh Lord. He tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his manufacturers had money for lights, but the way they were used in the film, I, a former student wizard and aspiring director, put in my seat: if I saw it in a theater, I had to my eyes in many cases, and would wonder if his DP really understood the basic 3-point lighting setup. Although, along with a very clumsy sound design (or just very haphazardly as in the art gallery scene), shouldn't be something that draws attention during a Troma edition, it should be something * basically * that a movie maker can pack, even if the writing is not very funny or scary (whether it is) or if Lapel puts a strange mix of songs on bizarre moments. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie by any stretch. And maybe if you die a vampire (or just a vampire period), it could appeal as an alternative to low-interest basement cellar alternative to Near Dark, or as a slight improvement, says 1972's Blood freak. You have better ways to waste your time, overall.
