I like the role a lot, but the story slowly grows slowly. Danny Glover does a good job of wondering if he is the bad man. Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid didn't have as much space in the story as he could have had. I thought the first scene was a little over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded. But I will see it again. I have a 5 (wish I could calculate a 5.5)
