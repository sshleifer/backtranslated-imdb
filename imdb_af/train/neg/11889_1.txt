Very funny to see "Beretta's Island" as a natural garbage film. It's like answering Jess Franko's b-movie type. Bodybuilders hit back (face to face!) To pushers. The very stupid strike! : Incredibly bad straight shooting (shooting) scenes look even better than hand-to-hand fighting. Spectacular scenes are ridiculous. Saving beauty scenes is incredibly stupid. Dramatic scenes are very untruthful. The great happiness of the movie is beautiful landscapes and festive features. T miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the beginning of the film and the list of Franco Columbu's family at the end. Special attraction: naked chest. Anyway forget - Franco can sing!
