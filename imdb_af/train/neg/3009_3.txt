That song is humming in my head. Not the biggest song, but it's the 80's. This movie is about a lead singer being "supposebly" murdered while accused of murder while stealing his girlfriend's backing in his band. The lead singer, whose name is Billy "Eye" (right) was killed after two years and his band returns for a concert. Only the back singer is the lead singer this time. Billy stole her and eventually ends up killing all these people and fearing the girl and making people think she's wrong with her and suggesting things. She finally decided to go to a cemetery and dig his grave to see if he was still there. She sees that he is dead, but still sees and hears his voice. By the end of the film we find the reason why, Billy has a brother named John (right) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all the people coming back to blame him on his brother and take his girlfriend and terrorize her because she made him crazy. The end is very cheesy and the acting is very lamb and wood. But .... I like it anyway. I watch it for the song. I wish I had it.
