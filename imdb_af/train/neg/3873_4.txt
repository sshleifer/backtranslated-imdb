Alicia Silverstone (pre-"Clueless") plays a contemporary crime-obsessed teenager who is trying to kill the cruel of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which was not made very well, but is surprisingly serious about its leading character. Silverstone is attractive and successful in cutting out an interesting young woman here, despite the kitsch's undermining of the picture. The supporting film (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although the violence is going overboard in the last act. Not a cheesy party, but nothing extraordinary. * 1/2 of ****
