This movie has all the elements to be a clever, twinkling comedy, but for some reason it took the dumbbell route. Maybe it didn't really know who his audience was, but it's hardly a man's movie that gave the role and plot, but is too slapstick and dumb-blonde to appeal to women in full. <br /> <br /> If you saw Legally Blonde and his successor, then it's like the confusing terrible successor. Big actors like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson also managed so much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller crumble in supporting roles, which is stupid rather than amusing. <br /> <br /> Many things in this movie were paint-by-numbers, the various uber-clich√© montages, the last minute "misunderstanding", even the children's party chaos. It only represents lazy writing. <br /> <br /> It will be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you do not take it seriously, but it is such a scam that can do better than you will probably feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll over.
