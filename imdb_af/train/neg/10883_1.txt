This movie is not programmed in Italian theater. I saw it on a manifestation called "fanta festival". I find it horrible because some scenes like music videos seem chaotic and dark, the use of fluorescent colors is mocked and there is no suspension in the movie. Music is completely out of the story and I have no words to describe the visual effects. Looking at the first scene, the movie looks interesting, but a few minutes later it gets busy. The story is interesting, but the development needs a full review.
