Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How can you do this for me? I can't believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I saw it at the theater with my brother because my mother forced me to look together .... oh God ... where do I even start? The plot sucked. The voice acting SUCKED. The animation struggled. The end was really sucked. If you like this movie, you come too. And to Futuramafan1987, which said it was the biggest movie ever, you are a tool, flat and simple. It is not a movie for anyone, but ten-year-olds with a squatter with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. I still cry to this day about the terrible maze of a movie .... and then there was Pikachu's Adventure ... don't even get me started with the horrible mess of a movie. It is truly one of the most boring experiences of my life. Don't look at it right away. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Exit, find every copy of this movie you can and burn it. Burn them all and then continue to rent a good movie, like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even back to the future!
