A few years back the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME. It was imperfect, but very enjoyable (my score was 7), created this piece of garbage over New York City. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I love you (J'taime) created a sense of Paris and it was made in many parts of Paris. <br /> <br /> In this current movie I didn't recognize New York City, I didn't feel like I was in the city of my birth. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 congregations, I haven't seen any scenes in The Bronx or Queens. There is one scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I have seen no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scenes from the beautiful hotels or theaters. It played a big role, most of the artists were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest kind. The very few humorous moments are all a course of sexual nature or very offensive to the very fine New Yorkers who know and love us all. <br /> <br /> Some of the films nominated for the 'razzie' awards were much better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> In my mind I think the title should have been <br /> < NEW YORK, I HAVE YOU.
