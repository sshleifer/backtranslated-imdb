Seems the role event should at least ensure an average movie. And so I sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief. Besides Ed Harris, no one seems to possess the skills of acting. Even Sean Connery, whom I normally worship, had to have run out during the entire filming of Just Case. Not once in the whole movie can one actor convince me. <br /> <br /> It made this movie cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit out of the question. It's exciting, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Conclusion Just look at this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do.
