It is rare that I have the need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving because of how bad it was created and how biased his product was. <br /> <br /> I made a clear effort to show the part of the filmmakers to the Palestinian family as drills and unreliable. We hear they are discussing the sadness they feel about oppression, but the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that is in line with the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand that restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions is designed to prevent peace. I felt out of the movie that the victim's mother was selfish in her mourning and completely shut down because of her side of the fence, so to speak. She was reluctant to see the hurt of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed words caused the final meeting to be out of control. It is more realistic to regard the Israeli disposition as a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignoring requests for recognition for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the country. <br /> <br /> I gave it a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother who would normally be admirable in a documentary, but in view of the lack of impartiality, it all looks exploitative. Also for the poor changes, lack of background in the real case, and ultimately the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Eventually, it is a poor documentary and a poor film. I admit that this is partly the result of the political situation, but I am obliged to mark the mistakes in the direction, regardless of the heartbreaking and sad topic.
