It is without a doubt the absolute worst movie Steven Seagal ever made. And it says a lot. Don't be fooled by the rating, it's too good. This horror was not even worth a u / 10 score, if such a thing existed. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no plot <br /> <br /> - Worse action scenes ever, and there aren't too many of them <br /> <br /> - Seagal doesn't do anything itself including fighting, talking (very double), and so on. As usual. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and can't care less about this movie. Something quite obvious. <br /> <br /> Take all the other garbage DTV movies Seagal made, multiply it with each other, multiply it by a thousand billions, and all the bad ones you won 't even describe 1% of this absolute crapfest.
