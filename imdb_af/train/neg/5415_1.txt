Dil was a memorable film that brings a good director, such as Indra Kumar, to the celluloid. The movie followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti, all was excellent. <br /> <br /> But then every successful director gives some horrible movies with a few hits. Pyare Mohan is one such movie. <br /> <br /> Although the comedies are nicely told, then they fail to laugh. Compare to the kind of comedy films made today, it's a stupid one. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, don't look at it. Because the pathetic comedy will just make you cry. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is worth it.
