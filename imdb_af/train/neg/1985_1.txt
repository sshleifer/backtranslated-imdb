the costumes, the dialogue, the historical accuracy are terrible. For example, - Stacey Dash and the pending scene. The nose was accurate (as for what I could tell), but the kind of nose broke the person's neck. Mrs. Dash at the end of the rope hangs without any bad effects until the rope is shot. This type did not bruise the person, it killed them at the end of the drop. <br /> <br /> And just before they go to rob a bank (in a glance), they break into the street for a group of hugs - with their bandannas hiding their faces - it would be for people on the street be. <br /> <br /> The poor editing - it is a battery pack under the shirt and it is clear that the "long ride" clip shows that they are driving together and then turning the film around. <br /> <br /> I kept the fact that they kept the scene with the horse, and it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was crap.
