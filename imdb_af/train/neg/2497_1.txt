There is only one problem with this site, you can't give a negative rating. In addition, a friend designated it as a D grade film. I say he was too nice. A piece of wood can show more emotion that the actors in this movie, and the money used to make this movie, would have been better used to start a fire. It's absolutely horrible, 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this undisputed massacre will never return. After looking at 5 minutes, the boys and I wondered if it would be more fun than zinc weight hardship. Half of a cardboard and a bottle of 151 later I finally found that some of these G grade remotely remote actions. It is an insult on this whole planet that the director thought that anyone could find something more beneficial from it, he had to buy a queue. And for the actors in this movie I hope you paid well to be in this joke, because I doubt you will ever work again. In short, I like everyone in this movie 100 big and 12 demerit points from your acting license.
