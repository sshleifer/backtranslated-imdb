When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant bug chasing a few nurses) And the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I wasn't in for a big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese ball, which always does a good job in whatever role he does. The FX is pretty crowny, there's not too much of a plot, and I'm still not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey, because there's nothing in this monkey movie. But come on people, what did you expect? It's not really as bad as it looks .... If you enjoy the old 50's style black-and-white bug attack movies, this one is basically an updated version, without the special FX updates.
