Well, finally, the remake last night in London, unintentionally, hilarious, sexless and without real humor. I don't really know where to start, while being entertained by this strange tribute, it didn't really make me move. The play is screaming hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are too much 'Disney'. There is a ridiculous 'six months later' insertion to the Nic Cage fire (which didn't come soon enough) With Cage in the bear suit, the audience suppressed the joy and poured out the comedy from various bad things on the island . It's such a strange remake I can't believe, I saw it, it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip gifts would have done in the 1980s, a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of the Miner's Strike , very strange!
