I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in the past year in 2003 was for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest: "I saw teammates Michael Moore in the trunk of his limo "and" I'll call the gay mafia better if I wake up with a poodle head in my bed "<br /> <br /> 2) Surprise winners: Nobody has Adrien Brody for the best actor (Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director (Genuine Jeers and Boos), but they won. <br /> <br /> Last year's award ceremony wasn't bad, but there were few surprises and I was happy to see BACK. THE KING sweeps the awards even though it wasn't the best in the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better), but what the BBC covered, Jonathan Ross, got some of his sycophantic friends and pretended to be screaming when they were something. but. So when I heard that Sky did cover British TV, I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to do the links, but we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh, if British TV is desperate for film critics. Obviously, they will happily fly over Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock wasn't bad, but he's not Steve Martin, while the place looks like a sports hall with seats being inserted! Not much of a glamorous arena in my opinion. The biggest problem I had with the ceremony was the "small" Oscars format handed out to the winners in their seats! There is no such thing as a "small" Oscar and just because the Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design award is earned as Best Picture or Best Director. All winners must be allowed to upgrade. What a bunch of arrogant snobs the academy and I totally agree with the comment that this format is shameful and if it wasn't for the surprises, it could be the worst ceremony in history. Regarding the awards themselves <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett. No big surprise for a competitive category <br /> <br /> Best supporting actor - Morgan Freeman. No real complaints since Freeman is one of America's biggest live character players <br /> <br /> Best actor - Jamie Foxx. Most predictable night award. Gold <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Hilary Swank. Great surprise, as everyone thought Annette Benning would only win academic politics, but Swank earned it and gave the best speech of the night. <br /> <br /> Dear Director - Clint Eastwood. Big surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award, simply because he never won one. Actually, I'm happy with it, because if he didn't earn it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he didn't earn it for the AVIATOR <br /> <br /> Best Movie - MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Another big surprise since everyone thought the academy would divide the best director and best photo awards while thinking of THE AVIATOR's Hollywood-friendly plot would have made it a Best Picture Dead Certificate, while MDB's controversial topic would have changed a lot. voters <br /> <br /> What these awards may illustrate is that this year, voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and really give awards to people who deserve what they haven't done in the past. I mean A BEAUTIFUL FIT to defeat the HISTORY OF THE RING! And for a long time, academics can vote with their heads instead of their hearts
