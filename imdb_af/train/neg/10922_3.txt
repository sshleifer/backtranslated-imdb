Worse than the rating it was given. It's a typical sci-fi movie these days: bad for horrible acting, a poorly written mini-dissertation, and scanty direction. From the opening scene where DeMille buried his set to the end, this movie is terrible. In the play, this movie Moses (which was Charlton Heston in the DeMille film), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor), had a boy who buried a box in the sand. The characters who had to represent the three aforementioned icons were terrible and had to match the people who were "supposed" to them. The fact that it is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they all shout for an ambulance. Of course, the author is unaware of the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a film of such low quality.
