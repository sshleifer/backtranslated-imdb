The first half of this movie is a pure delight. Book. Funny. Wonderful performances. A meticulous brother and sister living in Manhattan falls for the same woman! Adult. Clear. Sense of humor. What more can you ask for. As a romantic comedy, it starts refreshingly. It heads in untapped area. And then it falls apart. <br /> <br /> It's from a universal adult comedy to a come-of-age, come-of-the-box story that's been done many times before. What a disappointment. As a folk film, it begins with such a promise. Why should it turn into such a pedestrian "I'm who I am" movie. The freeze frame ends shot by Heather Graham's jump in the air to celebrate "her luck finding herself" underlining the banality of the last part of the movie. <br /> <br /> It could have been different. It could have been magical. It eventually became the same old guy.
