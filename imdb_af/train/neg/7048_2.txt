I selected this movie from the front page, which was a bad move. It was not funny at all and the main characters were unpleasant. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the scene were terrible. It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. Terrible movie with a surfing theme that has nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie is likely to be revived because she is now in the spotlight, married to Gordon Gekko and everything, but if you haven't seen it, don't waste your time. A bad movie with BIG navigation, REAL surfers and AWESOME, BEAUTIFUL cinematography was in God's hand.
