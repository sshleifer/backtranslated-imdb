Dieter Bohlen, Germany's infamous composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits such as "You are my heart, you are my soul," felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less a fuzzy image of it. He did not deny that he was a selfish asshole, but the whole story was distorted to fit his image of himself. No word that he probably hit his former wife and ended up in hospital. However, it was written in a funny style and a great success after his appearance as a jury member of the German version of "American Idol" - especially his memorable comments. <br /> <br /> It must be the end of the story - really. In the hype of the said "Idol" TV show called "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (abbreviated DSDS), someone has got the terrible idea of ​​making a movie out of the book. The result is "Dieter - der Film" <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a movie so desperately trying to be funny and failed so completely. None of the gags really touch the point. Naddel's voice and style of talking was immediately on my nerves, although Verona's voice had to do it more. Independent, childish, predictable and long-lasting gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie within minutes of the end. The content of the movie is a messy movie adaptation that was suddenly written by a ghost writer, based on Bohlen's sloppy idealized memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be a satire, but they failed. The story is completely uninteresting and the fact that the background voice Bohlen himself assures that the entire film is nothing satirical. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder it is considered bad for a movie release. The likelihood that this thing would have been rotten in some archives was quite high until recently when DSDS's current season seems to be a mediocre success. With the "friendly" help of Germany's biggest yellow press newspaper "BILD" and the desperate situation for TV station RTL, there's something in the program, while the still unbeatable show "Wetten dass ...?" Run on Channel 2, the movie finally arrived in television. Unfortunately. Watching this movie is a waste of time. There are definitely better cartoons with much more fun and a story worth looking at. /> <br /> Therefore: 2/10
