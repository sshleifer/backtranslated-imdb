I find it rather useless to comment on this "movie" for the simplest reason it has nothing to comment on. It is similar to a rotten egg that is nothing good at pointing to the world expression, as it is rotten like other endless numbers of eggs before it. But since a commentary is such a grand imperative ... Filth is definitely the right word to describe this movie created in the same way as any other Romanian "movie" directed by Lucian Pintilie. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances recommended for people outside Romania as for others (who have amateur camera lately, lack of plot, lack of directors / actors' quality, etc. sound etc. like trendy and even artificial): watch and enjoy this "movie" (as I know you will) but favor the other well-meaning IMDb members, don't write an online review as it will deceive, irritate and in the end wasting their time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie has some value, an educational, because it sets the example: "How not to make a movie."
