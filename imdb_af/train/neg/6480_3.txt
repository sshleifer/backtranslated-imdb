It was nice to see all the famous characters again, but the story bothered me. We loved Ariel in the first movie - so why is the second one centered around her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I didn't have the plot of it. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not come back as Eric's voice! Disney, please stop recycling classic movies with these clumsy simulations.
