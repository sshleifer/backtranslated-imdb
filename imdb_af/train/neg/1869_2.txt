The veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei is again with this erotic thriller that clearly depicts Joel Schumacher's 8MM. But, as expected, Mattei does his movie on a minimal budget - so it's already unclear when it's released. <br /> <br /> After her daughter is kidnapped, a mother goes into the dark world of underground pornography because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that regulates sniff films as long as the exclusive customers pay well. The search for her daughter not only leads the mother in Europe, but also to prostitution. She goes with a few guys to get her clues. When she eventually makes contact with the sniffing organization led by the mysterious Doctor Hades, she is in danger. <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about this one, although it is promising. Problem is, the movie is by no means as sloppy or explicit, as one would expect from the director who made films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (released for the first time in Russia!) Is not enough and does not contain the amount of nudity and sex to keep the viewer's attention. The plot is also not that special, except perhaps for the surprisingly many different places in Europe. The end is extremely disappointing. The acting is also not really remarkable, except Anita Auer who plays Doctor Hades. She looks and acts extremely rude. You don't want to meet her in a dark alley (or your bedroom). <br /> <br /> All in all, SNUFF TRAP only appeals to collectors of Bruno Mattei's films. But it is good to see the man again on the helm: It was his first excitement since 1994's GLO OCCHI DENTRO.
