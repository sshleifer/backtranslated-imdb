I already know that critics and some audiences say it was a satire, there were many political and social messages, the names refer to other names, etc. It may be. I can't realize such things (I don't want to do anyway) because I'm not interested, I'm interested in 'cinema'. Regarding the movie itself, it is again said that the movie is clever and dramatic. I couldn't see anything we didn't see in monster movies, except the scene that took place in the second half in an office. Yes, that scene says somethings about humanity, but it doesn't make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining (generous) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. Regarding the biggest mistake of the movie, it's visual effects. It was just shocking, I couldn't go for a while, because I expected a realistic monster, because it's not one of the old Gojira movies. It was made in 2006, but it wasn't. It's like you don't believe there is a monster, you can't mind. If you agree, I strongly recommend Cloverfield, which is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an attempt. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics are talking about it as being a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it is rather a drama than an excitement or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I don't want to compare the host with other monster movies, but I try to mean that the host doesn't do anything that other monster movies don't do. By the way, some people may call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for the Asian theater. Yes, I also like Asian theater, but that is the fact.
