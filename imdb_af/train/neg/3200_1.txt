Joe Don Baker is ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, a spicy, sweaty, murderous guy in a stupid cowboy pack that Roy Rogers would have laughed at. Somehow he still has a weapon, probably because he lives in Texas, and that will allow any law enforcement there. <br /> <br /> This greasy loser is a deputy sheriff near the Texas border. Not surprisingly, he was once a Texas Ranger, but kicked out because he was of the opinion that his law was his own personal ball to play. This includes shooting suspects across the international border to Mexico, hitting the defenders, threatening violent battles, threatening women, starting with gunfights that could be avoided and managing to threaten the lives of a child in the process. promising that he will help and protect, is killed only so that he gets out of jail, etc. can be. This man makes LA police look like saints in comparison. <br /> <br /> When his mate is killed by some wandering Italian assassins, Joe Don's character hunts them and kills one of them. Then he takes the other to Italy at the request of Mr Wilson, who rightly thinks Joe Don will take up a lot of time. In record time he lost the Italian and he got a Maltese taxi in the process. It's just the first of the many deaths and large-scale destruction that Joe Don runs in a trail behind him as he drives into Malta (the Italian killer) in Malta. <br /> <br /> So start the mobius strip part of The film in which our hero is arrested, placed by the Maltese police chief, goes out and causes more trouble, is arrested, is being trained by the police chief ... and so on, and so on. Until you want to blow your brain with Joe Don's ivory handled gun and do the horror. <br /> <br /> Joe Don proves his futility, not only in Palermo's first time, but in the next yacht he puts in just one punch. Then he was taken by Palermo after threatening a woman with a dress hanger. You hope Palermo will actually torture him in the basement he is sitting in the basement, but not the stripper he threatened has come and pushed him out because he promised to protect her. Her throat is quickly cut (big surprise) and Joe Don escapes at night. <br /> <br /> And here you hope he may have drowned in the (still) other yacht. But even the ocean doesn't want him and spits him on a coast where he is nursed by a poor Maltese family (what have they ever done to earn it?) He returns to the city where he is in the police arrested. by the police chief ... arrrgghhh! The female police officer who escorted him freed him so they could get Palermo. Why she would do anything so brain-dead to destroy her career for this huge demolition is beyond me. It is just a crossword puzzle. <br /> <br /> They go out to the villa where Palermo is hiding and start shooting. Joe Don blately cheats and kills Palermo. He then released the big and brilliant last line of the movie: "The big one has my badge. Can you get it for me?" Thanks for the immortal line, Mr. Baker. It goes down in the annals of movie history as the most literate, amazing, wonderful last line ever spoken by a character in a movie. It definitely falls in line with everything else about the character. Bravo.
