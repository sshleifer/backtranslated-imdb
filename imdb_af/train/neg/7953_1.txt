Although the play and director can be regarded as merit, the storyline is a very poor wannabe Vietnam movie with the country's name simply changed. <br /> <br /> At least, for a movie to retain credibility, try to have some accuracy in equipment, weapons and tactics. Except for the limited use as stupid propaganda about the South African Defense Force, it serves little purpose - certainly no entertainment value. <Br /> <br /> Aspiring filmmakers - that's not how to make a war movie. Do research, and be proud of your product.
