Rajinikanth is born again after he gets a magical power that he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> There are several problems with this obvious movie: the 50ish Rajinikanth is still at home with his parents; the girl's father next door thinks he's a compelling "boy" ("vaseekaramaana paiyan"); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the film with his sermons, the worst being how women of the ages have their domestic work - but we must believe that he is not a tea; Though well read, he wasted six of his seven powers on a stupid kite; I can go on, but you get the picture. <br /> <br /> There are god people, there are gods, and there is Rajinikanth. The guide has problems setting up Rajinikanth in one of these categories. Initially, Rajinikanth, only Rajinikanth who does Tamil heroes - is standing on the villains and, despite being the oldest, is run by the most beautiful girl in the movie. Rajinikanth does it well and some of Rajinikanth's brands are actually enjoyable - 'baby count' is a novelty. What makes this movie unbearable is that those few initial minutes are just a foreword to a worst book ever to be written. Even the foreword is split with a comedy that is forced and obvious. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; We see that the hero faces several hurdles (from politicians, as usual), but we can't really fall for the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is. In the end, when everyone wants him to be the leader, the hero gives one of his sermons and goes away to become an hermit. The director does not solve the problem in the climax scene. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rehman's score is very interesting. Either he shows shimmering brilliance or he doesn't bother to fully invest in this movie - who can blame him. There is one scene where Rajinikanth steps into one of the crooks and then throws the knife and starts his baby count. The music is very suitable for the moment and serves as a catalyst that adds further tension. The songs are all mediocre, no one will save the songs of this movie after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can assign in IMDb. This movie has all the elements that justify its rightful place, just below the position of IMDb.
