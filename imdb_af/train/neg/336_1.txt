Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the starboard, they destroy all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds peaked, and then he feared Halhill's chase movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, just inviting himself to the terrible last action hero. And here's Edquay Murphy's memories of Trading Places and 48 hours with this "family" adventure movie. It is an incredibly boring, childish and generally terrifying blemish, with the chance to see Charlotte Lewis's big breasts in a stiff blouse being the most enjoyable aspect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The story is pure humdrum. It's about social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types and telling him he's the Chosen One. Chosen for what I hear you ask. His job is to save a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, the classic actor Charles Dance seems very shy to be in the movie, but hey, I'm sure he's paid well to sacrifice his talents. Of all the Murphy's movies, it's easily the worst. I read a few reviews that indicate that it is nice to see Murphy in an atypical role, in a non-formal kind of movie, and both points are loose, but there is no forgiveness of the fact that film - not atypical and non-formal - is an absolute refuse. <br /> <br />
