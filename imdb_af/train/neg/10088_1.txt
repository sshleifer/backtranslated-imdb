I am an actor, producer, director and what I intend to say is fact. This project was the worst movie in making history. From producer to director and modifying this so-called movie is a joke and I mean a BIG joke. Why would Blockbuster release such crap? I take my work very seriously and this film is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I saw bad Zombie movies, but it takes the cookie the Coffie and everything on the damn table. THIS FILM SUCK !!! I really hate to talk about other filmmakers badly, because I'm one myself, but consider taking on another profession. I respect the fact that you have completed a movie, but I have to ask you, "Were you a CRACK"? I mean the makeup on your girls, the scary zombies, what do you think? For the whole nation, if I could vote for zero, I would have had it. WORST MOVIE MOVIE HISTORY!
