I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Not terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hater), and I had high expectations for this one, as I listed it on many "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" websites. (I'm now convinced that the top 10 lists are all cutting and pasting.) First of all, there is hardly any action in the movie. Most of the movie is about talking about the plot, which is a great thing because it's at its best thin. And the action itself could have been impressive in 1978, but it is routine according to today's standards. A special warning to Netflix users: the DVD they send is terrible; the picture is terrible and not even improved 16: 9.
