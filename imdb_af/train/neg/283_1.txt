To film, this movie felt like one of those post-school presentations, just lower budget and lower everything else. I think it was supposed to be an inspirational movie of some kind, but it didn't work for me. like preachy.it has very light shades of Flash Dance, but so, what? There is no excitement in this movie. The dialogue is confronted and split to death. Of course, the whole movie feels like a bad 80's clich√©. acting was less than stars, although it has a lot to do with what the actors gave (or in this case) to work with. On the top are the poor song choices, with very bad lyrics. I felt ashamed of all the actors involved. They are all talented, but you can't tell this movie. It's just my opinion of course, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream to believe a 1/10.
