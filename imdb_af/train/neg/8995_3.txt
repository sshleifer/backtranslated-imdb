I missed the start, but I saw most of it. A friend put it on DVD in the cheap room at FYE. <br /> <br /> The sketch is all very short, but most of them are still too long. Most of them seem to have forgotten to have something funny! Many racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor in it, sketches based on stereotypes, or sketches using racist terms for people. <br /> <br /> I try to remember something I thought was funny in it, and I have problems .... The logo for the Tunnel Vision network is a lipstick mouth with an eyeball in it. The mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids. Kind of creepy. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most of the actors tackled things better and it is fortunate that this bomb did not hold them back.
