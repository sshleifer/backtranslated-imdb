There were many unknown movies or movies that gave bad reviews. It wasn't one of them. <br /> <br /> It was stunned and using camera techniques that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and took most of the movie to go, and then you asked, "That's it?". After deciding not to take the film too seriously and just seeing it from a wheat point of view, it got better. This is a movie that would hit MST3000 if it was still on.
