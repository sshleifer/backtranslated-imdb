The sign of a classic movie is that it matures like a good red wine. This movie is not Cabarnet and certainly not Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that we are now poking into sit-coms plague and the dialogue is stilted and preachy. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie. <br /> <br /> Wisdom comes with sixty plus years of history. Since Watch on the Rhine, writer Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Bidenesque plagiarism with her so-called real-life story "Julia" from her book "Pentimento". As one of the most beautiful of an abundance of Western-based USSR excuses, it is clear that her theme was in the play and the film was calling on America for the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism of the fascists, who just proved to save. their military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer correctly noted, it is not a pro-American play and movie, as Lillian went to an American apostate communist in her grave. This film chronicles the well-known dummy of the intellectual elite who formed the American left, just as now the proxy left the Daily Kos and Michael Moore in the conspiracy theories and gave help and comfort to those who would destroy America.
