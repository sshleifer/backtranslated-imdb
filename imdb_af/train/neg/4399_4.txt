'Tapeheads', a harsh, intermittent funny spoof of the music video business, may have been the perfect comedic short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly involved in the swing of the uncomfortable chaos. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles, starting their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties and one deathbed. It's too bad that the filmmakers had to think of a dull piece of land to keep the running time. (Shenanigans includes a crooked politician and his henchmen who don't do much, except to take away the film's primary strength, the late 80s music culture). Still, Cusack and Robbins create some original articles here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same note-like wavelength, and they never sit down. They are the right thing in friendship comedies. * 1/2 of ****
