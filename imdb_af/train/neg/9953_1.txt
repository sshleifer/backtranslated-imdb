I have to watch a good movie soon, because it looks like every other entry or something I despise. But my history speaks, I must not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana shields. I never thought I'd see a movie as thunderous as it did. Al Pacino does not play in this movie: he suggests. There are many, many scenes of his character, which are a racing car driver, just staring at the camera. He is absolutely terrible. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two are supposed to be in a love affair, and there is no chemistry whatsoever. Sydney Pollack directs this movie? There is no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here. Is this the same guy I was cheering on in Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a horrible movie experience. Walk, don't walk away from Bobby Deerfield.
