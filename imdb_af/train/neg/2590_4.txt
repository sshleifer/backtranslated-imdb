American Cake went far from the first. Initially I believe the actors don't have an idea of ​​what they are doing and it's just a reminder of a college party. Story stands out as two colleagues from the colleagues (with the young stifler) attending the dreams of the university, just to experience the late night festivals, sex and of course the drink. The plot is silly and comes away from the original cake. In fact, they didn't even have an apple pie anywhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store and can rent for free. But remember, it's a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex movies with absolute nudity and crazy drinking. I myself am a teenager and I believe even Evan almighty would have been a better choice.
