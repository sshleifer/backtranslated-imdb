Now, I'm one to see movies that have poor reviews, and say, "Hmm ... it's not that bad!" I loved The Cable Guy and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Keep in mind, I didn't really look at it with high expectations, but I thought maybe ... just maybe ... it would be bad in a way I could laugh at it. I was wrong. In no case during my suffering through this "movie" (And I use the term sparingly) I was even close to being generously entertained. To start, Shaq Quentin Tarantino makes like Marlon Brando as it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I could tell, an Amish priest would probably be better off than him. The main character is simply annoying and not an easy-to-hold character. Frankly, I'd rather eat a greasy tuck from a Harlequin fetus bloody sore than to see it again.
