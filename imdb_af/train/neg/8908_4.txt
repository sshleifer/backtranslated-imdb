This series was CBS networks that responded to the Big Valley's success. It was a 90 minute Western, just like the ABC program was. While it was an answer, it didn't have the good to make it past season 2. <br /> <br /> This issue was really lost on this show. For example, in one episode Johnny gets his eye pulled out of a stick. Incredibly, by the end of the show, Johnny was completely healed. Along with this, the stories here were not as close as the Great Valley. <br /> <br /> It's a show that I don't want DVDs, and frankly they'll never be released. Thinking as CBS runs a lot, they reused many well-known settings. It was one of the last Western series that CBS produced when Westerns were not really popular in the 1970s.
