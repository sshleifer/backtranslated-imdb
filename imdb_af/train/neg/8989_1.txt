There are some good things about the movie. The music and cinematography are wonderful. Alex Wilson is warm and gives a good performance. Ryan Bauer is also warm. The production was very lucky to throw them because they really give production value to the movie. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many of the boys in the movie who are not talking are also cute. Why isn't the actress Amy playing in the credits? Brandon Alexander gives a great comic performance as Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is probably the star, James Townsend. He can't act. He is also very rude, not nice to look at. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle tone at all. It's no wonder he has to make his own movie and throw himself into it. No one else will throw him in anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not credible as someone who would even have a girl because he is so gay. They had to throw someone other than the head if they wanted what was best for the movie. Then he might want to use this movie again as a vehicle to start a career in softcore porn, certainly not really acting, because he would have taken some stage lessons. Plus, anyone who does pores is listed in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a brown Latina as Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher doesn't look like an actress. All in all, this movie is soft core porn and is no better than anything you would see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is ashamed of it and doesn't want to be associated with it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable stage name. Plus, I once ran in West Hollywood once and when I mentioned this movie, he just turned around and walked away. I understand. If I worked on this movie, I would be embarrassed and would not like to be associated with it.
