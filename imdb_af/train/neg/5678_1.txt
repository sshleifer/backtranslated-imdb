It will be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie I've ever seen. (I couldn't quite see it). Pure and simple, it is just violent violence, just for the sake of it, and the ridiculous story line just adds to the ill-considered and unauthorized filming. Ill. And just for those with a love for manic mutilation. After killing several hundred men, women and children, Seed is finally captured after killing several police officers who eventually get a hint on his whereabouts. He is condemned to death by electric chair and miraculously living! He is buried alive, he digs away and denies revenge against those who drove him off and hit the switch. Needless to say, following more horrific murders ...
