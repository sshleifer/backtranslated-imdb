Dahmer, a young confused man. Dahmer, a confusing film. Granted, I had a few beers while watching the movie, but it doesn't explain why I got so bored by this movie. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying, and there is no real story with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explanatory text in the beginning and at the end of the movie. The interlude, which would be the movie, is just boring images and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see real murders, everything is just a lot of insinuations. Sometimes you even get the feeling that Dahmer is dreaming the whole thing, but you know he is not, because it is <br /> <br /> based on a real story and it actually happened, at least most of it. But what happened? It's not easy to tell. <br /> <br /> I don't encourage people to waste time on this movie. I <br /> <br /> didn't like it a bit and I cheated on it when it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
