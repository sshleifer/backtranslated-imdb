I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr. Sandler became known. <br /> <br /> It's bad .... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a painfully dull house movie. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy his other movies ...... but if you are a fan like me .... stay away from this one. This can change your thoughts on Adam. You should never recover from the horror this movie is ... I had a better time watching old people playing in the house .......
