I read the book Celestine Prophecy and look forward to seeing the movie. Be advised that the film is loosely based on the book. Many of the book's most interesting points don't even come out in the movie. It's at best a B-movie. Many events, characters, how character interaction and encounter in the book are simply changed or not. The flow of events that are very smooth in the book is limp and fed to the view as if you were a child. Character development is very poor. Personality characters differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to a "B" horror flick. I understand that it will take six hours in the film to present everything in the book, but their screen play base missed many points. The casting was very good.
