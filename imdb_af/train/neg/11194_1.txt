The upcoming attractions of "The Order" make it a decent horror mystery / thriller, but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent, all thrown together to form a heap of waste. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is made up of terrible dialogue and godly special effects. The acting was also nothing to be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I played the right spelling.) Saved the movie in this category. <br /> <br /> For Heaven's Will: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
