Good night, Mr. Tom starts in an impossible exceptional village in the south of England where the sun always shines. Before we have a big idea of ​​the period, we hear a radio announcement of the Second World War declaration. Soon a train of clouds comes from steam to refugee children from London and when shy, William, with hesitant, funny, old Tom (who you just know, will be a heart of gold). Our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what a load of sentimental blowing it is. In fact, it's just the old, odd-pair-buddy formula. Are there new stories written? <br /> <br /> As I suggested, there is hardly any time in town and not much in London except the old old ambulance that is moving around. And certainly not an indication of the horror of the Blitz, because London's citizens are polite in the airline. Even when the local teacher's husband is denied, he is thought to be murdered, later recovered. <br /> <br /> I clicked "Goodnight, Mister Tom" and obviously, and John Thaw's accent had a picture of Ronnie Barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth which she "land bumpkin" 'accent. <br /> <br /> By the way, my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons I didn't like and watched co-imdb ​​reviewers. in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
