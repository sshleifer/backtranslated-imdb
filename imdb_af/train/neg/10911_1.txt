I hated this movie so much. I remember it alive. It's not even funny. Any movie that relies on intact sex jokes and racism humor doesn't earn the money it costs to make it. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drinks a cardboard of milk. All I could think of was "he deserves it, because he makes such a bad movie." Don't waste your time or money on this one.
