I picked up TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We considered taking a trip from the east and thought it would give us a sense of what it was like. The movie was a total waste of time, if I went out to buy it, I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw it cost $ 49. <br /> <br /> The DVD ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across Canada where my stomach feels sick while walking up and down and walking around the curve. <br /> <br /> There were lots of footage they probably shot at this and you'd think they could have made a better product. If I wanted this project, I would have provided more footage, put on road signs to let people know where they were and to sleep to see the scenery. Making such a movie should be 60 to 90 minutes. Oh yes, the case said it was in stereo. The whole movie was a hissing sound of the speed of the car sound, it could make at least some music out of it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good cross Canada movie watch The Railrodder / National Film Council of Canada, starring Buster keaton (one of the last movie he made) in this comic movie Buster Keaton a railway track player in Nova Scotia and traveling to British Columbia
