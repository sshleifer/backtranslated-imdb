This movie will be a hit with those who enjoy sophomoronic, senseless, explicit mockery of sexual exploitation and F ... in almost every sentence. Like a good plot? Like comedy? Like romance or other human values? Stay away from the blow. It was so bad that I left for about half an hour. I saw that two children slipped into what looked like about 10 - very harmful - it earned an X.
