Written by the excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this film was a slight disappointment. It was too short. It created the Hovis atmosphere for too long, laughing at Catholic claims. Then you very quickly have the fascists and socialists who work for the family's attention and the terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> However, my wife thought Liam was cute.
