I was intrigued to see how a small-faced 2008 movie somehow won the Oscar for the best picture of 2009 and saw the Hurt Locker. unfortunately, everything I invested for the two hours was the grim confirmation that this film has only won for on-screen reasons. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this movie is the worst you'll ever see. When it's not yet another Bourne Identity tribute with tough, annoying shaky cam images, it shows all the features of a two-day soap opera in terms of lensing. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is characteristic, the characteristics are about as well developed as rejecting Beetle Bailey comic strip ideas and dialogue - in cases where the movie gives "minimalism" and for no obvious reason one or two soldiers in the right talk box are not the worst ever recorded. In fairness, the actors do the best they can in the circumstances, just not enough to obscure the bad project. <br /> <br /> The whole movie felt that it was meant as a kind of "mockumentary" that they were clocked, was humorous and so well edited that they could do it as a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours on this movie, they are two hours, you will never come back, and two hours of wasting you will regret the rest of your life.
