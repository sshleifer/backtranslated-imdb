Stalker is right! Girl sees man, girl wants man, girl practices everyday ways to bump into him, girl won't leave him alone, girl pretends to be a patient, girl can't stop talking about him, girl pretends' to love another man (or two), he does not pay attention to her, because she is annoying, girl STILL will not leave him alone. Playing right, Drake's character could have been beautiful, but she's totally unrelenting in her quest for Cary Grant's character, her girlfriend-in-cahoots are boring. Sadly, Drake's attempt to play "off the beaten track" as "disconcertingly disgusted." has. The direction is slim and the dialogue is only slightly dim. <br /> <br /> Screw ball comedy is very difficult to succeed and when it fails, like in this stuffed butt of an attempt, it just stinks. Worse still, Drake spends the entire movie requiring a lot of Valium and a limitation. She destroys any humor found in this drier than mummy dust loss.
