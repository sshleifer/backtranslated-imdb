OK, a slasher movie. A very, very silly slasher movie. <br /> <br /> We got your stereotypical teenagers in a home business. We have an FBI agent who has seen Dirty Harry once too much. "So what are the secrets .... punks?" We have about 4 different small camera shots and scene that doesn't make sense at all. "Hey man, I'm fixing the sprinklers" ((that man was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly a preacher is tied up on a couch watching home movies, he's being murdered. <br /> <br /> They're following the killer in the middle of nowhere, with no policemen. Suddenly she is in a church with a wedding dress. I swear it's the stupidest slasher movie I've ever seen.
