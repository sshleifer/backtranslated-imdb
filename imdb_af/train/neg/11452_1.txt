If I could get this movie with 0, I'd have it! I see a few ppl at IMDb, saying it's the funniest movie of the year, etc., etc. excuse me? are you PPL snorting LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie. N O T H I N G! I really want my 27 minutes back from my life, and I watched this piece. <br /> <br /> I read someone sitting on a plane watching this movie that no longer looks after 30 minutes, I fully understand, I would actually watch snakes on a plane for 2 times instead of watching this movie once! <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie, do something else useful with your life, make the dishes, walk the dog, hell ... anything is better than spending time before watching TV .
