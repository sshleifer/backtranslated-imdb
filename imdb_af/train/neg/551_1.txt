I'm going through the AFI's list of top 100 comedies, and I have to say it's really one of the worst. Not just from the 90 movies on the list I saw, but from any movie I've ever seen. Drunks are sometimes funny, Dudley is not. Liza almost made it worth it, but unfortunately ... Just look at Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughs and drinks, is supposed to be funny? I recommend almost any other movie on the AFI's top 100 comedies for more laughter than that. If you want to see a more fun "drunk", try The Thin Man. Funnier movie in general, will kill any Marx Brothers movie (especially if you are as drunk as Arthur).
