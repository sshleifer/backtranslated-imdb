"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to be in a flawless world for a time, where the biggest sin a child could commit would be the law and a traffic ticket. It opens with a young female automatic fanatic who gets the business of her arch-enemy, who is pushing her into a motorsport. It's about drag racing - this B-flick is mostly concerned with rock-roll, man! The people at American International apparently loved decent, square teenagers who wanted to party and yet didn't have an adult chaperone. There are some entertaining dual enthusiasts and fruitful exchanges. (Necking Kid: "We thought we'd get out for some fresh air." Dad: "Where did you think you'd get it in her throat?") But the ghost is a little late in the arrival. Shortly after 65 minutes, the movie deceives us with a climax race that actually takes place outside the screen and a pre-"Scooby Doo" style unmasking that doesn't make sense. But for nostalgia buffs, some senseless fun. ** of ****
