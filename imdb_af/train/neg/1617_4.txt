What an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no concessions are made to "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or enhanced sound. <br /> <br /> Facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same as being in the middle of a fight or talking about a campfire. <br /> <br /> I see these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to entertain. It is quite long and dull in places. <br /> <br /> But I suspect the lack of any plot development is given, I don't think it's very educational either. <br /> <br /> It's also hard to see a story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read a little bit of history so you understand the context of what can happen, since the director didn't see it for some reason Che's band was moving over the way they did. As a result, there seems to be groups converting for particular reason and being shot. <br /> <br /> I would like this movie to generate more stars for somehow more empathy with my developing depth of character, but somehow all the characters have always been strangers to me at end. The stars it gets are for realism and the hardship of guerrilla warfare.
