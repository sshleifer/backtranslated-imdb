Envy the best stars. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, one can only expect the best. But with an envy, no one can save this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and associates at a sandpaper factory. Both make a decent life, but because Tim has a better job performance, he can afford more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always comes with new ideas for inventions. One day Nick comes up with the idea for a jug that cancels the cane (yes, I'm serious). To fall in love, Nick decides to really find this product. He offers Tim an offer to invest in his idea and shares the profits 50/50. Tim refuses to think the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious), eventually makes millions. He spends his money on things like a much bigger house, a horse, a personal trainer and fine deserts. Tim started envying Nick. Hence the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it seems quite terrible. This movie features some of the worst dialogue and very poor performances of all role players. Then, as I mentioned earlier, none of them can save this mess. Not even the great Christian Walken, who played a homeless character called "J-man", made this movie funny. The movie is bad from the beginning and just gets worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like crap (no pun intended) * you want to see Jack Black in a white tux <br /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie at all costs, but avoid especially if: * you offend bathroom humor * you love animals
