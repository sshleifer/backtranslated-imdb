Before I wrote this review, I went back and read the reviews of others. This movie was a particular disappointment to me as it contained two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, a score of the often wonderful Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra", "The Thomas Crowne Affair "). The dance was stilted, unmotivated and inexplicable, the songs forgotten, the story is a joke. Even the costume wasn't flattering. Only photography correctly captured the correct mood and spirit. I'm glad other people enjoyed "The Young Girls or Rochefort", though I definitely didn't.
