I read the other comments about this movie, and usually I don't try to be hard at my criticism, because I'm trying to be a nice person. However, this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and it's very bad USA Network plus Cinemax nights.) Everyone who thought of this movie should be prevented from ever making another one. This movie somehow upset me that no other movie ever. I really think these people are insane. Just save your time and don't look at this file. Please - I wish I had. The acting is terrible, the plot (which plot) is dumb and humiliating and insane. I really don't think it should be in a movie. But this is my opinion, and I try to save you from wasting your time.
