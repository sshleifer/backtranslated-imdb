After seeing the previews, I felt that this movie would be a great improvement over the fast and furious series. So, I've been expecting to have a missing storyline, but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civilians with fart tarts. Unfortunately I was wrong. If you can just imagine a quick and furious movie with a worse story line than anyway, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> It's the absolute worst movie I've ever seen (I'm nice - no I won't take baseball bat to my nuts as others have said). Not only was the storyline, but the action was also crazy. I think the director thought they could just throw a lot of women and exotic cars and then call them a movie. For example, there is a point in the movie where the man presses the button and she climbs Lamborghini and flies over a McLaren SLR to win. And after the little bit where Eddy Griffin had a fight with one of his "girls" (an Imus comment would work in this case), the girl asks to go and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene I couldn't take it anymore. So, I only got half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I've ever run. Then I had to stop for a few drinks to kill all my corrupt brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option. You're better off going to the local motor show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home. I'll keep all viewers in my prayers.
