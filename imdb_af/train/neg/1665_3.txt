It was a decent movie, I actually enjoyed it. But the end is so sudden !! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves many loose points. What happens after the concert? What happens to her boyfriend? Is she talking to Grant? Will she come in the next semester? And how about Angela? Clearly, Holly's performance Angela will beat a few pegs, but nothing is shown to show how she responds. There is so much excitement in the air and it is very unsatisfactory. I don't know if it's trying to leave a sequel or something, but it's a terrible end and I think it really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
