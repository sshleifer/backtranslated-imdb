I really didn't expect much from "The Night Listener" and I never heard of it until I saw the cover in the video streams. However, the movie is very effective when it comes to suspension and tension. Sometimes it drags a little, but it actually helps to make you wonder what is going to happen and more importantly: when. As the film progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is dragged into a kind of cat and mouse to the point where he becomes obsessed with discovering the truth and existence of a 14-year-old abused child who no one didn't seem to have ever seen personally. The Night Listener is an interesting story, which is great to build the tension in the movie and you are pretty much kept in the dark of who lies and what is really. In the end, however, it disappears similarly and does not live up to the potential it could have had. It doesn't give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character, which would be useful and interesting.
