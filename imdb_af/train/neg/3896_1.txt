Good. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule and suggests that "you didn't live until you saw the sun through Saturn's rings," while the spectacular sunlight was flowing through the window in the middle of the day. has a nosebleed. Next, West is back home in a secret hospital, a melting gelatinous mass that berserk and causes a thick nurse to run through a false glass door. Apparently, West becomes "stronger as it melts", which makes about as much sense as anything in this hopelessly pure, noble moovie. Then this dull Army Brass, similar to Coleman Francis (director of very bad moovies), tries to cover the information, but the man walks around and kills everyone he sees because he melts. He attacked an old old couple because he was melting. He shouts one terrible actress and moans helplessly for about 10 minutes because he melts. He melts because he melts. For example, former Rick Baker, should be the star here, but they just look hokey. The film is poorly shot and it looks so dark and confused that it is very difficult to figure out what is not - not that it will help at all. MooCow says who is cutting the cheese with this one? : = 8P ps - "Didn't you get crackers?"
