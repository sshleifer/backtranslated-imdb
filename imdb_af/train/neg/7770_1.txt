This full movie movie is regulated by Bill Rebane, the man who is partly responsible for the truly notorious Monster-a-Go Go. As I approached the end of the cold, I came to the incredible conclusion that this movie was even worse than the 60's shocker. The story ?? as it is ?? are about three eccentric millionaires inviting a group of people to their remote home to play a series of macabre games. Anyone who succeeds in keeping the pace and surviving to the end will win $ 1,000,000. This is a very simple plot, but Rebane still manages to make proceedings incomprehensible. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Selected. I mean what hell was, is it all exactly? I think you are about to draw your own conclusions. Production values ​​and acting are undoubtedly a pornographic film standard. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) isn't even that good. She is so incredibly terrible that she is compelling. Unfortunately, the same thing can't be said about this crap attachment as a whole, it's just a cellar cellar.
