The only way to get something out of this movie is to approach it as a comedy. Seen in the light, it does not deliver. <br /> <br /> Looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a smooth and one-dimensional investigation of 'issues' without any insight. <br /> <br /> A movie about stereotypes and then making every character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy - especially when the same characters break their hackneyed forms only in predictable, stereotypical ways. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the movie almost visible, and Michael Rappaport is a great show, but the writing is so terrible and the social comment is so naughty, it's hard to find anything.
