Oh, dear, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and nasty ... Remember the shot of "The Natural", where the lightning strikes the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat of? Well, the producers of this movie used the same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch hit the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid to use the material of The Natural, or did they just hope that no one who would see the movie would pick it up? <br /> <br /> At the end where they are trying to get away in the truck. Such overworking in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A very bad movie, a very bad movie.
