Don't let the point of departure deceive you - it was one funny movie. The problem - it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. The story pleases you for an end that never comes. Worse still, the setup is never explained. You will leave the theater and ask, "Is that it?" I judge it a 2 just because there were a few short moments of promise, but the end point left you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did such good work as he expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are strange works, and interesting turns everywhere, which have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this one come to video before you waste your money.
