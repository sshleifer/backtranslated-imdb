If Deborah Messing was not already cast as "Grace", it could be a tolerant movie. However, this is just another story of a frustrated spinster with issues that hire a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney). She reads in a magazine article to travel to London for her sister's London wedding. How new is this plot? <br /> <br /> Not a funny or non-romantic way, the Marriage Date moves over the storyline of deceptive sex by bride and best man, and pays for escorts to deliver the movie as four weddings without Hugh, and definitely, a dead end deal for the naive groom who is ignorant of the sexual history of his bride (Amy Adams). While Messing perfected the oppressed princess, 30-something-woman with a failed relationship history, her neurotic and drunken movement on another faux beau, is just the restoration of her TV series. If this woman is an actress, get a role that is not at the right time again. <br /> <br /> Very drunk female bond, cricket-visual jokes and Mulroney in a towel (pretty!), but the movie is a drill with the obvious happy ending. Expected Brass Continued: Divorce Date.
