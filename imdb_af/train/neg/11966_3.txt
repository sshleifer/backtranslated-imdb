Bob Clampett's 'Porky's Poor Fish' is such a cartoon filled with horrible pun and one or two nice moments. In Porky's Fish Shoppe, 'Porky's Poor Fish' is an uncomfortable area between a standard black and white Porky cartoon and one of the books-to-life Mare Melodies that was popular at the time. Typical of many of the early Porky cartoons, Porky is far from the star, only appearing in a quiet opening musical number and the climax of the film. For the rest of the time, the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal, but gets more than what he has negotiated. Unfortunately, the audience gets far less than they've negotiated. As sometimes happens in the books-to-life series, the spotlight is thrown at points that worked just as well in a non-animated medium. Licks are scarce and while the cartoon is just saved by Clampett's energetic direction, there is very little to consult Porky's Poor Fish about any of the other early Porky cartoons.
