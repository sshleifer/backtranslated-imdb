If it wasn't for the "Oh So Gourgous," Natassia Malthe, this B-movie would not have been one sector of my Tivo disk space! In what layers of rent, was the rear warehouse filmed the supposed space port? "Continuity People!" This is a basic principle in real movies! At night is an alleged space gate and per day (night and day at a space station?) A warehouse! ??!? People please! The only thing I'm going to award this movie is the wardrobe dept. To keep Natassia constantly in that tight shape, revealing outfits! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits that they apparently spent time every day of filming! The Sci-fi channel would have been better to show SpaceBalls! At least there would be real humor to look at something so incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please fire your agent as soon as possible! You're so much better off an actor, even to be associated with this level of filmmaking.
