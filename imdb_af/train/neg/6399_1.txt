One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two big comics turned into juice for a ravenous child. They both sold themselves in this one, worse than Pryor's character. Two: Scary, too much sentimental writing that could be used in a Harold Lloyd movie, clicked it so. Three: Choosing a black actor as the toy; the racist subtext of this is unbearable, as it is never addressed. There is no message here, Pryor's role could be played by any comic actor. Four: That Child ... I wish I could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting ... that would mean that movies like this and Kid Co. might not have been made ... and my childhood would have been free from their mental power. So, if you want to see some big comics, they are contaminating a sickly lovely kiddie movie, continue. If you want to see them in something good, Pryor's old actions and Gleason see something better, like the Honeymooners.
