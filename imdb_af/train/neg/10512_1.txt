I hired this movie, for some reason, Tom Savini, I respect his work, but it was a real deviation, I had horrible cliches, half of the film was naked women who called "fallen angels" running to try scary, oh and then there was the occasional "Blair Witch" black and white movement sicken cameras scenes. Tom's character was very horrible, horrible writing. And you must love these lines that they use. "Is there anyone there, who's out there, it's not funny" No, but your acting was. I wish I could give this flick a 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they left Anthony reunited The Breakfast Club in the forest of unforgettable acting.
