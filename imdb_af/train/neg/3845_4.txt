Although Bette Davis did a wonderful job as Mildred, I felt the movie was not the best I saw. At the end of the movie I felt something was missing out on it. <br /> <br /> However, Bette Davis did a perfect job, and she made me hate and made her unhappy. Leslie Howard did very well than the beloved Philip Carey, and I enchanted him through the movie because I was in love with such a terrible woman. It is such a sad thing when you fall in love with a bad seed. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, who's a sensitive person, even if it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> In the end, the play happened and not the plot. The end scene was exceptionally good, but I'm not the one to give it away. Although others might find this movie good, I was one who found it so. I must recommend this movie to those who want a bad seed so they can see what can happen to them if they fall in love with that terrible person.
