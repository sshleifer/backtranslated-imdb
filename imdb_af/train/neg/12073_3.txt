The money has to be divided between them, but only after they have successfully spent a week at the Dean's House. In the story there was a march in the story when we later found out that it was actually an overnight remnant, not a week's holiday, at home for guests to qualify for dean's money, as almost everyone sonop is dead. br /> <br /> The first victim of the dean curse has nothing to do with getting and money from derivative Christopher Dean estate, local sheriff Dan Garcia, Rodolfo Acosta. Acosta cooled his head and then served on a dish to a shocked group of guests. Later that night, cute Chin Greg and Laura's, Jeff Morrow & Marry Anders, found a small pet dead outside the dam. <br /> <br /> The movie has plucked all the people staying at the Dean Mansion. one by one until it is announced who the murderer really is. We then have a double turn in the story where the original killer is suddenly murdered along with two of the last remaining guests. The actual killer is not only getting all the booty, $ 140 million, but eventually does not have to divide his accomplice by doing him or her by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot. br /> Nonsensical who did this, and haunted house movie with such immoral and unlikely characters that even a mother, much less the audience, will find difficult. There is everything you could possibly think of in the move involving selective guests, including incest, S&M sadism and, of course, double traffic and backpacking, which doesn't even fall murder. You can't care less about which of the guests survive to collect the dean's fortune at the end of the movie, and hope they don't. <br /> <br /> Even the big surprise at the end is "I'm really so surprised since the killer's identity was revealed to the movie maker who forgot to keep his face in the shade so you really can see who he is, even before he reveals himself! We then have a plot turn that eliminates the killer along with a number of remaining guests just to make the movie a little more confusing than it already is. The final plot twist, which you can see from as far as ten miles away, was just to show how clever the obvious killer was who was foolish almost nobody watched the movie.
