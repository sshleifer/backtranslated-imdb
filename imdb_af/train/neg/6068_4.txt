Vodka Lemon is a beautiful but extremely unequal Armenian movie that some will delight and others will wear. Although reasonably well-crafted, the film lacks a true "singing", and rather relies on many scenes that will look common to the spectacular art-house viewer. The film contains a handful of moments of mere cinematic brilliance, unfortunately they deserve a movie that deserves their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and eventually dissatisfied. You may be laughing, but these moments will be far and wide between a sea of ​​washed-out snowy landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides. A noble effort, ultimately done by lack of narrative cohesion.
