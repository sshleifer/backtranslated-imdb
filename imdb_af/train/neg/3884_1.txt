Many months ago, when I was seven, I can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie. This appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. To be the wise adults they are, they told me, "Absolutely not! It's a lot of garbage." Of course, I was very disappointed that I wouldn't be the first child on my block to see the "Incredible Melting Man". <br /> <br /> Little time passed - maybe a few days. I forgot about "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment has faded. Twenty-five years passed until it came to the forefront of my mind. While navigating through channels on digital cable, I found this long-lost relic of a movie. My curiosity was piqued and I decided to eventually take part in these fruits that my parents have forbidden. I had to listen to them. The "Incredible Melting Man" may be the worst film known to man. It makes movies like "Def-Con 4," "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered" look like Oscar nominees. I feel scared of wasting nearly two hours of my life to see this filthy dirt. the effects were rough even for 1977. How did someone convince a movie company to make this movie out of me. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I made. Listen to your parents if they forbid you Watching this movie, they were right.
