My friends and I rented it from Blockbuster because we saw Nana Visitor's name on the box. This movie is a travesty. I hope she denies her resume. <br /> <br /> The "plot" was lost and limp, the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. The movie doesn't make any sense. The rough plot of an alien parasite species that infects humans has been done many times by films with much better scripts than this, for example, the invasion of snipers and the faculty. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the accident coming over this movie, suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> How it classifies him as a horror movie if there is no use of fear, suspense, gore, terror or any of the usual horror movie wasn't techniques I don't know, but if you still find yourself want to watch this movie, I suggest you have lots of sugar in hand so you can find parts of it funny.
