This is the only question I have left. Why did this movie suck so much when it played such a good role? Why was writing so bad, it completely disconnected the audience with the characters? Why didn't it make sense at all? Why did the studio take a very good point of departure and "Hollywood" is the hell out of it when everything it needed was good, smart story telling? Why? I never understand why good-starting movies become a heap of shit by the time they are released. I hope for Freeman and Spacey, who are Oscar WINNERS, that it is never released to the big screens in America. <br /> <br /> As a person with a Bachelor's degree in Journalism, the whole story is just totally laughable. I just thought the script had potential, but the performance made it into a clich√©, and a terrible one through it. Just. None.
