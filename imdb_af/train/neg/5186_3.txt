RKS films have always been commercial films that fit the 90's, from GHAYAL, DAMINI <br /> <br /> His last few films were KHAKEE. FAMILY was crap <br /> <br /> This movie is a decent movie but could be better <br /> <br /> The problem is that many old-fashioned clicks are thrown in and many scenes come to film and long out. <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan's character is shown very well, but his character gets heroic that can be subtle <br /> <br /> The long jump can be avoided, as the teeth are simply drawn. <br /> <br /> Even the second-half street play looks too simplistic and hardly a solution. The message was well-executed <br /> <br /> The direction of RKS is decent, though it can be better. Music is okay. <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks the part very well and is comfortable playing his part most often although he sometimes looks at ease in light screens. He is excellent in dramatics. Vidya is performing in the scene for the media. Pankaj has a non-specified role and too filmy He excelled in his part Darshan Jariwala Hams, as the parent's villain is cute
