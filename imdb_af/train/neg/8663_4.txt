Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water ... <br /> <br /> Another computer has proven generated mutant crocus for human meat, released by one of the facilities that doing bad science. Gereco Biotech company is engaged in growth hormone research, which accidentally releases a baby crocodile that is developing at an accelerated rate. <br /> <br /> B-roll casting adds fun to this course of the mill "genetic error monster film". Costas Mandylor evokes Mick Dundee, Aussie accents, hat, big asses, the works, as a crocus specialist appointed by Gereco CEO Joanna Pacula ... Wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive who refuses any involvement in the gigantic animal's facility on innocent people free). Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter working at the shelter. Soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi is Longenecker's love interest, a local artist who welds sculptures. (His brother is a victim of the crocodile). Of course, this skill will come in handy when our heroes have set up a crocus craft, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. <br /> <br /> The crocus itself is never the least convincing, as it drives up through a reserve looking for food, the special effects of a low grade variety. Regarding Roger Corman productions dealing with renoidal dino monsters, I stick to Carnosaur. The monster here is actually a crocodile standing on its hind legs, often erect because it chases possible victims. I felt Mandylor and the filmmakers played Crocodile Dundee with his crockery and amused this imitation where the monster itself failed. Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have good chemistry on the screen. As expected, Pacula gets her excitement in hilarious ways.
