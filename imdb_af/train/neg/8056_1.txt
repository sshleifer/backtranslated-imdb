Incredible, boring and incoherent supernatural "thriller" in which student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is the ongoing victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claimed the life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can't start telling you how bad it is ... nothing of any interest ever happens, or ever there is some sort of real entertainment value. I did not like this role in this particular movie - unfortunately they are not convincing (their roles are not good). To promote it as a horror movie is a joke. Where is the fear? There is no sense or tension - there are some good songs, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> How on earth did this project get the green light? Author-director Steve Carpenter has no noticeable vision or talent I can feel. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie meaningless. <br /> <br /> The alleged killer cut I watched is 86 minutes of pure tedium. <br /> <br /> 1/10
