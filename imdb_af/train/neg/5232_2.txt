Becky Harris plays the female shopper whose accident it is to be in the shop at the wrong time and of course only the purpose of being in this movie is to give a reason to remove remote! Miss Harris seems to be in her fifties or older when she first comes to the scene. Once the red-haired thief was done with her, it became clear that it was not AARP queen. If it's not some of the best assets ever shown on celluloid, I want someone to turn me on. Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and I literally carried the VHS copy of her charm. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie isn't really worth it. I was hoping to see something pretty convincing and intelligent, but I was both disappointed. God bless Becky Harris!
