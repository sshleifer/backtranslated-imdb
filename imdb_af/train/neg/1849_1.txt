I was interested to see the move think it could be a diamond in the rough, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible directing (the lap sequence not running) although the director might say this is what he is going for, it looks very uninspired and immature) editing can be done by someone with 2 video recorders and the stock is low budget video. I would say that it wasn't even as simple as mini digital video. <br /> <br /> There are a few simple ways to capture a movie with what the director has, such as editing. But it is clear that he just doesn't care. There is so much trouble in this movie as a ham sandwich. It can be made better, but it will mean extra work.
