It was not a success. You drove this nut in the burning sun in a buggy with a parasol over it and killed people for its own reasons. You put the same person in a snow bath in a snow bath and cut off pieces of his anatomy that were frozen. Then you have a woman in a house in the middle of somewhere that shoots wolves that aren't there. What is the point of this movie? Couldn't Bruce Dern find something better to do? It was a waste of film.
