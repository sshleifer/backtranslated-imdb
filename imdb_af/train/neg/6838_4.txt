Plot Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, is murdered by his associates with his wife. His twin sons, Chad & Alex, are separated. 25 years later, Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, a Hong Kong-based smuggler, join forces to avenge their parents' murder and legitimately claim the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich worked together after they had previously done Lionheart. It is also the first of three films to play Van Damme playing double roles ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicant" is the other). The plot is a very simple application of the revenge story, the film's only redeeming feature is Van Damme's performance as two very different people ?? the pricy rich kid and the rough - As it goes, Van Damme does not do a very good job in any role, although his actions are on Alex, is almost amusing. It's confusing to confuse the brothers with different clothes and different hair styles. Bolo Yeung makes a very worthy handler for the bad things.
