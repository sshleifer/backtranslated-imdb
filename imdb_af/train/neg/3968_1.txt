If you've ever seen a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compare it with the feedback it gets on IMDb, you know that most comments and voices are decaying. Trust me: you will be bored! People from the production team write their feedback themselves (sometimes they even acknowledge it). But that's not enough: They also click "constantly" when there is a negative comment about the movie. Therefore, negative critics are always behind the hips. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad writing, bad end. Believe me now! If not, you will believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley might be a good businessman. Otherwise, it can't be said to find people who still finance his movies. (Well, they are cheap, yet.) But as a creative person, he is a complete failure.
