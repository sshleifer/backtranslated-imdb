Robert Altman's downbeat, New-fangled western Edmund Naughton's book "McCabe" has been overlooked at the time of his release, but in the past year he has been critically affected. Apart from a completely convincing tree-town scenario, the characters do not deserve much interest here, and the photo seems (deliberately) broke and unattractive. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who, in the struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere, helps to organize the first brothel; Of course, as soon as the profits come in, Beatty is threatened by city drivers who want some of the action. Altman creates a solemn winter atmosphere for the movie that gives the audience a certain sense of time and space, but the action in this sorry village is limited - most of the story is vignette - and Altman's pacing is deliberately slow. There is hardly a statement (just the opposite, in fact) and the resentful actors staring at each other without looking at their thoughts. It is a self-defeating image, and yet, in an Altman-specific way, it is defeating the defeat. ** of ****
