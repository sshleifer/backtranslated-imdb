The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released on video / DVD as a full-length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The first half of the film is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly distributes the story between the families. However, Dutton's character dies halfway and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, disjointed, and horribly horrible 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (PG-13 later designated for video / DVD release).
