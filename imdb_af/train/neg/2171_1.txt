This movie definitely has one of the strangest themes in history - with Ed Wood's passionate defense of cross decorations in Glen of Glenda? <br /> <br /> The subject: playing bridge. The Park Avenue sets it up; the Bohemians play it. The Russians - who speak very dubiously "Russian" and have the most unconvincing accent when speaking English - play it at the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If one is not interested in the bridge - even in spite of the big movie - it is probably not very interested in this bizarre movie. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer - as Luke is an unlikely Russian.) But they were all sunk by the fetishist writings.
