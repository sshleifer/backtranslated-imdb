In Bridgeport, prisoner high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed by teenage student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); She saw that he was killing her family to stay with her, but Richard was arrested and sent to jail for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna feels better, but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her eve, she joins her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the festival. But psychopath Richard escaped from prison and was put on the same floor in the hotel and chased Donna and knocked her hotel and hotel friends crossing his path. <br /> <br /> The forgotten slash "Prom Night" is a collection of cliches with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is level and stupid, with a bad play by Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer. The predictable script is great as it is possible to determine what will happen in the following screens. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dan√ßar" ("The Death Invites to Dance")
