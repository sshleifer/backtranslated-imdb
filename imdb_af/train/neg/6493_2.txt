Oh, dear ... as an English man, and a small part of Welsh, a fan of Anthony Hopkins's work in the industry ..... to date, I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see I'm no one hoping for better. So my comment is as 'straw in the wind'. But that's the point isn't it? - I have no ax to grind on the commercial value of a job. I, a full member of the great unaware, go to a movie that is transported to another location. Yes, violate faith for a short period. But not entering a state of total disbelief. <br /> <br /> If by an unknown author and director, I would guess that this "production" would be rejected in oblivion. Unfortunately, it is not, and I have been wide-eyed and confused. Having seen some of the cute reviews that gave this work, I am very worried. Perhaps that's what I'm trying, without bias, to see every movie on its own merit. Regardless of the author, director, studio or even infamous content. <br /> <br /> My advice, so much for me: don't write and regulate the same production. It's full of danger. Movies need to be moderated to maintain a glimpse of credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in school reports, "Can and can do better ..."
