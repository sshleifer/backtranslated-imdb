1st watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Killing and incredibly supposed sequel to the original classic animated "101 Dalmatians. "Yes, the movie continues where it ends in the first one, but the problem is that it plays much like the original one. One of the great things about the original was the rhythm of the story, which this one does not have. The animation is also very incredible for Disney and all we get is the same characters that go through the same kind of story. When will Disney not make us boring with successors and re-do's etc. Etc. Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre price they have exhausted.
