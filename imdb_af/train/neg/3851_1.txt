I never thought I would see a movie worse than "Lisa Picard Is Famous", but it came very close. As repeatedly repeated by the comment, it was predictable; Five minutes in the movie you know, it will be stranded at the other outcome. This film painfully refers to everything from "Something about Mary" to "Revenge of the Pink Panther". Author Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs new new material. <br /> <br /> The only strife is the distorted boyfriend / police officer pursued by internal affairs, but even the occasion is wasted. Lots of shots from the Seattle Space Needle needed to disguise the obvious Canadian shooting land. Some of the worst driving in the car screens with almost no trouble disguising the fact that the car is being pulled through the town on a trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or place the brakes once in a while. Selma Blair is inert and the short short is a crime. $ 3M for Jason Lee, for what? Guess it beat skateboarding! <br /> <br /> So here's who to watch the movie: Bee Spirit fans who want to hear two actors, sing 'Islands in the Stream' badly; People who can't get enough of Julia Stiles. 10/01
