The worst movie I've seen since Gingerale Afternoon. I suppose it's a horror / comedy. I've pretty much predicted every scene in this movie. The special effects were not that special. I believe that I can get the consequences of what I have in the house so well. I wish I could say something nice about this movie, but I'm afraid I won't. Even Coolio should be ashamed to appear in such a turkey. After a little thought I had one thing to say about this movie - it ended.
