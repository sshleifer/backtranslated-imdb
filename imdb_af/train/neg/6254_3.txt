A friend of mine was in the cast as a FEDS agent (a non-speaking part, as I recall). He brought it to DVD so I could see it. It was "interesting", but many felt like an amateur movie. A well-made amateur movie, though. Really boring and poorly written. It was probably fun to get involved and involved, but it certainly did not earn a wide release. Perhaps in Omaha they would enjoy it, but this California girl was bored and honestly embarrassed by my friend's involvement. <br /> <br /> If this movie maker made or made more films, he really should try to have a very interesting story line and good actors. I'm sure it was a good tool for them. I wish them luck in the future and hope they can improve their film production.
