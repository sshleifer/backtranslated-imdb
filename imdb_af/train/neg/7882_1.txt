After stopping at the movie shop to see something, we stumbled upon this. It seems like it's calling for the summary, at least so we tried it. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's actually enjoyable! Oh, wait, talk too soon. <br /> <br /> Somewhere there, the movie was a disgusting turn in fundamental, right-wing Christian brain. Not quite sure what is happening, but I think the scriptwriter found God somewhere. He wrote this script and did not have time to change it because he had a KKK meeting to come with his friends from the Westboro Church and his hood was not clean. <br /> <br /> Can they give warnings? I refuse to support this religious idiot. Many like video games have rating systems, movies need some sort of symbol: maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to make a turn worse. <br /> <br /> Unless you share it Sentiments with whatever moron this story has, will open your Bible in your lap while you see it and plan how you will transform your neighbors, don't waste your time. These are some of the worst rubbish that has come out in many years, and the radical religious nuts no longer need funding.
