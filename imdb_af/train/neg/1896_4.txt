This movie shows us nothing original. Every idea or (action) scene can be found in many previously released films. Fabulous Nick is completely clear here. Even Patton will be calm and angry or good. Mr Duvall is ok but has a very small portion. So does Angelina, so how can we determine her newly awarded stars? Overall there are too many characters, so no one and nothing special is detailed. This makes the movie easy to forget. Too bad, don't you think?
