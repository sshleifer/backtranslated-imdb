The producers made a big mistake with Mark Lester, who could not act or sing in the title role. Apart from his very bad "play", all Lester's songs had to be baptized by a girl. I don't know why they didn't throw him at all, because there would have been so many boys who could play the part infinitely and did their own singing. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, who was only 16. The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is definitely much better than Jack Wild ever. It was obvious politics to award these old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the turbulent events of 1968.
