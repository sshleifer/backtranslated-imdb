There are many things about Helen and nothing is good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play mothers of some Leopold & Loeb as murderers moving from mid-west to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, a starstruck Jean Harlow wannabe, makes a children's dance studio and Winters is her piano player. Soon Winters (like Helen) starts to crack. It's been very slow, and although there are moments of real creepiness (terrible calls, a visit by wino Timothy Carey), the movie is without any real horror. Nevertheless, it is always worthy of entertainment. The acting divas are fine and the production values ​​are great. A music score by David Raskin, cinematography by Lucien Ballard and Oscar nominated costumes adds a lot. With this, a spot in the sun and lolita on her credit, does anyone crazy and winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master of this type of non-A-film exploitation. In addition to Carey, the Oddball supporting role-player Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (as a lot of Aimee Semple McPherson such as evangelist), Yvette Vickers and Micheal MacLiammóir (Irish Orson Welles) as Hamilton Starr, nicknamed hammy.
