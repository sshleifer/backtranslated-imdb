I just can't stop laughing !! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But no matter, it's very entertaining! In this movie you don't have to give anything! The acting is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, my, I could see the stick that T-Rex holds for a moment.) The raptors are the same of the Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is also the same, but ... in a few scenes seem to be slightly filled and it looks like a child's failure. Action is fast, sometimes too fast, actually I'm talking about quick editing. They edited it so quickly that we couldn't see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! too late they are rubber! Well, just interesting things here are to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... don't rent ... watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more entertaining!
