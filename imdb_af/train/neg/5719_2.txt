This movie is much like the movie Hostel, except with * BAD * acting and not much stress. The gore elements are there, but you don't really feel like the characters, and don't make the violence very effective. Some parts are just strange ... like forcing a snake to someone's throat. How about this? Is it supposed to be terrible or greedy? It's just stupid. As far as torture is concerned, there really isn't any (except that the guy is blown in the beginning, which they don't show anyway). The main bad guy still says, "Let them die slowly", but the butcher kills them all very quickly. Death is all relatively fast. Yes, I watched the "unrated" version. So, overall, not the worst gore movie I've ever seen, but not good at all. You will miss nothing if you hit this one.
