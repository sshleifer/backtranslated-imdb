this movie has it all; the thin camera works, reminiscent of martin scorcese or oliver stone, the stiff action of 'heat', the explosive action of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic sense of saying 'the godfather 'br /> <br /> The judge's character shows a fiery temper, but also shows real emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me of the depiction of Robert de Niro's portrayal of Jake La Motta in a furious bull. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are truly breathtaking, not since Bullit's film portrayed such high octane but stylish car screens. The special effects push the boundaries of technology and film filming to their limits. Independence Day has the standard that this movie has clearly played out and far exceeded. <br /> <br /> Overall, great acting from his list (such as an oscars night party invitation list!), classic venues, enticing action, and a stiff writing.
