This topic deserves a much better script, and the final result, than this movie serves. The script is full of holes, as it has never been a story, but rather a series of nightmare scenarios are loosely knit. The gaps and loose points in the story line are numerous. The victim's kidnapping scene is told that her parents are not dead and looking for her since she was taken is not bizarre. It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for renaways who gave her a "missing poster" when she was eight. In the real world, if the head of a sewerage shelter found out that he had a solved kidnapping under his roof, that which had to be followed immediately would have called the police. It's a law enforcement issue, not a 12-minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is so short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for pure, free exploitation. Funny, this is what this movie should be condemned. In the end it seems to be.
