It's a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice and sucked the storyline! There might be a funny joke, it's stupid and it's boring. Throughout the short film I fell asleep and wondered when it would end. <br /> <br /> Nobody acts on people, and everyone does dumb and ridiculous. Rob Schneider, who acts like an animal, is not something I would pay to see. It looks funny, but the bottom line: Don't waste because you have a short and temporary music. <br /> <br /> I wondered when it would end, even if it was short movie. In the beginning we thought it would get better; but it gets worse. Dumb, all the way to the end. I walked out of the theater, and I will remember that movie as extremely bad. <br /> <br /> The author and co-producer of this movie is a Simpsons TV writer, but it's nothing like The Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!)
