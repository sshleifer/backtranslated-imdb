I'm a big fan of B5, who only caught three at the end of the season. I have been faithfully watching all the previous seasons when it was syndicated and decided that it was one of the most thoughtful story bows ever to hit television. Even the stuffing episodes were interesting. The movies were also well-produced and entertaining than anything to hit the theaters. <br /> <br /> What brings us to the 'River of Souls'. Of course, after seeing everything, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen appears to be in an Ed Wood movie rather than a serious Science story. The story itself may have looked good in form, even in the storyboard. Of course, it suffers when it's time to fill out this idea in a two-hour movie. There are no special effects to entertain us in the total absence of a compelling story. There are places where they apparently were short-lived and only improvised the dialogue to fill out the story. If it made the regular season, it would have appreciated among the worst of the episodes.
