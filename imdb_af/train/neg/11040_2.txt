You should watch this show once to see them all. The formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something as he meant well, but he upset his wife, in the end she finds out what he did, was really for her, she stroked his cheek and gave a nice smile as he watched fiercely. In fact, the story lines are so paralyzed and formulate that I will now take a sting. <br /> <br /> Episode 'Valentines Pay' <br /> <br /> Jim's wife noticed that Jims disappeared every week, he explained to her that he had lost it at the casino. She screamed and let the house complain about how terrible he was. Then he appears on Valentine's Day in a limo with tickets for a ball (to explain the missing wages). She realizes 'Her' mistake and the usual 'Oh Jim, you're so nice'. .. The End <br /> <br /> Another very obvious item is the fact that Jim's character is based on Homer Simpson who can escape as a cartoon character with a warlike and ignorant, when attempted become with people who do it Not working and Jim just comes over as an arrogant self-centered jerk. <br /> <br /> IMO the only reason why it is successful is simply because we are so much in terms of People with TVs. Today you can make a show about a man who insulates walls and you want to get an audience. <br /> <br /> "Two and a half men" on the other hand are fantastic and hilarious.
