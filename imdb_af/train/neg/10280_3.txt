Did HeidiJean really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Dull, slim and completely lacking in imagination and heart. I was watching the movie wondering who the hell thought Carly Pope could play in this movie! The woman has no traceable personality and gives a very slight performance. Baransky was as good as usual and gave the only interesting interesting thing. Probably her involvement was the only reason why this project was green to start with. Perhaps I expect too much for a lifetime movie that played 15 days from Christmas, but I sat through this thing thinking that with another director and a review of JJ with an actress who could at least sympathize with it was quite a cute little movie. .
