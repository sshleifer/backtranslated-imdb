WARNING! Don't even consider watching this movie in any form. It's not even worth downloading from the internet. Each piece of pornography has more dust than this wasted celluloid piece. So-called filmmakers have absolutely no idea how to make a movie. They couldn't tell a good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to any human being. If you are looking for a fun movie, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Let's hope Mr. Unterwaldt (Jr. is a good indication of his obvious inexperience and intellectual infirmity) dies a slow / painful death and never makes a movie again. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's even a waste of time to write something about this crap, so I'm stopping now and looking at a good movie.
