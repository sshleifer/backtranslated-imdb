Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a way to produce the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most easily-offensive viewers who mean CBC 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and so mortal, I can't believe it. The performances are very hammy and over-maintained, but I don't violate the actors, since those kind of one-dimensional stereotype characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked and asked. Many lame jokes show they tried to present as 'controversial', it's less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
