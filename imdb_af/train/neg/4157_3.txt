The above was a much more appropriate title when my suicide suspects and I decided to look at this masterpiece of modern bullshit. Erotic, Scary, Suspenseful, Good Day, this is all this movie fails to be. <br /> <br /> However, it's incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to one of the greatest comedies I've seen in recent years. And yet this film doesn't even try to be funny and it is one of the great achievements of the movie. It becomes a comedy without even trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The movie is an old man who looks amazing Santa Claus is about to plow over zombies and smash vampires into the ground. It failed me to believe the title of the movies. If it was vampires against zombies, why were the vampires and zombies not fighting? Oh yes whatever, except there were more errors on this rental than the title. Like this one; There is a virus that America is creating diseases such as creatures that go around, acting much like your average tourist. And yet there are only four zombies in the whole movie. Another problem is that, apart from a shop, everything is deserted. Certainly, you will see that zombies rotate a little in the woods or in the background. In fact, I believe they have traveled over and over again in a forest world, as they did not have a high enough budget to roll into a wider area, whether the director did not film his precious time in different areas of timber he was putting in a trailer to bump into, with such trivial issues. <br /> <br /> In fact, the director had so much fun doing that he didn't have enough time to throw a big enough or even an editor. And so he told the eight cast members to dress as different people and tried not to behave unobtrusively, assuming he changed his name and cut it randomly on the film. "Editing is not a hard work anyway?" The only reason this "movie" found it in our pocket was because it was somehow confused with Freddy vs Jason, strangely how these things happen, it's not. And the only way we made it at night was to attach gas masks and tie them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this deceptive debris. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, we laughed at the end, but I do it a lot when he lost his common sense ................. ..
