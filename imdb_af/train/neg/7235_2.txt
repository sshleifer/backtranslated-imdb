Not even Bob Hope, guided by a series of fine character characters, can save this poorly written war-time comedy, as his patented timing has little to do. The plot involves a Hollywood movie star, Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II, followed by his involvement by accident in a confused attempt at a colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour) to hear. Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, portrayed by Eddie Bracken, engage him and the three are involved in various escapades related to exercises filmed in Malibu, California, hills. Paramount budgeted well for this effort, using some of his top specialists, but direction by the usually reliable David Butler was slack, and it should be attributed to a missing comic element in the scenario. A move to the end of the film to create a heroic opportunity by Bolton is still born with poor stunting and camera activity in evidence. Strange, Lynne Overman gets the best lines and this veteran master of the snare do them very well. Dorothy Lamour looks beautiful and also acts, and it is always a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb as her father, whose voice is unique on the screen or radio, but there is little they can do to make this movie save, cursed as it is with a script command error.
