This movie is easily one of the worst I've ever seen. And I don't mean it in a good way. We wanted to see a crazy horror / thriller, so we chose the one that was the best in the store. For once, the movie was everything we expected. And more! (or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> The actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by placing the red door nip plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we see through the eyes of the killer rats. And the writing? Don't even start writing me ... And just when you thought it couldn't get worse, the first part of the movie seems to be Oscar material compared to the end. <br /> <br /> Take it from me, this movie is hilarious if you're into crazy horror movies, but if you want a good movie, keep going. It's not for you.
