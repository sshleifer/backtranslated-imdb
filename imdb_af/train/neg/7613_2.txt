The small California village of Diablo is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff Robert Lopez unleashed an old box. According to him, the box known the sixteenth-century Mexican devil, named Azar. FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate the murders and co-operate. The Sheriff's daughters, Dominique and Mary, fight with the evil and bloodthirsty demon. "The legend of Diablo" is an absolute rubbish. The movie doesn't have any fear and fears, the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad. The animation is the only aspect of the movie I enjoyed. I'm a big fan of indie horror flicks, for example, I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch". Unfortunately, the legend of Diablo is a great misfire.Definitely one to avoid.
