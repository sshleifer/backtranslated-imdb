Edward Montagne's tattooed alien is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed for taste. Instead, it's a poor act, witless look at low budget and uninspired movie. The plot is absurd and the acting is extremely tight and amateurish. John Miles, who had a fairly resume in the industry, has horrors and guffaws throughout, and everyone has the same acquisition as characters in a government movie slip on driver safety. The film expects it to be in 1950 such as 'Leave Beaver' and 'Father Know Best'. In New York's unnatural healthy vision in 1950. Why doesn't the viewer even see someone sticking out a cig until some good women are fed? in a flophouse halfway through the movie. The only thing the movie goes for (except for its shortness) is the excellent location shots coordinated by William Steiner. The film's low budget works in the filmmaker's movie, as the viewer is treated with well-formed shots of New York City's interiors and extensive exteriors. Unless you want to enjoy the movie for the choice of settings and camera angles, I suggest you watch almost any other movie.
