I think it's Jack's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer he is, but empathy comes at a price like all things. If he is surrounded by mediocrity, he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one. He's a joke as a mafia hit (also because the part doesn't suit him, he's so elaborate) and just grazing avoids fooling himself. Kathleen Turner had a very long career. being tall and blond, because her acting ability is limited to the thing she does with her eyes, when she opens wide, of which she is convinced, is so damn sexy and Anjelica Huston is absolutely the same (which is made interesting) everything, just like Robert loggia. <br /> <br /> The movie is a lame concept (and it's the only mention of the cloth they call scripts) of a gangster movie, with a role that is probably only interested in party to come faster (they probably collected the party elite). What did they shoot in one day? Because that would be the only explanation.
