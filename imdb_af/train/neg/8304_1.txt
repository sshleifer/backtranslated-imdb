A Christmas story is one of many people's most beloved movies. ACS was able to take the viewer at a time and place in such a way that very few movies ever had. It has a sweetness and goodwill for what is scarce. <br /> <br /> So I followed up (and waited) for the successor, "It Runs In The Family". The movie is almost released, a few times, just to be pulled at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF was (and I think) a total failure. <br /> <br /> The sets and cinematography were just fine, but directing completely missed the point. The film was nothing but a cash flow formula of lazy decisive, lazy writing, and disconnected acting. <br /> <br /> The narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of America's great humorists and storytellers, forced us to make a false repetition of the warm white he used in ACS. He has over-emotions, and why did he do what I would never know. He managed to become an annoying, overwhelming parody of himself. <br /> <br /> The writing and acting in IRITF is illegal and forced. The actors may have seen ACS, but whatever the whites and nuances that were in ACP shouldn't be registered on any of them. The acting was embarrassing and robbed of any of Shepard's dry humor. <br /> <br /> ACP will always be a real treasure, but calling IRITF a successor is insulting all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
