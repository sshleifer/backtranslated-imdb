This indicates a French film, LOL, with the emphasis on young girls with many older men ... why is it so French that is so fixated on this kind of thing? When the age difference is so great, it really gets so dirty! Valentina Cervi is beautiful (she has a strong resemblance to Olivia Hussey, of Zeffirelli's '68 Romeo and Juliet, in a similar period), but she looks about 15 and the play Tassi plays, her painting instructor, looks ... well, 50 is KIND. <br /> <br /> Other posters did the job of explaining the historical record (exceptionally detailed in this case) of the true Artemisia, a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period (17th century ). Her story speaks to us in modern times, especially because of the age-old accusation that "all great artists were men". She puts out the allegations of bits, and because the story of her rape trial is so offensive. Not only was she clearly assaulted and forced into a humiliating sexual relationship (because in those days marriage to your attacker was the only way to avoid social shame), but Tassi was a rapist and possibly killed his wife and child . <Br /> <br /> The movie makes a terrible despair by reversing this truly fascinating and remarkable story - very dramatic and no need to make a "spicing" - because in a strange Frencified way it is " hotter "to have a well-known teenager who signs male sexual organs and a warm love affair with a man who is old enough to be her grandfather. It is "sexy" - the truth is boring and looks too feminist / politically correct. <br /> <br /> It also disturbs me that it's only part of Artemisia that is interesting enough to film. The fact that she has been painting for decades (her famous painting by Judith Holding Holfernes was not painted before the rape), that she was the first woman to be admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy, that she still had children. boring things. After all, it's about a middle-aged woman and they're not "hot" like teenagers. <br /> <br /> I understand there is a very creative license to make a movie (or book) of a true historical character. You need to create dialogue, have subplots, create dramatic structure. Certainly some details can be sacrificed - it's not a big problem if the dates are moved a few years, or if Artemisia is played by a blonde actress (when we know from her self-portraits that she was a brunette ... and a big leg one, not a skinny minny), or something. But turning her story around her, and rape in a romance is actually sick and disturbing. It's even worse because the director is female. She must be terribly ashamed of herself. <br /> <br /> If you like (and I know some people can give less about the right woman artist and just like costumes and hot sex), you'll probably like "Dangerous Beauty" with Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack . Equally based on heavy rewritten history, with many trees and jewelry: Bon Appetit!
