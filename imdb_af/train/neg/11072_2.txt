Sat in the night on television. Yes, I can hear what you say about this one. This is probably categorized as one of those stereotyped TV series. In all fairness, the story line has turned fine, and you might say, "Well, that's not what I expected." But, as a movie, well, it's not easy to see a redeeming element. Casting, acting, camera work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there is nothing to congratulate. Rated R ?? Oh, that scene. Did we need it? This is a movie you can watch and then forget that you even watched. And what was the title again?
