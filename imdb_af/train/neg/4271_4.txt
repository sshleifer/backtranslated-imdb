Typical thriller has been done many times before. Simple plot sketch; cop Liotta is obsessed with Russell's wife, and he tries to bump good uncle Kurt so he can have her. It's not predictable, it doesn't even try to guess, the plot is the plot and there is no thinking outside the box here. Then I think the only reason to look is to see how it develops, but nothing is original or interesting. There isn't really anything to say about this movie, it's not very bad, but no good points either. Russell plays Russell and you know what to get if you see him in a movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an annoying Cher-esque voice. I read the plot and I could see the movie in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I watched it and it spread out before my eyes, just as I thought. I didn't feel a drop of emotion at all. I have no feeling for this movie, it's like I never looked at it. Considering this, it's a pretty senseless movie isn't it? Still, I give it 3/10 for some reason.
