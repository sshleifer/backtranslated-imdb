This true story of Carlson's Raiders is more of an Army training film than anything else. Obviously, it is quickly put together on a minimal budget over the only thing it should recommend, is an early performance by Robert Mitchum, who is the only decent actor in the film, and real footage of the wreck in Pearl Harbor who gets your blood boil, as it was meant to do.
