The IMDb guidelines stipulate that you should state whether your comment contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, this whole movie is something of a fairy tale ... a warning story that glorifies what warns it, a story of lost youth who doesn't know where it's going. <br /> <br /> I just saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival. This movie was not only bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is inconsistent, the characters are the most in-depth clich√© offers, and farnsworth's play was particularly bad. <br /> <br /> From the patronizing accent to the relentless plot line to the place 'graphic' elements to the repetitive dialogue and scenarios ... it sucked the big one. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for a more edgy, up-to-date "drugstore cowboy" with some natural-born killers, but it's not as sensitive to characters as the former and not true or shocking (beyond some levels) than the ladder. <br /> <br /> more than anything, someone really needs A) edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are a few things to continue and clear <br /> <br /> trade with a worthy subject ... if ham-given in the effort.) B) edit the movie. if cut to a core, it is possible. <br /> <br /> I will go below 1 if I can ... like maybe zero kelvin.
