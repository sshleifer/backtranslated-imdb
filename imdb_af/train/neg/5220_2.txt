A young basketball game professor of genetics is researching the genetic sequence, using human fetuses. He hopes to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He is under pressure to close his research because he has not published. The university has problems financing it. He does a trial injection on a monkey who dies quickly. He then tries it on himself. He started a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little one; she is the one who demands the results of the research. <br /> <br /> Initially, it has no effects from the injection, except for a new power. He then realized that he had some memory loss and began to remember what had happened. In addition, he started very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Since the film is called metamorphosis, it eventually changes into something else. You will not believe your eyes - or what he has changed, or the absolutely crazy costume the actor wears to portray what he has changed. Incredibly, there is a further change in the store. The end of the movie is really very absurd. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie is about is that Laura Gemser is in it, but she has a very small portion. <br /> <br /> Once I saw a video box for this with a plastic mold glued into the box. Perhaps it might even have had some electronics in it, maybe eyes that were light (the main character's eyes sometimes turn green in the movie). The copy I watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue was kept on the plastic, which was removed. The curious box, if it was still, would be the only reason I would have had on this movie; I'm definitely getting rid of it.
