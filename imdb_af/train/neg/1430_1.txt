While slamming through the channels on a late Saturday night, my friends and I stumbled across this movie. First, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American? Seriously?! His accent broke so much, though his character seemed to be Scottish. Then I was amazed to find that this film was made after he had played James Bond / Agent 007 twice. This film plays the stereotypes, with the inspirational professor figure. The girl who played Pony has to be paid to keep her mouth shut. And, this movie won an award? I can not believe it. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we wanted to look our eyes after we only watched it for 10 seconds. We switched from "Kicking and Screaming" to this one, and we wanted to call back. Earlier in the night, we watched the 1995 children's classic "The Indian in the Cupboard", which also discussed the Iroquois. The following rule represents our desire to run away: "Take me outside, the earth lawn." From "Gray Owl": "If you don't like it, you don't have to look."
