Anyone familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time. There are a lot of movies I don't like because I have the urge to revise for an incomprehensible reason. However, if someone is to know the name of the worst movie I've ever seen, look no further than Transylvania 6-5,000. Without question, it takes the title of the all-time no. 1 horrible movie. I can't believe I really made it from the beginning! <br /> <br /> It is clearly meant to catch the taste of Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein, but where the movie was a funny take on horror movie traditions, this one is a desperately tense and wrong attempt to wring of embarrassingly weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr. are ashamed to be here as a few journalists in modern Transylvania here (maybe they realized early on that they were doomed in this death). During their research they encounter all the main samples of previous horror favorites, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can boldly push this movie to the end can pray that a game be driven by their heart to relieve them of the agony of boredom. It points to a career for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way, it results in incredible entertainment.
