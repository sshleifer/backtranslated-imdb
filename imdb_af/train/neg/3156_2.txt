I just want to make one thing clear - I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really leaves him down. His acting is still fantastic, he is still as charming as ever, and he still looks good. But the movie itself is a rubbish bin! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say this, come across a little male ... you're always waiting for her to run with her best friend, whose own sub-story is a bit strange. My family and I (who sat down and watched the movie with me) were also moved through the soundtrack to the movie; Sometimes the music does not match what goes on in the scenes. However, this was not the worst aspect of what I saw as a very disappointing movie. I could forgive the front lady's slaves, I could forgive the freaky characters thrown into the mix and I could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment but whose choice was to cut out the whole middle part of the movie and hit straight to the end ??? Of course, the end was planned from the beginning, but how it affects them is incompetent. If you're a Michael Vartan fan, skip this movie: buy yourself a poster instead.
