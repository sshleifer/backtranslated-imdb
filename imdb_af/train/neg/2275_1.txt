A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre loose Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as a head start. For the dubious benefit of an English soundtrack, we endure Tom Cruise's soulless performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but we usually get a character among us to keep our interest. His empty posture ignores any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is a acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor from enriching his appearance of character with verbal and body enriching language. Cruise's masking only accentuates her insufficiency as an actor. See the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes!
