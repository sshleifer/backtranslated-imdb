I admit that I became a hippie age, I'm a sucker for this kind of movie. I can enjoy the shock of the hippie genre much more than most "ordinary" people. However, this movie is just terrible in every way imaginable. <br /> <br /> Every trite perception of the hippie ability is presented as a gospel, police kill a young long hair when he lands a plane peacefully. This movie is so horrible that it is not even funny to watch as a mop on the remains of hippie drones. It's like a left-handed version of Dragnet, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave it two stars was because there were some obscures of interest on the soundtrack. In addition, I couldn't find a choice for negative stars. <br /> <br /> No actors, almost no plot, sheeze, barely even a script ... you have it, an "art" movie .... All this done at root canal drill inertia, drag every meaningless scene just to fill time. <br /> <br /> In a bizarre twist of life after art, the star's "nonactor" joined real life in a congregation and robbed a bank in Boston. One of his co-robbers died and he was sent to jail where he was killed in a suspicious weight loss. "accident" ..... and just think he should leave it as a legacy.
