It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched this movie with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there wasn't a single similar character. I could see more entertainment statically. I only gave this movie 1 because the scale did not enter negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
