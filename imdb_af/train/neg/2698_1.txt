This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays white and other races that are not blacks than the evil that exists in our education system. How quickly he forgets that it is the same education system that made him what he was and failed in it. Ice Cube's character is the hallmark of an offensive black man who was responsible for the most violence in this movie. Singleton barely touched the relationships between white and black characters trying to reach out to each other. When Omar Epps says, "I have to be with my people," that racist remark spoke. And John didn't think for a moment that Thomas Jefferson's picture in the tower did not get my attention. Nice touch!
