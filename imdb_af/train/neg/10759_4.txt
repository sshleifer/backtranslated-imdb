Despite the huge future design, the smart Asimov premium, and Will Smith's reliable cooling performance, this movie doesn't live up to expectations. The clich√©s come thick and fast; (awake from a repetitive nightmare, maverick policeman recalled his badge by hardass lieutenant, to list more, it would spoil - you could see the end a mile). This movie is also on stage - you never feel you have traveled anywhere; which is supposed to be a global disaster never leaves a natural CGI Chicago. The robots themselves are in close proximity, but the 'crowd' scenes look more like a bad Disney CGI is over and over. And if you can destroy the robots by hitting them, why should they inject 'nanites'? You know it's a duff movie when stupid questions start to bother you before the climax. It could have been good, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the completely predictable plot of the action movie of the past forty years.
