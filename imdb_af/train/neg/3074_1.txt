Even for the cocaine-cut 1980s, it's a pathetic one. I don't understand why anyone wants to waste celluloid, time, effort, money and hearing brain cells to make such foolishness. If you are going to make a comedy, make it funny. If you want to waste such a trash, keep it to yourself. Release it as a joke as follows: DO NOT !!! I mean, it was a joke right? Someone please tell me it was a joke. please.
