This movie became extremely silly when things started to happen. I can't care less about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so annoying, and the foremost actor (forgot his name) also came to my nerves. Can't quite remember how it ended and so on, but the whole idea of ​​strangers who had human bodies and that everyone was just foolish in this movie didn't take things quite away. My dad told me it was stupid movie ... I had to listen to him.
