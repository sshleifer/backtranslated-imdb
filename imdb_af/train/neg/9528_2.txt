There is a lot of torture today. That's all this movie is. It's about a good person who makes a bad decision. Due to his friendliness, he became vulnerable to two psychotic women. From then on, it's just a kick-on attack on him. I don't know what point you're doing about it. There is a woman and a child out there somewhere; he has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there had to be a few times when he could act. The movie looks like someone's joke. I supposedly had a bit of fixation on the likes of these two in the wake of the Manson murders. Still, why would anyone make such a movie? What appeals have it except for sadism. The conclusion is completely unsatisfactory, but it could be corrected with an obvious plot twist. Oh, well. Another hour and a half of my life.
