** SPOILERS ** I hired "Thesis" (or "Thesis" in English) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar's later attempt "The Others". Based on what a brilliantly measured and terribly effective creepfest that movie was, I assumed his previous efforts would be of similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead, I have the most boring, horrible excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie I have seen since the German movie "Anatomy" (which reminded me of this one). <br /> <br /> The plot has potential, but it is discarded within the first 20 minutes. It is about innocent n-beautiful psychology student Angela (Ana Torrent - a Jessica Harper deadringer) thesis on the subject of violence in films. To stupid some far-reaching circumstances to go in here, she is in possession of a sniffing tape on which two men torture, maim and kill a young girl for the camera. Angela, and her horror buff friend Chema (Fele Martinez) are both shocked, but have been interviewed by the band and decided to go to the bottom of whose responsibility it came. <br /> <br /> It leads to ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never really give a reason why they want to find the girl's murderers (as they definitely refuse to contact the police during any of the unfolding events, even when their own risks are) and The riddle itself is as limp as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls. There is only one proper 'idea' (the kind of camera the murderers use is discovered) and that's a) a very poor one and b) in the first 20 minute wheel off. The rest of the so-called "unraveling" is only due to blind happiness, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a SLOW of terrible, transparent and thoroughly useless red herring run out only during the visit. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenabar may know his ghost stories, but he clearly didn't read a book in his life. The key to a good whodunnit is to have a large group of potential suspects and eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and gradual discovery of more and more evidence before turning on the final turn. In "Tesis", * POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD *, the killer's identity is almost immediately guessed by the amateur detectives, and then we get 100 minutes from the writer, trying to pour out the scent until he runs out of ideas, she throws hands up and says, "OK, you have me, he was!" Like any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - not so lucky. You look at the wrong movie if that's what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> The only thing "Tesis" dragging on beyond just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it really tries to make a little ridiculous, confused "point" about violence films. I have no idea what attitude it is trying to tackle the subject, but it seems determined to catch up with a ton of deceived, confused psychobabble, and say, "Look at me I'm political! " The final scenes, in which the "point" of the film is thought to be hammered at home, are so absurd and puerile, it can't help but wonder if Amenabar is now ashamed to look at it. If he doesn't, he must definitely. It's a total 'amateur night at the treasure house'. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't believe I've spent two hours (it feels like at least six). I just hope something can happen. The urban legend of sniff films (and that's basically everything they are, despite the way this film is trying to propose is a kind of criminal phenomenon the world is doing!) Is an area so in a good horror can be exploited. movies ("Videodrome" anyone?), but it's so easy to step across the line in childlike "wouldn't it be cool than!" field with it (ie: "My Little Eye") ... "Thesis" saves an all-time layer for the snuff movie genre. At each level, this one better death is dead and buried. I'll give it a 1 out of 10, for some nice lighting, but that's all it gets.
