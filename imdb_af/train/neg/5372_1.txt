One wonders why this picture was made: the plot as such is quite incredible, if not ridiculous, the characters (experienced wage cop versus younger, very fascinated) reasonably predictable, the end completely dark and impossible to understand ( maybe after several views but you have a masochistic tendency for it, the idea is to read the book to fully understand what it's about) and the acting is bad. Was the basic idea to show that French filmmakers are able to do both Americans in the genre and the seven and the silence of the lambs? If so, it's a total failure. It was quite a success (and has a kind of cult status as the first French serial killer movie) and it seems to be a good product to perform. Strange.
