Although I was not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was amazed when I saw his name in the 'Joshua' opening credits. Heck, I wasn't even aware that he was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it goes without saying, I watch the movie based on the movie, not the clues. A kind of 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Omen' or any other demonic children's movie 'Joshua' is billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow, and flat. Still, I continued to see how it would solve everything, and hopefully the end of the climax would shed some light on the subject. Well, I admit it did (a little bit), but what a parent closure. And what a low-low budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. A person falls? you do not see the drop, you see someone lying in what appears to be blood. One is hit by a taxi? you don't see it, you see somebody complaining, riding a bike. I'm not sure if it's called 'style' or laziness, or just a lack of special effects funds. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a working son who tries to balance everything, a child? Joshua, who should not be the antichrist and a new born baby daughter crying a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days his life? and what was that about? Are there rats above or is it Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is he just jealous of the newcomer to the family? Will he grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does he drive his family to the edge? I do not think so. They were nuts, and no "so-called" acting could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, no questions have been answered, hardly any open doors. I'm sure the idea might have been possible, but for Pete's will, give me something. Anything. There are still much better kids-to-wild movies to explore. Joshua is more like the Mini-Me of the antichrist.
