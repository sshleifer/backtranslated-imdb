The last Tarzan movie with Johnny Weissmuller (look surprisingly a year after Tarzan and the Huntress) is bad, despite all the trivia you can add to make it look better. It is clear that RKO has taken a great farewell to Weissmuller, who shot in a beautiful environment in Mexico, with a top star of the country (Andrea Palma) and several award-winning filmmaker Gabriel Figueroa. He included the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin. the score. Although it can cost less for filming overseas, it looks more expensive than any other RKO movie in the series, which benefits from Acapulco beaches and real pyramids such as Aquatania and with impressive d√©cor for all scenes related to the temple. from Balu, especially the outside, built on steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann had to remain as director, instead of Robert Florey, who gave it very slowly. Neumann did a good job with Tarzan and the Amazons, Tarzan and the Leopard woman and Tarzan and the Huntress. He completed his career for the classic "The Fly" the year before his death. while Florey became a television director, following a career of some remarkable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimpanzee playing for Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, a turbulent postman who sings terrible songs (which has a Caribbean air in a place that Africa should be and be shot in Mexico!) Drilling and definitely of dubious taste, it was a sad farewell to Weissmuller's Tarzan.
