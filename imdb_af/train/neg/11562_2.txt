Rich widow Anthony Steffen (like Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover, and the British Lord. He brings sexy red-haired women to his castle, where he whips and kills them. Black-booted stripper Erika Blanc (like Susie) gets away temporarily. Mr. Steffen is pursued by woman "Evelyn", who died during childbirth. As a therapy he decides to marry again after meeting a beautiful blonde Marina Malfatti (like Gladys). By the end of the movie they had to dig a few graves. "The night Evelyn came out of the grave" is at least a good title. <br /> <br /> ** Evelyn uscvel dalla tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti
