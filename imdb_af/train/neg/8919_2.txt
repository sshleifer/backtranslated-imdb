I only saw it when it was chosen as a suggestion of my TiVo system. I love Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. In addition, I am a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and it started with the appearance of his 30-year-old cartoon. With both of them I thought it would interest me. I was wrong. Just minutes, and I had the fast forward button. I ran it in about 15 minutes, and thought it was. <br /> <br /> Then I read some of the other reviews here and I didn't give it enough chance. I recorded and watched it again. There are 75 minutes of my life. I'm not coming back. <br /> <br /> I can't believe there are no more bad reviews. Personally, I think it's because it's difficult to get the 10 rule comment minimum. How many ways are there to say it's a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The movie is about being made by a couple of junior high kids ready to disobey the world and think they're joking with breasts, curses, and jokes. The characters are flat. The parody of the "Swinging the Alphabet" is lame, essentially, the sound, by A-E, to hit the obvious curse a "F", and then no idea where to go. The journey through the intestines to the expected landing does not work the first time, let alone the following. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the whole movie you'd expect from someone trying to make "Out-of-South Park" Stone and Parker is unaware of what and isn't funny. It can be great if you are tall. Otherwise it is not.
