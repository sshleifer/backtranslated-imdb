I write this because I somehow felt like Dark Remains was a good movie. Although it's not the worst I have seen, it's definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Poor writing, poor actors and poor directing. Even if they can't afford big names, would it be too much to ask for an attractive main actress? It was painful to watch a simple actress through the movie with her dull performance. The story was a clich√© and poorly written. The special effects were minimal. The "suspense" tricks repeatedly used were difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Dark Remains is no worse than some of the episodes of the Masters of Horrors. But not quite on par with quality movies. Dark Remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss a movie in the genre, even if it is poor. As for anyone else, time should be spent on something valuable - which should be very easy.
