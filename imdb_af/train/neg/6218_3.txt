My thoughts on the movie, 9 <br /> <br /> It wasn't good, not good at all. Visually it was wonderful. I was happy with the pacing, the camera angles, etc. But the characters? eh, kinda mix. Plot? It sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie looks more new to age than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and terrible. Science is not better portrayed. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life to life? Really? <br /> <br /> It's also something my ass bites a bit. Here we created a CGI movie ... created with science ... and they use it to tell us that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters, <br /> <br /> "Well, so now what?" (or something similar). I could not hear it too well because the crowd immediately got up and made a break for the exit. It was an "okay ... it was just scarce enough to sit here for the whole movie, but let's get out as fast as possible!" type of copy. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the footage and nod your head nicely. Any thought, "what's the point?" will suck you out of unbelief and show you the exit sign with longing. <br /> <br /> Good ... SPOILERS follow. <br /> <br /> So, basically, a scientific "creates the machine" that is capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic lives. Bad people use it as a weapon. However, the scientist also realizes that he is guilty. He gave the machine his intellect, but didn't give it his heart. <br /> <br /> The machine goes out on Skynet's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth and ends slowly. However, the scientist succeeds in surviving and making dolls. Everyone has a piece of the scientist's soul. <br /> <br /> The last one, # 9 wakes up and knows nothing about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets each other like himself, # 2. <br /> Well, # 2 is caught by a last surviving robot of the machine. # 9 finds out more like himself and comes out to save # 2. <br /> <br /> They succeed. <br /> <br /> # 9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits perfectly to the device. He puts it in and the machine comes back to life ... out of the soul of # 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> The movie then continues with action scenes with # 9 trying to save its soul-geeked compatriots. <br /> <br /> Eventually they hit and destroy the machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then rains and we see life back to the planet. <br /> <br /> Honey?!? <br /> <br /> It doesn't make sense. Not at all. Why did the scientist want to divide his soul into 9 homunculi? What has it achieved? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why save?!? <br /> <br /> Why did he expect nine small cattle to succeed if nothing else had happened? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight first. At least it would seem to have a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to suck their souls through the machine in the device and then destroy the machine and then release the souls to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to enforce and bring life back without the rest of the crazy steps?
