I bought this movie on blu-ray because it promised great visuals and music. I was also a big fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is very much like Baraka, wide angles, very similar shots with cameras that capture a long time in each shot. Even some of the screens were identical (the street with traffic). While Baraka told a wonderful story, which put nature, man-made environments, spirituality and horrors of the world in an impressive way and with great music, this movie just jumped from shot to shot without converted story, mediocre musical score, and then. ... POOF, it's done! I thought there must be a mistake! History of the world? Half of the movie is Egypt and landscape (looks like Arizona, but I didn't do it). Serious people, it's terrible, rent it if you have to, but don't buy it. The filmmakers should be ashamed to express it.
