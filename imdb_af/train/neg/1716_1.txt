Although it was a TV production, there is absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the final product. This movie had a budget and it had a decision department, so if you are going to make a movie about a real life story and actually put the real story in the title, you shouldn't make an effort. to try to realize? First of all, this movie was cast absurdly. These actors belong in television crews or in the ridiculous lifetime channel movies, and not in a real gangster / criminal story. All about them, from their appearance to their ways, just shouted from the 90's shopping mall-alt-rock-listening generation. What about the writing? Two words describe it - stupid and insulting, and again it sounds too 90s. I don't think the real Clyde Barrow ever said the words, "I'm out of here." It's as if a bunch of "New Kids on the Block" friends have come together and decided to make a real "kewl flick" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know one that will be completely rad and rockin. Well, this sticker doesn't even arrange the rad and rockin's scale. Everything that could be wrong with any kind of movie is wrong here, from the decisive and acting to the editing and music. Every thing is largely wrong ... and it is particularly true that the parties responsible for this horrible turkey had the nerve to put the true story in the title. It is definitely NOT the true story, but even worse, it is not even entertaining as a ceaseless popcorn movie that is accepted in its own terms. As I put in my headline, it is just terribly past words, imaginable at every level. Trust me on this, or look at your own risk.
