Save Mission: Galactica and look at the original Living Legend episodes. The network took parts 1 and 2 from Living Legend and nailed them in one plot with the terrible Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in space, on its own, is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, Galactica, the original Star Trek, then the Revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-made science and syndicated sci-fi.
