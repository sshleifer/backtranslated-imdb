Film begins in 1840 Japan, in which a man kills his wife and her lover and commits suicide. It's a very gory, bloody sequence. Then it jumps to the present ... well 1982 to be exact. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little child move to Japan for their husband's work. They rent a home and - surprise! Surprised - this is just the house where the murders took place! The three dead are like ghosts (the makeup is hysterically bad) and makes life hell for the family. Sounds OK - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between. There is an attack by giant crabs that is just unshakable! They look so fake - I swear I saw the strings pulling one - and mumbling them !!!!! In the first 20 minutes there was a meaningless sex sequence (probably just to show George's body), another one about 40 minutes later (but it was essential for the plot) and a very dull extinction at the end. The battle scene between Albert and Doug McClure should be seen as believed. <br /> <br /> As for acting - Albert was OK because the man and McClure were pretty good as a family friend. But George - as always - is fantastic in a bad movie. She gives this movie a much needed lift - but can't save it. I give it a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing. It's a very boring movie.
