This movie had some good actors in it! Unfortunately, they forgot how to act. I was hoping the movie would get better as it passed, but the acting was so robust that it was doomed from the beginning. Actually, the actors seem to be reading a script all the time. Perhaps it was the Musical score or the Director himself, but one thing is sure that the makeup artist needs another job! The face powder was so thick you could see it on the actors' faces! Wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder it never hit the theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods is ashamed of you for not giving it all to you. The plot was wonderful, just needed a whole lot more.
