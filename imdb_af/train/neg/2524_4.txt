Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br/> <br /> Cast: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Overview: Stuart Gordon which we usually associate with incredible horror films like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, took a little detour here and did a little sci-fi movie. I emphasize the word "small", as it is a very low budget slip, and it contains its greatest weakness. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the future. A world in which the big superpowers (which, according to this movie the United States and Russia are) make their differences, not by engaging in an adult world war ... but by fighting a gladiatorial battle with giant robots. Our hero Achilles must act against the evil Russian robot fighter named Alexander. Very cheap stop motion simulation occurs. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is wonderful, I think. The big nations set up massive territorial disputes? Interesting premises and one that could have been properly handled if the proper budget was available. Unfortunately, what a fun movie can be an embarrassment to another great director. <br /> <br /> I, as a child, loved this movie and I think you would like to enjoy this movie, You have to go back to the little child to have fun. I showed this movie to some of my friends and when the movie progressed to my friends it was like "What is hell, is that a piece of crap francophone?" And I'm just as good, this movie is a sci-fi by one of my favorite directors, Stuart Gordon? "But as the movie progressed in Corny, I almost felt like stopping and not letting them go through that torture. This is because I loved this movie as a child, and there is still a little nostalgia associated with viewing it, but everyone just didn't get it. <br /> <br /> And I realized that the movie wasn't "It's really that good. First, the movie is about giant robots who And to get it credible, you need to use some good special effects to make it work, expensive effects It will help us solve the audience, but unfortunately it is a small-scale movie , from a small-scale company (Empire Pictures, who went bankrupt after this movie was made!). The effects help us just giggle and laugh. sets and some of the wardrobe look unfinished or half-picture. <br /> < br /> OK, once you assume you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and thumbnail, you can give the movie a even enjoying the big robots that kick hell apart. There are some scenes when the robots fight what is so cool, and let me go "that's why I like this movie!" But everybody knows and they, a little bit slightly effect will straighten you out of the protective little cocoon you're trying to hide. And spree, your right to realize this movie, just doesn't meet his point of departure. <br /> <br /> And here's another thing that bothered me a bit from the movie. This movie is basically a movie for kids. Do you know giant robots that clear it up? Stop motion animation? Hello? But this movie dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence became a bit bloody. So I asked myself, is it a children's movie or not? After a while I just came to the conclusion that it was basically a children's movie with adult sensitivity, which is really not a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those who are not so naive, childlike charm doesn't look at two robots fighting each other, and if you don't have a nostalgic connection with this movie (like me), Id asks you get away from this one. Gordon's a good director, but this movie he made just didn't do it for me. Well, at least not now that I'm an adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
