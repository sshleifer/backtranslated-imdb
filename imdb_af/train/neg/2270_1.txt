The only thing that kept me from vomiting after watching this movie was the fact that it was just actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the TV program. It is also the main reason that TV program fans will not keep the movie, but not the only reason. This movie has about as much entertainment as getting a root canal. It approaches the abyssmal depth of the bad film, and then gets worse. I won't waste your time describing this movie further; That's enough to say that I regret watching the poor camera people who had to suffer this first time.
