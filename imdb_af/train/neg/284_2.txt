I just bought today at the 99 cents store, and I still think I've cut down. "Dreaming to believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastic drama and $ 1 is just too freakin 'expensive for this. This movie is probably just noticeable for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It's directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also did Promo Night. Now on the movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a girl named Robin (Played by Olivia D'Abo) who is severely injured by a car accident that also costs her father's life. So the accident avoids getting her into gymnastic tournaments, she is often chosen during her classes and eventually she meets a wild kid named Tommy. (Played by Keanu.) Robin, when he doesn't get training, works part-time with her mother and step sister, at a laundry owned by her abusive stepfather. Eventually she was chosen to compete. <br /> <br /> Overall, Keanu alone and some catchy 80's are what prevent me from giving this one star, and it's not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself does not receive any medals, as it appears to be from an old VHS and at the end the sound is not synchronized and when the end credits are almost over, it fades to black, although sound may still be heard. So it can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork doesn't make sense either, because it looks like recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the wallpaper has nothing to do with the movie, because it's not in the movie itself, so the cover is of course on the photo. In any case, avoid at all costs unless you are a Keanu fanatic. I probably won't hang on to it anymore. I'm probably going to give it to The Cinema Snob, which is a good YT criticism tax. Hey, if any of you have any crappy movies they no longer want in their eyes, feel free to donate to him to run his show.
