Good animation and some workable character development keep this animated horsewire from DreamWorks at least in sight ... but it stays a bit slow and the storyline is a bit stupid. It is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboys and Indian roles, but here it just looks like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper story-making decision. GRADE: C
