I couldn't believe my eyes when I watched this movie. There is no point in it then blood and violence. Unlike other scary films that have meaning and meaning, this movie is just blood, gore and one after another dead. This movie is not interesting at all, has no meaningful plot or storyline and no intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this movie is generally pointless. Don't even waste your time with it. It's just an hour or two of unrelenting violence. It has many bloody scenes that are not terrifying, but only rebellious rebellion. It's probably the worst horror movie I've ever watched from all the horror movies I've ever seen.
