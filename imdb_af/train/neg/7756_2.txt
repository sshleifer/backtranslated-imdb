I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and caught it recently. The sci-fi channel was getting worse, but not much. A shameless ripoff of Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are asleep and consume as many extras as possible. The CGI is pretty bad, and descendants of prosthetic cat heads are laughing. We get a little gore, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it. Unlike Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is not known. Apparently it was shot in Fiji. Nice work if you can get it. Remind me of all the low-budget sample STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
