I read another review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never-ending cycle of marines that killed, murdered, used drugs, and talked about. <br /> <br /> I disagree because the movie really had more on it, but it's a way, I can see what this person is trying to say: it didn't have a real plot - it's a point with which I agree. <br /> <br /> It is self-sufficient Stone at its best. He really wanted to show not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic for those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just a way of champagne, grandmother, Oscar hunting, "let's create a lasting image." <br /> <br /> The problem I have with Stone and other filmmakers of his ilk, that they do not understand this simple concept: the terribly bloody deadly waste depicting, reflecting or even reflecting the war was not an unfair or immoral war. We saw Iraq at the same time. If you miss the point, let me make it clear to you: if you see how really bloody the Second World War was and how devastating it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unfair war? If that fact did not convince you that it was an unfair war, why images of the horrors of Vietnam should convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that case. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support America's decision to go to Vietnam in war, but I certainly do not endorse the "this war is wrong because people have died and suffered" theory. I don't think the motivation is always ignored, just because the war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> It says nothing about the fact that the end or the final big "twist" was a bit stupid. However, it is not Stones first oddball departure. Wall Street was a great movie, up to the last 30 minutes or so, when it made a terrible turn. JFK is probably one of the few films that Stone did. It actually ended very well. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't matter in this one because there was very little plot to the point of the movie to turn around. And that's why I gave it such a low point. It was almost story and finally boring - unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy.
