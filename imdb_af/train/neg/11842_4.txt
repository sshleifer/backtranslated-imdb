Kirsten Dunst is horribly overstated as an actress. You can always tell she's just "acting". However, I like Izzard. Plot is very boring. The viewer has no real connections with the characters, and never knows who to really sympathize with or even care about. Slow, dull film, with a few laughs, but little and not very funny. Plot is not at least spearheading. You can see that every plot turn comes a mile further. What is this movie supposed to be? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? You won't be at the end of this movie.
