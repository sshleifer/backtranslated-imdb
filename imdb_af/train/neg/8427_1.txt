Let's start by saying how much I like the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man who was apparently unable to pursue his dreams because of his excessive, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to see in practice. In my opinion, this is undoubtedly one of the biggest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has me 10 out of 10 ratings without reservation. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie turnaround is a real tragedy in every sense of the word. Almost any of the essences of the TV show are successfully transferred to film. This movie has a very urgent, depressing tone that has hit me almost several times. Since Harold is beaten in a bar (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of ​​comedy, but is certainly one of the reasons why fans of the TV show will not like this movie. The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert was bathing in the basin and being seen by a neighbor. <br /> <br /> The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of the question and it makes me wonder if the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the TV show. In the TV series, Harold always went to respectful girls, not strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert's response to the comments made by Harold's girls was absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the movie Albert says almost nothing when such an opportunity arises. <br /> <br /> Most movie sitcoms from British sitcoms tend to be tough, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES movies (which in some respects were actually better than the TV show itself!) . However, STEPTOE AND SON should stand right at the bottom of the post, even under GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - Skip this one and look at the second spin-off, STEPTOE and SONS RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the TV series, and is actually very funny.
