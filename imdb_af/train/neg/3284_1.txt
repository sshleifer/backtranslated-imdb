Did I see a worse movie? Maybe only "Manos: The Hands of the Level" is dragged more than "Dukes". I had more fun with the giant plot holes than the movie gave me at any time. Let's take some. <br /> <br /> There was a noticeable death and rebirth when Sheev spoke to the Dukes and they didn't respond. He shows and moves on, as neither Knoxville nor Scott knows what he's talking about (nor us). It was like the engine died and started again. <br /> <br /> The few times that General Lee flew through the air was not even exciting. Nothing I didn't see on the TV series. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo was upset at Luke because he stole the girl he loved. The only reason it works is that the script actually does it (though roughly). The rest of the time it looks far and forced. <br /> <br /> Seann William Scott's horrible, horrible accent (or lack of it). <br /> <br /> I hated Willie Nelson's performance. Were bad jokes supposed to be engaging? I wanted him to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson gets great on the big screen. She actually felt like one of the better actors in the movie. It tells you how terrible this movie is. She is a goddess. <br /> <br /> During the climax of the film, I waited for Boss Hogg and the bad guys had pulled out the Hazzard County, with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. An atomic bomb would have been adequate. <br /> <br /> It is not meant to be a cohesive dismantling of the movie, but a release of frustration at the uncomfortable writing and execution of what could have been a real heartwarming movie. br /> <br /> If we can just delete and start over ...
