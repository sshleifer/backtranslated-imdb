I think I watched this movie, but don't quote me as I might have fallen asleep when I watched it because it didn't exactly "grab my excitement and imagination". At least I know I have looked enough of it to know I won't be watching it again soon. Or ever. <br /> <br /> Jeez, talk about lamb ... actually paralyzed. Totally paralyzed. It won't be even six years old. It basically had NO valuable dramatic impact. Nil. Nada. Just call liquor. Comedy? It was supposed to be comedy? Ya could have deceived me ...! <br /> <br /> Now, if the strangers were insatiably carnivorous as in the movie "Critters", we could do the human characters, do something a little more in-depth than excessively smattering, like shouting and shouting and run for their lives so they would not be eaten, so the story could be something more exciting than drying dry. <br /> <br /> Don't bother looking at this. It's not worth it. You can find something more interesting to do. Like to look at paint. Or asleep.
