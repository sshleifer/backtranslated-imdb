The worst movie I've seen for a while. Interesting first half with some engaging, sharp dialogue between dubious characters in a late-night bar. The film then degenerates into a formless sequence of scenes that point to visual shock (read dislike) without any observations or lessons in humanity or anything else. <br /> <br /> I wanted to go out, but the director was present at this show and prevented my politeness from respecting him. Yet time is precious (as the director himself observed in his intro) and I upset the time I wasted in the second half of this one. <br /> <br /> Savings were the three main characters in the first half of the movie, especially the female head.
