Before explaining the 'Alias' comment, let me say that the Desert Trail is bad, even according to the standards of Westerners staring at the Three Stooges. In fact, it contains Carmen Laroux as a semi-bad girl Juanita. If you hear her Mexican accent, you will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita of the classic Stooge card "Saved by the Belle". <br /> <br /> In the desert road, John Wayne plays the Moe Howard character and Eddy Chandler gets Curly Howard. Like their Stooge counterparts, a running gag throughout the 53-minute movie is muddy. Wayne's character, a dress pursued bully, is not very endearing, but is supposed to be the good guy. <br /> <br /> Playing a travel rider cowboy Wayne is holding the rodeo box at gun and taking the prize money he would have won if the attendance was good. The other riders had to be 25 cents on the dollar (actually even less after Wayne robbed the box office). No explanation is given for Wayne's riders of the riders and is still considered the hero the girl gets. <br /> <br /> Things get complicated at this point because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his sidekick Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix who would play Sheriff Micah on television's "The Rifleman") see Wayne rob the then count and steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo driver. Tired and curly is blamed. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to Smith and Jones. Who first meets them, but their old friend, Larry, whose sister becomes the 2nd half of love. (Senorita Rita is left behind the old town and makes no further appearance in the movie). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is beautifully played by a radiantly beautiful Mary Kornman (who grew up, but in her younger days she was one of the original members of Hal Roach's "Our Gang" trousers). Kornman is the editor-in-chief to see the Western and West Scenes, and her plays with Moe and Kruller are much better than any other in the production, as if they were using a completely different crew to film them. <br /> <br /> Even for 1935, the action series in this case are extremely poor and the technical movie show is staggeringly bad. The two main hunting scenes end up with stockpile shots of a rider riding a horse. Both times the editor cuts a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the movie stock is completely different and the character has different clothes than the stunt rider. There is liberal use of stock in other places, and none of them is even convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is a scene in the middle of the movie where Moe and Curly drive their horses and drive away (right) from a cabin while the posts gallop to the left of the cabin . The cameraman follows the two strokes with a slow pan on the right and then makes a sweep to the left to reveal the approaching posts. Outside home movies I have never seen anything like it, because it looks stupid (what it does), but because a skilled director will never set up such a scene. They will film the two riders, and then reposition the camera and film the posts closer than a separate action. Or, if they feel creative, they will drive the camera so that the camera approaches the riders in the foreground and the posts in the background. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
