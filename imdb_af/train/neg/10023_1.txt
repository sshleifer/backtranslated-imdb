Sorry about Yash Raj movies and Aditya Chopra who lost their intelligence over the years and gave a steady performance over the course of the year, it's not even worth appreciating your Tube standards. I dug my teeth all over the movie, started with the schizophrenic direction, a plot line that never quite materialized, and at the last scene I just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati filmmakers were "crazy away" on such stupidity can be. Shame the actors to take this job and even respond to it as a piece of work they can do. Saif Ali Khan - totally disappointed in your choice of film. Kareen shows enough skin for puberty that has been hit and Akshay appears as dull. Anil another delay with a pubic fascination for English. His cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre film that lasted for 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel. Don't waste any brain cells, energy or your money to see it. See / rent AMU - with Konkana Sensharma instead - a beautiful piece of independent film that ever came from India. Intelligent, attractive and a great storytelling story. It will all affect intelligent actors and I hope everything is not lost in Indian theater production.
