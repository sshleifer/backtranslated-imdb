Let's just say I had to suspend my disbelief for Spiderman than I did for Hooligans. That is to say, I have less of a problem believing that Toby McGuire can hold buildings than I throw Elija Wood in Manchester. I won't get in touch, because I don't want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​mature, professional British men who is near death every weekend is good, funny. And this movie is not. The battle, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken too seriously. The gravity of pugilism, the respect with which the subject is being treated, becomes annoying, as it does not create or resolve the conflict. The plot, with holes large enough to drive a Guiness truck, seems to be slapped with a confronted "fish out of water" theme so viewers can watch Woods' tears as he learns how to man to become, ie. hit other young men with opposing football taste with blunt objects and then run away as fast as he can. The characters are cartoon, especially the Americans at Harvard. The character development and story line is linked to the viewer throughout the photo. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the movie does not reach its height, until almost the end, which you will spend almost two hours of your life, you will never get back. Count "The Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this garish and disappointing dud. It doesn't waste time with empty melodrama, the tired old "Yankee in King Aurthur's Court", or crying parables of old. They are just pure, dark and clever fun; The way violence is supposed to be.
