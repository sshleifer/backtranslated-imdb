No real plot for this one, just a series of short sketches that come out of some VERY old jokes. I claped once or twice in the beginning, much to my chagrin. But even in just 73 minutes, this movie is delighted, and gets boring and boring (with a little nudity sprinkled here and there to keep you awake). As bad as this movie is (and it's pretty uncomfortable), it's a comic ginger compared to pretty much. All by Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg (Date movie, Epic movie, Meet the Spartans). Unfortunately, the song is so exciting in a sad way. <br /> <br /> Eyecup: 11 pairs of tits, 3 bushes, 3 asses <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Red DVD DVD's Extra: Original trailer for this movie; and trailers for "Beyond the Door", "Dead Pit", "The Farmer", "Obsessed Ones", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor" and "Wacky Taxi"
