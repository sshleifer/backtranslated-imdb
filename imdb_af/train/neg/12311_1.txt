I know I've added a comment, but I just wanted to explain something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old frogie of the Baby Boom generation who grew up in a shimmering picture by Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason. <br /> <br /> Before I was born, Bilko was 20 years old, but I had the pleasure of discovering Phil Silver's license from BBC2. I wonder if I would enjoy Steve Martin's transvesty if I didn't see or hear Phil Silvers - I don't know. Maybe I would. <br /> <br /> Some of the other reviewers who think this movie are worthy of a '10' acknowledge that they haven't seen the original. I can only encourage you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode. If you go to the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin et al. Still think that Steve Martin's movie is a little over a 2 - I'll give you a pint.
