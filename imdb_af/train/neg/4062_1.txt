Few movies made me feel so uncomfortable, and that's not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (how I end up there, I can only wonder). I was subject to under 90m of hate-related garbage. The main impression was a bit like this other ill movie "Don't answer the phone" - but worse. The nastiness of it all, rape and everything, is shown without distance (unlike strong things like "Last House on the left") and total contempt for the (perfect) victims and everyone involved so the viewer as a sadistic voyeur. In the end, I felt like a shower. No credits to the director
