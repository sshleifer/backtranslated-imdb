Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai", or "Big Trouble in Little China", or "Conan the Barbarian", which is horrible movies that have a certain coolness and self-mutilating humor that makes them cult cultures, The Golden Child not bad. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is not unworkable, and there are a few funny moments. But here's the Eddy Murphy "flip attitude" just a sense of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are stupid enough to do more damage to that tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are rather than forcing. <br /> <br /> Without a feeling that anything is at stake or that the characters face real danger, why should we care? br /> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - great fans of Eddy Murphy who can't help themselves <br /> <br /> - I can't think of anyone else < br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
