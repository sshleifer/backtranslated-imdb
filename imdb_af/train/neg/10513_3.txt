This movie was almost a waste of half an hour of my time. I usually like the cheap horror monster type movies, but this movie was a disappointment. The main mistake is the lack of explaining the beings. When they entered the house and found the man he could rent, they explained. He didn't really say anything about them, except they killed his parents, and unless I missed something, they didn't say how he could escape. Not to mention the fact that it gives no idea or reason why the survivor remains and feeds the creatures essentially to her own death experience. It would seem that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the "cross incident".
