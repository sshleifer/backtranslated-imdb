Revenge is one of my favorite themes in film. Moreso, "the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in film. If I saw Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2002), I expected an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a poor half-hearted effort that explains nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The final scene, a gratuitous male rape / torture scene, came as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy. The movie does not even follow it. Instead, the drawn-out scene (which overcomes the cruelty of the initial rape, both to the extent that it was graphical and to which it was ritually made) is crowned with Dawson's face in an expression of or regret or "It has not nothing restored while the rape of her rapist is heard in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene was not one of shock, but one of confusion about what such a graphic scene was trying to do go to the audience. I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Rejoice in Dawson's revenge? Are we furious with the brutality of it all? Do we feel Dawson's moment of spite? Apart from this failure, the movie is really kind of uncomfortable with more style than fabric, character is thin, dialogue is monotonous, etc. <br /> <br /> Usually I try to take movies on my own, but Descent didn't really know what it was. Thumbs off.
