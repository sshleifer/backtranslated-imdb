The other night I rented this movie because my friend or I had never seen it, even though we heard from a friend how good it was. <br /> <br /> Now I'm pretty conservative in my views, but I knew to go in, it would be pretty liberal, who directed it. I thought before the movie started, Michael Douglas would play a compassionate, popular, liberal lover of the masses, and there would be a staggering conservative opponent than his antagonist. But I thought that's where the political statement would begin and end. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot was solid: Single president falls for a lobbyist. OK, it has the potential I thought to be quite entertaining, as the plot was unique. But then the movie became a liberal infomercial. The film had more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the president and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There were several ridiculous sites in this movie: 1) The character Sydney who plays it six figure lobbyist who is a "closer". Could she have been more brief? She was constantly disorganized and in awe of everything. Almost a "closer". I'm a sales and she can't sell a glass of water to a man who dies of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Is anything more ridiculous when Richard Dreyfuss plays a right-wing fanatic? It is the most liberal man in Hollywood and she plays a right-wing ideologue. Give me a chance. I like how he adopted his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech at the end was simply ridiculous. The line about "I'm a proud card-bearing member of the ACLU" was a joke. First, no president would ever recognize such a thing, an active member of an ultra-fringe group. Secondly, why even bring something up. You have just over half of the movie heard, moderately or conservatively. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was wonderful and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the movie is from a movie to a left-wing political statement, and so the movie failed. It's a disgrace to see a huge plot that is being destroyed by Hollywood to force their political views into the audience
