This movie wasn't nearly as much a task as I expected. There is a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoia festival. Most of the plays are mediocre, but quite typical of the 1970s, which is full of pregnant breaks. A photographer and a model testify to some strange behavior in the forest and soon become the victim of the same action. Aircraft are detected, more people disappear - but are they the strangers or our own government's ultra-secret group of guys? Soon a reporter and a "UFOlogist" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) will be drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as threatening as they are unlikely and relentless. Then the fun really starts. <br /> <br /> The film, predictable, makes about as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but has to be commended for taking it so seriously. The camera work is good for a low-budget movie, the pacing is pretty good, the writing is stupid and absurd, and there are continuity issues that are fun to watch. What are the few seconds of shine I mentioned? Honestly, I can't tell you much without writing a fairy tale. It's enough to say that the end of the movie is at least worth sending quickly if you can't take the drug.
