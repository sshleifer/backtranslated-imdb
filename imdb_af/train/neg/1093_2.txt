Kitten Natividad, of Russ Meyer's film fame, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who found her breast cancer. So she goes to South America to get special fruits (Crockazilla?) That are supposed to have healing powers. After some of these fruits (which look like plastic bananas on stems), Chastity is equipped with some mystical magic powers that make her a superhero, specifically The Double D Avenger. Note that she also wears a mask as a mask. In writing, it all sounds good. In execution, though, it leaves much to be desired. Chastity seems to have a bar and a local strip joint is upset because she removes their business so that some of the strippers (including Haji, also of Russ Meyer filming) go to her to destroy her. Of course, Chastity is fighting back in the cover of the Double D Avenger. Watching her do a "Wonder Woman" type of spin to change her outfit and lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double-flyers fly as there wasn't tomorrow. With the awkward theme song playing over and over, it comes down like a twisted 70's live action kids' adult-themed children's store. Although it's unlimited, it's likely to get worse with PG-13. And it's probably a blessing that the faded stars were well covered. That makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan movies look great in comparison. Special look by Forest J. Ackerman, but so what. Very stupid, and I never buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.
