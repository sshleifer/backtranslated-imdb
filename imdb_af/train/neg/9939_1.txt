The movie intellectuals can drop everything they want about the important (imagined) meaning of this movie, but it's just that: intellectual fool. This film is creatively bankrupt, and some flaws are that it is endlessly self-sufficient. Yes. <br /> <br /> Of course, Godard wasn't a Stones fan. Too bad, because it could have been good. He is capturing the birth of this timeless song, and he rather chooses to cover the music with a guy reading a real detective or a crap. <br /> <br /> Then there are the endless shots of what look like 60's librarians spray paint words on people's cars. And then there is the seemingly eternal "interview" where the actress gave a brilliant command to answer only yes or no to all the deep and intellectual questions. There are a few men in a purple suit, read more crap from a book, going on for, oh, just about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in a junkyard. <br /> <br /> That sounds almost intriguing? Well, it's not. <br /> <br /> But for unwashed movie school hipsters who don't care about the lost opportunities to have full access to the Stones, bring sympathy to the Devil in the world and rather hear some English-speaking readers rather than you look at the cover of Nudie Mag's, this movie is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More accurate ... maybe Godard throws it.
