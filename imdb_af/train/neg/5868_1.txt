Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. Low production values, horrible story idea, bad writing, ill-considered play ... and I can't even set an adjective that is descriptive of how poor Joan River's direction is. I know there is a special place in hell for the people who financed this movie; <br /> <br /> This movie is a train track. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinite) = Rabbit test. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not even funny how bad it is.
