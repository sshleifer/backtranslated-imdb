Wonderful, it's actually very viewable. I mean it's bad. It's really bad. But while the original was so bad, it's worse, my life is bad, it's so bad - it's bad entertainment. Right, that's enough vague praise. Production values ​​are rotten about the board, the acting is exuberant and the Romero-Wannabe satire can't imagine which side of the ecology fence it mocks. Internal logic takes a back seat to heads that drive themselves out of the fridges, virus incubation times that are variable such as the 'plot' require, bullets that work against the zombies or not, zombies that have feelings of speech or not. Gore is the sign, of course, but the framework is so slapdash it is annoying. The dialogue sounds as if it was translated by the same computers that contain instruction manuals, and the scale of the zombie infection is implied with none of the inventiveness of Romero's films. It is all done with a terrible attitude. Absolute litter.
