To make a good movie, you also need excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of the two. In this Eye of the Needle we have none. <br /> <br /> I don't even remember the name of the director. He shouldn't have done much in his career. I love Donald Sutherland, but he can't be the lead in a movie. He falls short. Sutherland is excellent in a movie when he doesn't appear longer than 15 minutes. For example, I would say that Sutherland was excellent in Oliver Stone's JFK when he talked to Kevin Costner on the park bench for 10 minutes without even breathing. Great. But Sutherland is the main actor in a movie, not good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? She is probably good for TV series. The DVD is terrible. Terrible colors. Terrible light. I couldn't even appreciate the painting by Storm Island for how mean photography was. <br /> <br /> This Ken Follett story was good, but it's a shame that they have turned it into an uninteresting movie.
