I was totally disappointed with this movie. I read some of the other reviews here and have much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But this never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here will believe. I learned he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I will rate his performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Acting: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Scripture is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I removed the movie from my DVR at 70 minutes. in the movie. Much better movies out there than this ...
