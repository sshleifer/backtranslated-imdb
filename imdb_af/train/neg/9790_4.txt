At least the under-age set remains interested. Eleanor (Geena Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) Little, a lovely, benevolent couple brought a new little brother to their son George (Johnathan Lipnicki) from the orphanage from the orphanage. They come home with the strange new brother or sister ... a sharp-dressed little boy named Stuart (pronounced by Michael J. Fox). Yes, mouse. Stuart is happy to get the feeling of properity, even if it is in a super-sized world that contains his new family's pet cat Snowbell (pronounced by Nathan Lane). Stuart begins with the experience of family loyalty and overall friendship. George will eventually accept his little new brother if the brave dressed Stuart embarrasses a model boat race. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty and Jeffery Jones. And the voices of: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
