"Tree" has gained a reputation itself. With heavyweights, Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, one might be tempted, how bad can it be? Well, it's much worse than you could possibly imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and disturbing fact of "Boom" is that indicates the decrease and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights. It was just director Joseph Losey who plunged the depths with "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some may like to add "secret ceremony"), managed to recover and create his best work in 1970, the wonderful "Go- Between ". <br /> <br /> The heart of everything is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid-forties to the early sixties, Williams has created a number of plays that have gained classical status, remaining in the repertoire of theater in the world, and many become many vow films. When William's muse left him, probably because of his infamous drug abuse, it left him in the good fortune. Williams at its best is an actor's dream that offers many memorable performances. (Was Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in "Night of the Iguana"?) Taylor especially shone in both "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly Last Summer". There is an anecdote in which Taylor asks John Gielgud to teach her to play Shakespeare. He replied, "If you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams," he said. If Gielgud saw "Boom", he would have kept his tongue. Taylor has never been worse, and has become an impressive achievement. Despite her well-photographed face, she is definitely podgy. Aside from the physical decline, from this time on she will lose faith credibility as a serious actress with a string of utterly forgotten roles (and worse) to her credit. <br /> <br /> Many can be said of Burton the same. Following his short-lived drama stars, he won fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work from this point (1968) would be immeasurable to say the least. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward has long ceased to be a force in the theater where his dressing room comedies have been replaced by the likes of Williams and British "angry young men". He looks like he enjoys camping, but almost manages entertainment, that of the man who claims such a talent. <br /> <br /> The only cast member who maintains her dignity is young Joanna Shimkus, who in a few years will be a promising screen career for Mrs. Sidney Poitier to be. <br /> <br /> "Tree" series of self-care; it is simply out of control. A better sad indicator that careers went wrong, rather than a camp fun party as some suggested.
