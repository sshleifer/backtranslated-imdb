Not a really bad start to the program - but a slap in the face of true law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it attempts to record itself as a reality prize - and is nothing else. Men and women who devote their lives to enforcing laws deserve better than that. What's next, medical school in a minute? Charo performs lipo? Charles Grodin helps with hip replacement? Come ... show some respect. Even the citizens of Muncie are running the program. Police Academy = High School High School? Poor editing (how many times can they use the Taco Bell in the background?), Cheesy siren effects (the same loop added ad nauseum for every "call" or the role code or not) and last but not least - more security issues than what you can attend a stick. <br /> <br /> If I want to see manufactured police and sensible fake police, I'll see RENO 911.
