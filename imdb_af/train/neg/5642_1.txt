This title looks more like a filming exercise than a movie that had to be released to be seen by the public. For Dafoe and his wife, for the first time, it had been fun to work together in a movie, without considering that people could really see it. I felt it was 90 minutes wasted because I was anxiously waiting for a plot to develop or even start. <br /> <br /> Try this movie in a genre and you won't, because it has a beginning, middle or ending. I have previously seen 'arty' movies and it doesn't even come close to arty, abstract or original. It seems to me to be completely useless. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks for itself when the only people who evaluated this movie were a 10-year-old. No doubt the constant senseless erotic scenes that the film insists on throwing at us. This is if you can call it erotic. It certainly did not taste.
