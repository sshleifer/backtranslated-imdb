What a disappointment! I hated the mum, but this one was even worse! It was very tiring and unbelievable and at some point I sighed and grabbed all the time. I can't believe people really like this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very convincing. The whole movie felt like a big tour around America's most sought after buildings. The never-flowing tips and combinations were not very convincing either. I stopped paying attention about 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a happy evening has become a total disappointment. What a mourn ... I think I saw too many movies enjoying the National Treasure.
