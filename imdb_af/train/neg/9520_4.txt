[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] This film's reputation precedes it, so it was with the expectation that I was sitting down to see it in mailbox on TCM. What a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> The movie is excellent and the production values ​​are the first, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin and the whole thing goes on for too long. For a movie dealing with alcoholism, family divisions, infidelity, gambling and sexual oppression, the movie is peculiarly flat, prosaic, lifeless and cliche-driven. One example of this is the portrayal of Frank Hirsch's independence: his heavy-handed request to his wife to "go up and relax a bit" followed by her predictable plea for a headache, leads even more predictably to his nighting with his secretary ("Hey Nancy, I got the blues tonight. Let's go"), all according to a good formula. We do not feel that they are real people, but cardboard cuttings acting in a puppet show. Also, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really investigated or explained. Dave's imagination with the weather / weather Gwen is inexplicable in view of her greasy inability to defuse or get out of the pot. Of course, his subsequent despair of the Shirley Maclaine / Ginny character is doomed to failure, and it was clear - by the conventions of this kind of sepa operation - that it could be solved only by killing someone. The moment the jealous lover started running the rifle, I started betting myself on who would kill - Dave or Ginny. The whole thing was deceptive with a capital 'P'. <br /> <br /> That said, Maclaine's performance and that of Dean Martin are the standouts here. But overall, I find the film's interest to be just that of a Hollywood history.
