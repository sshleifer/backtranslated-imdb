I think it's time for John Rambo to live his life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a sturdier but a cold-blooded killer. Always stop appearing on the screen, somebody dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I was tired of Hollywood it seemed. It's not the worst of the films about Vietnam, but the honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. Anyway, John Rambo, who carries a 50-year-old machine gun, who seems to be half the Viet Cong army, plus a large number of Russians, is an insult to watch. What's worse is Rambos cheesy speech at the end ... Please !! Oh yes, I heard they were making another one ...
