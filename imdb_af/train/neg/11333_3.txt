This movie is just crap. Although the directors claim to be part of the oi culture, it is still a very, very bad direct debut. The subject itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and never before, but the worst aspect of this movie is the dialogue and inexperienced and naive direction. There is no time in that movie. I felt that the directors were so excited to do that movie (that's their first feature), that they never really asked themselves what story they wanted to tell. I met Ben several times (one of the directors) and he is a good and thoughtful guy, but it does not make him a director. I think American History X is full of cliches, but somehow manages to transport a story. "Oi! Warning" is full of clichés, doesn't tell anything new or challenging and (this is the sad thing about this movie). It is far from any Oi! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Weird but great German movies, watch the movies by Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Benny's Video Funny Games The Unbeatable Meinster Film The Experiment The Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> *** out of ten, due to the subject and the photography
