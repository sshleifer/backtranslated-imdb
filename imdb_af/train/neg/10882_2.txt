This movie is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. From the very first scene I knew it would be a smash crash. It starts with a seemingly bad girl who kills a lot of nuns in a mission. As it turns out, the people are owned by some random zombies. Well, a few years later, some college kids make a promise. Horrific acting goes from promise to the headshot. Things like the jock screaming at him to do things in a very non-chalent way, with the promise of responding and doing "eager to be a popular role." What the cake actually took with this one is the final blow. Absolutely WRONG special effects with guns. For example, rifles make a noise with no snare flash, and vice versa. It is accompanied by stop-animation zombies (why they move in stop motion is a mystery), cheesy music and about 40 guns coming out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is crap. Just like so many others, you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low-head movie rental.
