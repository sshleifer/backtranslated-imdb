Interesting film about an actual event that occurred during the Vermont Civil War. It kept my attention to the end and I'm not sorry. I have never read any of these raid incidents, so I was curious to see if the rebels pulled it off. I enjoy historical movies from that era. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is at the confederate uniforms. They look too good !!! The acting was sometimes stiff. I like the old man who eats the potatoes because he has no teeth. The wounded soldier playing with a dog was a bit strange. Overall, it was a descent movie.
