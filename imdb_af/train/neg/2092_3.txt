Basically, "Caprica" ​​is the origin of the Cylon origin. The assumption of the show is interesting. The authors, however, follow so many story lines and hide them with too many POV characters who put it in the storytelling. The plot creeps at the glacier speed that lacks the tension it might have. In any given episode little or nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier with a stolen slide. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is managed by the AI ​​version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing caused by one soldier of one (STO), an underground monotheistic extremist group. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (father of Battlestar Galactica's commander Adama) struggles to keep his family together while looking for his daughter's AI version (who also died in the bombing) in a Machiavellian virtual version of Caprica (much like the 1930s Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to the vapid writing, Caprica suffers from a similar problem as many originating stories. We already know how it ends (ie the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
