I also love Dafoe as an actor, but I have created a few hours of my life, and I can't believe it. I managed to see it as a whole. Was there actually a point for the movie? And the end, well, I'm glad I never paid to see this terribly senseless piece of pathetic excuse for a movie! <br /> <br /> I'm not sure without hunting the facts but was Dafoe married or seeing the horrible actress in this movie in real life? If so, was it an attempt to start her career? If it is so scared, it must have failed. <br /> <br /> I put this in the hope I can actually put someone off to watch this movie, even if one person takes my comment and decides they'd rather see paint dry, I'll feel I have made a little good in the world, if I just had the same advice ...
