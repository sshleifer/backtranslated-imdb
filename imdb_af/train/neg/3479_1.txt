I went to see this movie at the theater and I was shocked when I entered the room. There was just me and my girlfriend! It screamed to me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not to my surprise, the movie was bad. Ben Affleck plays a man who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable story with him falling in love with the girl who hates him. His play is cute, but for the comedy aspect of the movie he is not very good. The plot line is poor and the comedy almost doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some good points. For example, the family falls apart and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will stop other people wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room !!!
