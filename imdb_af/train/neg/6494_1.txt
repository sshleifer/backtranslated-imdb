I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested to see how he would act as a writer / director. I couldn't have been more disappointed by this move. The movie was so unsuitable and the movie was so far to the point that I wanted to pull the plug from the wall. The actors were very good, but it was such a waste of talent. Not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors, and Mr Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the movies I've ever seen in my 50 years, it's absolutely the worst movie ever. Please do all of us a favor, Mr. Hopkins, and keeps up with acting, which you are excellent at, and allows writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas. If I could give this movie a rating that was less than one, I would surely want it.
