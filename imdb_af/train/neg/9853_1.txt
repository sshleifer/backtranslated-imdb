I think most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this movie shows no self-control to fully exploit it. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are top of the art, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work. Hydrogen-filled flies? They should be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there's the everyday possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, don't try to give it up as a fact. Some people will always misunderstand. All in all, the film is entertaining, but I constantly told myself, "Oh brother, a burden of ....". If you want a FAKE documentary, watch This is spinal tap. Or at least the sound turns off.
