Where to start? The special effects should be called special defects. When the director shouted "action", he thought he had also indicated to the actors to perform the worst performance. Perhaps he was irritated with the producers and wanted to make sure they didn't recover a cent from their investment and that the work would be a case study on how not to make a movie. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant, but his family didn't allow him. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is certain that anyone who employs him in the future is because he falls in love with him has jumped his objectivity through the window or because he changed his name and all that past previous references deleted.
