I think it was just useless to produce a second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie, but it is ridiculous to make a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin and Thomas J.) dies. The story was over to the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to get the story going. This was pointless!
