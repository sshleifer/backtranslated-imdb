Tonight I sat down by this movie and forced myself to stick to it, although I never happened to any characters or what happened to them, because the two were leading Gerard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, great movie stars of their era and I wanted them see in something else that was definitely. They both performed well, but with unpleasant characters. Indeed, the whole movie is about a shabby little town in Mexico, inhabited by almost uniformly unpleasant characters (the doctor is of course the exception). What Michèle Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. <br /> <br /> It's supposedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think of is that if Sartre's work is anything like this movie, it should be a very mediocre attempt to imitate Camus's masterful novel The Pest, which has treated a plague in North Africa. <br /> <br /> A well-activated but uninteresting film.
