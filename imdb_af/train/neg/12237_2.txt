Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original Frosty Cartoon: Needs a little work but can be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph on the fourth of July? C'mon! Give me a chance !!! It was a movie that should not have been made. It was bad. It didn't really go for any holiday except July 4th. This made it very bad because Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And any movie can be destroyed by too much singing. The regular songs made this movie look much longer than it really was. The film has tried to mix two well-known Chirstmastime characters with an American traditional holiday (which almost seems to be limited to America), too many senseless songs and a common plot line. The result? A bad movie that can't really be watched at any time of the year. I suggest that you withhold this movie even if you want Frosty and Rudolph.
