I wanted to see this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she only has a smaller part in it, and her character is not very nice. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is very beautiful and a perfect pleasure to watch throughout the film. It's nothing but a showcase for her appearance and talent. She does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty stupid on its face. After a car accident, some friends may have died, but their past lives are alive, while all kinds of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are behind them, but we never really know who they are (maybe they were in the other car, but we definitely don't hear why they are behind them). The final scenes look especially filmy ambitious, but I can't get anything coherent from it. The opening scene, where the bad guys (who wear some strange masks) cut a blonde girl's wrist and collect some of her blood is never explained or followed up. Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons trying to withdraw Cassie (Sagemiller) from death ... but no, it doesn't seem to work. The bad guys are just bad guys; they really just messed up a story that would otherwise have been interesting. In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who needs hell bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
