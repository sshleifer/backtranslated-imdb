This movie is still in the long line of no budget, no hassle, no talent movies were shot on video and provided a smooth cover to catch unsuspecting tenants at the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what Watch this movie is like a video camera and some red food coloring and film yourself and your friends wandering around in the night growling and "attacking" people. Congratulations, you just made 'Hood of the Living Dead'! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you. <br /> <br /> I saw a low budget, shot at video films that made talent of filmmakers and actors or at least bothered, but it didn't. Avoid being a true masochist or amused by poor horror movies.
