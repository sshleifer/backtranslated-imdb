I loved the original. It was brilliant and will always be. Oddly enough, I actually looked forward to the re-make. I am usually a bit against re-makes because there are too many of them, but somehow it has irritated me. I really enjoyed getting started. Caine brilliant, as usual, and Jude Law who is right to keep is right next to him. It was quite clever how it was modernized and it was working. What prevents it from being really good is the last seven minutes. It's completely gone from the original, so far it has ceased to be smart and just gets annoying. The end in the original was fantastic! There was so much tension built up and it was incredibly clever! This? It doesn't grow in tension, but in frustration, as it turns out, they decided to make Caine's character a homosexual. It was when they tried very hard to be different. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Rolkrediete. This movie is worth the watch just for the performances, but the last seven minutes really do. What a pity ...
