It is actually a low budget, made for TV, type of film intended to capitalize on the success of the original. I am a fan of b-movies, and this one could have been good if they didn't attach the name "Cube" to it, because as the original director and plot was, it was better. Taste the whole range. The characters are annoying and clumsy, there are problems with continuity, and several separate production screws. The story hardly gets a chance to develop because of unnecessary dialogue and suffering from it. They use more or less the same fury over the whole movie, and because the first one was so good, it's just a disappointment. <br /> <br /> If it's a stand-alone b-movie, I'll probably give it a four. The "1" rating that I give was actually a statement about how it had completely thrown into bonds and intelligence compared to the first.
