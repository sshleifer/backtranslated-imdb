Adrianne, must really get a life - without Mr "Brady". She made me nauseand was one of the main reasons why I know longer at the show. It is beautiful mindless display, and every little argument or disagreement seems to be under-analyzed and analyzed after death. It makes them look / sound, it's all but ready for marriage, yet I know that these differences are all part of life. I think some people are entertaining. If this happens in the next season, I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing to do with their life, but look at this trash. Although I wouldn't be terribly surprised. can't even advertise for this show! I hope they get enough money every week to embarrass themselves every week in front of a camera. But the "A" girl has one very big bat!
