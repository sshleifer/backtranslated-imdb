Except for all the technical flaws .... How about a female aviator who can kill everyone herself, 4 out of 7 terrorists (including ex-marines), two of whom even use a rifle Then she lands the plane perfectly. We're not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; We're talking about a regular, scared but very well-composed flight attendant. : D How is the leader in charge of the assault / rescue group, with a full (according to the logic of the writing) plan to sleep all and have someone from his team, flying the plane. Only he decides to change plans and instead give an attack on the terrorists, flame guns, do not know where the terrorists are, or how much, and not a benefit position, to make his entire team easy . Decimated. Yes, it uses the old noggin. Only later on decided to use the sleeping gas in any case. And it seems useless for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> Bad as this movie was, but I couldn't stop myself watching and wondering, what's next? : D I can't help but imagine all the excellent, unemployed writers who think of themselves, it's not fair. lol! : D
