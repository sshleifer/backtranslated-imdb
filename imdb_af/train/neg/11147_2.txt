I have nothing to do on this movie. It's so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save time and do something more interesting, rather than watching this movie ... doing anything, even staring at the walls is better. <br /> <br /> And because I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I also say a low budget movie, bad scene, no name actors, a stupid mutt as the wolf, and so on. The story also doesn't bring anything new, the special effects are made in the 80's. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> Enjoy! ;) (don't look at this movie)
