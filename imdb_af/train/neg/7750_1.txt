This movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet. I love BARNEY more than this movie. The graphics suck, half the movie is animated, the deaths suck, and over all, I was ready to just the people who made this movie! PLEASE BE NO CLASSES OF YOUR LIFE THAT IS THIS MOVIE. The only good part was when the movie ******* ended! This movie is 50 percent Jurassic park, .1 percent Sabretooth, and 49.9 percent DUMB! Please don't waste your time watching this movie, you will regret it. You want to know why this movie sucks? Well, the lid sucked, the graphics sucked, the blood looked (I mean) ketchup, the people tried to blow themselves, the college students thought there everything and could stand up. I mean, there was a 5 ft. Tier running straight to a woman, she throws a spear from there 100 feet away! Wait until you really get it! The acting was also terrible. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and it just had to be destroyed.
