This film is another director of Tim Burton's efforts to capitalize on a well-known title to bring his vision to the screen. He did this with 'Batman', 'Sleepy Hollow' and now this. It's not a remake. The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton reconstructed the whole story and irrigated it for today's massive viewers. <br /> <br /> The original planet of the monkeys was a product of its time. During the 1960s, America struggled to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time to seek soul and reconsider social levels. It was the civil rights era where long-standing groups have claimed inferiority to be equated. In that context, POTA was allegory, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broke difficult questions and kept the suppression of American society elegant by condemning the white man to his species of inferiority. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was pervasive and intelligent with ironic, both subtle and obvious. <br /> <br /> Burton's version was so much a product of today's times like POTA of the sixties. These are monkeys for dummies. It's superficial and jejune, replacing politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue, and focusing more on form than dust. The 'surprise' ending is completely inexorable and does not add to the movie except a rock hanger setting up the successor. While ending the original POTA all connected together in a single powerful scene together, Burton's end only mocked the audience and said, "I know something you don't know and you'll have to wait for the successor to find out. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, as always with Burton's movie, the movie is excellent, the make-up is fantastic and Burton's camera work is excellent (though I still have his dark look Thirty-and-thirty years of advancing the prosthetic composition cannot be compensated for the abusive vacuum. <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to a monster film. (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, assisted and attacked by a few twists (especially Helena Bonham Carter and Ari). The presentation is formative and simplistic with a lot of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality. <br /> The play is mixed, Mark Wahlberg is a go own actor who simply misses in this role. Walberg is great to play dark, characters that are painful but strong. This part requires an inspiring hero, a profile that is not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far below her ability that the breach is ridiculous. She desperately tries to do something about the thin character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace protector and love sick teenager. <br /> <br /> Then there's Tim Roth. She is a virtuoso show, which releases the film of the total debris. Roth is hateful to diabolics like the malicious general Thade. He creates one of the most shameful and despicable bad guys I can remember in a while. In addition, his physical play is superlative, making a chimpanzee that is such a perfect sign that one can almost believe that the species exists. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great disappointment. It's decent entertainment, as long as you watch your brain at the door. I evaluated it a 3/10. From a technical point of view, it's much better than that, maybe a 9/10. However, the story is an insult to the original franchise. It is simply a further attempt by Burton to be self-glorified by using a familiar title to lure tricks to the box so that many can see how a genius he is. Of course this is true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, rather than simple mass-formulated thoughts.
