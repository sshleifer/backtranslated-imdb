I was very excited when this series started in 2005. The assumption was very simple and attractive: every episode would be a one-hour mini-movie directed by a well-known, remarkable horror director. Then, when I finally watched them, it was a bit of a fall. A few good episodes originated from the first season, but everything was a mixed bag. I attributed it to the learning curve and thought the season 2 would be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I in for a shock. At least one had some good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "The Black Cat" with the excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a total and total loss to me. The episode "Sounds Like" may well be the worst thing I've seen on television over the past 10 years, and most of the other episodes aren't much better. I really hope season 3 will change it the next year, but I don't like my breath.
