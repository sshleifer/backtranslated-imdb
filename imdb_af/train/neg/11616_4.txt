I didn't enjoy the movie, Joshua, at all. Maybe that's because I saw another, much better similar movie titled Orphan 2 days before, but maybe it's just because this movie wasn't very good. I'm going to learn. Certainly, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original, but that doesn't mean the movie can't succeed. It could have been stressful and entertaining and cold, but it was slow, boring, irreconcilable and no longer reminded me that it wasn't very good. <br /> <br /> In the end, Joshua's motivation is revealed. I will not give it away, but the reality is that he has not really achieved his goals, because despite Vera Farmiga as his mother, Abby, disappears about 3/4 through the movie, all the arrows show her return home. She was committed to a spiritual institution because she lost her mind, but then Joshua's Father / Her husband was accused of tampering with her medication, which told the audience that the institution realized she was indeed not mentally ill is but medically taught. So .. shouldn't she be coming home soon? Will Joshua not fail? Willn't her mother be with him and his sister and possibly his father soon? I questioned the Father, as his future was left open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day I didn't care about the characters. The evil demon Joshua was not sorry. The storyline moved slowly and when it picked it up, it was still boring. Suspens fell flat every time. When it was over, I couldn't believe I was sitting through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the acting was good from the parents, especially Vera Farmiga as the mother, but if you want to see a movie about an evil child, look at Orphan. Now it's a movie that has taken an inexorable concept and created a brilliant movie.
