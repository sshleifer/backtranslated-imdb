PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ MY FULL REVIEW. I don't beat the movie myself - just the DVD versions currently available. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this movie even two stars. I mean how can it just arrange 1 in 10 !! <br /> <br /> Here's how: An epic movie adaptation of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" with historically accurate combat tones, courtesy of the Red Army, and an extremely faithful, scene-by-scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult, but worth going through seven hours - if that's what you see. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you can't see movie - everywhere I know. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to see the RusCiCo DVD version - which is widely regarded as the best version available, as it is letterbox and the scenes cut from other DVD releases are recovering. <br /> <br /> But this is one of the worst movie films I've ever brought to DVD. The picture is muddy and contradictory, often stroking. It's almost tolerant if you limit your brightness, color and image levels to maximum ... but the problem doesn't end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also inconsistent, suddenly loud in parts, virtually inaudible in others. <br /> <br /> And, as for languages, it's a big problem for English speakers. The chosen option has some good actors, and some very awful kids whose performance gaps and parts of the movie are not baptized at all. , glowing back in Russian and even French randomly. <br /> <br /> The subtitle option isn't much better. The captions do not appear underneath the picture, but right about it - which conceals the beauty (or what remains) in the scenery. Furthermore, the subtitles are often a poor translation (a shame that the writing has taken trouble getting so close to Tolstoy's real words), and the captions also just look in parts. <br /> <br /> So even if you turn off the color, brightness and picture settings to the maximum, and change the volume up, and choose subtitles * and * baptized English, you're still getting a movie that is annoying to to watch and listen. <br /> <br /> Can it overcome the content? Maybe it might have been, but at seven o'clock - who can stand it so long? <br /> <br /> Maybe someday somebody will come together and fix it - and maybe I'll see a masterpiece - but for now I just can't give more than one star to something just about the first 12% of could not watch for the first time.
