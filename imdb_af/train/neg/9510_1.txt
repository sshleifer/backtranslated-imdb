Sugar & Spice is one of the worst movies of 2001. The film tries to cross Heathers and make it and fail. When I saw last January, I was so disgusting about the movie I had been running on my cellphone for the past half hour and talked to my girlfriend. I heard that the DVD has a director's cut, maybe I'll clear it out, but this PG-13 trash movie is the *** and the worst kind of ***. Maybe if the movie has a few T&A that would have made it, it did well. But the gags are lame and the acting is terrible. Worse than a Troma movie.
