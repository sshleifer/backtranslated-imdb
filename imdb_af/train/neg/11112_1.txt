Wow, how bad can it get. It was seriously bad. Not in terms of the gore - it was especially laughing CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible - the main arc of the lead was a total joke. Within a few nights of stalking Vinnie Jones, he begins to 'haunt' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend. Um ... are all New York photographers this childish, suggestible and weak? His character development has absolutely no justification or point whatsoever - and finally, you will laugh aloud on the completely predictable and completely absurd twist of his character. <br /> <br /> The greedy moments were clearly just a weak, low-self-valued attempt to jump into the modern MTV style gore - all, blood, but no real emotion at all. These parts were inadvertently funny - and distracting by their self-consciousness - crazy camera angles. <br /> <br /> Overall this film commits the crime to blowing another potential idea. What the atmosphere (until the stupid monsters at the end) could have had is ruined in favor of 'watching my' self-conscious direction. This film was not made for and heard - it was made for a resume - a deep selfish motive.
