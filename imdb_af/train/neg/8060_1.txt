What a bad, bad movie! I tried to look without a quick door. It failed. After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, went to the internet to see how many minutes this disaster was. (84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confusing, boring movie. I don't think anyone can be beaten by getting a fluorescent bulb that gets much less confused! The one funny thing is that I watched the "The Killer Cut" version of the movie. The box says boldly "More Blood!" "More sex!" "More Terror than the scene release!" Yikes! If this movie was horrible with all the demands, I was just wondering how lame the UN-Killer Cut was? If you want to see a wonderful movie about the world of life and the world of the dead, watch the Night of the Living Dead series !!
