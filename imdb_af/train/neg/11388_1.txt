This story is about the romantic triangle between nde. African male prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who doesn't speak French and never seems to shave. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it is boring, sad and depressed, or shoots or shoots winter days or in poorly lit interiors, where everyone is bathed in a strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know it's because the white balance was out. Everyone is light and depressed and looks haggard, loose and dirty. Bodies are distressed and shot in such a close-up that they look very ugly and unattractive. Molle, greasy hair. Yuk. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time, or naked or sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother dies. All three characters go back to Stephanie's hometown, where we see through a lot of flashbacks to deserted countryside and predictably icy interiors, a bit of Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre. The mother dies. Well ... and that's really. Character development is minimized as well as the denial of the story. <br /> <br /> I suppose the storyline is not linear (it will explain many non-successors), but really, after I paid my seven euros, I didn't feel myself constructing the movie myself: that's the director takes my money. To expect me to add the story translation process and get my hands dirty, ask too much too much. <br /> <br /> This movie is a heap of pretentious junk made especially of a desire to Epater les bourgeois (ie kick the straights). I can see how it was a shoo-in for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it is nowhere.
