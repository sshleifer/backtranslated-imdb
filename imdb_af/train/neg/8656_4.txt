This is the first non-zombie subgenre review ive done, but this movie is worth doing a review. Dinocroc is a good movie in general, but unfortunately it's still an obvious b-movie. The Dinocroc itself looks good, but I thought the movie itself needed a bit more weight than action and violence, because when the crocus is shown or in a battle scene, it doesn't take much, except that the crocus is shown and kill the crocodiles or run off in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was warm, it's a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the crocus looks fleshy instead of a cartoon cover * of the komodo * cough. I enjoyed this movie enough to be happy that there will be a sequel that can say more than I can about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and a watch worth.
