It is true that some of Peter Sellers' workers may be disappointed with his last venture. But surely any fan fan in all his movies will enjoy, just because of the man's great talent. and The Fendal Plot by Dr. Fu Manchu is definitely no exception. Unfortunately, it will be Sellers' last movie (it was released even after his death), but it is still nice to see how the man managed his irreplaceable talent to his untimely demise. And not only do we get one seller but we get, because Sellers not only plays the title role, but also his nemesis, the equally bizarre Nayland Smith, the detective on the hunt for the crazy 168-year-old Fu. The story is equally exuberant, as we follow Foed's outrageous denials to make his centuries-elusive elixir, and Nayland and his group of associates also try to prevent him. Just like any of Sellers' bigger films, the movie comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance of him, as well as many of his well-known co-stars, David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren for a few . It's also nice to see Pink Panther stall black Burt Kwouk (Cato) who enjoys a comedy with Sellers - although it plays the same role, but still nice. Indeed, the story is quite ridiculous, like many of the characters involved, who classify it as a movie under the Goon influence. And although it never reaches the heights of Goon comedy, there are many funny jokes pointing in the right direction. The film failed commercially because it was initially released because of the world's grief after the death of the salesman (the movie was released less than 3 weeks later) and there is always that sad thought lying in the back of your mind while you see it if it was Sellers. last movie. It's far from a good movie - it's often slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes the jokes are simply not there - but it's nice - if it's just for another top performer by Peter Sellers.
