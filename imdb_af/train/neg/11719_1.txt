In the words of Charles Dance's character in this movie, "Bollocks!" No plot, no character development and absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Full of things just not happening in the real world (since when were British police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters?). Full of bugs (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of dull and artificial dialogue. And directing / editing is terrible - wobbly handheld camera shots that don't add anything to the film, except a vague sense of sea sickness; confusing jets; no structure. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes's character is completely unsympathetic - why do we care what happens to him? Go to video? Go to the rubbish bin!
