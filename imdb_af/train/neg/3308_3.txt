If you get your hands on a British movie, you expect some kind of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this movie does the business. This is done by highly skilled craftsmen. This alone can make you enjoy half an hour. But if you look at the low level of professionalism, you will find nothing really. Except you feel good and plead for a drug liberal view, there's really nothing there. The writing is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the end must be one of the worst eastern of Hollywood. In all it's English, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did they make this movie? I have no idea except to make money of course.
