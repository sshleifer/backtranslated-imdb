Here we are: two travelers from a distant futuristic world come to earth ... one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life, another is an inhumane murder machine that is determined to save the woman who saves satisfy a whole breed, eliminate. <br /> <br /> So what can we call this murder machine? It's almost as if he's a kind of destroyer, or eradicator ... like an extinction or something. What is the word I'm looking for ... something that -terminates-things? Hmmmm .... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the protector (who quickly does the white tunic, he stole Luke Skywalker in favor of local clothing), finds the young woman first and satisfies her with " a future born hero. The evil uhhhh ... "extinguisher" kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes, and tries to trace the woman by visiting and asking her workplace to look at people's eyes and her name threatening to repeat. <br /> <br /> Then a desperate race for survival begins as the seemingly deadly and unstoppable "extinction" of the couple strives for rural life. At one stage he could buy boots and a motorcycle, but I don't know. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, in an exciting finale, he'll try to fill them up with a huge tanker. .. sour. Then the truck will fall. They will be saved ... but no! He will come up again, as strong as ever. He will kill the protector and approach the girl to a meat packing plant, where he is pushed into a scary finish in a large piece of industrial cutting machine and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe I extrapolate too much ... after all, I didn't look at this movie anymore. Protector Sean Young fertilizes by kissing her at a bar and tells her the child will be born in 3 days. <br /> <br /> The costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I loved them the first time I saw them on Star Trek: Next Generation! Sean Young does another big turn as an unemotive Replicant, and Jacket Swew Stephen Baldwin is also on board as Young's Fat Cop Boyfriend. Not sure where he fits in the plot ... maybe he's an input from another James Cameron movie?
