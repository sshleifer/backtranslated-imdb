Second movie in the box. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, this movie was pretty average. It's a bit boring in some parts, but there are some good effects, but it's not good. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have taken over almost the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) team, which also has their own spaceship and is led by Churchill, is captured by the vampires, receiving a message from Earth and the team formed by Quintana. (Played by the very hot Natassia Malthe), the fire officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman played by Aaron Pearl of Wrong Accused.) V-SAN later met with the leader of the vampires Muco, played by Michael Ironside of Total recall. He has no plans to live with people, because he is bowing to world domination. <br /> <br /> While this movie wasn't wasted, I doubt I would be back in the DVD soon.
