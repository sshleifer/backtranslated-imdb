SEX WISH was actually released from the video tree in the early days (minus ten minutes more, ahem, "extreme" footage) in the UK and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case has. Oddly enough, the newspapers brushed this ultra-disturbing movie under the rug in their headlong to get the comparable harmless blows of FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON, and the film has been forgotten. I got the chance to see it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the movie's expensive with my jaw on the floor. It is not so much politically wrong as it is quite demented, a triple X takes Michael Winner's DEATH WISH (brought away the title of the game with regard to inspiration?) With hardcore sex and some really nasty violence in an already threw bubbling brews from the seventies. If you do not consider yourself, it may force you to think again. By the time SEX WISH is over, you want to clean your eyeballs with disinfectant and a long, hot shower to rinse yourself. If a movie really is the "it's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie" rule, it's the one. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or lowlights) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim As he masturbates over her, Harry Reems' play-sounding mustache, the helpless young black couple being forced into front of the swordman (they won Oscars for their utterly credible performances if the Academy was angry) before the man was castrated for his troubles, and a little slippery direction threatening to lift the proceedings above their obvious gravel house. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will prove you very, very wrong.
