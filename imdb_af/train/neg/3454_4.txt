Cuts are trying to be as most post-scream slashers have tried, a ghost of the horror genre trying to be clever by referring to other well-known horror movies. Now I'm not scared of 'Scream', as I think 'Scream' is a very good horror movie that does a good job of mixing scare and comedy. Cutting failure at most levels. It has its moments, but overall it's just not out, not even a "so bad it's good" movie, just a lower average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes or so is OK and pretty much the story, apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really act, and ironically she gets her tongue out, figure out. Go ahead for a while and a group of film students want to finish her movie, which is apparently cursed. And as you probably predicted, the one and the role and the crew are slowly chosen by a masked man. <br /> <br /> Unoriginal plot, poor performance and a predictable ending are some of the following elements. There are many references in the movie, ranging from 'Scream' to 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. It is also not smart, it feels as if the director wants to feel smart and cool by calling other well-known horror ala Scream. For a treasure chest there is a minimal chorus and no nudity, which is a big negative when it comes to a shooter who is not quite there. Really, I should support this movie because I am Australian and we are not as good as it comes to horror (we do have our gems), but Cut is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> That made me look for 90 minutes or so, so at least that's good. I wouldn't recommend it, except hardcore slasher fans, who might appreciate what this movie is trying to do, but if you're looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
