It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. One of those movies that uses every stupid stone they can think of. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was really good at it. But otherwise it sucked. It was more than 10 years ago that I saw it, but it still hurts and will not slow down in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line in the movie makes a good summary of how stupid it is. I won't ruin it for you if you want to seduce the lot by seeing this movie. But I sponsor you a * nghya * moment in the end, with a few in between. If you have nothing better to do, and you want to show and laugh, then it might be worth it. In addition, if you are forced to go on a date with someone you really don't like, suggest watching this movie together, and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it. It's a fair price to pay, I think.
