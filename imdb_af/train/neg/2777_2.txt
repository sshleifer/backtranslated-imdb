Unfortunately, this has been shown on Star Movies here in Thailand for the past week. This is complete garbage acting. As another member said, this movie is a good example of how not to act. I didn't see a movie that had been in the hand for so long. The actors (can you call them 'actors'?) Are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that to understand the acting truth would probably have to see the movie ... but it would be similar to torture. <br /> <br /> When the front lady delivers her lines, I cringe, and the rest of the throws with their accents (false or confronted) are equally scary. Another actress with the false British accent was nice, yes, but good gentleman was terrifying her. Mix it with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. She didn't have to say anything and I could have accepted her as the pretty girl. Oh me, we just came to the scene where the front lady's lover says, "Really me?" after a forced cry from her. Laughable. No, really, I just laughed aloud. <br /> <br /> The sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the movie. Some of the sets are colorful and some of the screens are pretty nice (minus the actors). <br /> <br /> The old magic lady? What ?! Another member called the "modern" love song that was in the movie. Completely inappropriate for a period of about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand the movie is considered 'Big Budget' in Thailand at the time of production. I would be seriously upset if I was the producer of this movie. Just going to show that money doesn't necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) movie. <br /> <br /> I will give the King Maker a 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets make the film of such a kind. a rating. 2 out of 10.
