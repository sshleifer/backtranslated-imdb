It seems to be a thrill of a movie and is almost laughing. It asked me to say, "O my God!" more than once with the intricate appearance of the plot that was simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Fanciful or absurd places just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and unlikely, impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too much to be understood why it exists. <br /> <br /> If you have the time and want to find out how bad a picture can be, then you will want to see this one. Otherwise, spend some time watching how paint is dry for a more productive time spent! <br /> <br /> (That a movie released in 2003, already shown in July 2003, can give an indication of the quality of the movie)
