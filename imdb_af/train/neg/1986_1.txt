Must agree with the other reviewer. It must be the WORST movie, let alone western I have ever seen. Terrible acting dialogue that was unpleasant and pathetic (let alone completely inappropriate because it was supposedly in the 1800s), and o did I mention a battery pack that appears prominently on the back of one of the characters? I waited for the tree to fall in the middle of a scene. And the end? The least I can say is that it was in line with the rest of the movie ... totally awful. And yes, it contained every clich√© in the book from the slow step to the empty dusty path to the ridiculous "let's remember when" shots when a main character dies. Luckily I saw it on free TV. Don't waste your time.
