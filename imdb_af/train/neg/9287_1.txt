WOW! Why would someone make a sequel to an already runaway movie? Half past death was a bad movie but at least had an idea of ​​what it wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea what it wants to be. It just exists on the screen for reasons I can't explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is this: Twitch (played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison where a box of gold stones may be buried. In jail, a riot breaks out between rival, one of them is shot by a man named Cortez and Cortez plans his escape. During a marriage visit, Cortez kidnapped Twitch's fiancé and Burkes (played by Bill Goldberg )'s daughter and held it in an executor room. Burke is reluctant to befriend Twitch and they eventually get into trouble with the idiotic prisoners as they find out that Cortez has their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Advice: This is the most unnecessary successor since Universal Soldier: The Return. The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is a caricature. Look, I know it was a low budget movie, but it's not an excuse for these guys not to make their efforts. No one in this "movie" believes in the characters they play. No one in this movie can be considered serious as an actor. Kurupt should be ashamed of him. His character "Twitch" is actually a spinless minstrel who spends most of his time while being attacked by Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time throughout the film as if he had to take a PHD (pretty huge dump). The combat scenes are poorly correlated and pathetic and for an action movie, HPD2 is rather boring, even if there is an action. Don 'Don't let anyone tell you this movie is pretty decent. It stinks and is an important reason why people despise Follywood.
