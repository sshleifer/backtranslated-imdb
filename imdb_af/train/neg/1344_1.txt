Any movie with a title as ridiculous as "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover, but the plot is very different from what you can expect after watching the DVD cover. The Bagman is not a good movie at all. It falls into the category of movies apparently (and probably) filmed on a home video camera. The acting is terrible. I haven't heard and seen such woodworking since Troll 2. There are many scenes with nudity and sex, but they are clearly jumping too fast. The characters are moron and completely forgotten. The end (which I won't spoil) can easily be expected after looking at the very first scene. Because of the cheese-like nature of the film, nothing but the terrible production values ​​are actually frightening (terrible attempts at realistic gore, a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Recommended for only bad movie aficionados.
