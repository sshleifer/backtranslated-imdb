I'm a big movie fan. I like movies of all kinds. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I get it following the book now, which increases the point that not everything should be made in a movie. Especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not strange, they are mentally ill. The things that happen are not funny, they are disturbing; especially since they are supposed to be true. <br /> <br /> This movie had the feel of The Royal Tenenbaums, another movie I hated. Only Running With Scissors were even more dysfunctional and less funny. <br /> <br /> I'll never get those hours back. I wanted to be my brain after watching.
