I do not give much faith to AIDS conspiracy theories, but it is sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatic. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of fear and death often generated such dark fantasies. This was especially true in San Francisco's politically radical and sexually extreme democrats. The city, famous for its beauty, has rarely appeared lighter than in this movie. A feeling of darkness and dissolution endures every scene. <br /> <br /> Whilst the play and plot cannot be properly spoken, the films, at a unique cultural context and oppressive dark mood, at least partially, capture the film from a complete loss. Actually, I found the most interesting show to be Irit Levi as a critical and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Police detective. She is interesting, but not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> Highlights: The film's use of the reckless tragic Turandot is an effective motive and there is a sublime silent cameo by the iconic performance artist, Ron Athey.
