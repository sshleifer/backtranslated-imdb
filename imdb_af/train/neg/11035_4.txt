This is the most saccharine romance I've ever sat. The perfect movie for a vacant housewife in kerchief, accommodation, and ostrich high-heeled mules to watch in the afternoon, eating on the couch. In fact, chocolates play a prominent role in the movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could finally watch was that I could finally see Keanu Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look. The only fast-paced action in this show is that Giancarlo Giannini blows his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian and Mexican. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is as stiff as wood. Unfortunately, no bodies are torn - the hero is shamefully perfect and temperate. The aristocratic, warm-blooded, old world-family cliche is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy tale story. <br /> <br /> I knew before the titles had finished that it wouldn't be the movie I was hoping for. The glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food advertisements in Women's Day Magazine. I didn't list his name, but the art director was definitely Thomas Kinkade, who refined the million dollar canvases of Irish cottages in fuchsia. This film was literally seen through rosy glasses. If you like dreamy pink and blue sky, this movie is for you! (The chocolates also look really good!)
