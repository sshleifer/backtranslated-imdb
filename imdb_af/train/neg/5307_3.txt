What happened? 'Doubt' has so much potential to be a brilliant movie - but instead it has drawn a clear plot line that keeps me watching. The only thing the movie was about was the glamor of Meryl Streep, who earned no DOUBT the Oscar nomination. Although not one of her best performances, she still gave us a solid and reliable character that blew through the screen. <br /> <br /> But even the luster of a screen legend can't save this movie off hill. From the boring start, which had no power or punch - to the less than convincing end, the film was really a disappointment - especially as it provided as much as possible through its promotion and trailers. It was clear that the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he eventually talked too much with a boring movie, which had been dragged too long and didn't have enough action. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the other Oscar nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman delivered a decent performance, it was not Oscar-worthy. (Especially because they completely omitted the performances like Will Smith, in seven pounds). Amy Adams didn't deserve the nomination. Looking at Amy Adams was like looking at a cardboard box - because it was one-sided and simple. It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie, because I'm sure she would have been victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance, but the length of her performance asked me if the academy really gave her the nomination. <br /> Overall, I see Doubt as one of the most disappointing movies of 2008. It was a mess of a movie with so much potential and I didn't recommend it. The only bright light in the movie is Meryl Streep, who, however, gives a beautiful, solid performance - don't even do enough to save this movie. *** / 10.
