If you are not an Evangelical Christian, make yourself like an Egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague. <br /> <br /> Terrible - why, oh, IMDb puts the most favorable reviews at the top of the list - it was because of one of these I just lost the end of what had been such a nice night out on this walkway . <br /> <br /> The plot lead started strong enough - I was drawn into the movie and right up to the point where the Bible's sermons were taken. What a waste. <br /> <br /> This movie hurt me so much that I first registered with IMDb to complain about it - I hope I can save it as well. /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian does from my side ;-)
