It was a movie I couldn't wait to see! So I finally got it and I was disappointed. To begin with, the film said so little about New York, just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It really doesn't focus on New York's magic. Another thing that changed my mind was the French movie in this movie. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French style remake! Anyway, here you see elements that remind you of French movies, such as long and messy scenes, no or little talk and of course everyone smokes French style! The story follows many lives (too much for my taste) and somehow link their bodies. I feel like there was no commitment to the characters, as much as the stories were. The movie was too short to cover every single fate, everybody's happy ending. So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each. And there you have your 120 minutes! If you keep active screens dialogues and things, it's not the movie for you! I give it 4 just because I love New York and I loved the cast!
