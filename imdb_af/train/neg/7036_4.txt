I do not destroy anything if I inform you that you see that a woman has sex with a goat in this movie. If this is your thing, then your movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband are going to see her estranged sister in the family home in the bush. Her sister is a creepy lady to say the least, and she loves interests beyond family love. On the side, a group of indifferent characters appear and begin all sorts of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty poor and the characters are pretty stupid. The woman bumped even after her husband started to hang out and hang out with the heathen, even the generation with him. On the exploding side of things, there are many baked meats and some kinky links, but nothing that is not anywhere else. Oh, and the above-mentioned goat-sex scene. <br /> <br /> Most viewers won't make it to the end. Exploitation fans will drive it out, but will want more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
