I thought this movie looked like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part. Being a movie maker, I give it a 2 for consistency. <br /> <br /> The problems remain from start to finish with the highly predictable plot using bits of most, if not all, previous successful war stories. . The computer-generated graphics were too much like watching a video game at points and there was no effort by the director to add a realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what he needed to work, but didn't find that information. <br /> <br /> It seemed that this project had pushed the boundaries of a low-budget movie too, which led to a production that dragged the viewer along with the story without their imagination being involved. The actors were not bad, but the plot needed more innovation.
