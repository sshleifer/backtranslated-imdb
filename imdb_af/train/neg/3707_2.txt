It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. (Yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any movie with Kevin Costner.) <br /> <br /> Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable with the whole movie and his supporting actors didn't even seem to try. Chris Rock is a wonderful comedian, but he cannot transfer his talent to this movie. It probably has only two tensions in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> If you didn't watch movie, avoid it like the plague. Go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or looking dry on a brick. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts, I give it a 2/10! <br /> <br />
