My title should be enough. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) will eliminate as much as the "nouvelle vague" movie movement. Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and clever philosophy. But the moment you give them a movie camera, they start acting like WOOOOOOO, see how I can be! Complot? THEME? Get the nose! LET'S FILM A AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE ROUND AND ROUND! At least it's not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the back of the people's head. O-la-la, quel artists). No, Truffaut retains some visual clarity. But also the security camera on a fast mart. The two are indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> Haha, just as one side for all your dweeby movie students. I bet the ear is sticking out the side of your neck. But don't go without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, you will hate it. People who like this movie have probably never read any books except the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or maybe 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. Or maybe they read the lyrics for The Doors songs, and they think it's deeply moving. Whatever drives your boat. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) sources into Balzac, one of the best and most meaningful writers ever lived. Nice try, truffles. But you are nowhere near the ballpark. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film like an Aids-infected syringe. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who would like to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, enjoy your Truffaut, Godard, and Andy Worhol. And for the sake of pet, push the ear back into your neck. You look like a cabbage.
