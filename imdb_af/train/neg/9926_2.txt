I just watched the 30th birthday issue of Blazing Saddles, one of my all-time favorites !! The TV pilot for Black Bart stinks. The plot didn't exist and the acting wasn't good. It was obviously an attempt to profit from the success of Blazing Saddles and there were TV programs that managed to do riots of big movies, but they would never have worked. Since TV has not even played the chorus sounds for many years when they broadcast the movie, it is unthinkable that they thought they could place a show on TV with the "N" word being reversed. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing many familiar faces !!! There were quite a few actors / actresses that I recognized from other exhibitions over the course of the year. I had to write down all the names and do some searches. It was fun. I argued with my mom if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
