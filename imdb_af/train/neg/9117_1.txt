... or maybe it's just as bad. The plot is a cheap rehash of the first, which is strange, as it is supposed to be a prequel, not a successor. Pretty much the whole movie looks like a cheap reminder of the first, with scenes mimicking the things that first happened, just much more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first played a good role, this one consists of B-list actors and rejected. The acting is mostly terribly bad. Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first, just like almost every main character, including those who weren't in the first movie. I realize this was followed by a TV show trial program, but that's no excuse. They don't have to turn the (bad) footage into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and it's the erotic rows. However, since it is nowhere as good as the first one, it doesn't even increase a score of 1. If you get the chance to see it for free and you're a straight man, it might be worth it. to check, if you want something erotic, it's not porn. If not, avoid at all costs. 10/01
