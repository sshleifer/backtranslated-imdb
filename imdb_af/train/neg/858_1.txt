I hate this movie! It was nothing like the book, and just thinking about it makes me angry. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yes, it's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning can be similar, but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The end for example! So in the book it is very intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version, jack likes them through a silly maze ... yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that made me angry was that Jack was just Mr. Halloran kill! Quite simply, he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him as if he wasn't important. Overall, it was just bad that the movie was so out.
