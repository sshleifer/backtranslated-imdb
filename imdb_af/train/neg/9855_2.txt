Let me start by saying I am a great fantasy fan. However, this movie is not for me. Many far-fetched arguments try to support this film's claim that dragons might have existed. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries, but fails to thoroughly investigate them, which might give the film credibility. The film uses (pretty!) CGI to tell us a narrated fantasy story about a young dragon's life. It is combined with a popular TV show CSI style forward to make it look like something scientific, certainly not. In many cases, the arguments / clues are far-fetched. In some cases, clues used to show dragons may have existed, or flown, or spit fire is simply invalid. To see this, make me cramp in my toes. Even a fantasy movie needs some reality, but this one just doesn't. Bottom line: It's a pretentious fantasy CSI documentary, not worth watching.
