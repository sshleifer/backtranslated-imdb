Not a very good movie, but according to the information it is fairly accurate to portray torture techniques. The aim of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps and it was done effectively enough, with surprising honesty for the time being. Whatever technical flaws (and there are enough) to see, you'll see a forgotten angle of a forgotten war and some foul things - again, nasty because it gets north of the DMZ and not into Guantanamo Bay done. <Br /> <br /> I don't think any of the Korean veterans got tortured when he was in office, and if you watch the movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to the Vietnam movies. I don't know if it was the people in '54 who were trapped in the WWII concepts (the boys tend to wipe much) or the war or whatever, but it is interesting to see it from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like "Go Tell The Spartans".
