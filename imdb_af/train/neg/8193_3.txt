Well, during this recent thank-you break, everyone decided to go and see a movie, and because Fred clause became the majority, that's what we said. <br /> <br /> To start the movie, so many plot holes were pathetic. Simple explanations of why a certain event occurred were void. for example, who is trying to turn off the Sabbath clause? Is this a kind of corporation? A little explanation would be delicious. <br /> <br /> Second: The movie has flung your faint characters, causing no sympathy for you about their feelings or actions. Example: the little eleven named Willie and the only tall girl in the eleven town. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and I can care less because this film doesn't mind me. <br /> <br /> Third: I suppose it was supposed to be a family movie? His rating was low on only PG. For a family movie, there were several articles of suggestive conversation. It didn't bother me, but if I was a parent I could see a problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paul Giamatti became very bored with his role, but frankly he was the only one worth watching in the movie. Vaughn had a few funny moments, but played the same character for the last two movies. mature frat boy. (nothing against Vaughn, he's good at other movies) <br /> <br /> So this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me just because someone bothered to make this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I will definitely surrender this tab, or if you have to see it, save it for a rainy rental.
