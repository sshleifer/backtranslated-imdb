Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. He is scarce in it. Most of the screen time is dominated by unsuitable jokes. One running gag is that a character is called Jerk Off. There are also many erection jokes, where the punch line is someone has set up. This movie is as funny as Kirstie Ally's British accent is convincing. <br /> <br /> This movie started out like a bad action movie: five minutes back story and then bam! Inconsiderate jokes. But, besides the horrible writing, the movie is also poorly targeted and the play is terrible. Also, this film makes the old bad comedy clich√© of many well-known B-movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. It's just a few people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, although he is named as the main character. Don't be surprised to buy this movie at a drug store that sells for five dollars. Even this is too much.
