I saw it, I agree with him 100%, but I don't care about his delivery. He just came across as an asshole in a poorly edited, confronted young smear campaign. Edit tracks a lot, etc. The camera will be focused on him and you will cut 2 or 3 edits just over a minute or two dialog. Insert into the constant spraymill in the camera shot, which is a film no-no. <br /> <br /> This documentary hits a topic with so many angles, so many interesting stories, that the movie was just as easy to do. Picking up religious fanatics is like choosing the backward child. It's so easy it's just wrong. I mean how difficult it is to make these people look like nut bags? To contradict them, let them say more than one verse or two. I like to fly back from the same religion to the people, and they completely contradict themselves. <br /> <br /> I just think he could have done something slightly more creative. The part with the neurologist talking about brain activity has never been wiped out. It would have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious passages compared to drugs, or sex, or ???? He could have played more on the women, everyone was happy about the Passion game which looks more like a sniff in a new Rob Zombie movie. More could have gone in the history of John Smith, the Mormon founder who had the colorful past. Delve into science vs. religion. One is a very methodical, very rigorous process to increase confidence in theories. It builds on itself from a solid bottom, a new layer on top of a more proven layer. An enormous proof of evidence is needed every step of the way. The others start at the top and come down to unstoppable demands. This is so because good? I said it. <br /> <br /> Well done? Want to say, does it turn into a HBO original series? every week a different religion. <br /> <br /> It was an eye-catcher about one thing. I had to be blind. Good ole G. W. Bush ... no wonder he was elected. He had the religious majority. And now ... it's the blind that leads the blind. Bill Moyer .. Well .. What can I expect from a man who gets out of Sutra in Newport Beach?
