A fun concept, but poorly executed. Except for the pretty good makeup effects, there really isn't much about it. There are obvious problems; For example, after the weeks and weeks that look like clouds to normal size, it looks as if the main character is normal to deadly. And as soon as he is deadly thin, he remains as deadly thin for what seems to be a long time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie has much worse problems than that - the movies are definitely low-budget TV show quality and most of the plays are pretty much everywhere. Robert John Burke always seems to be trying for some strange, winding Charlton Heston imitation and is literally painful to watch ... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I was this movie as high as I am is that when the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and takes over the character of Joe Mantegna, the film develops a fun, campus 'cheesefest slaughterhouse' feeling and the gangster's crazy schemes for the torment of the totally petty gypsies are somewhat fun to watch. The end, if predictable, is also common. Avoid if you're not a King-o-Phile, or is it really the idea of ​​Fat Tony's voice from the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp.
