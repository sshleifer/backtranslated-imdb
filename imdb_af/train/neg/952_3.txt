Happy Go Lovely is a waste of everyone's time and talent, including the audience. The lights of the old hat wrong identity and faux scandal plot lines are forgiven. Very few people watched these movies for their plots. But they usually have some interesting minor characters involved in subplots - not here. They usually had interesting choreography and awesome dancing and catchy songs. Not happy, please. And Vera-Ellen as the female head played the whole movie as a second banana that was desperately looking for a star to play it off - and instead she was asked to wear the movie and couldn't do it no. The Scottish region was wasted. Usually ubiquitous droll scottish disgusting is absent. That photography was pedestrian. The music numbers were pedestrians. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance while chewing the landscape because no one else has done his part, in the kind of producer roles regularly set up by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is fine, and no one can do David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you worship Niven like me, it's a good reason to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
