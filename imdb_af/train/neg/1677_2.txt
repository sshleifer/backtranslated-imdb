Unlike others, I refuse to mention this zealous excuse for a movie that is a triumph of style over dust (I don't want to give a bad name to the style). Yet, this is the most appropriate description to consider. <br /> <br /> One pointless, unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears, "Wonderland" makes one wonder why the movie was made in the first place. and who in their right mind gave the green light to this arid and confused mess. A biography of pornstar John Holmes? A study of who the man was, why did he go into business and how it affected him? Great. Bound to be compulsory, bound to be entertaining. Bound welcoming and fascinating at about a million levels (and I have zero interest in pornography). <br /> <br /> But a confusing, violent, Rashomon-style study of a series of murders, Holmes, was linked to his career ending? Who cares about in hell? What insights do we get? This film ignores the most interesting aspect of John Holmes's life - that he was a pornstar! Wonderland can be just as good about anyone: the fact that the main character is the best known male adult movie star in history is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make matters about a thousand times worse, the picture is loaded with jerkoff gimmicks - annoying machine gun editing, messy Dogme-95 camera work, unnecessary screen saver graphics and animation. etc. <br /> <br /> In the absence of a compelling story and unique main character, the director (and I use the term loosely) threw a dozen or so techniques of other films and decided to make the subsequent mess a movie among other things: the trendy, bleach-bypass of Narc or Traffic or "Minority report;" the devastating, often incomprehensible, throw-the-pieces-of-the-air cut style of "Natural Born Killers" or "28 Days Later;" the filling-every-moment-of-silence-with-an-old song-to-call-the-period soundtrack of "Goodfellas" or "Blow;" the funny, retro title sequence of "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can." The list goes on and on and on. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> I wanted to keep this movie. I had real hope for that. "Wonderland Avenue" has been busy for years; If the context of the murders rather than the murders were emphasized, I think it could have worked. If the murders (and Holmes's growing involvement in seedy L.A. types) thought the end of a career, or the end of the swinging 70's, the movie would have meaning; it could have served a purpose. As it is - meaningless. Useless. Who cares about how many perspectives exist on a series of murders that are generally unknown to the public? The case is not known enough to earn such careful investigations. <br /> <br /> This film had to be the third act of John Holmes Story. That's it. Period. And it could have worked. What is it? Oh, right, right, they didn't want to tell a traditional story-and-fall story. They didn't want to make "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted their movie to be different. Right? <br /> <br /> Well, in one sense, they succeeded. There is a big difference between those movies and Wonderland. The difference is that movies are good. <br /> <br />
