The return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who love movies that spoil and confuse them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame housewife who does not kill or become vampire. I was prepared to do this, but I was not prepared to make the worst editing ever in combination with senseless flashbacks. In the end, it turned out that she was raising her car in herself when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and it was just a look back. With this movie it is impossible to tell. Can you believe the same man who made Army of Darkness produced this crap? A much better idea is to stay at home and watch Army of Darkness on Sci Fi channel. The movie has it all: trenches, zombies and a man with a chain saw for an arm. The Forgotten did not even have one of these things.
