"Fungicide" is probably the most incompetent, embarrassing, miserable "movie" I've ever seen. The acting is criminal, the direction is virtually non-existent, and the special effects are thought to be created by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a vulnerable laptop. <br /> <br /> It's far from me choking creativity, but I actually believe things like this shouldn't be made. I'm sure the "movie" makers will say it, yes, the "movie" is hampered by a low budget (like nothing) - but in that case they just didn't really bother. As it is, they offered the world something so urgent, so indescribable, that only imbecels could get the most shades of pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> The start of the "movie" wasn't as if I wasn't expecting "Citizen Kane" or anything. I expected a low budget, little horror with perhaps a sense of ingenuity, a hint of fun, and even energy. What I got was the movie-like equivalent of a used handkerchief. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, our learning antihero scientist, working in his parent's basement, is seeing manies moving some goo into a cup. Apparently, such high-level science is the end result of years of research. His parents then sent him to a strange hotel-type place in the countryside to relax. There are other people there, which is just too terrible to write about. In any case, the scientist drops his test tube on some mushrooms - and as soon as the mushrooms grow and kill some. (Wow, I'm just suicide to write the plot summary). Our heroes save the day by exploding a barrel of balsamic vinegar (by attaching a "fuse" - really a piece of string). The barrel explodes unattainable with the power of a small nuclear weapon that destroys all mushrooms. The end. (Thank you). <br /> <br /> This summary is as good as the "movie" (and actually makes it much more interesting than it actually is). This would never have been beyond this stage of development (which means that a plot sketch on the back of an envelope is scratched). Someone really had to catch up and give someone a powerful shake and said "NO." <br /> <br /> And the "special" effects. Well, they are "special" right. It's become CGI crazy. And done by a person I can just assume, the bike pump is at the center of modern technology. And when the mushroom samples are not in the style of a 1984 computer graphics package, they are presented by actors who are dampened in a sheet. I'm not a kid. <br /> <br /> One of the most relentless things about the movie is its laziness. It can be summed up by the scene in which the hero turns his rifles (a la Clint Eastwood) and then fails to get it in his pockets. I mean, come on, some recycling and he could have pulled it off, but just to leave it - it's really bad. <br /> <br /> I can't believe money was shot at this camcorder. The film makers have to keep their heads in shame and are prohibited from going into any film equipment within fifty meters. <br /> <br /> I also think it's wrong that friends and family come from the makers on IMDb and put foolish reviews on and give stupid users high ratings that give a totally inaccurate picture of the movie. "Fungicide" is an absolute travesty of film-making. Mr. Wascavage is either very, very stupid or very, very cynical.
