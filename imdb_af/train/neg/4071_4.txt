A young man does not kill a young woman for no reason. The man's brother was sentenced to jail because he was an accomplice but soon escaped. On escape, the seemingly innocent man kidnapped three victims and soon he called his girlfriend on the plot. If it's not bad enough, the situation quickly makes a downward spiral. <br /> <br /> This movie had good aspects and very bad people. His strongest aspect was the main actress Emily Haack. The fact that she is naked in a reasonable amount of this film, presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character. I see no reason why she cannot take this experience and somehow can change it into a career in one way or another. I was convinced that she was a ruthless individual. <br /> <br /> Also the creators of this movie were very fat and had no bumps. Graphic nudity (both male and female), coprophagia, and extreme anal violence are not chased away. I love my horror movies to push the boundaries a bit, and this one completely ignored them and went smoothly to Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they achieved what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the negative aspects. First and foremost, this film is very low budget and the film quality shows it. I can excuse it - the plot was decent, the acting fine and in some scenes the lower quality movie made the movie more disturbing (a more realistic feeling). So, I won't bother them because they have low grade equipment. What I will care about is the use of poor choices in shots. For no reason can I determine (except to pick the movie), there is a large amount of footage from a cemetery. I do not really know why, and I started to dip at the point because it was so long and useless. <br /> <br /> I also have a problem with the title. The idea here was to deceive people into thinking that this movie is somewhat related to the classic "I Spit On Your Grave". Now there's a line that looks like the main character is the woman's daughter from this other movie. And the themes are very loosely the same (a woman becomes revenge on men). But there is no fixed connection and the reason why this title was chosen was that the client of the video store would think they had become a successor. It was misleading and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last major complaint is that this plot makes no sense. Not even a little. A woman is not killed for any reason at first. A prison refugee gets time to kidnap people to torture them for no reason (because they have done wrong to his girlfriend). The same man goes from good to very angry without explanation. Likewise, the female lead (Haack) from the ordinary person to someone who is excessively cruel and sadistic, for no reason, and to people who for the most part just meant little to her (a neighbor who offers drugs for sex , is wrong, but not worth torturing.) <br /> <br /> Don't mislead this title or the claims that the movie is incredibly shocking. Yes, some screens were shocking, but the vast majority of the movie is boring and allows you to take a nap. If you see it in the video store or on Netflix, just keep browsing. Or rent it, and we can sit on it for hours. You're warned.
