Back in the 1970s, WPIX ran every weekday afternoon for quite a few years "The Adventures of Superman". We will get each time a little while predicting neighboring performances to air the "Superman and the Mole Men". I always looked forward to those days. Looking at it recently, I was amazed at how bad it really was. <br /> <br /> It wasn't bad because of the special effects or lack thereof. In fact, George Reeves's Superman costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foam pad showed him that it was more obvious to be clearly visible. And where was the Mole Men's costumes even worse. What was supposed to be a covered cover would not have been ten years old, as the zippers, sleeve shirts and poor pills were heavily characterized in greasy costumes, all of which were painfully obvious. But these were devious shortcomings. <br /> <br /> No, what it did badly was the confronted plot devices. At times, Superman failed to do anything to make the situation worse. A lynch mob looking for the creatures? Rather than calling up the hysterical crowd or looking for the beings themselves, he explains to the dangers of the situation to Lois and the PR man. The creatures are angular? Again he stood to look and talk, but did not save them until they were shot. Luke Benson, the town's garbage canister, shoots at him? Attempting to kill any reasonable person, but Superman frees the man over and over to cause more trouble. Superman had quite a few opportunities to tackle the problem, but never made use of it. <br /> <br /> It said, both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, seemingly comfortable in the roles. If they are just given a better script to work with.
