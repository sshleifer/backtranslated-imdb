Drilling children's fantasy that Joan Plowright gives star bill, but little to do. Sappy children strive for their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (yuk) while best friend Hazel runs mayor --- she's 13! Completely pedestrian in every way, plus the added downside of poisonous performances by the girls as well as the baseball boys. Certainly a less effort for Showtime - no limits?
