I saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book, and maybe it was a neutral idea or a very stupid one. I think it was the latter. First, it was inaccurate in very small but important details. One of the first things I noticed was during Winston's daily life in his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc. He feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive views on people without great fear. One of the most important parts of the book was that even in small activities, it was almost impossible to even give a hint of his true emotions on his face. It is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarians. In the book, Winston knew it was a great risk to wander around there and was skeptical and scared of every journey. While in the movie, he does so often and without fear of losing the important sense of heavy duty and risk right from the bat. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies include Winston hiding his diary in the wall, yes a very small change, but it asks the question, what's the point? There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and it's morph characters. <br /> <br /> However, the major inaccuracies were much more disturbing. First, one of the important pieces of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent but crude philosophy. In the movie, they talk about it and go straight to think that Hitler is managing technology. It's true, in a sense, when it comes to its fascism, but if that's all you get from Big Brother, you really missed the point of the book. The scary thing about Big Brother is that it somehow has some points behind its philosophy. When O'Brien picks up at Winston's mind in the Ministry of Love, he listens to everything Winston says to Big Brother. The fact that he is listening and advancing in his philosophy is in effect what is the most scary and intriguing. In the end, when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the frightening thing is that you are not sure whether it is the search and torture it caused, or the real power behind philosophy. I can't say that the Big Brother's philosophy shows me the appeal, but its intelligence and depth make it incredibly disturbing. <br /> <br /> Also, how can any relationship between Julia and Winston be in the movie? It was terrible, no connection whatsoever. <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien before giving Winston his address? One of the things the book was wearing was Winstons' thoughts about O'Brien before making contact with him. In the movie they just jump the gun. <br /> <br /> But that's why this movie was a terrible adjustment: because it is impossible not to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours. How could anyone think this movie was watchful if it was less than two hours? At least, the movie requires 3 hours to capture some of the important moods and connections. Anything less is just useless. <br /> <br /> If you loved the book, and I really mean it, you wouldn't approve it, and chances are you already knew you wouldn't. Because the book is unfilm and this movie proves just how impossible it is, it's a fine thing in a small movie. <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten
