First, Zorie Barber (Zeke) may be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. As a character supposed to be a hip, town writer in martial arts and proud of being mysterious, why is he so hyper, overly dramatic and terribly horrible? Did he know anything about his character before they started filming? Does the director have? Don't teach the martial arts discipline? Apart from this, this movie misses the target with its lame jokes and seen-it-all humor. Hand in toilet? <I> Cabaret </i>. Masturbation? Hmm. <i> Fast Times by Ridgemont High <i> American Pie </i>. The list goes on. .Bad dialogue: Eric says in one order: "It's not my business <i> but </ i> ..." and 30 seconds later Mia says "why is it any of your business?" Bad editing: At least five minutes of film is being wasted on NYC traffic jets. <hr> It is also impossible to believe that the four main male characters will be a strict group of friends in any world. I can't comment on what everyone is laughing at, but if you enjoy a low forehead, enjoy basic bathroom humor and insults at all times. If you want something a little smarter, but on the same line, see <i> Boomerang </i>. If you want a solid romantic comedy, go to <i> The Tao Of Steve </i>. But anyone who thinks <i> is torn </ i> is greasy and dates accurately, well, I can't agree.
