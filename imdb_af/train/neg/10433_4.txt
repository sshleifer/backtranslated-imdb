The battle scenes were great. Raised the old and newer silver and how they painted the other side. That was the end I hated. I was disappointed that it was the earth only 150k years back. But to travel like that, just to start? Are you joking? 38k people fighting for their existence and as soon as they come to paradise, do they leave technology? Not at all. Certainly they ate paper and cost food, but it's over. They can live like humans again. They only have one good doctor. What are they going to do if someone has a toothache that never cares ... yes right. No one would have made that choice.
