Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made me lasting. The atmosphere of the movie was first class, the acting memorable and the storyline a classic. Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again, I was eager to see part 2. ...... I was so happy to realize early in Part 2 that here was a proper follow on the great Godfather movie. was about perfect and I couldn't wait to see Godfather III ....... WRONG !, I wish I stopped at II. The storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story that just fit to have a story, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Pacino's protein was a poor character that would be eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes like Corleone were invested with all the bumps of the Catholic Church with full chorus, the killer riding in the sunset, the invisible helicopter participating in the meeting (where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else being shot), daughter and 1-nosed-rolling pieces of pasta over a plate, the pathetic shooting on the stairs ..... Corolla fills him down with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and fraud is not ready for an emergency ?) ... NO it wasn't good and with the best will in the world I won't be able to see it again. But I will look 1 & 2 many times over the years.
