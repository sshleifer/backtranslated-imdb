No redeeming features can possibly be expressed. I wish I could get my time back. nice skull face really breaks smile, bright on the camera when the disease has already had enough devastation on the ill informed script. I was (spoiler) lucky to see all the characters dead or seriously incapacitated, especially the party pops who drink the infected juice on their way to the alleged sunset. Eli Roth shines for moments of maybe ten, which is the theory of how well weeds in the forest smoke when others really withdraw from beer consumption. Overall, I found most of it useless, but not without freezing violence and not enough nudity, and happy to see the death of a throw, in a way that never happened (probably had to be laid instead of letting TBS look night, ugh).
