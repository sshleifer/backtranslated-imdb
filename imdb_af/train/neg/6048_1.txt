Even duller, if possible, than the original (I hope I can say it under the IMDb guidelines). The feminine connection at least tried to absorb European influences, hampering the conventional view of the American police detective, even though the attempt was made by Friedkin's ambivalence, Americaness and general direction. The (relative) house tree of the 1960s (especially with the narrowly faded) made a big impact on the European film in Hollywood possible. It lent a new strength and complexity to a tired medium, and in the best of them (eg BONNIE AND CLYDE, early Scorese), a new subversion of the receiving practice. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, with its difficult-tuned style and anti-detective figure. TWO are old Hollywood's right-wing repetition of US values. <br /> <br /> It is shown in the film's very tiring America vs France dialectics. For example, TWO were shot like a 70-year-old French police officer. It was the French who, of course, insisted on the greatness of American movies when they were ignored at home, and it was in some sense a retrieval, a warning against the Gallic suspicion. This can be seen in the pattern of the two movies. CONNECTION has French gangsters invading New York with the French style that suffocates the American thriller. This leads to the dissolution of the trace figure and the dissolution of the plot - the bad man got away. <br /> <br /> TWO returned the American to France, with American thriller values ​​imposed on the indigenous genre - the power of the detective being reaffirmed and conventional resolution achieved. This is further dramatized in Doyle's relationship with French inspector Barthelmy, whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plot. <br /> <br /> TWO seems to follow the original by undermining its detective. From the beginning, Doyle's interest in every turn is reduced. In spite of the termination of CONNECTION, he is considered a hero. But he is an American in a foreign country and his inability to control language or customs means he cannot dominate the plot. He even deceives the signs of the police force, fails an informant for a criminal and kills him. <br /> <br /> A detective's power comes from his power as subject to see and interpret, but Doyle spends much of the movie being watched, controlled, an object, a body (literally in the screens after being dumped by Charnier) were viewed and interpreted. In connection, he fueled the action, chased the criminals and forced the plot; here he is passive, tied to a bed, locked in a cell, an addict, a dependent. <br /> <br /> This loss of phallic power is predictably symbolized in the loss of his rifle, and the film follows a depressed well-known Oedipal trajectory. In the heroin sequence he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son. His stunned condition is like a return to the womb, robbed of adult pressure. Her watch strengthens the timelessness of this state, double meaning for a man whose career is dependent on timetables and accuracy. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective and to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this false mother. Who is solving his unified identity and killing the father (Charnier) so that he can assume his accepted male role in society. Psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 70s (ironically fueled by a Frenchman, Jacques Lacan), but it is rare to see a film so literally full. <br /> <br /> If all of these facts tended to minimize Doyle, then the movie's style isn't. Friedkin removed us from his hero by refusing empathy or character motivation, emphasizing the mechanics of the plot. Here, Doyle is a very conventional Hollywood hero. Instead of getting lost in a dark long shot, the traditional devices make him understandable and understandable - perspectives, shots, shots, shots, etc. <br /> <br /> TWO are all about the fall and emergence of Popeye Doyle. Plot in this case is subordinate to the acting, which is the usual Hackman showiness. The cold turkey scenes, so, despite their boredom, are not disturbing. We are allowed to share rather than to perceive cold; It's a much less uncomfortable experience. The screens are also shot by a lachrymose male sentimentality that is very American. <br /> <br /> Although CONNECTION tried to mimic the complex thrillers of Jean Pierre Melville, TWO did the opposite. Melville's LE SAMOURAI had a gunman who started the whole, powerful, outer language of the movie and tested his ultimate disintegration. TWO begin with a disintegrated character, which partially occurs by inability with language, whose domination begins when studying out of language - the closing action series are largely wordless. <br /> <br /> In the film, the local and language are important as they have determined and undermined the detective, but as he regains his power (in the return of his gun and the cathartic burning of the primary place of vulnerability The tower block where Charnier kept him, the Marseilles area becomes more irrelevant, and the mitotic position can take place everywhere. Compare the ends of the two films: one recognizes ambiguity and despair, the other absolute certainty. <br /> <br />
