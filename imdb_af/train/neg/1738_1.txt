This unfortunate movie is a remake of a 1927 movie. They had to keep it that way. <br /> <br /> What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks has absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and Bette Grable sings with a chorus. What I will do to the Hungarian! <br /> <br /> The ridiculous plot deals with a photograph of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome who saved the day by killing a victor. (Fairbanks). Let's move forward 300 years later, where Grable, just married to Count Romero, faces a similar situation. On her wedding day there is a raid by Hungarian soldiers. <br /> <br /> Romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to stay at the castle when his violin play pleases Fairbanks. The end is worse than the whole miserable movie when Grable Fairbanks meets to tell him the good news. An angry Romero cut off marriage. <br /> <br /> This poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948. As Harry Davenport, a veteran supporting player in it, died in 1949; it must have been his last movie. What a bomb to go after such a leading career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel is co-star, but he can do little with such poor writing. The costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age. I can't understand what Fairbanks was wearing.
