Put a DVD of this movie in a time capsule, and it will definitely illustrate a perfect example of one that will justify the minimal rating on a 1 to 10 star scale for future generations. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano are top notch - with ratings and millions of annual earnings - with their television series. Yet, everyone had no success in large-screen offerings. It is also true for other TV personalities - perhaps because many of the two-hour stories are more suitable for a 10-minute ride or at most the 22 or 23-minute drama during a half-hour program. <br /> <br /> However, this movie does not have a single element that will justify two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL or anywhere on screen or stage. <br /> <br /> The original date is listed as 2002, but the release date - on DVD only - is shown in 2004. It was not filmed long before Rodney Dangerfield's death. The reason for this is that it is probably on lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of it but found it when I turned on my set and frankly fascinated. Some movies are so terribly horrible that they rate some sort of top rating in the reverse - so bad you can move the wheel back to a 9 or 10. "Plan 9 from outer space" is the best example - and the Bruce Jenner / Village People opus can't stop the music, is another. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie falls even there. Even though Rodney's earlier work (as well as some of his fellow members) didn't have Citizen Kane or Casablanca, there were many moments of humor and a story that at least interest. <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this listing doesn't look as much as a minute or two.
