One of my best friends brought this movie one night with the words "Do you ever see the worst horror movie?" I always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horrible movie and say yes. I expected your typical cheese skater, but it was past B. It is Z shooter, the lowest of the layers. With a clear low budget, extremely bad acting, bad lightning, no plot, really bad so-called special effects, shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack make it movies like House of Wax like Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing about it is having 15 seconds of one of the characters topless - she had lots of fun tits. Most of what I said during this film was as follows: "Wow, it's really that bad," "It's the worst movie ever" and "I'm not drunk enough for it." So finally: don't waste your time (or money!).
