'Mojo' is a story of London's fifties, a world of emerging rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s, which is often seen in films that emphasize physical differences at our own time, but also represent a very exaggerated dialogue (it depends much on how the speech made in films made during that time); I have no idea whether people have actually spoken so outside of the movies, but no films made today and in today's times use such stylized language. It is as if the spoken discourse of writers of the 1950s serves a common abbreviation for a past, which, in fact, looks like a very distant land; and thus emphasize the particular, rather than the universal, in the story. 'Mojo' has a strong performance by Ian Hart and annoying children of Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner. The latter is still struggling to build a post-trainspotting career; But feel like a period, a modern movie incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom. Quite boring, actually.
