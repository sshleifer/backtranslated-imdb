It was difficult to watch this movie and is quite fair and objective since I am a big fan of the original 1944 movie. For me and many others, this is one of the greatest filmmakers ever made. To realize this, is simply a shortened TV movie and that most people have deleted it, I didn't expect much, but you can't help it, but compare it to the '44 movie. Scene after stage, I compared myself to what I looked at, and remember how it played with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I see these famous actors playing their renowned roles, replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was over, I found it not as bad as I expected. but it's not a 1944 original game. The two main areas in which this TV was not so good for the TV were (1) the electricity between the two leaders was missing and (2) was only 90 minutes, they rushed the story hard with little time to develop the plot , characters and chemistry between those leads. Crenna and Egger were flat, and simply not a match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson". <br /> <br /> Where this reproduction was held, it was in the other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton." Cobb was great, like Keyes and Robert Webber as insurance company Norton. It was also a bit interesting to see that the time frame changed, so the homes, cars, telephones, dictators, etc. Was in the early 70's in the mid 40's. Otherwise, the storyline was very similar, just rushed. <br /> <br /> However, one summary was enough and I'll happily go back to the original version for the rest of my views of this classic story and movie.
