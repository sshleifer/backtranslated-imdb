This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in the theater !! Couldn't wait to end it. To make matters worse, a 12A certificate is given so you don't see anyone being shot, only bodies that fall to the ground, even Babban are killed, are cut out! Too many scenes have been cut to bring in the younger viewers, because I think the creators knew it would be disastrous! Amitabhs acting was great, but that 'Basanti' wannabe and the other idiot playing Devgans's mate can't even act. Devgan was wasted! <br /> <br /> I won't see it again for free and I advise everyone reading it to do the same, YOU are warned !!
