It's the first of these "8 movies to die for" collection I've seen and it certainly didn't make me see the rest. Although I heard at least some of them, it's decent. I don't know, it wasn't terrible, but it didn't really matter much to me. Your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia type of thing, mother and father died, the family sold the farm and brought to San Francisco (?) Where they continued to get home food resources where possible. The best part of this was the creepy Goth sister, who of course invited a friend from the school who never left. Of course we have a butchery in the basement and so on and so on. This family is like the white bread version of the Sawyer Clan, they are nasty and they do bad things, but they are not soul. I see many reviews of people who like it, and I think I don't know what I missed, but I found it to be very mediocre and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. 4 out of 10.
