What a disappointment ... although the best of the prequels, but the story is poor, the plot is rushing and the end result is just a set of chunks, poorly realized and amateurish. There are numerous continuity errors that clash with the original films, and the rise of Darth Vader has been so terribly handled that it could be a legendary moment in the modern cinema, rather a cheesy goblet that will be mocked for many years. I will not complain about the deadly dialogue because it is Star Wars. The original three films had style, cult and cracks stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were shallow attempts to earn more money, and this lack of love shows in the kicks. Completely disappointing.
