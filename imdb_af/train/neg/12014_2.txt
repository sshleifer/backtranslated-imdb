A somewhat uncomfortable spy secret with a predictable plot on World War II dangers. The mystery is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia or not. The best play is done by Raymond Massey as dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor, got angry. He is the head of a spy ring seeking information from amnesia Jane, coded information related to related activities. Will she tell you? Can she remember? Moroni Olson (like Goodwin) is convincing as an accomplice to Massey. The role of John Garfield (like Dr Lewis) is nothing short of disastrous. He seems so miserable that the decisive position is one of the worst in film history. It is a pity that such a talented player plays a role that does not suit his talents. The movie is worth a look, despite being half a spy and a half-gangster movie, and despite being a parade of stereotypical characters. It is easy to forget this one, amnesia is not necessary.
