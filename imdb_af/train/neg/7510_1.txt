The movie is a collection of clicks about everything there is. It has no focus whatsoever, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is overprinted and stereotyping is abundant and shameful. This movie cannot resist temptation to make drama where it does not exist. Every little word swapping goes straight to a long, unjustified dialogue that is so typical of a playful rehearsal. Where there is no such exchange, the actors (no matter how good they usually are) cannot help with excessive emotions, even if they increase the game. About the acting, to put it simply. Directing is not helping here. Nothing can save this non-story. It is forced, faded and boring to tears. Inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with The Who, piercings and flashy 90's outfits. Characters wander without a role, detail and motive. Places are arbitrary. It is Boogie Nights by The Good Fellas with Saturday's Fever, torn with meaning and art. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it. <br /> <br /> Some movies have errors. This movie is Lee's mistake. He sold out like the rest of them. It has become irrelevant. He has nothing more to say. <br /> <br /> I have no desire to see anything from this guy (who will I remember from now on).
