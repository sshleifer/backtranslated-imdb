Nightmare Weekend is proving positive that some people are so desperate to be in the movies. They are willing to do almost anything. <br /> <br /> I am not referring to the many women who seem to appear to not appear stronger in this terrible piece of waste (the naked female form is after all a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to die together with a bad handpick called George. Now it's embarrassing! <br /> <br /> A bio-electronic is created by the brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a demented sensation with green wool for hair) is the artificial intelligent interface for advanced computer system that uses a revolutionary device (a silver sphere over the size of a golf ball), which, when taken in, can stop character deviations. <br /> <br /> Edward's personality-variable experiments were successful in laboratory animals, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to perform tests on human subjects, fearing that there may be side effects. However, his evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster) does not have such barriers and continues to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all become terrible killer mutants. <br /> <br /> With special fever cellar manufacturing, a blast-free blast and a plot that's almost impossible to follow (I've taken notes while watching the movie, and even then I'm not quite about it convinced that my summary is accurate), Nightmare Weekend is a complete and complete disaster that cannot even save multiple softcore sex scenes and a touch of gore. <br /> <br /> This movie also knows one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), an idiot-wearing Walkman, in a way run to make 80's music in a way that makes me look like Justin Timberlake.
