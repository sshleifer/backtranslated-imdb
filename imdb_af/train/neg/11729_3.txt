Virgin was chosen to marry a rich man. Rich man is urinating. Woman on boat holding sailor. Sailor urinates. Virgin attends a large community service. Man is urinating on the table. Boatwoman strip teasing for little boys. Man pretends to urinate his baby. There is an underlying theme here. Makavejev is trying to say he is pi $$ ed by the world. To say it's a bizarre movie is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a scene where Laure, who speaks almost ten lines the whole movie, baths in chocolate syrup. It is a lovely scene indeed, but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in your mouth, unless someone is sharing the director's fetishes.
