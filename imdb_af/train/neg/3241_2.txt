This movie has potential, but it really makes it bad, is Lindsay Crouse's play. I've never seen her before and maybe there are some Crouse fans who look like something else, but her performance in this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Her delivery is robot. When she delivered her lines, it turned out she was trying to make sure she had the lines and was just off the list in her head. So, her voice has very little bow. I can't believe anyone who's bad at acting is a major part of a movie. She must know someone in the biz. <br /> <br /> Now I hate to be this meaning of her, but the comment has to be so long and her performance is more than anything else. <br /> <br /> However, I liked where the story goes, so I went ahead. The first part of the script has a good movie. But the end was also disappointing. Maybe if her actions were better, I'd like it.
