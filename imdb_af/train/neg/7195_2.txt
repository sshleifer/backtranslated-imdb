It's done Disney again. The company that made "Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" made another movie that barely looks like the cartoon on which it is based, and doesn't like the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a young one, and for a movie to exist, it might have become a dream come true. Now that the movie exists, I was very disappointed, even furious. <br /> <br /> First, we have the characters. <br /> <br /> Gadget itself has the gadgets that made it such a fun character. the original cartoon (with good special effects that accompany them), and he even has a naivete of the original Gadget, but he is now more capable and is expected to solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain just watch. /> <br /> Penny has little to do; While playing a major role in the cartoon, discovering the crime and stopping it and sometimes being caught by the MAD agents, she is just being imported and forgotten, though she falls at least in Claw's base. <br /> <Claw is the movie's version of dr. Claw, who was a rather sinister, grumpy man wearing metal gloves and sitting in his chair, hid his face, stripping his cat and supervising various crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand, without a secret behind the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie, but are rather insignificant. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the cartoon are not spared in this victim. The famous expression "Wowsers!" is mysteriously changed to "Wowser", and Gadget's Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks. <br /> <br /> There are even product endorsements everywhere. Why is "Yahoo!" advertised on a board? Why do the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M's or Cones? <br /> <br /> Fans of the cartoon will hate it, others will probably find the movie below, and if all is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some quick money from another guy display.
