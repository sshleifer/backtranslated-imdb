Put on a doctor's home that I missed, and a Desperate Housewives (new) to watch this one. I don't know exactly what this movie has harmed. I never thought I'd say it, but I want to fame my 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Scripture, direction, I can't say. I recognized the stall of actors (the common suspects), but thought Herbert Marshall was a class add-on and put myself in for a good cheesy movie. Boy, was I wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: where the "office girl" makes with the 029 keyboard, put the cards in a 087 sorter. LOL @ "the computer". I want someone to identify the next device - a 477? This is even before the time of this dinosaur. <br /> <br /> And our dinosaurs don't have much time to waste.
