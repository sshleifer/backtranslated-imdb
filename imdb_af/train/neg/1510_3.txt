The reasons to watch it ... are ... paying tribute to a wonderful movie called Se7en: - It's up while your channel is surfing and there's nothing else to do. - Someone pays you to see it. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and pop in the DVD for Se7en, rent it, download it to iTunes, or put it in your Netflix cue and save the herd completely. The Herd has the same story with some changes. Furthermore, editing is only from Se7en and actually ending up getting you several times out of the story. The worst is probably flying over the helicopter shots, with sounds from people talking on the radio, except that there are no police helicopters flying in this one. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I call it a blatant knock. If you want to be nice, you can call it a tribute film, go ahead, but you can also see Se7.
