I gave these two stars the clarity of DV shot, which lends itself to the cold and dark sterility of its character. It was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This movie fails on all accounts. I can't recommend it because it's not poetic or blunt. Not dramatic or exciting. Not controversial or ordinary. It's just a miserable piece of waste that can't recommend any horror or exploitation clerk in good faith. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this, whoever you are. . Please keep away from this terrible product. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
