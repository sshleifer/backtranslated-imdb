Setting up a television series on a popular writer's works is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learned it hard when they bought the rights to books credited to Dick Francis in 1979, three of which were broadcast under the collective title "The Racing Game". Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey has a private eye for an accident in which he lost his right hand, just to replace it with an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played the annoying Chico Barnes) made me think of a horse's ass when he was on the screen . For six weeks, this lesser-clear duo has charged the countryside, filling nefarious plots to settle races, usually by the same methods - extortion, kidnappers or doping. Yorkshire Television throws money at the show, but no use. Violent, sexist, rushed and repetitive, it is quickly escaping to the knackers garden.
