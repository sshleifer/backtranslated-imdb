A warning for potential viewers: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story "The Dangerous Game," look elsewhere. "Seven Women for Satan" <br /> <br /> only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of Zaroff and having people murder. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may be considered by some destructors. Or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine. While her ancestors were hunting men because they were the only prey that was really challenging, Boris's victims are usually in a position where they can't defend themselves. The movie rambles from scene to scene with an almost total lack of clarity. The director completely disregarded the pacing and left the viewer with a suffocating dull film. A few individual scenes are lightly interesting (such as a torture sequence), but as a unit, the film fails to entertain. Viewers who are more <br /> <br /> interested in a variety of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in different stages of dressing, can see the movie. Most will find that their time is better spent on Mentos advertising. <br /> <br /> In a synoot, the DVD extras included a fair amount of information about the movie's history. Apparently, it has been banned for several years in its native France, which has greatly broken the spread of widespread distribution.
