Ascension is actually a step in terms of what the original film was in story and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the score himself (if you remember him, he was the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is funny like Luke, the child who helps the woman he loves . A petrified Dracula's body off the leaf stem. Diane Neal is good as the woman stealing Dracula's body to get a cure for her dying boyfriend. And Stephen Billington is big like Dracula himself. Gerard Butler played the score in the original movie. Roy Scheider makes the rest of the movie in this movie, and he does a decent job as Jason Scott Lee's mentor. This is the second successor in the trilogy, and they are starting well. It's in the air whether the last movie will close the series on a good note.
