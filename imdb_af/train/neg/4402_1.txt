Usually I love Lesbian movies, even though they are not very good. I'm biased, I think! <br /> <br /> But this one is just the pit. Yes, the scenery and buildings are beautiful, and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this movie is just a total waste of time. Annamarie alternates between swallowing and stoning / going out on whatever drugs or drink or not, and Ella inexplicable with this horrific behavior throughout the movie. At no time are we given insight into why this is so, or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If there was at least some kind of closure in the (possibly romantic? I don't even know!) relationship between the two, there might have been some kind of satisfaction. But while Annamarie asked Ella at one stage, "why do you like me?" Ella doesn't even admit it. It is never really clear whether this is anything more than an (unfair) Lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman. <br /> <br /> Even the interactions between the two women and the locals they meet on the Travel, which could be lively and informative, are rather flat, boring and mostly incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is one good joke in the movie, though I'm sure it was unintentional. The women travel in a two-seat Ford coupe with a medium-sized hull. Yet, when they set up camp, they have a huge tent, beds, sleeping bag, and even a table, chair and typewriter! In addition, we see lots of luggage, presumably of them, presumably also in the Ford's drum! <br /> <br /> And throughout the film, we never see a single petrol station, or anywhere that seems to have any place to buy gas. Usually they travel through endless miles of desert desert. So where did they get fuel? <br /> <br /> There may not be too many Lesbian movies, good or bad, but there are many that are better than that, and very little worse. Leave this one in the rack.
