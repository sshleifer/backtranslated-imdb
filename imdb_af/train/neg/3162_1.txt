I didn't even stop the filming because I was so bored that I thought I was going out. I watched it in the movie theaters and my friends and I just got tired. We got up and left for another movie if I ever had to sit for 2 minutes. from that movie again I think I'm going to shoot myself ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and I wasn't surprised. I mean what didn't know she didn't do the right thing and let him be happy. I mean for real, you will be a complete fool to not know it. I know I didn't miss anything and if someone asked me to see the movie, I would say "over my dead body".
