There is no story! The plot is hopeless! A movie based on a car with a fixed accelerator, no brakes, and a sturdy automatic gearbox lever can't be good! I would have stopped that car within one minute whether I was there or in the police car that was constantly following it. I feel sorry for the actors who had to put up with such poor writing. The few scenes that some similarity to action are heavily dramatized, and so far from the reality you can get. In addition, there were many blunders, for example the hood of the road motor, which was plucked to do 100mph. At first it just folded over the windshield, as it really would have been, but then it blew. The car was later seen in the movie with the hood .... <br /> <br /> This movie was nothing but annoying, stay away from it!
