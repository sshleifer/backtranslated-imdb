I mean the word "pedestrian". Looks like the producers of the movie have forgotten to do something interesting. Faith Domerge can do better than that. She's supposed to be the mysterious, brave Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson (there's an idea, eh?). Instead, she is a common housewife of the fifties, and the single, flat expression she wears through the film makes me think they shot everything early in the morning before Faith had her coffee. As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, they are all so serious "all-American" that the rash is laughable. It's more productive under Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think "Cult of the Cobra" should really be titled "Cult of the contractual obligation". Why would so many other talented people go to sleep, though a slow, predictable, derivative failure like this?
