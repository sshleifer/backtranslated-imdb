- A newly married couple move into the home of the man's former wife's death. It's not long before the new woman felt that someone didn't want her in the house. She sees skulls around the house. But when the man examines, he can't find anything. Is anyone trying to drive her back to the asylum she was recently dismissed? Or is the spirit of the dead woman trying to get the new woman out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I've watched The Screaming Skull without the help of the MST3K team. And this will probably be the last time I see it this way. Can you be sowed? I'm not talking so boring - I'm talking and watching the grass get bored. There are large parts of the movie where nothing happens. The screen could have been empty and I would get so much fun from it. The characters roared over and over with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. The Skull Skull is likely to be marketed as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> - The actors don't help much. Most of them provide lines with the belief that is normally reserved for a grade school game. I didn't watch it, but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in cinematic value. I won't even go into the script where the actors will work with. Let's just say that the characters of the most idiotic lines ever spoken on the film are given. <br /> <br /> - You've been warned! Avoid this one at all costs or at least search the MST3K version.
