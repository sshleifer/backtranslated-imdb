WOW! <br /> <br /> I'm just given this movie from a friend of mine who bought it at Walmart for 1.98 and he felt he was taken! It's boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the play is somewhat improvised, almost as if they didn't have a screenplay. The Martians are CGI, which seems to have been done by a beginner or a fan-made movie. I can't just emphasize how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: In one of the screens, the martians plunder a local female prisoner. She goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a CGI copy of that woman. The change is quite noticeable, and if she is killed, you can see that it is a computer figure that looks like a game in 1990. <br /> <br /> If possible, avoid this movie like the plague! You can download two trailers from their site and see how awful it is!
