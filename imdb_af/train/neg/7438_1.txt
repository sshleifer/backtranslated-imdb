This movie is a total waste of time, the plot is terrible, the dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting is OK, but the actors have absolutely no plot or writing to work with. Photography and some special effects are also good, but again there is no interest in this movie to watch. There is no logical progression to the story, the story line is completely nonsense. It's not even scary. To be a movie, there must be at least a small element of credibility. This movie has no credibility. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is level and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most special effects and makeup work is badly done, or highly mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read it and don't waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see a horrible movie.
