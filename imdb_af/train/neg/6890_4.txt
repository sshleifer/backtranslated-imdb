... except for Jon Heder. This man thought the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was entertaining. A 29-year-old Slacker boy (Heder) still lives with the widowed mother (Keaton) who meets a new love (Daniels). Slacker boy is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and try to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really liked the showings of Daniels and especially Faris, but anyone who threw Hader would be better off selling hot dogs on the beach. Honors' performance is annoying, which would be a good thing as he is playing an annoying man. The problem is that he is an actor too bad to loosen this action. In the end, you still wish you could face the man personally and you're upset about the end. In the future, every movie with this man will be no to me!
