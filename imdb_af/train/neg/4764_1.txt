86 minutes of my life wasted. I fell asleep for the first time, and I said I'm not the one to ever sleep in the theater. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a senseless plot in such a stylized and forced way, and can only suspect that the actors were as hard as the lead writer allegedly was in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Everything in this serious adjustment is too much. And if it's not the woodworking, almost as if you can see the teleprompter, then the set itself, which is predominant and intrusive in totally unnecessary ways, and unimaginably impregnated, is enough to put out the whole farce. <br /> <br /> As far as the alleged shock of a detective under disguise is concerned, any person who does not see it - as well as the rest of this ridiculous plot - telegraph light years in advance, should immediately check their eyes. . <br /> <br /> Bad plays, and of two very decent actors, along with the Hyper-coddled Branagh brand transfer, are enough to let you use real dots rather than spaces yourself. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a completely ridiculous undertone of homorotics in it, increasing to the end. All I can hope for is that it's such a flop that people won't try to replicate this level of theater again.
