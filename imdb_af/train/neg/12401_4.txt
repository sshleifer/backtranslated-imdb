I have a disadvantage here. I haven't seen the first two movies in this series, although I've seen many of Larry Cohen's films. Fans of the series seem to think it's a good movie. To judge it on its own, it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> You never get a good look at the maniac cop's (Robert Z'Dar) face, but what I saw was pretty grim. The screen shots seem to be staged to eat most movies, not to get excited. Perhaps if I saw the NC-17 Director's Cut, I might be more impressed. <br /> <br /> The end with the car hunt with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was pretty intense. best part of the movie.
