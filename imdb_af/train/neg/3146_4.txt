The author of the book, with the same title, did not use her name for this movie. When you read the book, this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the real events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have little in common except the title and some superficial details. The film adds nothing in terms of artistic merit to the book's own literary performance. <br /> <br /> For those who haven't read the book, you'll also be disappointed. Not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace, it offers nothing more while moving slowly (such as character development, for example). Some viewers can later be entertained by the graphic lesbian love shows, but you can also make a special presentation of the things they show in therese and isabelle - it is pretty tame and not imaginative.
