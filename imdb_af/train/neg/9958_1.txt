If it's really easy, regressive, self-sufficient, anti-settling, anti-civilization juvenilia, it's the ideal movie. Very poorly written, with an often inaudible dialogue and an extraordinary tiring camera in hand, this is a film that represents the world in attractive, simplistic, Manichean terms: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are insensitive and bumbling at its best, and predatory monsters at worst. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is many primary screams (yawns) and infantile regression (literally) in a primitive cave-like space in the forest, with utopia being the shape of a rave party - again in the forest (of course ...). Shows all the weaknesses of a first movie, and more.
