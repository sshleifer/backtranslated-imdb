A killer, cannibal rapist is killed by a mad policeman on the scene of his latest murder. At his grave, a cult gathered with plans to raise him by blowing on the grave. It works naturally and he wakes up the guys penis and he is back in his old deadly ways with a whole new zombie look. The two police, one of whom is a little crazy about roaming the city and having a drug problem, are back on the case. Two of the original cult member are also trying to stop the murderer by raising another kind of dead thing. Think they filed, leaving them out of the grave, comes a plastic baby doll used in the original resurrection. Sounds a little confusing, but not just his rubbish. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible and one of the policemen is the same man who dr. Vincent van Gore plays in the faces of Gore series and he is as horrible as the annoying police spokesman in this movie. The other police are struggling to get out of their terrible lines. Now I'm all for a low-budget theater, but this movie is just awful. If it wasn't very easy on the eyes and their nudity, I'd probably fall asleep. There is a bit of gore, but it is never more than a few animals placed on the stomach of the victims. The zombie makeup on the other hand looks good and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims is sometimes funny. There is also a half-decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the chipmunks voice is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on a fishing line. <br /> <br /> The end is extremely bad. You'll expect the killer to make much more of a fight than he does. God knows how they made enough money to make a successor. <br /> <br /> 4/10
