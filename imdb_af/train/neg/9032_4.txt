I never understood Garbo's appeal. She always gets stuck in her movies as it is jammed, not all that is tempting, and the annoying voice the tuba section drowned. She was also a very limited actress, as Gloria Swanson was much better off in the quiet era. In this last film, her performance is very average and even unkempt. She tried hard, but it didn't matter, because the writing was even worse than her acting. <br /> <br /> A will be screwball romcom that is never once credible and never comes off the ground (although Melvyn Douglas succeeds There is potential, but the writing fails in almost every department and wastes every Douglas and Garbo had good enough chemistry together, but this one is not even a place on Ninotchka, which I also overestimated.
