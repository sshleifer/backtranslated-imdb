After watching Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and having loved it every second, I finally had a chance to see that it was in Transformation. I was really disappointed because it wasn't nearly the highest standards of the first. 90 minutes people with baskets on their heads are not my idea of ​​a good movie. The Philip Glass score for this one did not have the beauty or the power of the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this movie was slow and useless. An irrigated version of Baraka, which is the same idea but better done. I really hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste.
