Not that I was really surprised .... movies are never as good as the books they came from. I look forward to seeing this movie because it is one of my favorite books, although I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they deviated too much from the book's storylines, and the movie version did not convey how awful this house really was. Finishing was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle looks terrible because of a very bad cosmetic operation. The acting was at its best. Perhaps if a theater version is made so they don't have to stay in Lifetime's "made for TV movie" box so much, it will be a better movie. If you've seen this movie, I encourage you to find and read the book. I doubt you will be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I read every time.
