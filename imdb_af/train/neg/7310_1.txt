** SPOILERS UNDER !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever winked at the WORST movie of the year ... what I saw is. This movie is GARBAGE straight! There is so much wrong with the movie you can't help but be surprised at how bad it really is. This movie had so much potential to be good, but eventually made nothing of it. The characters were as stupid as one could be; For the whole movie you just ask yourself "why would you do this?" or "what's your point to do?" ... that's how illogical and stupid the characters are. We don't get any background in them, so of course you don't really give a rats to their fate ... you can just laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - The "slut" (Marcy) for example ... was she so horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in it. It's almost as if the filmmakers need an excuse to give her the virus so voila! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Will anyone really go into the bush and drink water from the tap of a cabin WITHOUT look at it first? <br /> <br /> - Why didn't Bert just shoot the sick guy from the beginning? Movie would have been so over. Then they finally killed him. <br /> <br /> - Why did it take so long to finally leave the cabin, even though they had to walk? "No, I will just wait until two of my friends are infected (one of the deadly flashes) to finally get out of it. <br /> <br /> - What was exactly the reasoning behind Paul's attempt to fish from the body of the Hermit, just to fall into the infected reservoir and become infected with the virus Pure STUPIDITY! <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less a knowledge of These idiots, I don't think there was ever a worse end to a movie, in the beginning the kids asked the hockey cashier for which the gun was, and he said it was for the niggers. movie goes to 3 young blacks (dressed in leather clothes, one of them in a du-rag no less) in the store .... find out that the cashier is cleaning it so they can be used for hunting. continue to give them all the pounds and handbags and joke with them as if they were his housekeepers. <br /> <br /> Well, what is the hell of the point? One can be unhelpful, what were the filmmakers doing in the movie? Of course, as a Black man I was insulted by the initial 'Nigger' comment. It was a tasteless, useless remark. My question to the filmmakers: what was the end of the black children? Was it compelling me to forget about the initial racist comments made earlier? To smooth things out with black viewers, by joking? Well, I for one, did NOT find the pathetic attempt at humor funny. The whole movie was a joke .... a PATETIC attempt at movies that should not be given the time of day. Peter Jackson really thought this movie was so good? What movie did he watch? <br /> <br /> ZERO * from **** stars .... if I could give it a lower rating, I would have liked it. Please, fellow IMDb people, don't waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this horror of a 'movie'. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
