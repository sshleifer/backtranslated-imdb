I noticed that "Fire" was on the cable the other night and I started watching it, because I couldn't remember anything about it except I remember being a horrible movie when I saw it in '85. Twenty years later, the film is still terrible. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as evidenced by the title. When I heard the song again, I chose a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery they had imposed. And to put together this musical attack, Rob Lowe's character played a saxophone, and there was one scene where he played a solo attack as if he were Charlie Parker. Just his shrill tone and play thought more of a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters were very unattractive, although I have to say they did a good job of making equally unattractive actors to portray them. Actually, I thought Mare Winningham was attractive, and I initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear, but when they reached the end of the film, she decided to have sex with Rob Lowe's character. It is likely to be preferred to transfer a variety. of sexual diseases if such things are voted on.
