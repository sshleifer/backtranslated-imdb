So why does this show suck? Unfortunately, this is really the only question, because it is undoubtedly so. <br /> <br /> For those who are unfamiliar with the supposition of the show, the Caveman group focuses on a number of Neanderthals and their struggle to exist in contemporary America and is based on the characters in a series of television ads for Geico Insurance appear. The concept is solid and there is every reason to think it can be done successfully. <br /> <br /> I had to consider it for a while, but then the tagline of the ads - something that has the effect of "We're not that much different from you" gave me the key to the show's sucking unit. Although cavemen / Neanderthals are actually a different species from humanity, the title characters of this show are exactly the same as those of us who are boring. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's my background as a game writer - rather than a rare, hack, California-based committee - but this show had so much potential, and none of it was realized. To begin with, the producers must have focused on the fun things that cavemen would do differently from us. <br /> <br /> What could be imaginative, for example, giving their careers like everlasting student and furniture store, when they would be more compelling on things like underground workers and guides at cave parks? Why would they play prose like games like squash, when a whole episode can be dedicated to them, try to get hunting licenses to go to spear games? A spectacle like this can write itself, and it takes some deliberate bad writing to make it so fiery and boring. <br /> <br /> Another exhaustion of this show is an attempt to portray the cavemen as subject to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. To yawn! This has been done so many times before, and never more than that. And, as mentioned before, Neanderthals is really another species, so use it as a metaphor for racial stereotyping. It's both uncompelling and off the point. <br /> <br /> Responses are welcome, including those of anyone who wants to tell me why I'm wrong. I would like to enjoy this show and am sorry that I have not been able to do so. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Varhola, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
