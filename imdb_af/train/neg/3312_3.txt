... but I'm sorry I saw it. As the ratings on IMDb are relatively high (and they should also be relatively high on Netflix), I think I put it in my queue because it is advertised as a soft comedy from the UK, a category that produces many movies what I liked loved it. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, falls into the category of lethal comedies usually populated by Hollywood movies produced and directed by the talented. Brenda Blethyn is a skilled actress, and I liked her in other movies. The concept - a gardener who grows marijuana to overcome victory, she finds behind her husband's death - does not abuse me. Despite the harsh efforts of the film to produce humor, the movie falls flat on his face (which was flat on his ass, it could have been snapper) as far as my wife and I were concerned. Be warned, oh gentle reader, not everything, but succeed British comedies. This one is a dud.
