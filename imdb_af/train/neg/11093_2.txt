If this film is about a fictitious character, the movie itself can stand and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on "facts" that were very unfairly moved to Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts have been ignored. (Carter was not the number one player during the murders, there is no evidence that he has saved a friend of a child molester in his youth), but some of the bigger facts, as apparently to rob. becoming a decision to Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable for those of us who have seen the battle on tape and totally disrespectful to Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who was at best in trouble and to much trouble more than a normal person (has been hit several times in the hands of women) is for me strange. Ruben Carter was never, by seeing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to talk to his son, a person that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story because their vehicle is outside of me. Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they have to bend the truth in all their biographies to make them credible? (Here's a suggestion What do you think of Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now it's inspiring). Based on all the inaccuracies in the movie, I suggest you forward this one.
