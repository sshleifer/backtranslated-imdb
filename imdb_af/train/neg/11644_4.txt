Yes, I get Pasolini and its surroundings, but at the same time I feel his "Decameron" is greatly overestimated, and more than a bit disturbing. Overestimated because the so-called "realism" is what he sets (crowd, crumbling architecture, etc.) in the absurd and straightforward way the characters act. In the pursuit of realism, Pasolini has used many non-actors, but their heart-in-the-head lights stare and painfully uncomfortable line-up gives the whole a very varied and inconsistent feeling. And frankly, many of the toothless, fearless people are painful to look at. <br /> <br /> And Pasolini's "Decameron" is disturbing (at least to me) because of the coincidental and prevalent homosexual content. Not because I am prickly or homophobic, but because Pasolini's emphasis on homosexual images and situations is contrary to the neo-realism he otherwise assumes, so it comes down as unnecessary and forced. One can almost hear him say, "Ooh, I have to keep a cute, naked boy in this scene!" Sometimes it seems that Pasolini tries to play the homosexual angle on his nose with critics, and sometimes because he enjoys that aspect himself, whatever his audience may prefer. <br /> <br /> The inequality of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini's "Decameron" struck me as a failure of Pasolini as a narrator, rather than being an aspect of neo-realism. He seems to be bored with every story and so he enslaves them unsatisfactorily and with little conviction. Even the Pasolini's last dialogue in the movie, which some people find spicy ("Why create an artwork when there is dreaming is so much sweeter?") - for me it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would care to make a movie if he feels that way? In my opinion, a much better-crafted film (and with more homosexual content) is Fellini's "Satyricon". It is also full of bizarre people and absurd situations, but it succeeds because of its pacing, direction and strong storytelling, while "Decameron" does not fail by the same elements.
