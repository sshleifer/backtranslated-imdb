First, I want to say that this movie is worth more than the four stars I rated. I gave it four stars, because for me this 86 minute movie always looks like 2 and a half hours and is not enough to do it. However, the "Big Alligator River" (the title my DVD calls it) is better than your average nature finds. <br /> <br /> A tourist resort in the jungles of Southeast Asia is just open and uses the natives while trying to manipulate wildlife. Mother Nature seeking revenge comes in the form of god Kroona, a gigantic Alligator. But the creature is not the only thing the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and resort staff) have to worry about, the natives are also rubbed in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> This movie is a well done adventure / horror story with good musical score and direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the movie, is of course false look. Some of the close-ups of his jaws are good, but it has to be everything we need to see. Some of the underwater detached shots make it painful to see that what we are really dealing with is a squeaky crocodile. You can probably get to a zoo souvenir shop. But the natives are credible, if not authentic. <br /> <br /> Probably not the movie that will give you non-stop excitement, if any, but shot and produced well enough to get good mention. And like a lot of creature movies, this one ends up with a very high body number. It also has very good jungle. Acting, however, is under par, but who has expected it to be better? <br /> <br /> Much, much better than the recent US counterpart "Primeival", but nothing that can be compared to "Jaws". But remember it may not be drastic at some points.
