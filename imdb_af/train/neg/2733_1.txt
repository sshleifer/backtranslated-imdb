I debated whether to mark the spoiler box or not. Since 99% of this show has probably been seen by a Scrubs follower, it probably doesn't come under the category of a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Clamp Programs. Oh dear. We all knew that Friends were going to focus, when they started climbing shows ... and five and a half years in Scrubs they went and fell into the hole. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if the writers couldn't write that week and just said to themselves: "Let's show the other funny things." It didn't work. <br /> <br /> To begin with, showing all the times people fall, is not funny when taken from context. It's not funny to see Todd hanging through his banana hammock, unless we know why he was at his banana hammock. <br /> <br /> Secondly, for what a compilation of JD's fantasies had to be, one Turk's dream was, Another was not his fantasy, though I forget about that. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is completely forgotten. We've seen all these things before. And the collection of clips of people dancing? Why? It's not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must admit that two of my favorite Scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation. Dr. Cox realizes that Ben is dead and JD tells him how proud he is. <br /> <br /> But even to see those moments, the episode didn't save. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> Worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, don't let your performance go the same as friends, keep it fresh, keep it funny ... or turn it on.
