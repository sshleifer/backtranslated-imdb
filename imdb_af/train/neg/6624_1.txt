This movie was absolutely ... uh i can't find the word oh wait ... crap! I mean when it started, I was like yes it looks good and then it is so boring. I almost fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that I had caught a late show because it was full of dirt. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best, but the throw could never live to the original Sholay movie. I mean what he thinks of doing a remake. What did he try to do? Like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year as he did for Black? Ajay and that other guy were good, especially the other man who played raj, because he was the one looking at everyone. What did Amitabh do? He destroys his own dignity by doing all these silly movies. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now that means I have to collect some of his money and move as far away from Bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and I tell you he is already past half his way . I mean it's really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who is now getting a very good name because of the recent demise of Amitabh. I never really liked him because he thinks he is God and I just knew Abhishek was going to be in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save your Â£ 17,75 and spend it on something good, look at Heyy Babyy because it's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the cards!
