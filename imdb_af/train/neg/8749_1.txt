A horrible movie like everyone said. What made me light was the comic appearance of Scott McNealy, who gave an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a SUN logos wall. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically determines itself by its hatred of Microsoft. They were instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, were they stupid enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to the fire? <br /> <br /> There is no public record I see about SUN's involvement, but the creators of this movie know Scott McNealy clearly. An interesting puzzle.
