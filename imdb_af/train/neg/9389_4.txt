According to IMDb, as well as to every other site that holds a review; this "thing" does not have a director. Well, that will certainly explain a lot! Just a bunch of people gathered to shoot some twisted porn sequences and throw in an ultra-thin story about devil worship and women in the walls of a secluded sanitary area. "Hardgore" is an excellent example of a totally demented 70's because it's really made with a minimum of production values ​​and scripting inspiration. Violations of satanic cults were very popular in the early 70's and also in pornography. So why not combine the two? Here we have a simplistic story about a young, nymphomaniac girl dedicated to a spiritual asylum. From the first night she was drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo action. Really, a lot of dildo action. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she even has her throat gap the same night. The horror aspects are really poorly worked out, ranging from nice terrifying Satan masks to violent cut off penis attacks. Photography and acting appearances are almost unacceptably amateurish, but what do you expect from a movie that contains footage of sperm-free dildos and acclaimed male reproductive organs? The foremost lady Justina Lynn is a pretty pretty girl with an overwhelming body, but most of her co-stars (male and female) are spectacular and excessively hairless balls.
