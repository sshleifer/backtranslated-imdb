The movie has one naked scene: A man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his exposed genitals, slaps into the center of the screen. It is quite a long scene. What was the point? I almost thought it was funny, but we watched it with my mom and it wasn't funny to stare at DAT because it looked like a full minute. <br /> <br /> The movie is cold. None of the characters is equivalent. Audrey Tatou is of course cute, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't really recommend this movie. I expected it to be charming and fresh, but it was depressed. I wondered if the director was from a very top crust, educated French family and he looks at these characters. <br /> <br />
