This movie is terrible. Good fight scenes or not, the play is VERY bad, as you can say they read their lines of a map. With painful line delivery by everyone in the throw. Consider how a high school plays and cringing on the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions (strange pauses between the different characters' lines, combined with speedy line-up by others). If the movie was already actionable, it could be forgiven, but many of the movie included plot setup and Family Guy style, unauthorized cutting off (oh, wow, it's done badly). I suppose they were trying to be funny with it, but it came down again like a lot of high school and college enrollment students trying to set up a funny Youtube clip that afternoon. <br /> <br /> Now after the battle scenes. They are not bad, seen the level of quality seen throughout the film. Nothing great, certainly not everywhere in the same plane as other posters (Nothing like Drunk Master). The battles had an exaggerated feeling, with lots of cuts in different angles with blatant different positions by those involved. <br /> <br /> In sum, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of your friends' friends at this very, very inexpensive production. Which guy can you ask for? Oh, the same man who wrote, directed, produced and stared in this middle school masterpiece.
