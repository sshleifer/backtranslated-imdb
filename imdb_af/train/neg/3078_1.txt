I didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy movie to fail abysmally on both fronts .... really awful. The fact that it does not take itself seriously (usually a good thing) works against it, mainly because the actors are such wood that you will actually swear that they are reading tickets. On the rise though ..... the MST3K version, as always, has some lag.
