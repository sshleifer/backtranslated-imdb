I saw this movie yesterday. I rented the blockbuster DVD. In fact, I know one of the actresses from the movie. I won't say who ..! (It was kept under wraps.) But I have to admit, it wasn't as good as I thought. Tom Savini? Hats off to this guy. But it's a pity he wasn't in the movie for long. What the film lacks is the idea, the script, the sound, etc. It may look like a good movie. But it wasn't. It's nice. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad my sister paid Â£ 10 for renting 3 Blockbuster DVDs. I chose this one and I was disappointed. Anyway, thumbs down for me ..! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
