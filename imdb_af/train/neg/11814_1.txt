Back in the day, I remember dull Nintendo Power cartoons that had the same artwork as this show ... and then the word came that this show came to me a television! I wasn't esthetic, but curious. I was curious about how badly this show would suck. My friends all said that this show had no real meaning and was too stupid for straightforward people like me to enjoy (I'm actually gay), so I decided to watch the show with low expectations. WHAT A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate the new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate how much fanboys are about Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his name was) a good guy who owns a restaurant. Bad move, 4Kids TV! Escargon is nothing more than a runaway adviser to the King Dedede (who is struggling much in this show) and I hate the face of that one company that still provides Dedede with those terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> Then I started to hate Kirby even more, as it was clear that Nintendo had just been hurting Kirby. Kirby will never have beaten Mario in the fight for coolness, and Kirby will always be nothing but a small, small cream flight of gayness. NUF SOID !!!
