If you saw Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you will recognize some of the jokes made in this strange piece of craving. Written like a sitcom, this movie fails to get any similar cord going, from the self-help doctor played by the aways, sexy-chopped Molly Shannon to the "I'm thick and therefore funny" John Linette. The 5 women themselves are neat enough, and if done as a pilot for an action adventure series, it could have worked. Instead, it comes down to a male fantasy trying hard not to be politically wrong.
