I usually like Burt Lancaster's movies - especially when he is needed to go nuts with his impressive screen presence as in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest power, his magnetism, was also his greatest weakness, as he rarely, ever, underestimated anything. And it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders the Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was meant to be a kind of showman, but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. She's supposed to be smart, but it doesn't look like when Lancaster's blarney is thrown on the screen! In addition, the story may be one of the most thoughtless movies I've ever seen, and it's obvious it's a play based movie. It just seems to have been filmed at a healthy stage rather than in the vast wide open West, as it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very overstated movie.
