STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Miss the Mark *** There's a Little Inside ** Laughing Behind * The Wells <br /> <br /> Some plutoniums have gone and a some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of developing large-scale destruction. So Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his spicy young protégé Deke (Judson Mills, another actor of the previous movie) with the help of Josh's adopted daughter Que (Jennifer Tung) This was another movie dealing with terrorism, a year after the events of 9/11. In 2001, Norris even commented on how frankly the plot line to the movie looked like in New York, would have been what would have been in the mood for a movie where Norris and his side-kick kicked. a terrorist donkey as nothing else. Other than that, it is as interchangeable as Norris ever was in. It makes you wonder what the original had to justify in the first place a successor, and if one could get it, a President's Man 3 could soon come out soon. <br /> <br /> If you saw one Norris movie, you really saw them all and there really is nothing new or unexpected about this one, but at least you know what you get and like I have said, it was just what some needed to let go of steam. **
