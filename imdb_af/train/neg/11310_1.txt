First of all, yes, animals have emotions. If you didn't know, then I believe you are a moron. But let's assume that none of us is moron. We all know that animals have emotions, and we want to see how these emotions are visible in nature, right? <br /> <br /> What we get instead is a boring and ridiculous simplistic documentary that tries to show how animals are "human". The filmmakers look high and low for footage of animals that act in human behavior, and when that happens, they say, "The monkey is almost human!" (it's actually a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is in human terms. They waste time getting theorized on how dogs make "smiles," but not even do they call what a stagger. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even go as far as dressing in chimpanzees in human clothes and wearing a cowboy hat. <br /> <br /> I expected an insightful animal documentary on their own terms. I wanted to learn how animals emulate in their own languages. But, instead, researchers look back on pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimpanzees "Christmas celebration" and it was enough to turn my stomach. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't end there. Half of these documentaries were filmed, not in the wild, but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All the camera shots of chimpanzees are by steel bars, and we see how these monkeys are washed together in their sterile concrete pens. A particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning (although you have to find it quickly) where a captive monkey says in sign language: "Want to go out. Hurry." <br /> <br /> Clear references are made to "stress tests" and psychological experiments I scream to think about. Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth, and are given a wire frame to prove that baby monkeys desire a "mother figure". And after 40 years of experimentation, smug researchers complain about their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotions. <br /> <br /> A chimney named "Washoe" has been in a concrete cage since 1966. , and to this day she remains so. We get a brief glance (again through bars) of her leaning against a concrete wall, with a rather slim expression. Personally, I don't need to see any further experimental data. Wasoe, I apologize for our entire species.
