Birthday girl doesn't know what it wants - it's a comedy, it's a drama ... it just doesn't know. What could have been a very funny or touching movie ending in no one's country. The premise is originally enough to justify a scripture full of interesting scenarios, but scarcely deliver and end with petition. It's a real shame when you look at the cast - it's all very solid all the way through, but they don't get the chance to shine. Very disappointing.
