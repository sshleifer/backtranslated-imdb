For a comic writer, Woody Allen lets the paying viewer really do with this slight attempt at character development. There are some entertaining moments, but no more than one would have listened to their drier tumble tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell wastes his time in this movie that doesn't usually show off his funny show. Amanda Peet did well, but again he didn't have the room to move into this other movie. The film is so heavy and boring that it can't be executed, but if done, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies in one scene and don't really achieve anything, but to show that their writer can sometimes write some funny dialogue, you'll love it.
