I enjoyed "American Movie", so I rented Chris Smith's first movie, which I also thought to be a documentary. In the first minute I saw that it was not, but I gave it a breeze. <br /> <br /> What a dead end movie. Being true to life almost serves you if you are just going to investigate boredom, especially. tediousness with which we are already talking. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but will it be a relevance to anyone who sucks 1) a lot of work and 2) most of them are crappy, minimum wage work in the service sector ??? I knew it before I saw the movie. However, it did not really provide an investigation, because while the movie is struggling to feel 'right' (handheld camera, no music, etc.), it just hardly goes out like in the "real world". <br /> Would an employer for Randy be so cheerful when he picked up his check after Randy stopped him 3 days when the man said he expected him to stay 6 months? Or the day after he left his job (and screwed the machine, was he working), that everyone would be so easy on him? <br /> <br /> A big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This man is a loser. Not because he's stuck in these jobs, or has a nice apartment, or looks like one. He's a dope. He doesn't pay attention to or even really tries at this job. He has zero personality. If I had to hold on to someone, he wouldn't make it past the interview. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to what Chris Smith does next, but guys, beat the "this-is-important movie" stuff. "American Job" doesn't work.
