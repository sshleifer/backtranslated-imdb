(First, don't apologize for my bad English). Of course, just a movie with Jessica Simpson can include serious kinds like this. I'm a Norwegian, and I've offended and shocked me. The makers of this movie did not take the time to do them. research on making this American / "Norwegian" movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. <br /> <br /> So I put my fixes out of my frustration: -The country is called Norway, not Norway. - "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. -Norwegian priests never use those black caps with the white paper on their necks, as the Protestant church is by far dominant. True, we have a traditional folk outfit (which we only use twice a year), but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit. I couldn't understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie. Jessica had no sense. Neither has the "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> the only thing I recognize is the Norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but it's so stereotypical that people think about Norway!) Oh yes. <br /> <br /> Well .. I think the people who made this movie will never read this comment. but I cleaned at least a few things and got rid of that frustration. <br /> <br /> I am proud of my country and I would like people in the US to be less stereotypical and more accurate. when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> Dit was alles .. Long live Norway! ; p
