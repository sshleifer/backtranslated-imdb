Cut after the race, it's one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not that they didn't try. There was a decent writing with some elements of structure there, a good throw, some good acting. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements might be bad structure and no content story, very persuasive (which is probably much better when built-in), some bad direction and editing. I had enough about an hour to break my hair out in about an hour and a half, and much agitation in the hour and fifty minutes ran it. There was also an infinity about it all, that I was with someone who was a heroin addict. He was excited to glamorize something that was not good. This was enhanced by the beautiful 17-year-old girl who fell in love with the 30-year-old junkie. <br /> <br /> And the madness of the head was enough. There were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure, but the end result was listless and infinite (with unequal timelines). The characters were colorful, but to no end, which made me feel bad for the quality actors you haven't seen enough yet. <br /> <br /> Skip it. I assumed it was a director of the first time enchanted by his own villages, but he has done so before. I'm amazed at how this and many other very bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money.
