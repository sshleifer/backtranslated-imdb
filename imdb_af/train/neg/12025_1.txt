This movie was on the Romance channel, and I thought it could be a goofy 80 movie that would be pleasurable on one level or another, so my brother and I watched it. Son sucked it. Boy loved girl - correction, his * dream * girl (apparently there is a difference, and I'm surprised he realizes she is his dream girl - he was beaten by more than 30 feet just for the power of dreamies show), the boy ends up as a female woman to be near a dream mission (creative in that it is a distant plan, but not creative in that there are probably no better solutions ), uncomfortable situations arise, a game is made (it looks like late afternoon - or the place was somehow responsible for this strange lighting, or the actors had to wait until they were away from their day work to the set to come, I suspect the latter). Very uncomfortable, very pathetic. It's almost never amusing * accidentally * amusing, so there's really nothing to do with it.

But these are unlikely motives - I would say 'systematic disruption of the senses' would be a more justified goal. I'm surprised I watched it all. I think this is the kind of thing you see halfway through a morbid, self-flagellant inner problem and think you can be so well done so you can tell your friends and family that you're actually sitting through such a horrible movie, on the Chances are it will give you sympathy for the dubious state of your mental health. Can you * take the challenge?
