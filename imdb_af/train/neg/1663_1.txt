First of all, this plot is very exaggerated. Girl wants to make it, everyone loves her, a snobby girl enters, everything looks lost, girl pulls through, everyone loves her. Etc. Throw in the pace, a handsome male crushing the heroine, plus single parent problems and it's so predictable that you can repeat it practically. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate how they continue to reject classical music. They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is acting and sneaky. I can't remember the quote exactly, but I remember at one point in the movie, Holly says, "Why do they have to be so up-to-date ... so classic?" . <br /> <br /> Third, I went dozens of times, but the only reason I can think of making this movie is to promote Britney Spears. There is no point. <br /> <br /> And oh yes, while the actress who portrayed Holly (it's not sure if it really was her song or not) had a pretty good voice was not as wonderful as they make it out - especially when she calls. She was left over all the time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
