Let's be honest here: the only reason someone bought it, the only reason someone reviewed it, and the only reason anyone could claim it, is because David Lynch made it and because you David Lynch's kids want. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of crap. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Lynch would normally convey you and experience absurdity in himself as a pure subject. Perhaps the abominable, cacophonic sound, and chicken crabs must imply something about humanity's place in the world, about our relationship with the Real, about the absurdity of everything. <br /> <br /> Instead, it just says one thing to me: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to be offensive, I could drop Hansen on the gate and make my ears bleed. If I wanted to be absurd for the sake of absurdity, I could just take a dump on a plate and look for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a single redeeming quality for Dumbland - it's meta, meta funny. It's so bad it's not even funny, because it's so bad. However, this fact is a bit funny. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, buy Dumbland. If not, save yourself the pain.
