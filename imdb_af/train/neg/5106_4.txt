Alien LOVE (As this film is known in Britain) is a very strange movie. I don't mean it's an esoteric art house in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman. I mean it is a TVM with curse, sex, a very good T&A, a bad writing and a very retro feel. You can only suggest someone like John Hughes to set it up ten years earlier, although he would of course cut out the T&A. <br /> <br /> Going back to the bad writing, one of the problems is that few characters have any type of motivation, especially Amanda. Why did she pick up Connie at the bar? Similarly, can she meet a stranger? Do you see what I mean about retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and a lot of other mid-1980s movies had this kind of plot, most of which is more defined and convincing than the one seen here. The storyline continues to follow a badly defined, unconvincing and illogical path <br /> <br /> It said I followed ALIEN LOVE, not just to the T&A on the screen. As a sci-fi sex comedy, it's much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS IS EASY
