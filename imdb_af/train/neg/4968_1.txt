I expected the movie based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on the Beowulf epic, but said from the sample's perspective. <br /> <br /> Whatever you might think of Gardner's book, shouldn't be a movie based on the Beowulf epic Grendel, if it says nothing more about the monster than the few pathetic scenes in which the CG sample is not indicated as anything other than a modified Predator. <br /> <br /> In addition, writers should also be penalized for scaling up the original story and contributing to the continuing growing ignorance of mass-TV audiences across the US. <br /> <br /> Typical Hollywood to get it so wrong. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a total waste of time.
