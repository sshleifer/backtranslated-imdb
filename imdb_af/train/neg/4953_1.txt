I've never had comment on IMDb, but I feel I need to look at the Batman animation. His absolute garbage! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early nineties, so what does hell do with the winning formula? I feel like writing a letter of complaint to the WB. The original animation was dark and devastating, exactly as Batman intended. WB had to get it with a little Batman or the Future. Now they produce this drift. The Joker doesn't look remotely from the Joker of DC comics. GS must sue. I appeal to everyone who agrees with me to email or write to WB and use people's power to get the original formula back
