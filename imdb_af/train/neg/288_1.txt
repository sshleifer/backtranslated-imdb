There was nothing of value in the original movie, this one was even a lame. The fact that I even found it was absolutely wonderful. Anyone linked to this movie should be high on something! So what was the story line? What was with the girl? Was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, I tried several times to see it. I even borrowed a child from someone to get feedback. Child said it was stupid and he was four years old. I find that possibly some credit can go to the filming director, as possible some of the shots made the movie more than a B movie. It can push it. I loved the theme song. Good thing it was just a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you could enjoy the movie if you were high, as the role and the crew should be. Is pot legal in France?
