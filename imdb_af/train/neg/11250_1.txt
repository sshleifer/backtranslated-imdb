I like the period, I like the effort, but I watch a movie that looks like I'm looking through a coke bottle. It gives me a headache. If I played computer games that were vague and out of focus, I would upgrade my computer. It may be that the appearance of the director, but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I didn't take someone with me to this movie, I was out there. Although it was a series and not a movie by itself, Band of Brothers reached it. They made it look like WWII footage, with just a touch of grain, but it was still a pleasure to watch. Movies need real people, with real sets, and real places; Use CGI when appropriate, not for a whole movie.
