I thought the movie was a poor documentary. Nothing of substance was discussed. It seemed as if the ideas were cheap and nothing new. The film had no wonder or romance, anything that would really drive one into science. Most scientists have "stereotyped" and sometimes strange. A woman said her awards didn't matter much, just children being helped. She said after a 10 minute scene she explained all her awards. Play "humble scientist", are we? "I have comparisons that dance in my head," another said. I don't see how this explains to us. It did not cover significant effects of science on our culture. Science of science is barely touched. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie for a 10-14 year old. Other than that, I felt it was boring and unobtrusive. <br /> <br /> 4/10
