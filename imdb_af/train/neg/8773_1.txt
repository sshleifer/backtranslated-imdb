If you saw a lot less movies, it could be a great one for you. If you've seen many movies, it's a joke. The act of real heroes is depicted very badly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are many flashbacks, and above all, the scenes are fatally executed. New characters, good direction, would have done better work, but since it contains all the bollywood heroines, you can predict what will happen next. You don't feel sad if something happens, the emotions they portray are terrible, mainly because we've seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies. It is supposed to be a realistic movie, but it fails to show. There are times you wonder, you have filled thousands of lower vehicles with soldiers moving and bombarding the Pakistanis on them and none of their bombs hit them. Are the packs really bad to pursue or the director made them look foolish? There were only a few characters that acted. It was very good, but as far as plot, action is concerned, it is poorly targeted. This movie could have been short if they took out songs, flashbacks, at the point.
