There is nothing like watching giant robots fight over a desert desert, and deliver Robot Wars. Certainly, the play is common, the dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has huge robots! The special effects themselves are actually pretty good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but they contain a minimum of graphics and rather use miniature, so it has a relatively good age. The shortcomings are easily overlooked, as the movies are short-lived and it does have some humor in parts that make it very enjoyable. I would recommend any fan of giant robots or cute sci-fi looking for a sad hour of distraction.
