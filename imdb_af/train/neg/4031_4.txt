Actually, it's a horrible movie scam. The 70 minute run time is very well stocked with stock footage. The rest are non-description exteriors and kill interior scenes. The plot outline is very poorly rendered. They are all just perfunctory scenes as constricted. There is no attempt at drama in stage selection, but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors. Please do not ask. <br /> <br /> The plot relates to a rocket protruding a million-degree heat-surrounding earth that is five miles high and destroys the earth. This is a real time difference that should be deduced if a custom H-bomb can be formed and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour. Nothing much to report here, except for a malicious speech by a scientist against the project, as there may be some kind of life on board and think of the scientific possibilities, but this speech made by the mandatory idiot liberal is actually a lot of work. /> <br /> What saves this movie, somewhat unique, is the stock image. I have never seen a bigger variety of fifties airplanes in any other movie. It is by no means a complete list, but only a few of the planes I could see. There is a short eavesdropping by a pilot flying in an alternative shot an F-89 Scorpio and an F-86. First, the Royal Canadian Air Force is in Hawker Hunters and F-86 Saber Jets (or Canadian CF-13s) and even some CF-100 Clunks. <br /> <br /> For some reason, B-52s, B-47s and even B36s are seen to take away. More padding. <br /> <br /> "These Canadian aircraft are moving at 1200 miles per hour." I don't think so, because one of them seems to be a WW2-era Gloster Meteor, the rest F-80s. The Meteors push the attack and one turns into a late F-84F with a flight early straight wing F-84s attacking in formation. <br /> <br /> There is a strange tandem cabin version of the F-80 that doesn't "It looks like the T-33 training type is an interim radar inter-interceptor variant yet. . It is projected into a snowstorm. <br /> <br /> A trapped aircraft guard is seen from about 500 meters. It introduces F-8U Crusaders, F-11F Tigers, A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors. The air force scrumbles F-86s and F-84s and more F-89s you've ever seen in your life, as well as F-100 Super Sabers and F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F-100s are pushing their attack with sooooo much padding. The F-89s release their rockets into their wing points in Slo Mo. The F-86s, an F-102 release a falcon, even a few F-80s (F-94s?) With mid-wing missile release arrows. There is a very strange shot of a late model F-84 (prototype?) With a straight wing early model F-85 above it, a manufacturer's (Advertising Aviation) advertising video that shows the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet. How it matters here is anyone who guesses. <br /> <br /> There are other large stock images of Ottawa in the old days when the capital of Canada was a great place in the road and especially amazing footage from New York City's Times Square during one of the Civil Defense Drills. in the early 50's. <br /> <br /> I think we should also consider the idea that it was filmed in Canada with the possible exception of the automatic chase seen in the picture, as the Pacific Ocean is in the background. The use of a Jowett Jupiter is somewhat surprising and there is also a good TR 3. Canada should have been inexpensive and it is very free to use a lot in the background. <br /> <br /> As far as the real story of the movie is concerned, there is little to recommend it when the mystery of just who Ellen Parker is gives the finger to the end of the picture. And she's definitely turning someone away. Can it be, R as in Robert Loggia? The director who died before this movie was released? Her career as it was her last credit? <br /> <br /> It's like the newspaper, the gift bought in was more valuable than the gift.
