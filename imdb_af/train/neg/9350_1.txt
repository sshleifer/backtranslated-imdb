This movie was terrible. The first half hour is much like a ... Well, excuse for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork! It was apparently a tribute, like the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the chief's wall, but "ripoff" is the more appropriate word. The film felt as if it had been torn right from the Kubrick classic, just filmed by a new director's eyes. A blind director. Unfortunately, the movie gets even worse when it stops Kubrick's mass murder. As another commentator said, the depth of this movie was just slipped into your throat. Arrogant, self-absorbed and ultimately meaningless. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the protagonist ramblings will become a nerve if there was real character development in this movie. I felt absolutely nothing for this man. And I'm an alcoholic, so I find that if someone can feel something for him, it will be me. Strange character development, dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the title. For a movie called "16 Years of Alcohol", alcoholism is hardly a factor in the movie. See first paragraph - it was such a slaughter of a Clockwork Orange I can't get over it. A more suitable title would have been "16 years of violence" or, even better, a clockwork banana. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and take it anyway, drink it. Trust me.
