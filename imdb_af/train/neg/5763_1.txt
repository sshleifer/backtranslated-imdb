<br /> <br /> "Aside from Hollywood veterans?" (The fashion brothers were asked), that's what Hollyweird demanded and that's what it has. But so many of his recent resolutions made this one a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> The director is so out of touch with today's audience, to bring back physical pratfalls and gags instead of a funny dialogue is just a disaster. I knew it, the audience knew it and the CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a shame, why did they ever consider changing drivers? Not only that, but the two Wayan brothers played as two of four primary characters, without them being just a farce and a sad. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
