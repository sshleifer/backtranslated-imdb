This movie is just an excuse for the author to make a movie of 2 failed scripts. <br /> <br /> Its characters are just a compilation of characters with clich√©-tragic or comic features. The sum total of what is neurotic dialogue just as Woody Allen could write. wife loves this because it's like looking in the mirror so they will probably enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> These movies were not enjoyed by me, as there was no car racing and the movie had no fights. There were also no drug bases or gangsters. Not to mention a lack of snakes. This movie had no snakes. Not my cup of tea, and maybe not your eater, so think about what I said before looking at this movie. <br /> <br /> Unless of course you look like a woman, you have weight issues. Man issues enjoy sex and the city. and ally mcbeal, then it makes sense to you.
