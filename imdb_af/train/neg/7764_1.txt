What is this? A low budget sex comedy? Anyway, it perfectly describes the people in Spain. They can come up with a better idea, I mean they have been doing such movies since the 60's. And people love them! It's not a teenage comedy or a family one (you can't let your 12-year-old watch kiss 2 guys in bed, he'll never go to Spain). It should be considered "R" because only people look 35+ to watch: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I don't like gays (it's quite an important part of the movie). <br /> <br /> Foreign humor is horrible in movies (except Kusturica), hold onto dramas! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
