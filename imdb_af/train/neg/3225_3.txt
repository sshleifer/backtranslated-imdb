Kids love dinosaurs. It's part of their culture. But they have The Land Before Time. The original. At least that movie had the heart. This. This movie is just pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs does not mean that you can just draw an old story and show it to the kids. This movie has no plot, the whole assumption is stupid, and it's more by the numbers. Not so soul sucking as Theodore Rex, but it is light away from a country ahead of time.
