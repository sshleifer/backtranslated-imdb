Fans of Goreme Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere as they pick up this movie for his usual abdominal muscles because blood is precious little in this film. Instead, Lewis decided to try to trust the bizarre story by relying on special bargain basement bases on a budget that would probably have been doubled if the speaker came out on their bags one day. Oddly, while inexpensive and very poorly acted (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), the total impunity of the plot keeps on paying attention. Imagine what this movie could have been with a decent budget! Overall, it is for champagne taste on a beer budget.
