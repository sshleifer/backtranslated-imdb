If at least the cruelty and endless death had a purpose for the story to justify their inclusion, but the writing was just incomprehensible and just stupid. <br /> <br /> It didn't go anywhere, the story had no readable continuity. It was just a bunch of incessant snags and a very stupid end as if to say. "The end * beckons my haters and my few defenders to view my garbage." <br /> <br /> I don't get it, a masked killer that never removed his mask in jail, a prison scene that was supposed to be the guards raping an ugly distorted killer and kill him and nothing else? no explanation, no punishment, a very poor main character character who was a waste of an actor like Pare, who did not try to kill the man who killed his police, a baby, a woman and a dog tortured and sent to you to watch video. Cops who, for one reason or another, fled everybody in the dark separately in the dark at night in his farm house, like a bunch of poorly written teenage characters to kill one Time like a lot of idiots, and no one else police member hears that they die one after the other in the dark and just move around without reason until each is killed. <br /> <br /> A lot of the horrible real animal snuff scenes in the beginning for no reason or explanation, he was reminded, was he watching it to masturbate, it was comedy for him ... what was it ? No, Boll thought to throw it in to upset animal lovers ... whatever. <br /> <br /> then Pare will believe the word of a psycho-path to let his family go if he kills himself ... a more gullible, dumb man you never saw in a movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I'm trying to not completely hate his works. I'm trying to find some reason to explain an abusive art, but these things ... pure crap. <br /> <br /> Boll, what else do you do? I hope you find out because I know many more deserving people who can't dream of getting the budget you get over and over to make their movies. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see Boll At his best check "Post" it was really good.
