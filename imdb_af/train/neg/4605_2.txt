This movie was written by Charlie Higson, who had previously done the "legendary" Fast Show and his own performance based on one of the characters of the Kitskou (Tony the car salesman). He also wrote James Bond books for children. <br /> <br /> In fact, I've seen only Gordon's movies based on Lovecraft's stories, and each one is wonderful. Here Gordon tries to do something else. The style is completely "contemporary", which means shaky camera, fast and strange cut, cool chillout music in the background. It works very well here, I think, but it's still meaningless and cheap. It often reminds me of the cameraman shaking his DV camera in front of the actors / actresses and trying to make attractive movements in the pictures (hoping that something tolerant would come from it). The casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is due to good direction. I think the main character, "zero" young man, is very interesting in his "zeros". The fat man is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but isn't him. But really shortly afterwards, it seems that the movie is not that interesting. In this case, I mean an endless series of scenes of sadism and disease. There aren't many people in this movie / story: it's totally pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dead. Needless to say there is no humor either. It is a 1'40 long vomit without any relief in any moment. In any case, Gordon remains one of the most interesting filmmakers today active, and I think of this movie as an experiment and a failure in it. Everybody must sometimes experience, just to learn and find their way back. This can be Gordon's most uninteresting and empty job.
