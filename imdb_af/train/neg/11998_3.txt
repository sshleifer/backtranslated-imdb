it's a terrible, horrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First of all TOOO long. the longest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The stories are too Damn Over the Top !! <br /> <br /> In fact, there are too many stories that ruined the story line. <br /> <br /> The comedy wasn't comedy !!!!! it was not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The story is so repulsive and badly written that it doesn't matter if the characters live or die ....... <br /> <br /> I have some expectations of this movie had ......... but my expectations had completely crashed in the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> The only thing good about this movie is the MUSIC. ..... and of course Vidya Balan. she gives the best performance and stands up among all the senior actors ...... she is just a new arrival and yet she shines and makes the rest of the role so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and the Blonde who play his love interest also help save this disastrous movie. Govinda fits perfectly into the role of the taxi driver. and the Blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance. <br /> <br /> Another talented actress Ayesha Takiya is totally wasted in this movie !!!! so is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay does his part well, but it was also over !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also completely wasted ...... <br /> <br /> The only one not wasted is Salman because he has no talent ever to be wasted !!!!!!!! ! <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a very impossible movie with Mishmashed script and TOOO Masladar that the storyline is formed according to the silly comedic scenes. Imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 it's four hours !! think and remember before going to the theater !!!!! better avoid it !!!!!
