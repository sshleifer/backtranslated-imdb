There are just so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The first twenty minutes of the movie can only be compressed with five or maybe ten. The overall movie has been (graciously) short, but it could be made possible by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion (how did the fog have a reference to The Wiz on that one?) And its subplot a a little closer to the main plot. In short, the writing had the seed of a good idea, but needed quite a bit of rework. <br /> <br /> Second, it could have done without the rough humor. The original also has a few that could have done, but at least there was almost an afterthought - here is flatulence and urination abundant. <br /> <br /> Third, the performance is a bit too self-conscious. The original series had it good enough, just like the first movie, but here it is just way, far too much. The Brendan Fraser jokes were just a little over (and why is there no mention of the "new Ursula"?). Other gags with the narrator, especially some interactions near the end, also surpasses good sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, a little more attention could be given to the CGI work. In the first, it was difficult to tell that Shemp was not a real elephant (except by behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally healthy special effects should only tell the story whether they are good or bad, and at least succeed in it. So it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> <br /> All that said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. It lacks Brendan Fraser's charm, but Christopher only succeeds in that particular comparison. He even managed to give George a little personal depth, which was a big mistake in a Jay Ward-inspired movie, but wasn't here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as even better than Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most other performances were fairly standard, and didn't make me feel good or bad.
