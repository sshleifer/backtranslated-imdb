I saw it at the Melbourne premiere <br /> <br /> It's level, two-dimensional, unpleasant and hard to believe the topic given, boring. The actors are prudent, but they didn't have much to do with the lot of wrestling and incomparable writing. For those who might be concerned that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualized, you can be comforted by the fact that this story telling is completely without any literary depth, totally on the surface and full of central decision-making standards. However, it does not work as a popcorn film. The pacing is too short and the vessel is too small to satisfy even the level of everyday action. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of doubt that Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself: "This is the best thing I could do with the material." <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class fighter, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. His story once again failed on the big screen. <br /> <br /> It's life.
