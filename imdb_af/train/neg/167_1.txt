Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series or even had an idea of ​​the storyline should be embarrassed by this series. The Sponsor doesn't come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector. The Klingons are never seen until Kirk meets them. The NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name. Should I continue? Berman and Pilliar made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was attracted to this series in every single episode. I don't blame her for not being involved in this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a good actor, just like the whole cast. I like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was canceled early).
