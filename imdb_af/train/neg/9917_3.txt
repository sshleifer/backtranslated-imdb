When Stanwyck's husband-to-be murdered on the eve of their wedding, she goes back to a mountain hut where she drops off a cliff and is rescued by the rich lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, leading to a definite one-sided marriage, spending on a large estate in Chicago (apparently surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted to break out of Cortez, but eventually returns to Morgan, in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution. <br /> <br /> This movie has a good role (Morgan is especially one of my favorites) and a good director, but the writing is wobbly and sometimes seems senseless. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but I was finally disappointed. Still worth watching for the role play, and it's good for anyone who's from the 1930s.
