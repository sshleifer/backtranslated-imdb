To confess that fantasies are about Brad Pitt is a tough recording for a heterosexual to make. But what can I tell you? Perhaps this is the well-known extra that everyone talks about and makes a star a star. It crosses the barrier. It draws you into unfamiliar sensual and emotional areas. Brando had it in the kicks, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean and of course and in recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and many very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has redefined the concept unilaterally. He's the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get a theater to see Troy. If you like the "Jupiter's Darling" style, you can enjoy it. But if you don't, go all the way, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
