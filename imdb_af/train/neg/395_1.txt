When I ordered it from Blockbuster's website, I had no idea that it would be as horrible as it was. Who knows? Maybe I forgot to take my ADD meds. I know that from the moment the role played in their station wagon, in their late 70s, they had wide collars, bell bombs and feathered hair, I knew that this misplaced jewel of the disco era was the glory of the dumpster. <br /> <br /> The first prediction of just how bad things were was the narrative at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic powers were doing to cause destruction on the universe, which made polyester and porn quality music forces the alleged viewer. From the very beginning, with the bad consequences for the "monsters" of another world, the house that jumps from universe to universe is as painful as looking at a basic school production of "The Vagina Monologues". <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, it was sure to sign something that happened when a small ship appeared. The "ship" was suspicious of what looked like old video and video camera parts and would attack anyone in his way. Of course, if it is slower than Bob Barker's intricate intestines, but it had a dangerous pencil-thin luminaire and the ability to push an ominous green glow that could stop dots and be equipped with a laser within an hour or so. two could cut through bare balsa wood (with a little help). <br /> <br /> Moving on ... As the reflection and the bell bodies continue ... We realized they were trapped in a Space Time Warp. How do we collect this little bit of scientific information? Because the eldest male chief tells his son that he reminds in a more or less off-the-beaten way how you won the big game over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing Coca-Cola. Was pops a scientist? No, but he knew about horses and seemed to be an amateur in string theory and Einstein's theories. <br /> <br /> The recording I watched on DVD was almost bootleg quality. The sound was muddy and the transmission looked like it was shot from a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone, unlike it was really really bad. (There isn't enough 'really' to really describe it.) <br /> <br /> I know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classrooms. I never saw this movie on its original version, but even back I think I would come to the same conclusion: bury this one quickly.
