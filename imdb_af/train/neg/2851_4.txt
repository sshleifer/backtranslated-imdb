There are often poorly-paired couples (in the general sense of the term). In Huston's movies: "African Queen" "Heaven knows Allison" "Roots of Heaven". "Misfits" ... "The Barbarian and the Geisha" (look at the title) is another good example, so to speak. It seems that Japanese things were trendy at the time. So it works like Sayonara, the world of Suzie Wong and the home of the August moon. Huston's attempt could be the worst of this rather bad lot (with the exception of "Susie"). John Wayne fits perfectly into Ford's world. In Huston he is like a bull in a china store. His Japanese partner is completely soft. Even the dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the film from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those who have totally welcomed Huston's work should choose it, among all his other great movies.
