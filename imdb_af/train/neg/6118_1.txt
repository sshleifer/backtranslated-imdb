This is not a very good story of the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in the dull! Upper Derek in '10 'was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing more than soft porn. If you are there, then fast forward and skip the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show her horrible play. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than that; it was one of his few mistakes! Don't waste your time on this movie ... buy the book earlier.
