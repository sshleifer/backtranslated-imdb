This documentary begins with an interesting premise - it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus, as is commonly seen, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, however, the movie immediately moves to gearbox, and it no longer becomes an attack on Christianity, and very focused on the easy targets. <br /> <br /> The author / director is clearly having some problems with the church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger) and this film seems to be his form of release. It will be interesting to expand the first 20 minutes, but overall the film is disappointing.
