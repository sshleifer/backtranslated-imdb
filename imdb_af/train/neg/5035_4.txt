Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she discovers her sexuality with boys. But it seems that all the guys are spending their time with all the wind killed in this generic '80s slasher movie. This is to local village officer Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery lovers, two shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday 13th part 3), at the bottom of these killings. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the murders themselves and can thus distinguish itself from many of the 80's Slasher brothers. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a good body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious with the fact that the actress is 18 years old and so I don't mean to be distorted). To the detriment, the movie is hampered by a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a lattice theme that is used too often, and an end that is a bit anti-climate. But the good heavier than the bad (rare). Give it a rent, but I won't buy it. <br /> <br /> Eyecup: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bush and ass <br /> <br /> My Degree: C <br /> Code Red DVD Extra: an intro by star Aleisa Shirley and intruder director, Scott Spiegel; Both director's play and scene version of the film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; more gallery; theater trailer for this movie; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy
