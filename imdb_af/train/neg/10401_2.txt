Dearly beloved, dear, I ...! I have the power to see it through ... But why? <br /> <br /> The first two movies were fun and really good. But it's so bad, we had trouble seeing the whole thing. It was a kind of trembling for children. I can't believe this movie was not made at all. It looks like the props where it was taken from a bad western range of some kind (for kids) and they just did what they could. <br /> <br /> What is this movie for? I can only think of 12-14 year olds. If you are older than 14, you have serious issues with this movie. It is not only slow, but it is so boring. The characters are exaggerated (not just a bit) and so stereotyping it is fun for a while ... but not long enough not to get your tomatoes on the screen. You know everything that is going to happen, because yes ... you've seen it a billion times before in any heroic series on TV for kids. I chose all the survivors and all the tremors the second that introduced the characters. It's so bad. So wrong. So ... crap. <br /> <br /> But OK, we've got a laugh now and then. Not only at the crazy plot holes, but a few scenes worth repeating or two ... or one scene that is where two baby tricks fling themselves to one of the obvious tremor feeds guys. It's really a wonderful scene we've made. Repeat it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly. If I think about it, let me still grin. But this only happened once more. Unfortunately, the "badass" warrior was picked up and his part overestimated ... this and one comment. "They jump off the ground like a DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point we almost cried crying. But besides, nothing can ever top it up ... (?) .. so it's pretty much downhill from there. <br /> <br /> So tops here are demonic trout and overwork. If someone ever tells you, it's a good movie ... he's either a plant, a vegetable or someone who is very angry. This movie should be by far the worst of the tremor. I look forward to seeing Tremors 3, but this is a hit counter compared to this ... this ... * goosebumps * no. I'll stop it.
