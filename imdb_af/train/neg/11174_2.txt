Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tee Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth was wet. I dropped everything to watch this movie on Cable. For 30 minutes I had trouble staying awake. 60 minutes in and I hit the record button and fell asleep. Complete it the next morning. Don't worry. What a waste of a good role and an idea that has been an interesting story of a "Day in Life ..." can be your insomnia if you have it and see this movie. I guarantee you at least half an hour of uninterrupted sleep. Dialogue terrible. Continuity does not exist. Camera work could be done with a handy Super 8 and looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a total disaster.
