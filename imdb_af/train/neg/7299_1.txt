Sure, I saw bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that I actually got angry at the theater. I wanted my money back. I told the director that he had to repay my movie ticket, of course I didn't receive a refund (or even an answer), but that is the point that matters. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a -42. Why did the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stop beating? Why did they hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat instead of cracking the baby's skull? The plot was thin, the movie was full of striking clich√©s, and some parts made no sense.
