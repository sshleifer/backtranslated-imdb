When I searched for this movie, I actually found it when I played early on the Sundance Channel early in the morning. Why did I search endlessly for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris made during the last deviating years of the TV show, I have no idea. The movie is simply horrified. The written part is about a week it is. Of course, the highlight of the movie sees the real artists "too hot for TV" or for some reason disapproved. That part is still terrible, but champion bad who was nice in his own way. Now that I've seen what I've been looking for for so long, will I see it again in my lifetime? Nothing ever !! Do yourself a favor and just look at the much better "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or find old copies of the actual show. The girl acted where popsicles only look, is provocatively fun, but to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon, flashing the audience, probably made me sterile. In retrospect, I am so fortunate that it was a massive flop, because if it was a massive hit, there could have been a "The $ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie" and that my friends would surely have brought the Apocalypse. <Br /> <br /> My Grade: D
