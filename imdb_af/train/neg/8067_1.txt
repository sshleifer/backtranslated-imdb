First, let me say it should be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie is even exciting. Most of it is very confusing and if it progresses, you will end it !! Some people want a movie that they "think through" the whole thing, which I say ... "More power for you" !! I just want to be entertained. That brings me back to this stinker, entertaining, that's not. This movie is stupid and a total waste of time. Looks like most agree here too. Most of this didn't make sense, and by the time you think you have one scene that came out, another lame scene comes around and .... and I think you see where it's going. Avoid this one suck .... bad!
