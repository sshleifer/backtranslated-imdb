This movie started well, I felt I had a mature version of Seinfeld. Very quickly I began to question the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answers as to why they were doing what they did. All the plays were excellent, but only a few scenes had short moments where they were actually funny. Then Cortese was wonderful. I loved him in this role. His agent must show this movie to throw agents. Look at the first few scenes and then find something better, otherwise you will find yourself completely lost in this mess. I found it in a bin at a video store. It costs me two dollars and because of the awareness of this movie I feel it was a good price.
