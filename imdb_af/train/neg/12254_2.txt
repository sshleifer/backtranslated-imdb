Some can mock, but there is actually a real art with particularly bad movies. This is missing on all fronts. <br /> <br /> A lot of youngsters - women with breasts and constantly wet T-shirts, of course - go to the movie "blood surfing" and end with a 31 foot crocodile. <br /> <br /> Not only was the crocus obviously fake, but some of the props [look at the boat that hit the reef in particular] look like they come from thunderbirds! <br /> <br /> Not good, from start to finish. Don't see it!
