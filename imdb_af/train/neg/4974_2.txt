May the saints keep us, for this movie will not help. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has access must email Mel Gibson and tell us that we need a faithful Beowulf production. Something that has something in common with the epic poem that forms the basis of all modern Western literature. <br /> <br /> The recent (since 2000) versions of Beowulf make us wonder two things. First, why is there so much interest in the story. Secondly, why are all these movie makers wasting mountains of cash on this shit. <br /> <br /> The only reason it has two is that the version with Lambert in it (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed the 1. <br /> <br /> What's worse, some people will see it and get the wrong idea of ​​the poem. How can an industry where Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion to film so right can get it so wrong. I really mean, the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much. <br /> <br /> And please, horns on helmets? Save me. This is insulting. <br /> <br /> / hmm
