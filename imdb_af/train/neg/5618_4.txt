I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary has. Now I respect the man's opinion and belief. I myself am not in this state believer of the learned Christian doctrine. However, the anti-Christian propaganda is a little different. <br /> <br /> This movie has valid points, but they are very few and represent a very biased context. I do not recommend seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more than a chance than giving the director to Christian teachings. Instead of querying the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta at the Christian school that influenced his childhood. It also misrepresents Christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalist. There is no moderate intervention. <br /> <br /> The director uses Passion of Christ film screens without permission, interviews the head of his former school, and offers almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually found the principal to be the most apostate person and think his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed after the word were consulted or even before the interview said the purpose of the investigation. <br /> <br /> Having said that, there are definitely new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the issue of Christianity. But the way this whole thought is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and extremely biased.
