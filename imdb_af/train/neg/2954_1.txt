I watch lots of bad movies, LOTS !!!!!! It's really a hobby. Almost every Saturday night, a group of friends and I come together and see trash from around the world. ANYONE. Turkish superhero movies, Brazil vampire flashes, Italian gorilla transplant movies, Kevin Costner movies, ANY (except maybe Raising Helen), but I have never seen a WORST movie like Theodore Rex. Never. And it's not even entertainingly bad in an Ed Wood way - it just struggles. Now this movie was known in Hollywood when it was made because Whoopi pulled out the gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else who would listen that she hated this piece of shot = she tried to get out of her contract . clapped, she was moaning, yet they threw her thick buttocks in this leather-colored futuristic cop uniform that is terrible to see, yikes !!!! And you can only see how she is eating - do everything but watch camera for her agent so she can scream at him. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the writing is so terrible that a third class class can do a better job if the cookies are promised.
