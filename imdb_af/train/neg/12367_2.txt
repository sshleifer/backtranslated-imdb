Loony Tunes risked (at least) twice in the future. The first time was with the brilliant funny "Duck Dodgers". The latter time was with this ?? um ?? effort. "Loonatics Unleashed" is not without merit, and can be considered a good product if it is not the quality of Warner Brothers. WB cartoons are made known for their shaky humor, which makes at least as many adults and children attractive. These pedestrian superhero episodes, on the other hand, cannot convince the adults to surrender it. <br /> <br /> The premise of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals (2 bunnies, a Tasmanian devil, a duck, a duck roadrunner and coyote) live on the "city planet" of Acmetropolis and acquired superpowers when a meteor hit the planet in 2772. What is confusing is that the title section contains these individuals with a score of up to 2772 from the 21st century. Cute but loose stupid. <br /> <br /> In each episode, the super sextet ?? Amidst almost amusing, but essentially banal banter? Fight various super villains. For the most part, these are types found in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones. Like many mediocre superheroes, this one takes too much for the context. And of course these guys are the only characters to laugh about? The usual evil laughs, of course. Why is it that villains are always in predictable superhero adventures? ALWAYS ?? Don't laugh at every occasion? Animated material of this kind appears to be solely lauded in the province villains and (sometimes) their henchpeople and / or tribulations. <br /> <br /> In fact, the creators of this series missed their best bet from the get-go. The superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities, but sometimes not. The problem here is that we don't see enough WB pay. Lexi and Ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits that can be described as "bugs like". What we have here is basically the stupid and drunk "Teen Titans", including his excessive "modern" animation look, but with animals. FEh. <br /> <br /> The other mistake of the program's creators is (or is) the villains. As mentioned before, it's not terribly imaginative and does the evil-laugh a little over. Surprisingly, the writers missed the striking technique of making crooks out of stock WB characters as well as the protagonists. Adding to the fun could have been, says Jupiter Sam? as well as The Fudd, hunting still wabbits ?? as well as Tech E. Coyote turned into a very neurotic villain ?? and so on. Oh, the sadness of missed opportunities ??. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this whole production has gone too much overtime (it's a 2nd season). However, we are pleased that there is something new for the 14-to-9 crowd. The rest of us can hope for a 3rd season of Duck Dodgers.
