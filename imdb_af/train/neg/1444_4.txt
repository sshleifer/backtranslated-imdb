The movie is very long and unfortunately very different from the novel. If you want to see the movie, don't even read the novel because it will shock you. But cinematography was OK and if you are a person who loves adventure genres exploring Africa, then go. Acting performances are sufficient, but many important events present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his missing brother rather than a woman looking for her father. Gagol was clever and killed in the cave while showing that it is a good person who lives with the new king.
