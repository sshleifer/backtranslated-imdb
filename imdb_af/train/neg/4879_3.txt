Is there anything worse than a comedy film that doesn't have humor? The answer is Yes; one who fails to generate any interest in the picture. The point of departure is not too bad - a naive foreman for an illegal business - but it is a potty boiler with a poor script and script and does not work. <br /> <br /> Was it considered a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to think. The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast containing several well-known faces from the 30's and 40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong. I always reject Richard Cromwell as the weak man Gary Cooper murdered. in "Life of a Bengal Lancer", so I didn't count him). <br /> <br /> Can't recommend this one and give it a score of 3 - If you have a choice, get a root canal.
