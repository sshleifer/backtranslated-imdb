It could be the worst movie adaptation of a Broadway musical ever. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring fake. However, I will say it's funny to be funny. <br /> <br /> The hairstyles are remarkably dated. I can't understand for my life what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an outside of the theater where a Chorus Line is playing. Are we thinking that these people are auditioning for "A Chorus Line", which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning? Oh no, the show falls on itself. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production, and I listened to the album hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do that?
