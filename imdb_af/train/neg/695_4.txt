I heard so much about this movie that it was a good treasure trove and one of those early 80's movies that the hard fans of most slasherfilms die, just had to see. Well, I hired it and I have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the tensions for most slasher movies such as "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night" were, this movie could be right up there with the above alone, it did not have true enthusiasm and potential of the characters as well as the upcoming story. Characters I found were unfortunate to be in this movie, was the strange man with the curly hair that drove the dorm around and, of course, led his true climate role while facing the killer. Another would be the dirty, scary man with the jeans jacket. He could have played more roles in this movie, which made the movie more interesting. The movie played this man as just another loser who made unknown calls while he was sleeping. With his girlfriend and then his part down and cutting him down to the end that was a waste, I was finally disappointed. As for the true identity of the murderer, when the identity was released about who he was, I just laughed, but it was all obvious and he really made a real jerk from himself, as well as an annoying character revealed to his true intentions. This movie should be one for some time, but don't spend your hard earned money on it, in some rare to find collectors' inventory.
