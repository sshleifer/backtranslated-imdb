Please do not rent or even think about buying this movie. They don't even have the red box available to rent that would cost a $ 1. I think it's worth less than that. The main reason I rented this movie was because Jenna Jameson in the movie lol is between 2-5 minutes. I will give credit that the movie has hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity, but otherwise you can buy a horror movie that has the same thing as no one knows you. Ginger Lynn has more acting in this movie than Jenna and she is not even on the cover of the movie or her name. I recommend people to watch zombie strippers, because Jenna sees you almost the whole movie and naked most of the time. The movie is a big disappointment and such a big waste of time.
