In fact, these young people were so unpleasant that I couldn't wait for everyone to be slaughtered, and that included Clarissa (Joanna Canton) as I saw her the most annoying of the forest. <br /> <br /> But I knew it was going to be a mess of opening hours when a teenager Christine started relaxing on the priest and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing in the background. It didn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Even the prosthetics looked fake and the blood looked suspicious like Hawaiian Punch, but later it looked red day-apparently to fit the stupid Halloween makeup. were all wearing. I'm sure all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t as it will appeal to the bunch. It certainly didn't address me. Blah ... <br /> And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this dumb teen horror flick from himself. She still looks warm. I'm glad she cares for herself as we don't get too much of her too much. <br /> <br /> However, it's a step out of Dante Tomaselli's meandering HORROR (2002) because it's a somewhat coherent plot, so I'll give it so much. It and the little Boston terrier, called Boozer, also carve it in. I like what Boozer finally does to Clarissa. It was the only good scene in an otherwise silly movie. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate movies should have been desperate when picking up this one. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
