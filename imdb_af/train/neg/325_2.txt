After deciding to collect Billy Bob Thornton's films some time ago (under the influence of movie films such as "Sling Blade", a Simple Plan "and" The Man Who Wasn't There "), it was inevitable that There would be the strange turkey there, but what I didn't realize was that there might be one, I will give you an idea of ​​how incredibly poor this movie is - the funniest dialogue in it goes as follows: "Knock Knock "" Who is there? "" The big stinking man "," The big stinking man who? "" The big stinking man - YOU! "Yes, people, it's really that bad. Billy Bob is just there for about two minutes (I think he needed the job at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful, for some reason though it is undeniably terrible, I don't hate it. because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects loaded junk like "The Fast and the Furious" and not a "no-budget" flick like this one. a push.
