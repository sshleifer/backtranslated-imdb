Bridges or madison county is a better made version of this story. I felt that the end of this movie wasn't handled sensitively as in the original English movie. This movie is very indianised, if you are a very sensitive person who screams a movie when the hero finally dies, you will love this movie. On the other hand, if you're a fighter in life and think you're not crying like the end. But in general it's pretty good, the subject is well handled for Indian conditions. Tabu was good as a caring woman and mother. Everyone did well.
