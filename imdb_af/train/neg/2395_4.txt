Can it be by the same director as Do Not See Or Bad Time? Poor <br /> <br /> Acted, sounded edited. You just have to compare the various accident scenes here with similar in Do not Look Now to see how much Roeg lost his <br /> <br /> touch. <br /> <br /> Even the generally trusted Teresa Russell (look a little bit today, I'm afraid to report) can't save this one. The plot is pseudo-religious hokum, the acting is wood and Roeg's efforts to disrupt his trademark time are pitiful. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one like the plague.
