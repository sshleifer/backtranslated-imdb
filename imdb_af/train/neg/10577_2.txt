Some of the filmmakers participating in this series have made some very good movies, but they certainly don't have much skill with this series. Especially the writing. OK, the first season was a little better, but these new episodes just don't create stink. I am a big fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage. Nothing new or really interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just typical manufactured Hollywood crap, uninteresting, childish, weak pregnant and in some cases, flat laughter. Like Tales from the Crypt, the only good thing this series offers is a great nudity! Otherwise, this series is blown hard. Sometimes I get the impression that they've rented a bunch of eighth grades to write the episodes. Maybe they did.
