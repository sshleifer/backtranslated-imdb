I wonder how the actors acted in this movie. Annette Bening was really herself, half in and half out, was she faking or of course? It made no difference, since even though she was walking on the ceiling, it would not have changed the pattern of the film. Brian Cox did very well. I almost thought he'd always acted like that, troublesome, dishonest, in a dirty environment where nobody really cares about hygiene. What Gwyneth Paltrow is about is the question she did in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is rather sick and disgusting. Who will pay to see such a crap?
