I saw this movie as a total dissapointment. The talent available to the director - especially Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria, and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the four main leaders) - is completely wasted on an unknown, mediocre story, the conclusion not even real cares not introduced to dire, stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just annoying (appears to repeat her role from high faith, less humor). Crystal just plays his old old hyperactive, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and Cusack simply runs through his part, apparently bored with the whole project. <br /> <br /> For what is supposed to be a 'Romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, let alone chemistry and the comedy (possibly SPOILERS) Well, the only moments Light humor came from the background of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin, the author's writer, is of course unable to show any originality. (Spoilers) Azaria was pretty amusing like the Mexican lover and Walken made a strange turn as a parody of an arthouse maverick Dogma-type director - but these parts were very time-consuming and instead (Spoilers) we are treated with Billy Crystal with his groin sniffed by a dog. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a huge fan of the majority of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely lowered by a movie with great ideas and at the at the same time, totally unwilling to explore or expand on any of them, but rather to go to the same old genre advertising and even to the depths of almost a brutal, teenage movie humor. <br /> <br /> A very poor 4/10.
