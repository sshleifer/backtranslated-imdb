This movie was clearly poor and in a rush. I realize that financing for such a movie is hard to come by. But if the plot had any kind of original fabric, someone would have seen it get the necessary funding. This was not the case and movies like this are not essential and have no purpose in existing ones. The plot for this movie is better done and done, I could add many more. There is no reason to make a movie that has no chance of competing with anybody else. I was informed by my computer that I needed a minimum of ten lines to submit my comments so that the following rules are just a bull to fill in the space. In my opinion, there's nothing else to say about this movie. What I said is enough and if you waste enough time to read this review, don't waste time watching this movie. The only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes to watch crappy movies played on the women's entertainment network at 02:00. Then see what I care about.
