Dull haunted house man finds that an American family is moving into a 200-year-old home in Japan where a violent murder occurred suicide love triangle. <br /> <br /> New setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow-moving horrorflick by Motel Hell's director. The film generates zero tension and is composed of somewhat bumpy scenes that rarely seem to lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> An obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male head visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunting as the monk warned earlier. The monk tells the history of the house (of which the viewer is already familiar with the opening sequence) and then the film simply cuts something different. Earlier, the monk offered to help. Well, where's the help? The family is still in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is nearly made when he returns to do what he did an hour earlier - try to drive the spirits out the house, though by this time it is difficult to care for the viewers. <br /> <br /> There are a few (probably) unintentional camps to see that American actors are eventually occupied by Japanese spirits and suddenly start off with martial arts, I'm sure because the scene is more than " a small reminder of the chainsaw's duel of the same director's Motel Hell, which was, of course, meant to be amusing, but generally it is a forgotten dud.
