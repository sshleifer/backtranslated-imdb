A particularly malignant example of the Italian cult cinema with a stupid title to start (if any, the alternative THE MARKET OF SATAN is even less relevant to the plot!), This hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of erotica) a flat kind of atmosphere throughout? actually associated with the handling that is actually scary! Here we get the usual group of people (an acting troupe) stranded on an island (after which they were invited by a spade, since he was conquered from the front lady, a death toll for his missing spouse)! The characters are pretty much stereotyped: middle-aged but pounding hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history carries more than his share of the violent tragedy), heroic, messy companion (remember Mae West and the most annoying of the many! ), a gentle but dedicated stage manager (always cheating on his impatient behavior!), a few lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who once went into action, if you know what I mean), a jealous housekeeper (nominal star Femi Benussi, because it is worth it, it is really an ensemble piece), a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressive roommate, and so on. Although the movie does not mean unwavering, the horrible dubbing, snail speed, rogue production (with the screens that light the angry sea from some black and white movies!) And the fact that the killings only take place within the closing half hour , don't help. In addition, Marcello Giombini's score, although pleasant in itself, comes under the circumstances as relentlessly modern. That said, the revelation proves a surprisingly extended one (since there is certainly no shortage of suspects).
