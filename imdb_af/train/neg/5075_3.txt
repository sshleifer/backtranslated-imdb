The animation was good, the images were good, though not quite original, but the story was too long, too confusing and super-dramatic. After about an hour I couldn't wait to get it over. With so many characters having nothing to contribute and elements coming from nowhere or going nowhere, this movie is not one movie and it would have been better than a short series or possibly two movies. If you like this sort of typical story, you might like it, but frankly, I'm spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have a message to tell. Go hire a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, you will get much more from it.
