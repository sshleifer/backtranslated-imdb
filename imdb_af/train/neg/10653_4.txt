One two three four five six seven eight and back, haha. It's a must see, to see the work first. There are lots of work displays, see the close ups, man you will enjoy. A few years ago, a video clip was certainly based on this movie. It's a scooter but without tension. The end is also funny, and the clothes she wears in the wood that the buyer confronts look like a clown. The murders are mostly done off the screen, the blood flows, but never too stingy. There is also a lot of battle scene, and hey, nobody was hurt. And what about the weapon to kill, never saw a big one, won't spoil it, you should see it. And as a treasure there are also many T&A. To guess who the murderer is, will be trapped a few times and this is the best part, but what about the copper story in the woods, huh! But still his cheesiness, this one is still the one who really wants to. I'm glad I got my copy, one of the scoundrels' mistakes. But man, those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! If you are in your 40's, then one is back to memory lane.
