An Italian / American co-production with Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: how can any fan of trashy horror resist such a surprise? Well, based on the inevitable, extremely boring, and totally unpleasant first forty minutes or so, I would have said "very easily"; Luckily, however, things become a little more entertaining with the introduction of several ingenious death scenes, and for those who are happy to find a rough copy, also a neck color (unfortunately, my copy options have been edited to remove such offensive material.) . <br /> <br /> The Hoff stars as Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girl Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a run-off hotel on a seemingly deserted island to take photos for her latest project, " a book on witches; While frustrated, Gary also hopes to cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity. <br /> <br /> However, his plans for nookie are due to the unexpected arrival of property developers, Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son Tommy (Michael Manchester), the beautiful nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who came to the island's hotel. <br /> <br /> Having explained their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners. And when a violent storm suddenly picks up, it makes it dangerous to return to the continent, all agreeing to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, the place is also not known to the new guests of the hotel, but also the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef) who needs human sacrifices to bring herself back. One by one, victims are drawn into a swirling red whirlpool (guaranteed to give unintentional laughter) before meeting a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> None of that makes much sense, and the acting is horrific (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff is one of the better artists talking volumes over the other), but the viewers who making it past the brave first half, is rewarded with some nice, decent moments of gore: Rose cut her lips together before being roasted in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by hags and placed on a swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins are pulsating and breaking out in blood vessels; and Gary is stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possession again.
