It has a plot! ;) I saw movies with less plot (I don't want to call Asian movies, but ...). I thought the camera wasn't bad for a cheap movie like this, and the atmosphere wasn't bad either. There is no real reason for most things people do and the way they respond to what happens. Although I think about many movies, it was, of course, terrifying. <br /> <br /> It broke a few movies, just bad for single scenes. The acting was bad, but I saw worse. The movie was bad but I got worse. To see this movie is an experience between boredom, fun, death desire, sadism, horn and low level entertainment. <br /> <br /> So if you like gholfflieks with stupid sites, this is the one movie for you. . <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10 because it can be entertained if you don't expect to see a good movie and you're in the right mood.
