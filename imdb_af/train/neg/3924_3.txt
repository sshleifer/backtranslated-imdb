Actually terrible, pretentious, endless movie. Director Bellocchio seems to be flattered with the pretty face and figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he should have focused his attention even more on making a good, interesting movie. I hate to see it as a sex movie as an art film, just to become more "respectful". The regular, sometimes hot sex scenes are the only reason for the film's existence. Whether they are worth putting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste. (*)
