I was excited to watch this movie, which expects it to be the successor of the cult classic "Private Lessons" depicting the dream of any male teenager. <br /> <br /> "Private Lessons II" has nothing to do with the title I call it. It's just a regular soft core Cinemax movie that won't make a change in your life. There is only one hot sex scene in a roof, but that's it. I've been watching it for a long time, but believe me, it's just a regular boring soft core spot. <br /> <br /> The women are hot, but it's not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is only to watch it fly on the cable.
