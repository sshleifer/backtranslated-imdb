'P' (or Club-P) really should be called 'L' for lame. Every festival has a disappointment and it is the one who fails to live on his many-loaded logline: "Thai lesbians fight monsters." It is rather the story of a Khmer country girl, whose grandmother taught her a little witchcraft, along with some strange (but specific) rules: "Don't go under a clothes line," don't eat raw meat not "and" do not accept money for your powers. "Well, guess what people, the girl moves to Bangkok to raise money as a" bar-girl "and control all the rules grandma taught her what her learned that later releases an evil spirit that makes the strange johns pay for her services. <br /> <br /> While this movie cannot even be released in Thailand, it is the most controversial topic that most American This ho-hum horror pic is a cross between "Showgirls" and "Interview with the Vampire" as indicated by Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> If not for some scenes with significant amounts blood, the MPAA can probably only determine it for pre-teens, literally TV adult is broadcast, although you She would expect a sex scene, as the movie is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a real Thai porn star. <br /> <br /> As far as the lesbian angle is concerned, there is one short smooch and some "I love you" to prove that the two main stars are actually a few (on brother). And the P-bar must be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs and do carnival stunts (there is a swordsman who cuts cucumbers from the mouth of a girl ... ooh, phallic images). <br /> No nakedness, NO real monster (unless you count a five foot tall Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no way to ever pay any adult to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD . You have been warned!
