I think when Hitchcock scholars and experts come together, the talk is not of the Master's great films such as 'North By Northwest' or 'Strangers On A Train', but a lesser-known attempt like that of 1931, unclear and serious flawed, showing the great director in flaming form. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are a middle-class London pair shrink to stay ahead. He deceives their fate; she accepts it. Change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle who says he will set them up so that they can enjoy a life of luxury globetrotting. They make plans for a world voyage. But their problems only started. <br /> <br /> Just ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill, or Marion Crane. Well, Marion's unconscious right now, but you get the idea. Travel and Hitchcock gather as moths and candles, and set them up for a dangerous journey. This is perhaps Hitchcock's earliest decay in this theme, and not his most successful or memorable one. Hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element, in this case domestic drama rather than stress, but the two are not together, at least not here. <br /> <br /> The Hills is a dull, flat couple without chemistry. or personality. When they find themselves at the Folies Berg√®re, in the form of cross-cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of the film, they are killed on the outfits of the female artists. "The curtain went up too soon!" gasp Emily. "They are not dressed." <br /> <br /> When the hills are driven away on an oceanic voyage, it looks like a grace that kills more than a tragic thing, even though the people they work with are dropping, too. Emily's husband, Gordon (Percy Marmont), carries photos of himself beside empty chairs, which he pretends to be filled by Emily. Fred's girl "The Princess" (Betty Amann) has Clara Bow's eyes and Wallace Beery's five-hour shadow. There is also an offensive fellow passenger, a dull spider, who always introduces Hitchcock with a cartoon-like horn cake. Subtle was still to come. <br /> <br /> Everything is shot in a sudden way, with confusing blocking and tense dialogue. Hitchcock tries for an early comedy with Fred and his non-emerging umbrella, and Kendall seems to be pursuing while Berry plays for tears. When Fred and Emily break down, they are seen on a couple of rickshaws, one of many attempts to be symbolic. <br /> <br /> Emily is the only vaguely sympathetic character, partly because she really cares about her husband and agonizes about her relationship with Gordon, but mostly because she is the first of Hitchcock's many magnetic blondes, her platinum rings that as a Botticelli is hit on the open deck of a Chinese rubble, near the film's conclusion. <br /> <br /> Matters finish off with a dangerous situation as protagonist object to work manually and presumably repair their relationship. Only they are not actively participating in the resolution, and besides the fate of a friendly cat, there is nothing about the end. <br /> <br /> At least in the early 1930s you get a pleasant view of London. a chance to see Hitchcock when he was still on food. "Rich and Strange" is Hitchcock and pays his costs and teaches his trade, one for scholars, but not accidental filmmakers.
