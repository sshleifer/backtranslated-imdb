You know a movie won't go well if John Carradine (about the script and plot synopsis) reads about his character's funeral, just 5 minutes in the movie. The narrative is his character's last will. This states that his estate is divided among his 4 children and servants. The children will split $ 136 million equally, but if someone dies, the share is divided between the remainders. If all the children die, then it is divided among the servants. To be eligible, they must stay in the family estate for a week. It sounds like the typical plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There is little subtext about the nature of the Deans. They are a powerful and highly dysfunctional family, but the real trouble begins with the drowning of that dog. From John Carradine's opening stamp, you expect this movie to lead to a Machiavellian cat and mouse game with a spinning end. <br /> <br /> The journey is painfully slow and useless. We trust through minutes to see people sitting, playing pool, throwing arrows, abusing the "by the fisherman" shot, dramatic conversations between men picking crawlers, constant tinkering, wrong circus music, bizarre flashbacks that think of faux -German expressionism, the horror aesthetic of the 4th grade and lots of dramatic over-processing. This inevitably leads to the expected and unapproachable end. You will be happy to be alive, but the pain can be too big to wear alone. Share kids, share. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
