This movie looks like it's going to be really funny. I was very excited to see it, but was very disappointed. It was very unrealistic. The plot was also pretty poor. I was expecting it was really funny, but the jokes weren't even that good. I was also very disappointed at the end. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
