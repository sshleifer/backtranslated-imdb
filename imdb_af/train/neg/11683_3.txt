Three story lines and not enough to tie them together, "Inside Man" was a great leap and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Although she has moments, the movie began to look like a fast-paced, fast-paced excitement, quickly jumped between highs and lows and barely picking up steam for the last 20 minutes. I'll give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his part very well with a full understanding of his human side and not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen also shares well with his duality as "evil genius" and "criminal master brain" (both not the same in retrospect). Overall, however, each person created a wonderful subsection. Yet, when the parts finally came together and counted everything, there wasn't suddenly ah-ha! Not. or sum of everything. It all ended up with very little of the energy it started, with lots of plots, tons of questions, and as I said earlier, not near Spike Lee's normal level. I have to disagree completely with the so-called "professional critics" ... it's not the movie they play it.
