After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb. <br /> <br /> 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox 'is an adaptation of a beloved children's classic, which tells the story of the smooth, smooth protagonist. Fox (or 'Foxy') as he tries to steal a 'last' lift from the dreaded Boggins, Bunce and Bean. It's right, one short, one fat, one lean or how it goes. <br /> <br /> I don't quite know where to start my criticism. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm in my late teens and never been a fan of Roald Dahl, but I love his stuff well enough. He read some of his books as a child and saw Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over and over. However, this movie is struggling for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I'm still unsure! Many of the "jokes" will bear a child, especially if Mr. For example, Fox visits a lawyer or complains about being poor. An audience of (I suppose) children is also expected to sympathize with a character who steals and kills chicks. I'm all for the food chain, but you almost see Mr. Fox biting on their necks! Surely it's a little bit? And, too, the plot ... well, it's so boring. I just stayed with the hope that it got better, but instead I just got more and more irritated by Mr. Fox and his son Ash make stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the humor falls flat. I only laughed once or twice, although I specifically recognized jokes. I think part of it is that the tuner is so incredibly flat and monotonous. The voice actors have no sense of comic timing, but seek the subtle of humor that only works with certain mediums. George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and slim, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep does not show any emotion, I did not even realize that Bill Murray played a role in the end, and Ash, twelve years old, sounds as if he is about 30. <br /> <br /> I love animation, especially stop motion, but the visual style actually crept me a bit. Characters are long, spidery and lack any warmth of design. They move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange. There is also a distinctive 'mixed medium' feel, as 2D components are added sporadically and unsuccessfully. Characters look straight at the camera and speak; it was very uncomfortable. There were one or two moments when Kylie looked straight at the camera, didn't move and strangled on his eyeballs. It really provoked me. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Many people still look like that - look at the reviews. Maybe it just wasn't for me.
