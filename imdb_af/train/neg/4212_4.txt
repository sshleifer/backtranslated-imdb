The start of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and good humor, but once the movie turns into animation, it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons for this, at least for me, was that the colors in many of the animations were too dim, with too little contrast. It doesn't look good, at least on VHS. Once it breaks out and looks good, but not often. Also, the characters come too fast. For example, I'd like to see more of "Moby Dick". When the film starts to drag, it pulls back at the entrance of the dragon and then the film ends strongly. <br /> <br /> Overall, just not memorable enough or able to compete with the big animation movies of the past decade.
