What a crappy movie! Worst of the worst! This movie is as entertaining as a dead snail. Non-talent-as-always-actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script? Was there ever a screenplay for this goofy movie or did the director accidentally hit the record button on his camera and then decide to make the movie while they went along? Is it meant to be a children's movie or a comedy or what? My friends' younger brother is in the 6th grade and he and his classmates just did an amateur movie for their school project that left this geeky movie. It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! There is no excuse for this movie!
