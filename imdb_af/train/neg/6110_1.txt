Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist father (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very conflicting career) studies in Africa, something else. She traces him down (how?) And he tells her about the natives' stories of a giant monster whose night shelter can be heard in the jungle. It seems as if the Monkey Man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best dialogue of the movie), saves her from bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them just enough time in this grueling two hours to get naked scratch while a horny monkey looks and screams. Normally I am very open to different opinions on any movie, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you disagree, you didn't see it. (Notes: Newsday calls it "unusable", which is the best one-word summary I can think of. The Maltin Movie Guide says they should almost consider a rating of BOMB.)
