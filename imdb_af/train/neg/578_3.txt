It's not a good movie. The acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing. The movie doesn't look as though it's a real horror approach or going to the camp and kitsch route. I never saw the first movie, but this one does not stand on its own merit, there are several unconvincing plots and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the main female vampire. Not worth the look
