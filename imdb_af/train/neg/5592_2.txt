It's hard to describe this movie and one wants to try hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you feel it may be the perfect movie for a 12-year-old girl. <br /> <br /> This film has a nice concept - the modern version of Sleep Beauty with a twist. It has some dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy's relationship with his single-acting mom and schoolmate. A good start you can say, but then it has become a little greedy, very greedy, it tries to be a science. fiction, a drama, a thriller, a possible romantic love story, fairy tale, a comedy and everything under the sun. The result just left the audience feeling insufficient. For example, the scene when the girl (played by Risa Goto) finally woke up by being (Yuki Kohara) kiss, instead of being romantic, trying to be terrifying to let us laugh later ... it's a cheap trick because it ruins all the anticipation and emotion it is trying to build for the better half of the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't read the original story based on the movie (it is the well-known work by comic book artist Osamu Tezuka familiar with his intriguing and intricate stories). I wonder if all the problems exist in the original story or did it happen in the adaptation? It is rather illogical even for someone who is accustomed to the "difficult logic" of the Japanese comic book. For example, how did Yuki Kohara's character soon go to hospital (when it is supposed to be a long bus ride) to get Risa Goto's character ahead of the television cameras, after interviewing her The television? <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are copied directly from other movies (very unconsciously!) and they all seem meaningless. <br /> <br /> The famous "The Lion mouth is my hand" scene of the "Roman holiday" <br /> <br /> The movie is trying to be everything but ends nothing ... it's not " a fairy tale and it's a fairy tale. didn't have enough jokes to be a comedy ... and strangely there are screens that even look like an unintentional 'ghost' movie. Yet it must be acknowledged that it has succeeded in some of the Japanese teen's sentiment. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I have the feeling that there may be movies that should come with a warning label that said: "This movie may only be suitable for a person under the age 18 ", it would definitely be on the poster of this movie. <br /> <br />
