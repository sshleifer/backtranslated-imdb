It's by far the WORST movie I've ever watched. I saw some nice movies in my time, but those take the cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn bakery. It is so bad that I believe in describing a word about how you will feel after looking at these atrocities. Please do yourself a favor, if you ever get the urge to see it and see thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur Barney, then increase thirty times and you'll only get a small fraction of the horror you will be in the store. for. In short, I think you can really call it a horror movie, but only if you are willing to be flawlessly scared of the worst in the business and totally useless story. <br /> <br /> Real Rating, -10 disgusting
