I have the 'bones' to tell you to stay away from `Dahmer', the biographical film based on the real story of the grotesque serial killer. `Dahmer 'is more in line with the mindset of his focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed more than 15 young men and ate their body parts, was probably the most uncomfortable series killer of our generation. The actual sick individuals, however, are the filmmakers of this horrific spectacle who had to investigate their heads before attempting to laze this terrible "dahm" project. It's not an easy movie to digest, although Jeffrey can easily digest it with some fiery 'Brainsadillas' appetizers or even real life. Potato skins'. * Failure
