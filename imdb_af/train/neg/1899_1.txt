I watched it because I thought there would be lots of car hunts and cool cars to risk. Guess I'm lied to. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) who sits outside a Porsche dealer to see if they have the right car. When they confirm it is the right one, chick a brick out of the trunk and bump it into the window and crush it. He gets the Porsche while his friend gets the keys. They start the car and go off at night. They only deliver it to a warehouse to be followed by the police. So, the whole crew closed all the cars and went their separate ways. Then we get a glimpse of Memphis Raines. He gives a small speech to a lot of kids on a go-kart track. Then he is confronted by Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is "deeply" bleached *. Memphis is known as one of the most notorious motorcycles in Los Angeles. Memphis heads to a junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This man threatens to kill Kip if Memphis doesn't deliver 50 cars within 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are some issues with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: The first 48 In-film hours take place when Cage and Duvall are looking for a crew and everything plan. The last 12 in-movie hours are a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You may see 10 cars out of 50 as the film advertises. So, where are the other 40 cars? Why don't we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. The Chase: The chase at the end of the movie was a joke. It wasn't stress at all. <br /> <br /> 4. The dog: In the movie the dog eats the burgers and also swallows three keys. This is impossible. The keys were opened. The keys would seriously damage the dog's esophagus, stomach and colon. The guys suggest that the dog give laxatives to help him throw it out. It won't work. The dog will get a lot of diarrhea, but no keys. It was said in Jackass after Ryan Dunne held a toy cart on his rectum. Take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but no car. Same with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. The Cop During the Chase: When Eleanor breaks for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage tries desperately to start the car. You see a police cruiser behind him who doesn't look at his car at all. But only when Nicholas Cage restarts the engine, the police officer sticks his head to the right, sees the car, and immediately starts driving behind him. This is stupid. So, when he started to hear the engine and see the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How does he know it's the right car? He just saw the back of it. <br /> Overall, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid. I've never seen the original, but I'm planning to do it. <br /> <br /> I star this movie 1 out of 10. Get the Fast and Furious instead.
