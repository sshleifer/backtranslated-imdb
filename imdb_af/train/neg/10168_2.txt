Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it's made. The whole plot is about someone trying to sabotage the super bowl, and all the attempts to stop them. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills's careers managed to survive are beyond me. The most frustrating thing about it, however, was that there was no football in it! Avoid this one if possible.
