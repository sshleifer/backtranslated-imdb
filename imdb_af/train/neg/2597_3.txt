Drew Barrymore is an actress who has gone through bad times, not only in her career but also in her personal life. After being a great-child actress, she became obscure with low-quality mediocre movies. While recovering from the dark past, this movie remains reminiscent of Drew Barrymore's worst days. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with an interesting performance, reminiscent of Brian De Palma's "Raising Cain"; with a plot dealing with various personality disorder that sets the story for a horror / thriller. Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding, a young woman trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic past of her past, probably killed her other personality her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly her past turned back to haunt her as her evil personality was willing in her life to destroy her new found peace and her new found love. In the midst of the chaos, his new boyfriend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly meet the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> Unlike De Palma's underrated thriller, Doppelganger is for the most part a mediocre film that not only reaches its goal, it also shuts down in one of the worst endings of film history. While Barrymore is definitely not the best, she manages to maintain her dignity with an above average performance. However, the rest of the role-play ranges from mediocre to painfully bad achievements, although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them. <br /> <br /> The writing is full of claws and De Palma's influence is very obvious. While the film was originally made by literary references in almost every line, the dialogues are dull and the woodworkers certainly do nothing. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons and excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> The makeup effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really one of the few good things in the movie. However, the bizarre overuse of the effects in the completely out of context decreases the impact of KNB's work and makes cheesy that would be wonderful in another movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that it's a B -Movie is no excuse for its low quality, as with a better and more cohesive writing it could have been an interesting movie. Unfortunately, everything we have here is a mediocre movie that gets worse every second. Worthy of Barrymore's beauty. 10/03
