A friend told John Fante last Saturday that we were talking about Charles Bukowski. I didn't know that Fante was a favorite author of Bukowski's - a writer with similar fringe and humor except one generation earlier. 'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightening young writer posing for himself and the outside world as an over-skilled, masterfully talented writer who has no idea how to write about the real world experiences he didn't have. In the novel, the protagonist is a virgin, no idea how to win the favor of the women in which he desires to write in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he decides for his first sexual experience with a "wounded" admirer and how he eventually survived with nothing, but the story of his failed attempts at love, is biting and really, without to hit Hollywood. end. The film adaptation remains for some time for the book, but leads to the film of love that persists in racism, illness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a while and Camilla is crazy, and their love was never and never the right thing, no matter how many of them wanted to find it. This movie wiped out the real meaning of the story and replaced it with shock. I can't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about what it did wrong.
