This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I have seen. It is uncertain whether the author of the script has ever read the book by Bronte. George C Scott is ridiculous and bumbling as Rochester - when it's not just ordinary old acting angry. Susannah York has the most dated 1970s hairstyle I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters barely speak to each other, so the rich scoundrel has enjoyed the book that forms the basis of their deep intellectual and lasting love. The end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please keep the Timothy Dalton version instead. It's so true for the book, it's like reading the novel aloud to you. Dalton is wonderful like Rochester. G. C. Scott is laughing.
