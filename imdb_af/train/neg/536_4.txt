The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts on her past. The flashbacks are about a weekend where young Ann is in the marriage of her friend Lila. At the wedding she meets Harris who will influence her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life, she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older, more responsible, a mother of two and has things together. Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and works to work and is unsure of her direction in life. <br /> <br /> First of all, the good. The period detail in the movie is great. The dresses, hair, cars, homes, etc. Really put you in a different time and place. And there's a lot of quality in the movie. Vanessa Redgrave is pretty good at portraying the main character and her fragile state of mind, as her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a good job as the main character when she was young (and she is an excellent singer). Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to the character of Lila's brother Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad, unfortunately everything is. Things are constantly disrupting the story because it unfolds for us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is wonderful. They have fun and dance. Then you have to believe that she no longer likes him as a girlfriend and that she just irritates her. And I thought the whole, "he might be gay," had nothing of the blue and didn't serve a purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The character treads wood and creepy. If it was another genre, you would have been Harris as the serial killer. It's an incredible stretch to think that all these girls loved him so much (but they put out the other guys as a beautiful lady to help him). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem of all. Why don't Ann and Harris get together? They fall apart. They have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener's hut, come home to find out about Buddy's tragic end and then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> A couple of years later, they meet all the foggy eyes and I can't help but wonder why. WHY? The movie doesn't let you know why they were forced to marry other people, and I had a hard time feeling sorry for them. <br /> <br /> The part of the story in the present is pretty boring. The cliché good daughter and the cliché bad daughter. Nina changes in the course of the movie, but I don't know why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a "touch" scene where the girls are connected to coincide with old Ann who dreams she's chasing a butterfly. It's really lame and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There are no mistakes," Ann told us. The statement is not true with the story. And it doesn't really matter to the movie and wish they didn't waste the talent of such good actors.
