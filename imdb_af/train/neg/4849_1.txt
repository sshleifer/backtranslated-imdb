I just rented it today .... previously heard very good reviews. WOW !! What a lot of steaming poo this movie is !! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back? Eventually someone stopped "Stop-loss" from the Worst Iraq War Movie Ever. Number one place. To be honest, I don't think there are any war movies in Iraq anyway, but it was VERY bad. <br /> <br /> I won't be in any technical inaccuracies, there are hundreds of reviews from other GWOT veterinarians who describe them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowest E-niche on technical accuracy, they could have made the movie somewhat realistic .... maybe. I think the author should get the "credit" for wasting a movie. Of course, he or she broadcast the plot for this movie from a lively imagination that was not harmed by the limitations of reality. Does anyone except me know the point of this movie? Was there a message? Seriously though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised at all the positive reviews really. This movie is hard to see as a veterinarian because of all the shiny inaccuracies, but even if one can think it over, the plot sucks, characters are level (least) and the play is poor at best. This is ironic, I think, this movie is supposed to be about the explosion of the ordinance, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
