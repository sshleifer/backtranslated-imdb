The murders in this movie aren't that bad, but the movie is definitely sure. It's even worse than that. It is not even worth wearing if you move it in your DVD player. <br /> <br /> Not even wearing it on your shoulders carries it out of the DVD store, not to mention the money. and time you spend renting and watching it. Terrible. <br /> <br /> It is over to understand how anyone can say something positive about this movie. It was just a mere masochistic tendency of me that caused me not to stop watching, adding the group's pressure to my peers. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is terrible, the direction is even worse and the acting is plain despicable. <br /> <br /> I hope you don't see it as a treat for your fun, I'd rather see it as a fair warning: Don't waste your time watching this garbage!
