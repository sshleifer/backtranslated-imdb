I can't say I'm all in the misty Mundae movie that has only seen a handful, but it is clear that it was made on a screen and while it would be possible for the filmmakers to make a Tomb Raider -rip could make In a garage, this is not because it is quite clear that this is what they are doing. The movie only runs for forty-five minutes, and it's definitely a good thing, because there's not enough plot to stretch it any longer. It has something to do with an evil Nazi scientist (who looks so angry as a pornstar who a Nazi scientist can ever play), a mummy, who is clearly a man wrapped in toilet roll and Misty - this movie's version of Tomb Raider, which keeps her much less time than Angelina Jolie did in the big budget version. I must say that even these signs could have been better despite its shortcomings. It has Misty Mundae for a start, and even better than that, if you ask me, it's the even hotter Darian Caine star. The few get involved in all the lesbian sex you would expect from a Seduction Cinema movie and this is at the expense of the non-existent plot, although it's not really a bad thing. Obviously, this is a rubbish film, but the fact that it is short is to his credit, and if you are a bit of lesbian sex, you can be worse.
