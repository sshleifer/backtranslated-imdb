You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. It's one of the most sensible movies ever made. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, but there is nothing funny in this movie. Even the film industry acknowledges it was a very poor movie and didn't even try to promote it. It's a wonder it has ever been put on video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of contract Sellers made in this movie. I also wonder why the people responsible for this movie are allowed to make other bad movies. This movie is definitely a waste of money used to create it, and a waste of anyone's time to see it. Certainly there are high school students who can write / produce a film.
