There is a wonderful moment in * Survival Christmas * that makes almost worthwhile: James Gandolfini cracks a spade over Ben Affleck's dumb head. <br /> <br /> This movie is another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini who proves to be a great actor, while he is busy busy playing his career in this movie. <br /> <br /> Young and rich advertisers, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck), have been dedicated to believing that one should never be alone on Christmas. (And from the beginning there is the underlying problem with our suspension of unbelief in this idiotic movie: how many people of Drew's social status, in 2004, somehow care about or spend Christmas alone or with half the family or with a fifty dollar lawyer?) Drew finds the purchase of a family to spend Christmas on the condition that they pretend to be their own, without ignoring all the indications of the opposite that she applies bought the emotions he was looking for. <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000, a fleeting suburban truck driver, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini), and his unhappy wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), join in to be Drew's ad hoc family, against protest from their son, Brian (a very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter, Alicia (a very soft-focused Christina Applegate). Drew then spends the rest of the movie presumably recovering his youth or something. The messages in this movie are so twisted and illogical as his dry mouth story. He had a fake smile on his face and remained blindly in denial of any deviation he was supposed to buy the Valco family. <br /> <br /> What does the question ask: If Drew pays people to regain a glimpse of joyful family emotions, how psychotic should he be to represent happiness under their hair and spiritual anxiety about his presence? It's not a case of the Valco family who hide their true feelings and pretend to be happy as they go around Drew. Three of the four members made it clear that they despised him. Is he so aware that he can't see that his money doesn't buy him the "family" atmosphere he was in the first place was a truth? As with all movies, it is uncomfortable, but wondering how * four * writers can become so entangled in their own narcissistic dreams to propose in a credit sequence that they will reflect on probability or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, who was responsible for * Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo * - stops right there. "Nuff said. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow succeed in shining and proving their ease under this mess. Christina Applegate is willowy and cutesy and blond and fiery on all rights places, Drew Drew in small strips of carcass for most of the movie, and then a face and fall in love with him because the script tells her. <br /> And I won't go that far to say that Affleck a bad actor, but John Schneider looks better over his shoulder, there is a whole new level of Desperately Seeking Talent in town.
