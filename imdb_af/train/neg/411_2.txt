I don't usually feel much of an incentive to comment on movies I don't like, but in a case like this I just have to say something. This movie is horrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many errors in the story telling that I don't even feel compelled to expand, because it's time for me to continue this experience. The most annoying point, however, is that no-one at any point in the film explains whether the motivation for Bacon's character is mad because of a power ride or physiological response to his condition. <br /> <br /> The special effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven did good things (the director's track of Robocop on DVD is wonderful). However, this movie is stupid and usually does not come close to the point or technical aspect of the subject, but rather establishes predictable action without any pleasure. <br /> <br /> In short, so many other reviews here say (wish I read them before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
