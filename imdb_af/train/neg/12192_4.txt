I think we all start with many reviews, "It could have made a BIG movie." A demented ex-con fresh jump, a neat suburban family its target. Revenge, retribution, manipulation. Marty's usual imposition of the carousel. But unfortunately, a memorandum came down in Universal's turn: everyone made it up. <br /> <br /> Nolte only speaks with raised eyebrows, Long bitches go through cigarettes, Lewis "Ohmagod's!" her way all her plays, and Bobby D ... well, he is on a whole different wizard. Due to a kind of Cajun / Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid, he bumps thick cigars and jars at random atrocities such as "Problem Child". And I want you to suggest the above accent. Imagine spitting the divine religious rhetoric on top volume as he swallowed six Bibles, and you have De Niro's schtick here. Most of all, however, is his most conceived use of the "De Niro face" for which he was so planned. Eyes clipped, forehead wrinkled, lips curled. Crimany, Bob, you looked like Plastiekman. <br /> <br /> The story apparently started screening 14 years earlier when Nolte could not save the De Niro time in the bighouse for various attacks. After his release, he felt Nolte's failure of him and he guaranteed the terrorism of his and his family. And we must pass De Niro's character a bit because Nolte withholds information that has shortened his sentence. De Niro is one of those criminals who, despite being convicted of unspeakable acts, feel his lack of freedom justified in pursuing such acts on the outside. Mmm-kay. <br /> <br /> He goes to Notle's after-lover (in a scene some of whom will want to turn away from), his wife, his daughter, the family dog, you know. What is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick's script: complete predictability. Since each of De Niro's harassment becomes more horrific, you can call the rest of the action pretty much before it happens. Strick cannot be completely discredited, as he manages a few compelling dialogue-driven moments (De Niro and Lewis's seedy swap in an empty theater is the best scene of the movie), but most of it is overrun. Scorsese's cartoon-based photographic approach is forced to speak, not to mention the surprisingly outdated Bernard Hermann score (which I am still waiting for the Wolfman to see with a genetically-enhanced tarantula). <br /> <br /> So we come to the comic section of the movie. Inadvertently comic, that is. You know the scenes where something graphically horrible happens, but you can't help but get out of others' eyes. You will do it here. Nolte and Long squawking about infidelity, De Niro's thumb flirting, cross decoration, and a kitchen slip on a certain fabric to be seen to believe. And Bob's impressive, unceasing, CASH, mental damage, no end, in the eyes of the "philosophy" he left in prison. I wanted him to be murdered to lock him more than to save this annoying family. <br /> <br /> I always hate thoughts from other reviewers, but here it is needed. It's really * * Scorsese's version of Freddy Krueger. The way De Niro reflects, speaks, stems, resists pain, to his one-liners, is vintage Freddy. If you are thrown through a pot of water: "You try to offer 'sumpin' hot? Please. And this is just one example. <br /> <br /> Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 movie and want a thrill of Balsam, Peck and Mitchum almost 30 years later (or want a serious head-shock movie experience), avoid ' a trip to the Cape.
