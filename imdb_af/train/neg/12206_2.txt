I don't see much reason to get much detail in this movie. Sylvester Stallone is again John Rambo, a writer and survivor of the season in hell, recruited from prison by his only friend, Mr. Richard Crenna, secretly returning to Vietnam, taking pictures of US prisoners presumably still in terrible hands. camps, and return without involving the enemy. <br /> <br /> Know chance. What if he did nothing more than sneak in, take photos and sneak out? Who will come to see the movie? <br /> <br /> It's essentially a celebration of Stallone's muscles. Preparing for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bend. (They are oiled and crosswise.) There is the ritual band of black leather, ugly rifles, and even lighter knives. The black rifles are cleaned, clamped hard, and almost as oiled as Stallone's muscles. The bow is tested and yes, it has enough pounds to run a bolt through an enemy's forehead. The knife is sharpened with slippery cuts. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of Washington's suits, cynical politicians you can never bet on were never fought. grammar school. No guts, you know? Just sit with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The movie does what it does, but what it will do is meretric. In the mid-1980s it was deliberately used. There were countless numbers of MIAs who kept the North Vietnam silently in silence. The bumper stickers were omnipresent. (Free our MIAs.) Why would they like them? It's never been argued, but possible to change the POWs into a slave labor force - in a country that has absolutely no resources other than labor. Or perhaps for their propaganda value as a tool to humiliate the United States - a propaganda weapon kept secret by the Vietnamese of the world. <br /> <br /> As a prisoner, Rambo is treated in the Middle Ages. Vietnamese. Thick in his neck in swine rash and then exhausted by his wrists, his muscles still in front. Then, not satisfied with the human Vietnamese, a Russian officer was brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer - "Wipe haff vays from what you remember." A high-tech type, the Russians use psychology and electricity, not just pig dump. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and states that he intends to drive aimlessly until "this country loves us as we like it." found another myth that Vets who came back from Vietnam were cursed and cursed in a uniform manner. That is why I think we have chosen so much for Congress and others for high-echelon positions. The last three lost presidential candidates were under this despised group. At least Rambo's aimless, drifting left room opens to a successor, who quickly arrived. <br /> <br /> The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were soured by wisecracks, but Rambo is humorous. It marches dolly through its phantasmic ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely speaking. Talking is a sign of weakness.
