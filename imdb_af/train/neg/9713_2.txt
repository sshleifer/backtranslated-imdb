The first time I looked, Cold Case was after running for about a year on Danish television. By the time it got to the TV, it dived almost into 4 or 5 other American crime shows at the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I was bored. The substandard actors with the self-righteous faces and morals were a pain in the back. The whole assumption that so much money is given to a team of investigators to solve murders dating from 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely. <br /> <br /> The time is also a factor, as they have only 50 -60 min to tell the story, which means they break a little to resolve the issue and give justice to surviving relatives, if they are still alive. This, combined with the "personal" problems and relationships of investigators who need time to leave, shows the whole lot. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2 star rating due to the music I have the end. which is actually the only reason to watch it .... of course you will not do it because it is also a reason to look at this shit.
