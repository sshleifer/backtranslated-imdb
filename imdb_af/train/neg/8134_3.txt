A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go out to the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. He looks a strange sound, and she is disturbed by the face of a bat crawling over their picnic blanket. He wants to go on a cave, which has something to do with a job he does, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She remembers. They went on the tour, but let the group get out. She falls down a slope, where she is disturbed by insects. He follows her. He hears the strange sound again, and seems to know that a bat is approaching; to do and get in her hair. He fights it from her, and it attacks and bites his forehead. <br /> <br /> They come out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts attacking in which he hallucinations or visions of bats attacking humans. He gets angry when it happens. He can't drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife is concerned about rabies, and he starts a Pasteur treatment for this, but responds strongly to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people are killed. We see parts of the man's transformation in a bat. It seems like it's not just in his mind. Whether or not the bat bites these transformations is not clear, as he already had symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> While the title looks inappropriate, the implication at the end is that the same thing happens to another person. Not a very good movie, but I like the variety of the desert, cave and ski area, and some of the weirder scenes. I didn't think it was as bad as other people did, and I didn't think the 1999 movie bats were as bad as others think (I evaluated the one with a 5/10).
