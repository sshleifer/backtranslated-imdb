An OK movie, in Mexico, about a hit (Scott Glenn) who hits a ride with a struggling American writer and his Mexican friend to a hit. He pays them to take him to the border? but things go out of control. <br /> <br /> It starts off well enough, but is fighting fast and dying. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The ultimate relationship is poorly crafted and difficult to believe. An absence of passion, and essentially no reasoning behind her to leave one man for the other, made it ridiculous - and the end was predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is the American agent on the hit route, but he looks a little confused about how boring and slow the writing is. ..
