I won't give this movie a rating, it's not worthy. I just watched it because I'm a Pfieffer fan. I love her and will see what she has done. Even in this dud she did not disappoint. Every scene with her in it, watch the viewer ... wait ... for something to happen, but nothing ever did. It had some good story lines, but they suddenly ended when it started. Some of the other characters have potential, but nothing has come of it. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 when she made this movie and was the most beautiful with her. The wardrobe and set was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can usually see anything and rarely come across a movie. I can't find anything about it, but it was a dud. I don't understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about it all, it had a big stone hanger at the end. It had a final scene that woke you up and said wow, this movie is finally a place, then the credits roll. Good pleasure. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watch my cat eat more exciting. Well said. Actually, the commentary was more entertaining than the movie because it summed up so well. I also messed up 0.99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
