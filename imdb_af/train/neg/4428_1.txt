You lose 100 IQ points just to agree. This show must be terrible, I refuse to tune in just what I saw in advertising. Where did they dig the man anyway? What do they want to do next season as well? The secret is out. Everyone already knows the setup? Are they going to look at people who live under a rock in the next season to die? Where are they going to dig up more stupid women? No wonder America is a great joke to outsiders, see what you look at!
