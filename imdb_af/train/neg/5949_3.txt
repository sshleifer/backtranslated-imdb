It is not uncommon to see US inhibitors of foreign films falling flat on their faces, but here is the flip side !!! This is a terrible repetition of the British film "Wide Awake" by the British! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is strange but entertaining and funny! "Liam" on the other hand is just strange. I have to give credit to "Liam" for one thing, and it makes clear that I made the right choice to change my religion!
