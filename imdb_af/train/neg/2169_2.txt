I usually enjoy Loretta Young's early movies: her acting was light and breeze, and she knew how to wear clothes. But this one is just a loser of the word, except for a funny supporting turn by Glenda Farrell. Young is a hat-check girl who speaks to her writer-husband (Paul Lukas) to become a championship bridge team. It's not the most cinematic of games, and the long, talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just kills the movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is one interesting bit. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their climactic game, a series of fast shots show planes, trains, soccer matches, even a diver in the middle of the air, in anticipation of the event. It's the earliest use of a freezer I've seen in an American movie. Wishing the rest was so inventive and funny.
