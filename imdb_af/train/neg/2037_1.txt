If I could give it zero, I would change my mind and give it a -10. Absolutely horrible movie with no movie doesn't make sense of what happens. Don't borrow. Please do not waste your money on this one. Pleaseee !!! This movie could have done so well if it really depicted the true star killer's story, but no, I had nothing but horror as I watched it. Do yourself a favor and hire classic movies, it's better to see a movie you've seen 3-4 times than to see this shit! I don't understand why people even bother to make such movies if they know it won't do well. Zodiac killer should instead be called 'Boriac killer'!
