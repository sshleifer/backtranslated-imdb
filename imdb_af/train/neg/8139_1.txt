Or maybe that's how it feels. Anyway, "The Bat People" is about as flat as a carpet, as fine as a bag of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as intelligent as all three combined. Well, plot in a nutshell: a doctor (Moss) is bitten by a bat while he looks at a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and then becomes a bat. Well, not just a bat, but a bat - like a creature that looks more like a werewolf who sees its victims in the first person's camera. <br /> <br /> But then there's the sheriff's (Pataki) business, which is about the sheriff's WORST kind: the hick kid. He picks up people, learns from married women, steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries (the FIEND!). He smokes with one of the cigarette holders in his mouth and at the same time speaks and lets him look like Buford T. Justice in "Smokey and the Bandit" and (that is the worst part) ... HE IS THE FIRST FEATURES IN THE WHOLE MOVIE! <br /> <br /> The whole movie, however, is just TV movie-of-the-week-like crapola (guano, in this case). It's an AIP, to cry out loud! What did you expect, Oscar caliber? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about a movie that can't even save MST3K? <br /> <br /> How about ... no stars for "The Bat People", full version OR MST3K version! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there is ever a sequel to this movie, I bury my TV.
