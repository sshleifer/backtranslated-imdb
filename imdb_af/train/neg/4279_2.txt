I got a DVD from "I Dream Of Jeanie" in the $ 1.00 bin at Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was the "story of Stephen Foster", a musician and music educator, I had to see it. I had no idea what year it was made, because it didn't say on the cover, just that it was a remake of the Sewanee River in 1939. Bill Shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. The man has NO testosterone and is a wimp all the way through! I have a hard time believing that Stephen Foster thought music publishers showed him a favor by publishing his songs ... without paying him! In addition to the ridiculous idea, there is an almost 20-minute section of Ray Middleton and his black-faced "Christy Minstrels" performing Stephen Foster's songs that were difficult to watch. I can hardly believe that anyone considers this movie to be appropriate in our present time. It is embarrassing and must be forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will never be forgotten. Eileen Christy's portrayal of Jeanie was probably the highest point in the lowest point of Hollywood history.
