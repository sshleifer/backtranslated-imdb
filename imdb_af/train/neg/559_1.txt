I saw this movie at the London Premiere, and I have to say - I didn't expect much, but I expected something that was at least generously entertaining. <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Instinct" was not a big movie and is still something of a "smut classic" but it was entertaining. I can come across the movie many times on a late Friday or Saturday night to convince the movie and start myself to actually pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> This lame brain, waaay-overdue successor has nothing Is Sharon Stone Still Beautiful? Well, let's put it that way - for a 47-year-old she's pretty hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? No. She also had obvious plastic surgery on her face, and her hairstyle in this movie is somewhat unattractive. She doesn't look as soft or right or innocent as in the original - it's the whole point to be an evil seducer, and what not. <br /> <br /> The rest of the shows range from bad to terrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (a typical safe director - one who doesn't always do good work but is worth making movies) officially delivered its first true turkey. A movie, so bad people laughed at certain moments meant to be serious. <br /> <br /> I hear the movie has gone through several editing sessions, and it is very clear from the beginning. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the end - oh me! Talk about silly and incredible. (Still predictable, though.) I saw "Gigli" and I saw "Son of the Mask" - and although I don't want to "smear" this movie, I can do with my own authority (what you don't do agree with the fact that I prefer both those films about this catastrophic failure. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone started five minutes before the movie and people in the theater started throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and abusive scene in an orgy-type nightclub. <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - it basically bumps.
