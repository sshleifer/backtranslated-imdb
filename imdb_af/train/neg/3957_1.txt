The original Boogeyman was a stupid but entertaining supernatural movie. It was not a good movie at all, but fun in the right mood. The third installment in this series, Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is just awful. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifeless new footage. Secondly, CHARGES of recycled pieces of the first movie. The new material is incredibly amateurish, but not in a strange way, but incredibly boring. Clearly, these footage has been hit quickly and effortlessly. It serves as a framework for the endless cuts of the first (and possibly second) movies. And boy, do they milk those cuts from the previous movies; sometimes repeated rows over and over again. The only new addition to these passages is a voice about what uselessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience to look at is really ingenious. <br /> <br /> Returning the Boogeyman is an example of the worst kind of exploit slip; the kind that the audience uses in a highly cynical way. I want to keep this overview short and to the point, because this film no longer deserves. There is nothing of value at all. This is worthless.
