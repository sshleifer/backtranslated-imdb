Jeff Lowell wrote badly and directed 'Over Her Dead Body'. The idea is first and foremost as old as my jokes and the performance is just a cherry on the cake. <br /> <br /> Little Eva Longoria Parker is almost nothing attractive in this movie. Eva looks good as ever and delivers a nice performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks tears and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete miscarriage. She looks masculine and performs a strict average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, so is Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I expected entertainment more from this movie. Unfortunately I didn't entertain.
