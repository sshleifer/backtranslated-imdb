It's one of the worse movies I've ever seen in my life. I wish I could return in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the movie "War Games-The Dead Code" is filmed. 2) View the original WAR GAMES with my current computer knowledge and the eyes of a 1983 preteen. 3) Break in the pentagon computer in the 80's with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered. 4) Reprogram the WHOPPER to remember the place of THE DEAD CODE minutes before the first day of filming. 5) Come back to the present, beer and get Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to empty my memory. event, especially my original view of "The Dead Code" 6) Have another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy to the next bad remake of a good 80's movie. <br /> <br /> 8 Did I kill Jar Jar? I'm not sure if I should travel for it in the future. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
