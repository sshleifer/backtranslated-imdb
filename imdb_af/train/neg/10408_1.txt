If Fassbinder made a worse movie, I definitely don't want to see it! Anyone complaining that his films are talky and claustrophobic, must be forced to see it enjoy the more savvy style he has chosen in excellent movies such as The Bitter Tears Of Petra von Kant. This film falls with so much art, quasi-symbolic images, it looks like a parody of an art movie. The scene in the butchery and the scene where Elvira's prostitute-friendly channel surfer looks like ten minutes, are just two of the brilliant examples of what this film makes a real test of the viewer's endurance. But what really worries me is the few scenes that only Elvira and her ex-wife and / or her daughter contain. These are the only moments that show any real human emotion, and prove that the crux of this horrible film was an excellent movie that struggles to free itself. What a waste.
