.. this is this one! Very good starting point, to the right of the bat. <br /> <br /> Having an excellent first scene, should give credit where credit is due. <br /> <br /> Has solid characters and a decent enough writing for a ghost story. but here are the things that bother me: When the ghosts appear, I really liked the way; how it was done, what it looks like ... the only thing was the ghost's relationship. Because of the way things have gone down in the first scene, you think their dynamic will be different. <br /> <br /> Things slowed down a bit too much in the middle that I felt, and the crab / spider was just not good. BUT then the end is really good! Sure, "The Grudge" basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai's and that's what I like about this movie. <br /> <br /> If anyone with a moderate style repeats this movie, <br /> Fans of "Silent Rage" would absolutely love this movie.
