To this day, when you speak of Japanese theater, most people don't talk about Rashomon, or the Seven Ronin or Ran. For the masses, Japanese theater means all the monsters that we have grown to destroy the Japanese cities over and over, often in battles with each other. The first and greatest of these is Godzilla who has returned a dozen times or more and is confronted in a few films with the three-headed, monster monster from outer space, Ghidrah. Oddly enough, according to times, the special effects have improved slightly. But part of the charm of those old films was that the paper-mache city scents were destroyed. They became so bland, perhaps three steps above Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some visitors of the future traveled to Japan to desire that Godzilla be destroyed from when it was first discovered. And in fact he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II when he protected the Japanese Pacific garrison from these US troops. But later with Bikini's atomic testing, Godzilla became the friendly dinosaur, just like Barney, the average machine we've grown in the theater. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you give Ghidrah a clear field, you are calling out Godzilla. To destroy Japan so that it did not become the economic colossus, it was in 1991 when the film came out. More I will not say, but we all know that Japan is doing pretty well than 2010. <br /> <br /> Like all other Japanese monster movies, just sit back and enjoy the chaos.
