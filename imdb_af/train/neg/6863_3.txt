o my god, I give this movie three stars out of ten for the following reasons. The final order is again properly handled and it was absolutely hilarious. so it gets the three points. Other than that, it was horrible. It wasn't meant to be this funny, so much is obvious, but the dubbing, the actions of the confronted voices, the dialogue they said, often hilarious. The actions performed, and / or not executed, also lead to lots of hilarity and / or throwing things on the screen. as when the whole town is slaughtered and a small group of people are standing on a balcony and see if they see a hob or the "attempt" escapes from the church where they have thrown themselves. <br /> <evil mayor: I think something goes outside, so you have to go upstairs and look out the window. <br /> <br /> Think: OK. Evil Mayor: Now is my chance to get an idiot out and flame with fire that is totally ineffective and cracked. <br /> <br /> Add order to what happens. <br /> <br /> Evil Mayor: Damn, wait, I'll get this little kid and she'll walk outside and scream daddy who is seemingly unshakable for the fact that those rotten bodies aren't just creepy aliens, but actually zombies is without flesh or skin or anything and they will lead them away and I will flee! place the order in which this happens. <br /> <br /> hero (top): he tries to escape again, fool, and he left the door open, he's stupid, it's a nice view. <br /> <br /> wife: where's my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (now downstairs): I don't know, I can't see her anyway and she wasn't out there because I couldn't see her, despite being out there and I have a view of the whole area and she stands right outside, where can she be on earth? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, someone will throw it on the screen after 10 minutes. So, look at the first movie with some friends, drink a few drinks and make sure by the time you check this one you are completely blindly drunk and you can only be horrified by its stupidity. and there wasn't even a decent gore, such a shame.
