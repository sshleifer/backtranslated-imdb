After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River, why was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It was just not the same without Spur and Harrison, as depicted by Douglas. Perhaps he realized how poor the plot was. Jim returns to longing absence to find Jessica pursued by another man. He couldn't expect a girl to wait so long without any contact with him and not finding competition. For a Disney movie, it contains dirty language, plus the highly unnecessary part when Jim & Jessica are piled up without being married - lots of LAME. Another insult to viewer intelligence, according to members of my family. I stick to the first one and try to forget that I've ever seen the successor!
