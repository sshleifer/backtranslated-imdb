Over time, they released this movie to DVD. I know some say WB hurts the release of this movie because of The Dreamgirls movie. But how can you hurry the release of a movie that has been in your catalog since 1976? <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed with the DVD version of this movie, no special feature, no 5.1 DD sound. Come on WB, you can do much better. The sound and picture quality on this movie needs serious help. <br /> <br /> Seem WB did not put as much time and attention to this movie as it is a black movie and I have good sales. They could have kept the CD that didn't immediately have all the songs from the original CD. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB has to add some special features. Take notes from other group films, The Five Heatbeats, or The Temptation where you can only see the show, and the sound on both is very, much, much better than this DVD.
