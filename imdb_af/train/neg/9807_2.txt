Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or movie I don't like on IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just as terribly horrible, it's awful. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have thought if it wasn't an animated series, would have been better if I think, but as a lively action it shows the terms 'cheesy' and 'campy'. Which is Power Rangers. Five multi-colored, spandex teens struggle with their martial arts. The costumes are horrific - they look like something reminiscent of what rail and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear. The acting is unfortunate, and the combat choreography is so shocking and so lame to watch. This makes Jean-Claude Van Damme as good as Bruce Lee, which in itself is an understatement. In fact, they seem to be jumping and dancing; as it was a version of the 'Nutcracker', or they did ballet, rather than fighting. In addition, there are some cartoons that contain versatile art and yet it is done in a fun but not so cheesy way. It makes it stupid. <br /> <br /> Children show or not, it's just as lame and on the verge of absurdity. And even if this version is set up in America, you can be forgiven for thinking that you, like some of the battle order, are not filmed in the US, but rather in Japan. so the somewhat fake battle and footage is borrowed from the Japanese version, just to appear in the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like these kinds of things, then keep at Sentai's Japanese equivalent.
