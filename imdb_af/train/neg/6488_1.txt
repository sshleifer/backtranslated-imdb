Yes, the subject is a straight quote from the movie and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so bored to death with this meaningful attempt. All the flashes etc. Don't make sense after the first 20 minutes is just bad movie processing. If you are epileptic, you would have been dead at least five times. Of course, all the David Lynch fans will raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be "the best movie ever made" because it doesn't make sense. And if that doesn't make sense, it should be art and art. movie is always good. Right? I'm wrong. This kind of artificial grab is just a pathetic way to prove you're a good movie maker. Anthony Hopkins as an excellent actor should just keep acting.
