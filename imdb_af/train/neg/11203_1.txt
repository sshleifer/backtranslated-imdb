The scriptwriter attempted poorly to create the "Exorcist". But put in a blah-blah love story that makes you sick rather than keep you engaged. There is nothing in this whole movie. It has the potential to be something special but blows it by showing a lot of people about what nobody cares about. Very boring, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw it, but the silly movie tickets were expensive, so I had to resist the threatening torture that felt it lasted forever. There is nothing on the screen related to what the characters were talking about. <br /> <br /> They use computer graphics here, instead of dedicating me (as intended, I hate CGI), the movie even more devastated. Some say this movie has become horrible in the cinema because it was a "mind-boggling" and "slow-motion" because it was an intelligent movie. What is so intelligent or thought-provoking as the story is basically about beautiful son H Eath Ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion? Looks like an uninspired concept. Oh, and there are some mumbo jumbo about the "sin-eater" (the movie was originally called "Sin-eater"). Lame concept, but the film took the sin-eating thing too seriously, and the film became pathetic and madness about how dark and intelligent it was. Yes, I know there were sin eaters in the Middle Ages, but this movie just makes it cute. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was done right and I forgot why I even complained about this movie. If you want horror movies that actually have depth, watch Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen, or any of the Romero's "Dead Trilogy" movies. Nonsense dialogue is not equal to intelligence people, mainstream movie fans think that though (the same kind of people who think a ridiculous movie like Hulk is a movie masterpiece). If you want a nasty boring horror, watch the Order. This movie makes the church look like a rollercoaster ride.
