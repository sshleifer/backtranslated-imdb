I went to school with Jeremy Earl. That's how I heard about this movie. I don't really know if it's in the theater. I don't remember the name. I saw it, it's like one of those post-school offers. The acting is OK, not good. The plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty wheaty. So, the only comment I can give this movie is "Eh". I borrowed the movie from Jeremy. If I was in a movie rental, it would be one I would go by and after watching it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. middle school age. I also noticed that many times when urban children are portrayed, the snake is overused or just obsolete. Many times I think that's what makes their characters incredible.
