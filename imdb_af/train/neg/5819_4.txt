It is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. The parents divorced and mom stays back east in the house. The father, Murray Abromowitz, travels to California with his children and moves around Beverly Hills so that his children can get the best possible education. <br /> <br /> Things get really funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray's cousin, comes to live with the group. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the various adventures of the family that are complicated by the drug scene of the affluent environment. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter is a woman who wants Murray to go in with her as she wants a comrade. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come to the end. They play Murray's brother and brother-in-law respectively; they are also the parents of Tomei. Before the children, Reiner Murray no longer reminds him that he has already paid the bills for them. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with an acid drawing, as the shameful family moves out of their graves and takes to drive into Beverly Hills in their car. I think the film promotes independence and good old self-esteem.
