Let's put it simply in simple words, so even the makers of this movie have a chance to understand: This is a very silly movie with a thinner script, lame animation and a story that is about to be original thumbnails. Don't bother - unless you have to find a way to entertain a group of mentally handicapped adults or extremely slow children. They may laugh, especially if they are off their meds. There's a special kind of insult in a movie, it's ridiculous. Not only do the filmmakers believe that children are brainless idiots that can be entertained with a little bit of trouble, but they do not even bother to sweat. I honestly said this movie. Shame on you to bend so low.
