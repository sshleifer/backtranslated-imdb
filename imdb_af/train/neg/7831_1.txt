With its companion, MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES, it can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that started so eagerly with the TWILIGHT ZONE and OUTSIDE limits. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that it is of no importance to a comparable adult audience, but rather to TEN-YEAR OLDS, which can only count body bags, and hardly so. And so cruelty is king, and king is cruel. <br /> <br /> Stephen King is simply illiterate? In general, he has the ability to tell stories by Bart Simpson. Since he can't read his only inspiration, the movies are. <br /> <br /> True, the theater is not such a bad place to start, as it generally escaped the onslaught of Realism. But these movies are just the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to WRITE, you have to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, just PICKMAN had samples as close acquaintances. But it must be clear to any undergraduate student that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what is wrong. One can almost imagine this pathetic assault if his desk tries to make something SCARY. <br /> <br /> Do you think trying to accurately describe the horror of the system of which it is an integral part. the stupid fool, but try to make a terrible story for his little cousin. Suppose you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead and started to open up as they did to those autopsy things! Wouldn't it be gross? And that, boys and girls, is the story. <br /> <br /> What about characterization? Oh yes, he is one of those suits that never appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he shouted? Well, they can't really hear him, you know ?? He says he will sue the hospital, but he is no longer such a big shot, you see, lie there (or lie there, I can never remember) and everyone. And he thinks: Please, please, don't cut me and it's horrible, lying (or lying) like that? Now, wouldn't it be a big story? You know I've read somewhere that a snake bite can do it. I think it's the great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of that snake again, oh well, a TREE? have quite a ring on it, don't do it. <br /> <br /> Let's make it a PERUVAL TREE Sure, Steve, it's wonderful? except that TROUSERS are Afrikaans, yours! But how can you really say that the target audience is children, and not just spiritual defects? It's easy: there is no sex. <br /> <br /> Well, there is, but it is the kind that is shone through the door to our parents' bedroom. Modern filmmakers are very fond of the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the chase. <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON, they have no idea what is going on. All that really remains is the giggling outside the SM club and the Fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are actually angry. <br /> <br /> Despite a certain difference in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And since there is no real titulation, should he torture her first? Not in any way that will excite her, you understand, because it will upset our puritanical feelings. And so horror and romance just become unpleasant and care for psychopaths. <br /> <br /> Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist, and can only get a boner if someone touches him, do you know? rubber gloves (giggles). And that's what they use in autopsies, and that's how they discover he actually knows. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is the author's knowledge of his inspiring powers. Bad, they cut it out, because it can upset the FIVE-YEARS OLD to watch the show!
