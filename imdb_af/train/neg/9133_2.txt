This is a strict overview of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. <br /> <br /> Television moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means I'm immune to the nostalgic charms that Moonlighting has for most reviewers. <br /> <br /> (Possible heater warning) <br /> <br /> The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic "caveman meets fluffball" yarn, where a "charming" red-blooded man manipulates a deceived woman to to realize what she really wants and needs. The site on which the script's "white" is based, must have been outdated in 1950. It also contains frankly bad writing, such as in the scene where Maddie breaks down the furniture instead of shooting the villain, proving herself inconspicuous. female who needs male help. <br /> <br /> I often find Susan Faludi overreacting to see male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm all with her - Moonlighting has stamped BACKLASH everywhere. <br /> <br /> In one sense, however, this DVD is a requirement for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot section, it contains the screen test that Willis landed on. Both features show how wonderful Willis's acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Rating (and I'm a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10
