This movie looks as though it may well be good at first, but never realized. The director is talented and has good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of the Asian directors), but does not know how to create or tell a good story. The story was fragmented and appeared in all sorts of different directions in the film, without getting a solid, explainable, interesting angle. Actually, the movie never adjusts the explanation on press releases. However, the acting was very good. All the actors performed well, and Jude Law was excellent as always. It's too bad, he chose to do such a bad movie.
