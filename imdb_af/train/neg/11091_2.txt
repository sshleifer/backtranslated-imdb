Denzel is about the only thing right in this movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was a better movie early on. Someone has decided to cut an action and make plot points in the beginning of the movie, giving away most of the storyline in about the first 5 minutes. This and ruining everything that has built up in rhythm and rhythm may have had the incident before. <br /> <br /> So first it confuses you and then puts you off. The dramatization pushes past the suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this might be suffocating in viewers. Permitted, so do, if you are looking for it, knock yourself out.
