Well, you can't waste time, just the cause of a great death. I think everything I could see is a lot of talents wasting their time on a big screen with a pathetic humor that will appeal, I don't know who? some pathetic songs heard by who? some pathetically abrupt teeth that are justified by who? race against time? you mean waste against time? OK, first, you spoil your child, then you teach him a lesson. Wow, we are so ignorant of the fact that anyone who said it was a brilliant new concept is probably different to humans. Okay, well, let me comment like people. message to be given, but it may well have been by a stranger sitting next to you in the bus, rather than going to such a wasteful movie to learn it. Hindi movies have proven it a lot, and I can't waste my time on waste anyway!
