"Iowa" wants to be "Requiem for a Dream" for Midwest meth, but it comes across as a hard R rated "Reefer Madness". <br /> <br /> Yes, drugs are bad, and meth is terribly harmful, as an addiction and how it destroys people, families, and communities. But these characters who are either stupid or ridiculous and the eye-rolling plot will not teach that lesson to anyone. <br /> <br /> While writer / director / star Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on display, his partner Diane Foster plays a capricious, foolish wide-eyed guilt damaged by drugs already made by Susan Sarandon in the Rocky Horror Picture Show "I was really sorry for her for all the unnecessary nudity she was working on. It wasn't until the end of the movie that I realized I was thinking these two recent high school graduates had to be to explain some of them naively, because we were bombarded by their school photos, but if they did, they even looked older than the people on "The OC." Although they have good chemistry on the screen, they are a appeared imitating a "Badlands" -type couple. <br /> <br /> The guest stars are badly used, Michael T. Weiss, who was so good at TV's The Pretender, is completely ridiculous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is just as crazy, as his character is near No disturbing social meaning to the movie. Rosanna Arquette has to be even stranger than she rolled over for David Cronenberg as a very low rent Livia Soprano. John Savage should even make the old baby boomer excuses about having pot, but it's worse. A Goth chick appears, with the odd explanation that she is a stripper from Des Moines. The compulsory Latino drug dealer appears - in Iowa? <br /> <br /> With a limited budget, the interior view of meth use is portrayed fairly vividly, with rather frightening hallucinations. We are sure they are crazy. <br /> <br /> While the Iowa locations are being used very well (including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery), the accent and church references are confusingly Southern Baptists. Guns seem to be used by law lasting and legislation breaks citizens here more than into any downtown drug trafficking movie. <br /> <br /> The songs of Iowa's best-known bard Greg Brown are used everywhere, but strangers are not listed in the credits. I hope they are used with permission. <br /> <br /> I caught it at his commercial race in NYC because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it got considerably - and inexplicably - buzz.
