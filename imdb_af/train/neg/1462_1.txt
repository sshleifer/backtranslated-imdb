It could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this movie is not even close to historically accurate. It starts badly and then it is already downhill from there. We have cursed Hitler's father's own misfortune on the fact that he married his cousin! They were indeed cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called his father, Alois, "uncle" because Alois was adopted and educated by Klara's grandfather and when his son was educated when he was really his cousin. Alois was much older than Klara and as a child, she had the habit of calling Alois, uncle. <br /> <br /> The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to put it on his dog is simply a shame and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers. We see that Hitler chases the dog through the ditch when he catches up with the poor thing he continues to destroy because he doesn't obey him. In the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and cheat the cowardly little man, but then a shell comes directly to his persecutors, and everyone who told us is being killed. How then, if Hitler was the only person to survive the scene, did this story tell of cruelty and cowardice? Did Hitler himself talk about it? - I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Next, Hitler bulls and intimidate a poor, tense and warrior, tired Jewish officer to give him an Iron Cross! I can only assume that this Jewish official was a pledge broker before he fought for the Fatherland, and transferred a number of dedicated medals from his shop because I am sure Iron Cross is not being distributed as shown in this comic farce. <br /> <br /> All the grotesque clichés are here, especially the quiet and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on the little man. If only producers kept Ian Kershaw on the side. Then they might have discovered that Franz Lehar's "Merry Widow" was more likely to drive the Führer boat than any flying Dutchman out of Richard Wagner's cannon! <br /> <br /> Hitler may have been responsible for the death of 60 million people, but how can he ever be forgiven for his terrible taste in music? <br /> <br /> I can go on, but I'll be there for hours. <br /> <br /> Give it a Miss.
