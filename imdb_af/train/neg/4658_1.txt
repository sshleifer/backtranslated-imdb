SHORT ENGINEER is a terrible and useless repetition of the 1945 David Lean classic, based on Noel Coward's play "Still Life". A doctor removes a grain of grain from a woman's eye at a train station, he is in a miserable relationship, she is happily married to social worker of Italian descent. They accidentally meet at another occasion, form a direct attraction and arrange to meet each other every Wednesday. The couple are in love, but after a couple of afternoons they realized they didn't have a realistic chance of happiness and agreed to participate. Coward's original one play relates to two ordinary people who fell in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two Super Stars and veterans of Hollywood Epics, are no one's idea of ​​"ordinary people". Loren in particular is overlooked - Sophia Loren in full makeup, looks like a million dollars, works as a part-time voluntary social worker at a civil advisory bureau, just doesn't speak true. Burton, crawling, with colored hair, too much makeup and wearing flat shoes, doesn't appear to be your average general practitioner. That said, you can't really blame them for a relationship after seeing their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spent her evening with poisonous reviews and treating her husband with total contempt. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, potters around the house all day and finally boring: the most exciting thing he ever did is almost six years earlier. Their final scene together will cause unrest, ("You were long, far away", etc.). This great British working actor, John LeMesurier, has a three-minute como as Burton's friend, and apparently slightly intrigued, speaking his lines in a barely audible voice. It's a sad and forgetful performance in a bad, horrible rehash of a cinema class. Avoid at all costs.
