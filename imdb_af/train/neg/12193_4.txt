"Look, I know it can suck now, but pain is temporary. The film is forever. Everything you do now is burned to celluloid for thousands of years." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> Initially it was a movie for Steven Spielberg, the director hired several scriptwriters to adapt the screenplay to better suit his themes. And so we have a dysfunctional family threatened by a depraved monster recently released from jail Robert De Niro. Like the "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "World of War", the dysfunctional family joins the beast, the animal who is the father's creation, a lawyer who did not defend the De Niro during his trial. <br /> <br /> In the typical Spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then immediately released from his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually every "daddy" figure in Spielberg country, the father repeats his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoys. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg eventually left the photo and the project was instead transferred to Martin Scorsese, who then tried to try his hand at more commercial rates. The result is probably the worst movie in Scorsese's filmography, and ironically, it is the most enlightening. <br /> <br /> An artist's failures or failures are often revealing, revealing the inner workings of their art. When the story does not work, the characters do not connect or the images do not tear, we find ourselves with some inner core. This ?? The remaining carcass is after which the director's theater goes. <br /> <br /> Now, "Cape Fear" is an impersonal movie, so we find no thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese's filmography ("You've Been Brought!" De Niro shouts, but the movie themes of Catholic salvation are cutters. However, what the film does is simply the kind of language its filmography hangs on. Watch how Scorsese's camera desperately swings back and forth, dreaming about doorknobs and windows in an effort to force tension and how his characters out loud and shout for attention. But more importantly, watch the film make no spatial sense. A jump on a boat at the end of the movie takes place on an obvious soundtrack, a street paradise is claustrophobic and does not occur in any greater context and the family's home does not look at all in particular. There is simply no geographical sense for anything in the picture, Scorsese cannot play space or create any spatial environment. <br /> <br /> The reason is that Scorsese's camera must always be bound, or intimately linked to its central character. For the world around the character to make sense, his camera should be focused on the character. Resnais can transport you around a French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you a street and a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can rebuild a whole future cityscape, Lucas can give you an alien desert plan, and most other directors can create a sense of space through handbook "close-up-shot-shot shot combinations", but Scorsese can't. There is no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. He's all about character. You break the tower, you leave the boxing ring, the taxi taxi, you look away from De Niro and everything falls apart. He simply can't break away from these many documentary artifacts, which are somehow a prerequisite for action movies. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to correct this problem with "Gangs of New York", where space and sets become central, but even this self-conscious spatial experiment is powered by Daniel Day Lewis's magnetism. sabotaged. The actor draws Scorsese's camera relentlessly to him like a moth on a light bulb. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as a generic B movie, it's an ugly, vulgar film. Look at the carpet paintings, the turbulent tensions, the foolish rotorscoped special effects and the hokey fistfight build up. Yet we have Robert De Niro picking up the slack. De Niro, who gives his body to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only big scene. In an improvised romantic drive with a young Juliette Lewis, he put his thumb in her mouth and kissed her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl walks away, both awakened and repelled by this man's interest. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, just as well above, simply can't be countered by Scorsese. You will need the operatoon and baroque image of someone like De Palma to make this work. But Scorsese? No. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
