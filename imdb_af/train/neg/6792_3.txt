Here is a movie with a good cast and nice looking place work, but it just doesn't. Director Richard Brooks should have been a little tired at this stage of the game; How much better she was THE PROFESSIONAL! The horses and the rest of the action also seem to be slow, even during the non-slow screens. This film should be created if anything. The horror of horror seems to me terribly evil and the obvious ties in those desert detection moments - just lazy. messy work. Sorry. The actors did well, but I certainly saw everyone doing better. Ben Johnson is always a joy. I've seen this movie over the past 30 years; was then disappointed and stayed on the second viewing 30 years later.
