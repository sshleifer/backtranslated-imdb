It doesn't take long to see why Code Name: Diamond Head didn't make it on the network schedules. The TV pilot's movie doesn't go beyond the credits until it's clear, just how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something, because the plot didn't make much sense. Because of what I got from the devastated mess, a terrorist or thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something with a secret weapon. The world's most beautiful secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is out to stop him. Maybe there was more, but trust me? It really doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Action flies must have action. Suspicious moments should have tension. And dramatic moments must have drama. There is nothing in Code Name: Diamond Head. I saw others using the word "turgid" to describe it for TV snoozer ?? And it's better than any word description I can come to. None of the characters is at least a little exciting or worth caring. And Roy Thinnes makes the worst case imaginable. His charisma is just a little north of a snail. Ian McShane is easily the best thing the movie does for it, but unfortunately for everyone involved, it does not seem to go back as a regular member. Now if McShane was thrown into the series, you might have had something. <br /> <br /> I quickly discover that these Gawd horrible 70's made-for-TV movies make huge Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. . And it's double as Quinn Martin was involved. Many funny things about Mike and the Bots. So while I can only give the movie 3/10, I upgrade Episode # 608 to 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
