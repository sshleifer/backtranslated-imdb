Why? !! It was an intrepid, uninspired and embarrassing film. The embarrassment comes from the city where they made it. Pittsburgh PA! Why did they let these people do such a BAAAAAD movie? <br /> <br /> When this movie was originally released, it was more of a romantic comedy ... and no ROBO anything. That everything with Disney's courtesy has changed. WHY ???? They did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. As Matthew Broderick also enjoys his own movies, it wasn't great either. Wow !!
