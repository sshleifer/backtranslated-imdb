Odd slasher film by Producer Charles Band. In the days of Full Moon's greatest success, Band said he would never make "real killer movies" because he felt small dolls and big monsters had a fantasy element that made the movies better. People who kill each other are really and less fun. A good philosophy and a real shame that Band, after destroying the Full Moon studio through potentially bad business, has become so desperate for home movie profits that it has made exactly what it wanted Blockbuster to offer, and thus sacrificing creativity and originality has. The team behind this one also worked on 'Delta Delta Die!' and Birth Rite - both equally dim by Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is on the regular top form here as a beginner of a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make a story about a 'murder club'. She did - of course - do everything she could to join and then panic because it wasn't a real story and foolish Ms Rochon believed it and now everyone had to run around to cover in blood and maybe kill or maybe kill each other. The choice is there and with regard to this movie it is yours ... not recommended, but not quite bad either.
