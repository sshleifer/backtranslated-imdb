While there is Flying Guillotines as part of the title of this movie, it has no affiliation with the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and the successor Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two original are masterpieces of kung-fu movie and still stand as a classic. It's a very inferior copy of the original, and even as a regular kung-fu movie, it's below average. <br /> <br /> First, this movie doesn't have much to do. It is a senseless battle scene after another, and flying guillotine doesn't even play a big part in them. The story is about some Shaolin monks who find some villains who have taken a sacred book, and an evil prince who owns this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince has plans to lure the monks and use the flying guillotines on them. <br /> <br /> There are four movies with Flying Guillotine as part of its title. It is of the least quality in my opinion. The design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three, indicating that this movie was produced by another entity of the other three. <br /> <br /> The movie has no chemistry due to inadvertently funny due to poor production. <br /> <br /> Best skip it and look at the two original ones.
