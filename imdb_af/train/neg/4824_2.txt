I wanted to keep this movie, but many elements ruined it for me. Using a fisheye lens throughout and improper editing did not give me a feeling to be in the world of the methop, but it made me think I watched MTV for a few moments. The movie never looked and the acting was really an excellent example of overtime. I love movies that give us a glimpse of the cunning underworld, but this movie can't decide if it was a bad horror movie or a worse serious comment about the horrors of addiction.
