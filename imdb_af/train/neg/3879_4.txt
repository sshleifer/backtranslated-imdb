Rebar is an astronaut going to the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course it's a horror movie that makes things ugly and he returns to Earth as the only survivor. Crushed with a bizarre condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose, unless he regularly consumes human flesh, he kills what apparently the only nurse in hospital and escapes to the neighboring town to steal more victims. <br /> <br /> I like the premise and the sample and gore effects are pretty good, but space scenes are matched by stock NASA footage and the hospital looks strange like a warehouse. A very poor writing, small character development and overall bad acting, this one, in addition to a mediocre slasher movie, has the novelty of having a candle like the killer, and more or less just its gore effects. to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, strict for the most mortal monster movie fans.
