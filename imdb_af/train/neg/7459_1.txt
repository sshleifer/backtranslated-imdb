Please save your money and see something else. this movie was such a piece of crap. I didn't want to go, but I had to so I thought I'd laugh once, NOPE. not a single laugh, it was so terrible! chris kattan will never get a good comedy role and a night at the roxbury. This film is quite obvious, has no clever humor, and repeats it over and over. listen to me and chase as far away from this movie as you possibly can!
