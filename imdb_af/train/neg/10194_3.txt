This 30-minute documentary Bu単uel in the early 1930s on one of Spain's poorest areas is, in my opinion, one of its worst films. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say that, I fully admit that wealth can bring its own problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, although it is indeed rich. as the extreme poverty shown here). And if poverty disappears in Spain, it was not exactly the kind of socialism that Bu単uel benefited, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides it in school, children learn the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, horror! Bu単uel's short-sightedness is at its best, not realizing that it's access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor to overcome their situation. What does he suggest? That children learn exactly what at school? Doesn't Bu単uel understand that it's the lack of modern technology that made them poor compared to other people?
