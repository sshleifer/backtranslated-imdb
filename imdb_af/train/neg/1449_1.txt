First, before you read any further, understand that I'm not neo-Nazi. I'm just trying to understand correctly, Hitler, to make sure no one like him takes power again. <br /> <br /> I saw it. series and find it terrible. I mean, okay, it's interesting to look at, but is it really? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler was not angry with his whole life, the series shows an evil Hitler, even though he is a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter. It is highly likely that Hitler was in fact gay and fought all his life to choke this secret. Third, people will hate me, but that's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to come to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was beautiful. This is a common point I have found in interviewing people living near or far from him (of course not Jews). <br /> <br /> This series was terrible, because if you think Hitler was just a malignant bastard, ugly, and of course, not at all charm, you're wrong. If you think so, you will let people take power in countries and you don't want it. If you really understand how Hitler managed to get power, and stop thinking he's just awful, you'll find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember he's elected) and stop the theme before it's too late. /> <br /> Life is important to protect. This series is just awful to show us the truth. If we continue Hitler so, another will do exactly the same.
