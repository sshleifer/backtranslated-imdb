I'm a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And, in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (a very pleasant supportive actor) was in this movie ... so why didn't I enjoy it very much?! Well, despite a good throw, it is one of the poorest written and most clicked photos I've ever seen. Given the talent and money spent on making this movie, it is shocking how slides the writing was. I knew the movie would be boring when I predicted myself early in the movie, exactly what would happen next - and I was always right! And that is not because I am a kind of "movie savant", but because there has been virtually no imagination or effort. In fact, it looks like the movie is just a long series of cliches all tied together! Also, I found it a little annoying that Fred Carole was so ill-treated in the movie and finally came to the scene. Uggh! There is more tension in a Lassie movie ("will he bring people to save Timmy or will he quit the rope?"). <br /> <br /> Despite the very, very tired and clicked writing, there were some positives about the movie. It was pretty cool, because Fred looked like a broken luxury at the end of the movie. It was reasonably credible and he seemed to not eat, shave or sleep in days. Also, Charles Butterworth's "prattle" provided some light humorous moments. But it just wasn't enough to make this movie look like a B-movie. It's a shame, it could have been so much better.
