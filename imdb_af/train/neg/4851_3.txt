watch a team of bombing experts in Iraq count their time before they can go home. <br /> <br /> In itself, it's very boring. Each time that small caption acted, we told how long they had gone, but it just made this movie come true. Shoot up and finish your time there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I have to miss something. I'm a big fan of war movies if they're done well. It had a "jarhead" syndrome. A movie that is sometimes beautifully shot, but cinematography doesn't stop it dull and useless. <br /> <br /> And come across the slow mo patterns coming out of the gun, "have shot. They could have saved money and just had stockpile from any other movie with a gun in it. <br / > <br /> I had no empathy for the chief in it, I was constantly hoping that his recklessness would let him die. In fact, the movie would have worked much better if he had. <br /> <br /> I read reviews and felt that those who were in the armed forces did not have it, and everyone loved it very much, I have never been in power and I am with them. the cinematography.
