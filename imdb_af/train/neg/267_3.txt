The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers plays at a deadly slow pace, after Johnny Rico leaves his parents, the (not very attractive) girl for whom he desires, and joined the mobile infantry. The strangers in the show are nothing like the barbaric mistakes of the movie, instead they are squid-like monsters that shoot lasers from their mouths. <br /> <br /> During this release, I was constantly amazed at how fruity they managed to make the whole thing. The show is mostly concerned about the relationships between the recruits and the sore, long-lasting cans they give by their warrior weaponists, with about 80s of a pop doll sometimes in the sparse battle order which eventually comes in the last few episodes. In terms of construction, it is owed to Top Gun, which shares a lot of pacing and content (and everything that implies).
