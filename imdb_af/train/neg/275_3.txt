It is absolutely amazing to me that someone can comment that this film is not a minister. It is not only oppressive minister, but absurd, advanced, dramatic straight jacket, and painfully overwhelmed. If you see it, you feel that an 8-year-old child is being punished by having to write a "fascist" 100 times on the blackboard. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it was made at the height of WW2, and was meant to be a brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he caused (which anyone with great hearts welcome) and I'm sure it has captured the mood of the day accurately. But it is presented in such an immature, extravagant, sledgehammer way, it fails abysmally as a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas, who has sincerity and intensity to his role as a silent heroic anti-fascist and Lucile Watson as the amusingly bad rich grandmother who slowly realizes how dangerous the world has become has. Although their rootless education has subjected them to all sorts of hardships, the children are ridiculously shown to be robotically well-behaved small snips. They don't even look at the right people. And Bette Davis, a great actress, is one of the dimensionally noble ones I've ever seen on the screen. Her every word, her every gesture is meant to convey how SUPPORTIVE and UNDERSTAND she is of the qualities her husband must make and the great cause for which he fights, that she must be wired to get a painful electric shock when she dare <br /> <br /> This is a very important movie, but not a very good one.
