This movie reminds me of some bad science fiction films from the 50's and 60's. It's not scary or interesting, but it's boring, cheesy and stupid. Special effects are laughable, all actors are ridiculous and the end is just terrible. waste your money, rent or buy something better. I give it 3.5 out of 10 (I found this turkey quite amusing because of its stupidity).
