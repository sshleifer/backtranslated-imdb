This movie sucked. It was really a waste of my life. The scene was frightening, the plot completely unreliable. Long, long story short, these people become "terror" by this pathetic "mad killer", but completely failing to fight back in any way. And that's after they took a raft on a camping tour, without gears, and turned up at a campsite that had already come together and was full of food and clothes and the girls' headphones. Besides, after their boat disappeared, they panicked that they had been caught in the bush, but then the daughter's boyfriend just appeared and they never believed they could just walk out of the forest as he did to get them. As I said, this movie sucks. A full joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk to you about it.
