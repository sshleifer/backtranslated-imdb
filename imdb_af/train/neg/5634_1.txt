The poster calling this "Plotless and pointless" literally took the words I would use in my subject line. The only thing I want to add is "passionate." For a movie made by a married couple and containing many graphic sex scenes, this movie can make a sultry situation in one that is freezing. Dafoe and Colagrande seem bored during sex scenes, and the viewer can only take a Valium and do it. Also, the women in the audience saw too many Tampons in their time, and any guy turned on by seeing Willem Dafoe, pulling a bloody tampon out of his wife's vagina, should really get therapy. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the movie (if there is one) is the restaurant scene where a waiter explains to the ongoing sleeping Dafa who is a "jaw-jambalaya". (All the ingredients of the dish still separate, rather than together.) This movie is an "explosive thriller". All the elements are there: spooky, isolated house, dead spouse, flu violets on the score, weirdo caretaker who comes and goes as he likes, accident kills and near deaths, characters with a secret past. Actually, there are every thriller clich√© you can think of, but nothing comes together. Everything just sits there and never touches a coherent plot or even an artificial mood. At the restaurant, Dafoe succeeds on the "deconstructed jambalaya". Prospective tenants of this mess will do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the video store shelf.
