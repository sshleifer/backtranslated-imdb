It has the absolute worst performance of Robert Duval that sounds like William Buckley throughout the film. His hammie melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure it's a deliberate scene that steals or unintentionally, but it's the only thing I can remember about a truly forgotten movie. This photo should be shown in every amateur action class of an example of what not to do. Thank you, Duvall tackled bigger and better things and stopped creating a cultured accent. He's a good character actor, but it's about it. Klaus is so much better. His performance is subdued and remarkable.
