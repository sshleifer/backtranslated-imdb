In the Table of Babel installment of the mini-series, the narrator describes the builders of the tower as "the descendants of Moses." <br /> <br /> It's like saying that George Washington lived many centuries before Alexander the Great. <br /> <br /> Or that the bulb was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the bow and arrow. <br /> <br /> Should I say more? <br /> <br /> The Great Heroes of the Bible writers had at least devoted themselves to the chronologies of Biblical people and events.
