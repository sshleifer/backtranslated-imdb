My friends and I rented it for "Bad Movie Night", with high expectations, but The Brain was something of a fall. The brain itself is glorious, but it usually only sits on its small platform. Who thought it would be cool for the brain to beat just three elongated minutes to three people? This film has a number of things that go first, including an Estevez knockoff head playing a rebellious genius (we are told that his immense intellect is being misplaced in his extensive pranks and school classes, including that crazy glue sitting on someone's chair). It also has some good lines, a hilariously out-of-shape and out-of-breath handy man who is just about to be everywhere, and yes, a little chick gets naked. However, the director desperately needs training in the art of pacing. During the latter half, it just starts to mourn, with at least 3 or 4 pointless, boring chase scenes that make up the middle third of the plot. The screens in the PRI complex are especially bad. At least 15 minutes from this movie, people walk on and off the same stairs. I could have solved the script on this thing in half an hour - more cheese, more gory, more nudity, more brain action. If you are going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cool to watch while my superego is turned off. Perhaps the director tried to bring the audience into his movie. I felt like one of the zombified townsfolk at the end of this crapfest.
