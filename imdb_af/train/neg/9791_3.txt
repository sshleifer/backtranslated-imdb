Actually, it's about a couple who want to adopt a second child. At the adoption agency they meet a mouse (Stuart) and decide to accept him. If you think it's stupid, hold it, because it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart comes to his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (Save me!) The rest is actually the usual cliché, about family problems, jealousy from the older brother, and eventually all problems are solved and they are all a "happy family". I didn't know if the director believed that he was creative by introducing a mouse to the cliché, or he just tried to fill in minutes, but he just upgraded the cliché from boring to abhorrent. <br /> <br /> Why did I get a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat, which Stuart loves so much as the "brother". And because of some funny performances, where Stuart makes good use of his small size. <br /> <br /> Overall, I believe the movie will work pretty well as: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "brother or sister". b. It kept the funny performances, as Stuart tried to wipe out the cat, leaving out boring clichés that didn't even match anything else.
