Four best friends young male chauvinistic pigs (focusing on pigs) meet at a NYC dinner weekly to tell their sexual appointments in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group, leading to conflict and the inevitable "whip". Although the film's prospect has potential and there are a few funny moments to have, in general, the movie does not work in the last place where the girls are made to look better than the guys who are at odds with the core of the story. One of those one-man band with a dozen producers, "Whipped" will probably only be enjoyed by the kind of young men who think "The Man Show" is Emmy material.
