Genghis Cohn is a (very) generously entertaining British film about a German police commissioner in the late 1950s haunted by the ghost of a Jewish comedian he murdered 15 years ago while serving in the SS. The ghost comes back and wants his murderer to live as a Jew to sin for the murders he has committed. <br /> <br /> Otto, the German policeman actually knows this ghost's name, because the last thing he did before he died was said, in the Yiddish, "Kiss my ass". The policeman did not speak Yiddish, so he asked until he got the meaning. The 'kiss my ass' left such an impression that everyone involved in the murder learned and remembered the comedian's name, Genghis Cohn. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of men killed in the police commissioner's jurisdiction. , and there are no useful clues. The men are murdered with a set of knives missing from the local butcher. The butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich. The commissioner is therefore a suspect. The first man dies while he loves the butcher's wife, so the butcher is a suspect. But the butcher claims he would be very busy killing every man who slept with his wife. All the men are killed immediately after the climax of love. <br /> <br /> I think I can be a little angrier than the ghost of Genghis Cohn when I am killed as he was. He looked very happy about it, as if he were just in a soft car accident. I can only guess that this is because it is a British movie and they are known for being a very polite person. He uses some of his material from his stand-up route, and I just didn't find it very funny. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 4 because it was just as goofy. I thought it should have been a little more serious than it was. The movie seems to be a murder mystery (where did it come from?), And it seems that Genghis was more helpful than he was. The movie gave me a little glimpse into Jewish culture, but was just skin-deep. Love all Jewish liver eggs and onion sandwiches? Do they all say `shtoop 'and` meshuganah' in their daily vocabulary? Are there no more important things to know about the culture? <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at a Jewish community center in Berkeley, CA, and I was the only person in the room whose hair was not completely gray or white. (I have no gray or white hair.) There were 18 of us, and after the movie they stayed about 20 minutes to discuss the movie. There were 2 major concerns expressed: 1. The film was too light-hearted and future generations may not have the gravity of what happened and 2. If the survivors of the Holocaust die, future generations will not know what really happened no. I thought this second concern was ridiculous and I told them I thought they didn't have to worry because there is a lot of literature out there and there will always be people who would like to watch movies like myself. The murder of 6 million people by a very bad man will never be forgotten. I write this last paragraph because they charged me to tell others about my experience that day.
