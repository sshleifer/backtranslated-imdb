I think I'm coming to the party late. I just saw this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I didn't know it existed and was fully prepared to watch the 1963 movie version when I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I played Albert a long time ago and I am thinking of an amateur show of the show because I remember being so much fun to do. I wasn't impressed with this newer version. It just wasn't enough fun. It wasn't colorful. It lacked the exuberance of youth. The lighting was bad. Nobody saw it. It is not a state of mind, it is bright and higher. The lighting decision was a poor creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of errors. I have no sense in this version. The lighting was terrible and it dipped the overall performance. The dance numbers were also anemic. We have music videos today. At least, the dance numbers should have measured some of the best of them, or some of the best of Broadway. The choreographer slept on the wheel. </p> <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were very talented, there were definitely decisive choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin artists out there, it would no longer be correct to cast one of them into the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African American, nice and talented, but badly decisive. Jason Alexander's attempt was amazing, he always does intelligent work, but he just wasn't Albert. He was overlooked and it seems to most people who see this version. <br /> <br /> The medium of film is not the medium of stage. There must be translation from one medium to another. The exuberance and flash of the stage music must be filmed to film. There is no merit to a stage script when filmed. The spirit, the essence of the production must be brought out. For me, the 1963 film production of Bye Bye Birdy was bright and lively, while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as dark as the dance numbers. It was an unfortunate waste of many very talented people.
