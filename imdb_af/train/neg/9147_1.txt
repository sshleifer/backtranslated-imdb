I don't have an idea that could have made it on Earth or beyond, Sam Mraovich believes it would be a worthy project to undertake. Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, I see no reason why it shouldn't be at # 1 at bottom 100. For though I didn't see SuperBabies for example: Baby Geniuses 2 (# 5 at the time of this publication), I would dare guess that the movie is much better than this oozing wound, because even in his folly Baby Geniuses 2 was made professional . In contrast, everything, and I mean everything, in this movie is completely unprofessional. <br /> <br /> The film is meant to be an attack on Christian Law's alleged bigotry and hatred of gays. And I emphasize "mean." Not only is it completely and completely failed, it also causes an ugly scar. Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple's struggle against a society that is largely opposed to it, it creates weary, curved stereotypes of every party involved. Ben and Arthur, the namesake couple, are portrayed as two rough, sex-enhanced and hopelessly romantic cardboard cuttings that marry when the laws change so they can do it. It meets the opposition of Ben's brother Victor, a Christian minister who, like all Christians (like this movie we believe), is loud, greedy, stupid, and violent. He tried to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations kicked him out of the ministry. Just like in real life. And if you think it's terrible (that is), you haven't seen it. <br /> <br /> The actors (?) succeed in completely destroying any credibility in this movie by saying their lines as having a YouTube home comedy video. But not even Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker, as there will still be talk of the totally unbeaten and laughing dialogue that takes every minute of the movie. Each scene has at least one uncomfortable or wrong quote. For example, in one scene Victor tries to complain that he cannot have cousins ​​or cousins ​​because of his brother's homosexuality. But instead of clearly depicting this idea, he spits out the stupid, completely confusing, sounding line: "You know what I'm never going to have cousins ​​or cousins, okay, because you're so F *** ED UP! "<br /> <br /> The complete lack of production values ​​is even clearer. Yes, I know it's not The Dark Knight, but even amateur filmmakers need to know the basics of special effects and editing. For example, six spots of red cake dye are not sufficient for realistic bullet wounds. People do not count between a room over a room. And objects don't fall when it's shot! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on Ben & Arthur. I don't care if you're 7, 17 or 107. It doesn't matter to me if you're gay, straight, bi or undecided. I don't mind if you're just "curious." I don't care what pathetic reason you might be tempted to buy this mishap. Stay away, far away. This film's only reasoning quality is its ability to be used as a Frisbee.
