How sad there is no option to place a point lower than 1. I watched this piece of nonsense and could hardly believe what I was watching. Every part of the movie was terrible. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, just everything. I actually laughed myself at several points in the film. I especially loved the little bit, where our hero ran through the hospital in soft focus slow motion, knocking the clipboard out of the nurse's hand, because ............. well. Just because. Product placement? Crucifix (crucifix) everywhere. If you are satisfied with a Christian conviction and very easy, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get out.
