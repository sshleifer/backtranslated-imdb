Never see this movie. <br /> <br /> It is trying to be a ghost on scifi / thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s, but all that does well makes you very bad wish you looked at one of them and not that. <br /> <br /> It's very lame. A spoof should have an aspect that has a bit of top quality. This movie does not have such an aspect. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but just don't look.
