Problems with these types of movies are that dozens of them are made every year. Fortunately for use, only a handful of theaters are released, while the others are pushed straight to video or TV, like this movie. <br /> <br /> The foremost problem of this movie is truly the originality. It is one of those movies that uses the "Hard" formula of a difficult but disturbing man in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, it is a character played by Casper Van Dien, who works for a security agency that tests thorough testing procedures for companies and individuals. In this case he is sent to a ship, which is of course hijacked. You can watch this movie as a mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One" and the film doesn't even try to hide that those two movies are probably the biggest source of "inspiration". So really, you can't consider this movie as an original. It uses all the clich√©s from the book and this movie really does not offer any surprises or anything that looks distant from something original. <br /> <br /> As you can expect from a movie like this, it has a very bad writing. Or rather, it contains a lot of lazy writing. As I said before, the movie has nothing original, but the actual story itself contains elements that are far from likely and just fair. I mean, hijacking a big ship with just about 8 guys, half of which only carry a few guns and then asking for a ransom of 'only' 10 million dollars, for a ship worth about 10 times, is the amount itself is quite ridiculous. How will they even divide that money? Every person gets just over a million or something? It's hardly profitable for such a big and risky business. And then there's the case to take the passengers hostage. Somehow they manage to take all the passengers on the big ship's hostage and they manage to put them in one room, with just one man with his pistol, which he can't even fix it . You never see more than 30 hostages, as if it were all the people who were on board at the time. Also, when the Van Dien character is looking for his son and vice versa, it doesn't matter which room they run on the giant ship, but always bump them into each other immediately. Just a few examples of lazy writing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is an action movie, so the story becomes secondary. But then it is not as if this movie contains any good action. Half of the actors seem to have never had a weapon and the movie is filled with a few low movements. It gets really nice on points. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie does not contain the best actors, although I have to say that Casper Van Dien is not really a bad "action hero" and actor, as far away from the genre and the B film track. involved. However, he also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise; No matter how old he is, he just never seems convincing enough to be the father of a teenager. Van Dien started out as a promising new young actor, but as a movie in this movie, it doesn't really help his career. He is probably able to make something better, but he is never really given the right opportunity to show it. All the other actors also do a fair job, but their characters are just as formative that they never really get interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, it's not the worst genre movie I've ever seen, but it's also ain It's not the original or memorable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
