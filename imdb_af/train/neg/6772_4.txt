So, when Herbie made his first appearance, I was totally happy to watch Dean Jones Cup away. I just wanted to entertain for a few hours and eat too much buttered popcorn. Now, unfortunately, I have expectations of a wonderful / wonderful story when I watch a movie, if I'm not on any kind of medicine. And this is another great film for the medication. There is no big laugh, no complex plot lines, no difficult turns. Herbie Fully Loaded is ideal for the full load. <br /> <br /> It was the first time I saw La Lohan on the screen, because she replaced places with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought it was excellent) I can't say I'm really impressed this time was not. Apart from her constantly changing and distracting unnatural hair color, she just didn't pull like the child next door who spent a lifetime hanging around the racers. Her need for speed was not consistently portrayed in the movie - perhaps it was elsewhere - she looked older than her part and was always looking for something (a party designer had a new place to spend money). I couldn't see any chemistry with Justin Long; those novels were at best compulsory. The only time Lindsay got engaged was when she was talking to Matt Dillon, what I thought was really over as an evil bad Guy Trip Murphy. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Herbie again, and I loved film intro with old movie material. If Disney came out with 53 gems with a few Motor, I might just have behaved just to be faithful. His new feature (?) Was a bit contradictory (does he send the manager's thoughts? Is he now skateboard?), But whatever. We all knew how it was going to end, but I wish he had ended up with a little less dull than Maggie. And my head is still hurt from that lesson Maggie and our viewers have been hammering home. <br /> <br /> What made the movie worthwhile? Keep the old Herbie in a real story with a real plot - at least, Herbie is as good as Lassie - but it obviously requires too much. Why does Disney always go back to the same things as "Herbie Goes Bananas" and "the computer that wears tennis shoes" when it comes to innovation? <br /> <br /> I'm sure it was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations. For the rest of us .... it's for when you have the flu and just can't use the rear window tension.
