Possible Spoilers, maybe. I have to say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever made. First, the movie was made during the highlight of Disney's successor. It was created around the same time as "The Little Mermaid II", "The Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II", all of which were disservices to their original movie classics. (Disney also made "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classic in the first place.) Let me go and say I'm " a keen supporter of good Disney movies, and I absolutely love the original Disney "Cinderella". However, the successor of "Cinderella" was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so much different from the original girl I grew up to watch. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had many moments from the past with the current phrase like, "I'm going to do this banquet away!" you, the new Cinderella (as I called her lovingly) say, "Ewww!" This is the anti-Cinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the successor is Anastasia, one of the step soldiers, good! The gate? Why? They made everything look like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just terrible family members for poor Anastasia. My question to the world: Did people at Disney watch the original "Cinderella" when they made this successor? Well, it certainly doesn't look like that. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as offensive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I'm all for salvation and forgiveness, but there was no reason for salvation for Anastasia in this movie. In the first one, Anastasia was angry. In the second one she is good. One just can't leave such a story. I hope Disney realizes that this movie, including movies, is the name of Walt Disney. Perhaps, now that Michael Eisner is gone, things around the House of Mouse begin to form.
