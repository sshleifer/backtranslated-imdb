Criminal Insane 2 is included on the new DVD of Satan's Black Faith / Criminal Insane, which is also a good thing, because if I saw a movie and know there is a successor (especially something that is so unclear) , I'm always curious. I have now satisfied my curiosity and will never see it again. Most of CI2 is nothing but flashbacks for CI, and footage from Ethel asleep, remember good memories, I think. Thanks to Proposition 13, she was released from the Napa State (wondering if she's playing The Cramps while she was there?) And being sent to a halfway home by an old old lady taking Ethel immediately to call 'grandmother'. It's all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are quite pathetic, and it's even complete with a few "roles". Of course, Ethel does her thing, that is to send someone between her and food, especially the guy who gives evidence of one of her actions and radiates her dessert. You also have to wonder about a halfway house for murderers with a large drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. Guess that's all a matter of wrong confidence. If you like or don't like Criminally Insane, it's not good to see it, except for curiosity. One wonders why the makers of this even bothered. 2 out of 10.
