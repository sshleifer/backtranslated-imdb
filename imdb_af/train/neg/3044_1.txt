It's kind of a strange movie, as Santa Claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against Satan and his followers ... but that's pretty good. <br /> <br /> It has some real laughs. Although all of them are deliberate, it's definitely debatable. This movie is not good, but I can say I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie about "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "The Santa Clause" with Tim Allen.
