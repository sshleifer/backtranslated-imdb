"Diary of Sex Addict" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama on sexual compulsiveness. Probably a movie marketing scam, this movie is an attractive shoot with a good throw and a little different going for it. Bottom line, "Diary ..." we believe our sex addict character has the dumbest woman in the world, a stable babies on the side who can do nothing better than drop their underpants for him. no work despite a restaurateur. At best, this movie can be good drama. At the worst, cheap soft spot. "Diary ..." is not and anywhere in between. This one is for the dumpster. (D)
