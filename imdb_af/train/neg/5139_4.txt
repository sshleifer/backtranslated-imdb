Many of the horror fans look like scarecrows, so I won't be very popular to say I've found it very boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag so much. I think the biggest problem is that it's all in the dark. Sometimes horror movies can work in the dark (like Humongous), but scarecrows are in the dark for the whole movie. Much of the time it's hard to figure out what actually happens, and although some of the scarecrows were spectacular, it was hard to even see. If a little more lighting was used, it might have been better. <br /> <br /> There aren't many movies that include killer scarecrows, except Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend Scarecrows any day.
