Holy, freaking God, all-freaking-mighty. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way ... The character activity is the poorest thing I've seen for some time. This movie was more related to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the movie appeared on a terrible green screen. My favorite part was when they were in the wagon, and you can say there is no horse. They flee from alien monsters, and go about the same speed as a quick jog. Then switch it with a ridiculous CG horse to a far shot. And the CG in general appears to be subparity after 1992's Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, really come. It was like a horrible episode of Hercules, just without Kevin Sorbo there to save the day. Worst. Movie. Ever.
