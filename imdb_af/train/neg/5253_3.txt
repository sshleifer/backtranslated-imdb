The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for "Vrou". I don't know if it was intentional or not, but certainly had giggles from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year when it was shown. <br /> <br /> But these were the only giggles the movie has. Not that it was for giggles, it's a terrible movie for heaven's sake! A horrible movie in more than one sense. It is a pity that such a premonition has been wasted with terrible, unbearable moments for the viewer (certainly not for the dull heart!)! And it wasn't even necessary to show all the things shown. I don't even have a moral obligation (because movies don't really have such a task or function). Discussion of what is shown here, but it is a new layer on the whole "torture movement" that has grown in recent years!
