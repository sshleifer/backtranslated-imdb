** HERE'S SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The government continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now UniSol. The soldiers are now stronger and can do more damage than before. However, the government is slowing down, the project is under threat and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all is under threat. He therefore takes steps to ensure his own safety. He activates and controls the UniSols and begins to die. The only one they can stop is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. Choreographic battles. The story is bad and soon drowns in all the battles. Whatever happens and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie it is not nice to watch a fight where you know one part is indestructible. Usually you are pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to feel the battles between two somewhat equal fighters. Not where one is indestructible and cannot lose. Then the battles just become a tool to stretch time. You wait for the final battle when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable enemies. To further reduce my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how many women there are cut women there. Well, there aren't that many of them, because the characters are the most men (there is at least one UniSol woman both), but almost every woman is shown unnecessarily at least once. The female leaders come here, but we also go through a strip club (not to use a computer) with much more dedicated women. These moments give nothing to the story and are just there to satisfy the adolescent-wise male audience. <br /> <br /> Finally, boring battles. No more, no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
