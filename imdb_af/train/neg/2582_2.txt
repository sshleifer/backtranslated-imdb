Just finished with American Pie: Beta House and I have to say, it was such a garbage stack of shit. The first 3 American roads were hilarious, the last 3 being a joke and not called the American Cake. <br /> <br /> As you came out of the title of the movie Beta House, it is about a brotherhood, freshman, girls and, most original part of them all, fall in love. Of course, the man who has his way with the chicks is Stifler, who, with his friends, is trying to complete another apparent impossible task. It was unrealistic and super fake. It's just really predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college struggle to see who gets the whole thing (something). Summary: horrible play + dull writing + wrong use of the American Pie franchise = total waste! This movie is unbearable. I give it a two out of ten, although most of it sucked, there were lots of nudity and pretty girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
