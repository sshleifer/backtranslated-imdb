I almost burst into tears and watch this movie. Not from laughter, but from the memories of a good Rodney Dangerfield movie. Candyshack was his first and stole the movie, Easy Money had him at its best, and Back To School is by far an 80's classic masterpiece. Then there were ladybugs and that's when it started to show. Poor Rodney has grown old (Meet Wally Sparks was a slight step out of Ladybugs, but not much said). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Women, Rodney Monte (a name he must love because it was his name in Easy Money). He is a rich man, who is not always a man, and is not married as she does. Well, he inherits a large piece of land and since the land was managed by the Amish, he inherits 5 women. It sounds like a good idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is ALL. The writing is so poor that Rodney wants to see her one linen in the camera and all the characters have nothing to do. The movie looks like it was shot on video with some very poor stunt series that of course are not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who looks like he's dying to say the F word (what he needs since the movie R, but plays as if it's PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2 minute como. Don't get me wrong, sometimes I laughed at some of Rodney's jokes, but the poor man gets too old and too slow. We can see his jokes coming from miles. And the movie is also being computerized. Thanks to the terrible 1990s, the 70's and 80's Rodney just didn't work anymore.
