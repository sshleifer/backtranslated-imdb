Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately I didn't rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it is not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the makers of this movie showed Jeffry Dahmer's human side. Are you joking? The man has given new meaning to the term "finger lickin 'good"! And with all the flashes and prosperity I had trouble following the story. Overall, Jeremy Renner's actions weren't bad. You can catch him in "S.W.A.T", in which he plays an unhappy ex-cop. Anyway, I would rate it as a 1/10. It only has a 1 because of Renner's so-so performance. There are many books and TV documentaries that offer a much better job of covering Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this one.
