I didn't see this movie, but I decided to respond in any case, mostly because the memory of the aversion was burned so intensely in my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY wasn't a prize to start with but at least had the distinctions of 1) a Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Featured Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens 3) Was a relatively painless way to blow an hour away and half the time. <br /> <br /> In comparison, the 1994 version comes as little as a vanity for the then red hot Alec Baldwin and his divorced wife, Kim Basinger, will soon be divorced. McQueen and his then wife, Allie McBride, also split soon after their release of the movie and one can see the picture of Baldwins with their spouse. They ask who is the stupid idea of ​​making this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it and get out of the way - Alec Baldwin was never and never will be close to the Cooler King. And one of the reasons why these remakes have made me so annoyed is the perceived arrogance on Baldwin's part to suppose to challenge our remembrance of Steve McQueen. As someone else points out, Peckinpah's 1972 film vision was a satire piece intended to form some of the parody of the action / adventure genre. In contrast, Baldwin, Bassinger & Company, seems to be trying to eradicate a more serious scene, with only Michael Madsen and James Woods' clever unfounded villainous characters coming as real people. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely mean-spirited and irreconcilable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. One viewing was more than enough, not just because it had nothing new to offer, but because of how it was made. Peckinpah's movie was actually an attractive entertainment that had an exciting mood, where this version is a slogan that lasts too long to make little or nothing. There is no artistic urgency for his existence and some of the most uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the movie difficult to enjoy. <br /> <br /> So, I don't know, it was probably one of the movies that helped set up the wave of useless, artistic vapid big budget concepts that were around a then-name actor / actress. itself is not a very good thing. I'd rather always see a filmmaker trying to at least create a new movie idea and flatten it with something original. This movie just let me out my eyebrows and it seems that over the past 15 years since his release, Baldwin has become widely known as one of the greatest jerks in Hollywood. Thanks for the "Team America" ​​to put him in his place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
