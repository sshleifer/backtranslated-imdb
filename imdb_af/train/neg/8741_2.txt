Five minutes in this movie you realize you've seen it before. This is ROOM ROOM. It is firm. And this is the deputy of the demons. And there are NO new elements here. Except for the all-to-clear Bill Gates allegory. Conpsiracies are always good things for making movies, but why should they be so extreme? Boiler room is a good movie because it looks realistic for a while. In Antitrust everything is wrong. For example, how realistic is your boss paying a scammer to be your girlfriend to make you harder and control you? I give it 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.
