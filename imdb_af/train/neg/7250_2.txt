After reading the other reviews for this movie, I believe the high markers are likely to be paid, because the movie I saw was absolutely dire, with woodworking, fearless essays, and pouring out the predictable direction. One of the few pluses has been the beautiful scenery, as this film offers a beautiful view with excellent views and dramatic air and wide open prairies. Unfortunately, when the most memorable thing in a movie is the movie behind the actors, it must be a warning sign about the quality of the movie, all that is a thorough, uninspired addition to the Western genre, even against the many. reasonable price available on DVD is best to avoid.
