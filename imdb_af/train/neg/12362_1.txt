I saw this movie in New York City. The next morning I waited for a bus, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It rained and didn't want to wait at the PORT AUTHORTY. So I went across the street and saw the worst movie of my life. It was so bad that I decided to stay and see the whole movie. I haven't seen anything else yet. The year was 69, so I call crazy. I just stayed because I couldn't believe it .........
