There are so many wrong statements in this so-called "documentary" that I shouted to myself on television. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel may be able to produce a flashy DVD, but unfortunately he is unable to watch. on the science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> He trusts that it is inaccurate, does not tell the full story, or the old favorite "government is always for us" inside, and people believe what is being told and not the accuracy or details behind check the claims. <br /> <br /> Also, its "exclusive" or "unedited" footage is freely available on the internet from various websites. <br /> <br /> Further reading on the circumstances of the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to interview and used creative editing of the responses to promote his own opinions. <br /> <br /> All the claims made by Mr Sibrel about "inaccuracies", "bugs" or "whistleblowers" in the Apollo program are being condemned. <br /> <br /> How do I get back those 40-minute minutes of my life?
