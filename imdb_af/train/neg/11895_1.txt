Oh my God, how did hell happen here? I'm not going to say it again, but what kind of backward movie is it? The double in this is the worst of the double in King Kong vs Godzilla, Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy. It's from a villain named Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a gorilla robot that has the same strength as King Kong, but when this robot breaks, he builds another and then tries to kidnap Kong. When he does this (that is when Linda Miller gets annoying) he makes his slave Kong, but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes. Then Dr. Who sends the robot to him. <br /> <br /> Later, when I watched the movie, I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started groaning. If I sat through the misery to watch the DVD while I was playing, I hoped the madness in the movie would end up in battle. The end must be a very bad one, because they could have shown Kong again on his island to fight dinosaurs again. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do ... beware of the disappointment you will receive.
