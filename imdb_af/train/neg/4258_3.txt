I'd give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it were at least timely. When I first saw it, it was just what you could wait for the work not based on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or rather idiotic habits of our (Kazakhstan) government. It is a pity, because 'Qazaqfil'm shot movies when it was not honored by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually run by him. The movies include "Konec Atamana", "Kyz Zhibek" or even "Aldar Kose". But after the death of Mr Aimanov, the production of quality films has decreased dramatically in 10 years. There were very few films produced. But in the late 1980s, 'Assa' was shot, it was a film about the first organized crime groups in the big country. One year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another movie with co-star of the same actor / singer V.Tsoy, then he was already a Soviet / Russian rock legend. The movie called Igla (the needle or something) was completely new, someone called that period as a resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave. Unfortunately, we do not currently have a quality movie, our directors shoot movies about French and Japanese financial support. So, movies aren't for the public, but for the writers' professional critics, some of them take a prize at international author movie festivals, but there are a few of them becoming a business asset product ... And back to our nomads . Such movies are usually unpopular because of great aspects. The same effect was with Nikita Mikhalkov's "Sibirski Cyrilnik" on Russian Tsar, which was also shot at parities with foreign partners, I think they were French or maybe British. Nobdy likes it, even in the Russian public, as a main subject of comedy and comedy shows such as "KVN". IMHO
