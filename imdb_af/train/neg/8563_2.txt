This is what the title of this thread says. The only impression I got was that Marlee Matlin's character was always angry, so cynical and so pathetic. Her character's first date with William Hurt's character where their dance was stupid. All in all, I tried to complete the movie four times, and from four times I fell asleep. I will continue to watch that movie with one intention ... to beat my problem with insomnia, because all I do is sleep. Sweet dream.
