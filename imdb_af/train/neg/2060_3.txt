A suppressed housewife (an annoying lashing Angie Dickinson, whose body is double-treated / upset with extreme proximity to her delicate) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to tackle. It immediately leads to a series of murders that will soon involve a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, obviously I'm wrong if SHE brings home $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you're going to watch De Palma rip off (excuse me, encourage him) Hitchcock, see "Sisters" instead. "Dressed to Kill", while being loaded with style and technical skills, is one of the most peculiar spectators I had the dissatisfaction with going through. That plot is absurd and tired. It does contain some surprisingly effective joggers and nasty graphic murders that should please any horror fan, as long as they can get past the silly story line, it had to be dated even in 1980.
