I am an unbeatable skeptical and agnostic and therefore expected to enjoy this movie. However, after watching it, I honestly believe I could make a better documentary myself. The arguments show that there are only four faulty sources (despite being listed in the credits on IMDb, I haven't seen Richard Dawkins anywhere). It is put together with the cowardly amateurish computer effects, and it does not make the slightest effort to remain impartial. The narrative is penetrated throughout with a tremendous, almost adolescent anti-Christian sentiment that destroys any possibility that the film can actually change someone's mind instead of just preaching to the choir (that is, I). Although there is an interesting discussion of Jesus' historicity, the movie strikes an unbearable snake when it comes to living heavily on the Christian school, which the director attended as a child, an institution that apparently scares him psychologically, as it obsess him to this day. <br /> <br /> Of course, although TGWWT had a low budget, there was another opportunity to comment intelligently on the highly dubious roots of Christianity. There is certainly a lack of skeptical thought about religious documentary programs on the market, and this film could have helped fill the gap. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which is ultimately some therapeutic exercise for him. It is too bad that his Christian education has traumatized him, but he does not have to submit an audience to his coping mechanism.
