This movie is nothing like "Office Space" except in the basics. Office space was hilarious. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, as I didn't laugh at the whole movie once. Mr. Cornbluth's self-sufficient tirades are becoming more irritating than Jason Jason's in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or view it at someone else's home so you can leave as needed.
