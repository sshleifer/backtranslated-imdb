...... in a horror movie that is. Well first, let's start with Kate. Her main goals are to be laid by George Clooney, and look good and last, but not least, all screw. Must love her. She had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish this sieko, but ... instead she ran. I mean she didn't want to bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did, it was too late. I mean the man tried to rape her. I can't come to these movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean who honestly has any sympathy for a man who switches off everyone she met in a night. The movie is in progress. And as a result, all its credibility is lost.
