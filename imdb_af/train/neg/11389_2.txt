If you like movies that crawled with a small plot outline with kinky sex, this movie is for you. On the positive side, the main actor / actress (newcomer transsexual) has an interesting screen presence, but not enough to add too much more than a slightly interesting movie. In essence, this movie is about 3 social outcasts (transsexual prostitute, male hustler and Russian, gay immigrant) who somehow developed a connection. Why it's not clear. We are expected to accept these misfits, the core of basic honest people who have the ability to love while bumping their bodies down the street. Right !! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her ninety something sugar daddy! The filmmaker shows a keen, unpleasant side of life, while we want us to believe it, all these severely damaged people are really normal to the extent that they have a crew that helps them through life. Quite a fantasy, but unfortunately it is portrayed here as a real look at life on the wild side. In total, no plot, no truth and no real reason to spend much time here. Unless of course you just want to enjoy the kink !!!
