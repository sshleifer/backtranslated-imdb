I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face that embellished movies with typical characters of stupid dominee, romantic interest or girlfriend. But everything changed when she won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie LA Confidential, and I think I was not the only one surprised by her solid performance. But after that, her career did not follow the ideal path. Certainly, the prestige she won, thanks to that movie, made her. to participate in moderately sought-after movies (such as People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we never saw her again on a significant character. The movie while she was out, made nothing to put her on the situation; And it's not just that her character is too nice, but also that the movie is really crappy. The script from this movie cannot be hollow and basic. However, Basinger convinces her character, which makes this poor movie a few points. This movie is full of claws and generic villains. The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons, but mainly because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone. The end of this movie is extremely ridiculous. I do not recommend while she was out. This film connects the main sins to be boring.
