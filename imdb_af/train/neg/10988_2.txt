If I had never read the book, I would have said it was a good movie. BUT I read the book. Who ever destroyed the author's storyline. There are so many changes that it wasn't really worth the title. Character changes, plot changes, timeline changes ... <br /> <br /> First, who was Henry and the investigator? They weren't in the story. Henry had something to do with Mitch's persona, but Mitch wasn't a policeman. No, you did it like that, Roz, helped his body "sink" and use it as Zenia's blackmail against Roz. The real so-called blackmail was Roz, thought Zenia had slept with her son and wanted her to get away. Her son was also sent out of jail for hiding from his mother. Her son was not actually mentioned in the story. I also don't believe his beloved, Roz's secretary. <br /> <br /> Tony and West were not in the beginning together. He was actually at Zenia first while he was in college. The black-colored apartment was their idea, Tony just went to visit. This is where Zenia and Tony meet, become quick friends. Tony hides her love for Wes. When Zenia left, with Tony's cash, West and Tony came along. Eventually, at some point West left Tony for Zenia for a short time. Just to be broken again. Then go back to Tony. Zenia's extortion for Tony was that Tony wrote a script for Zenia. She was a college professor and didn't want to allow it. I would say the character Tony played was wonderful. <br /> <br /> Charis character was a blonde, not that it really mattered. Zenia didn't hurt her to have cancer while Augusta was alive. No, she was there when Charis had a lover called Billy. Augusta's father, he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam War. Eventually, Charis took care of Zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal for months. Zenia and Billy have a relationship right below Charis's nose while caring for both of them. Then Zenia turns to Billy and goes with him to the ferry. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her tho. Charis also had a split personality, Karen was her real name. <br /> <br /> Zenia didn't die to be cut into pieces. She had fallen or possibly pushed (we never really knew) off the balcony and landed in a fountain. She had almost pure heroin in her blood and it was likely that she had some who didn't know and fell off. She also died of cancer immediately. <br /> <br /> It didn't show any of the children's memories or anything the characters knew about the reader. The book is striped to its bare bones. Then it gets back into someone else's vision. Why can't you just write your own story in the light of what you've made. That was different enough, and I'm sure could be made more.
