It's just as old, "If I can't get the funding for my project, I'll inject myself" monster film. There is nothing new here. It's much like the Jeff Goldblum Fly movie. The man manages some common sense, but ultimately gives the consequences of his experiments. The acting is pretty bad. There are people who act across the road to endanger their lives without a clear reason. The man goes back to the lab that he has forbidden to enter. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. He is welcome, but he looks like a lot of trouble. It's just a very big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaurus suit looks as if it came to the Star Trek convention.
