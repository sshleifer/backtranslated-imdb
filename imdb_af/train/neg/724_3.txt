The concept for Sarafina seems to be a good one, apart from the musical perspective. It seeks to combine exciting African music with a story describing the horrific conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time of the film. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too scary and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between cheers and terror. If it were just a drama that reflected these conditions, it might be a good movie, but the scenes of schoolchildren shot by soldiers are not right next to the songs. <br /> <br /> Apart from the poor point of view, the play is also not the best, Goldberg also gives a mediocre performance, just like the rest of the role. Overall a disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
