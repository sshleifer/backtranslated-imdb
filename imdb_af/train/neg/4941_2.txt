I didn't really think of the Geico commercials the first 50 of the times I saw them and even found that they were a little furious and amusing, but serious! This is the BEST thing these people can do? This show sucks! It is vague and feels like watching an episode of "The Office" with the characters disguised as cavemen (I know many of you will hate me to say so, but "The Office" just doesn't do it for me) . Okay, I get it: we have the poor slob, just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a brave boss who hates him; the pseudo-intellectuals who really only have a scarce-functional intellect; and the dopey who just want to be accepted, but so what !!! I worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as I do on TV ... why do I want to waste another 1/336 of my week and see more of those nominations? Please call your parents and ask them if they have dropped you on your mind if you think so, you deceive yourself into believing it is entertaining.
