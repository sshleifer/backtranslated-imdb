"Raw Force" is like an ultra-sleazy and twisted version of Love Boat, with additional Kung Fu battles, demented cannibalist monks, white slave trades, energetic zombies and a host of turbulent appearances. No wonder this movie was included in the recently released "Grindhouse Experience 20 movie box set". It has everything that exploits fanatics, blends into a totally incoherent and seemingly improvised writing! The production values ​​are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pathetic, but the cost of free violence and sex can hardly be described. The film is known as Warriors Island in a tropical sunny spot, where a gang of monks raises the dead for no apparent reason than to change them into Kung Fu fighters. The monks also buy sexy slaves from a cunning Hitler-style businessman, presumably because the women's flesh provides them with the necessary powers to raise their zombie army. Tourists on a passing ship, including three martial arts, a female LA police spokesman and a lot of excellent but dull women, are attacked by Hitler's goons because they are planning an outing to Warriors Island. Their lifeboat pushes the island anyway, and the monks challenge the survivors to a battle test with their zombies. Okay, how does this sound like a crazy midnight horror movie? It's not over yet, because "Raw Force" also has piranhas, wild boat organs, Cameron Mitchell, in another embarrassment of the lead and 70's exploitation duke Camille Keaton in a totally insignificant como look. There is a lot of realization, including ax killing and chopping, hammy jokes and bad taste romance. The rubbish value of this movie will literally leave you speechless. Of course, the background of evil monks remains inexplicable and is not even punished for their dubious hobbies. Perhaps that is why the movie stops with "To continue" instead of "The End". The successor never came, unless it is so obscure IMDb, it's not even a list.
