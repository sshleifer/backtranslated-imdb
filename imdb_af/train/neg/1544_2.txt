I think I laughed twice. The line where the main character says something about the streets. And then I forget the other time I laughed. It was probably in the beginning. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the thinnest movies. Do not discover Hollywood that this kind of humor is humiliating and sad, really. You can just insult yourself so many times. <br /> <br /> 2/10
