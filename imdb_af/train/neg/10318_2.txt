Who likes terrible "comedy" like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two kinds of people I can think of who they see are: One, Muslim and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group so excited is a show about Muslims that doesn't even matter if the show is good . or funny at all (which is not). Two, old people and people whose idea of ​​the comedy is incredibly predictable, poorly written, old jokes. <br /> <br /> CBC should really look at what they do and who they've heard. If they just write comedy for real old people, think what will happen, their hearing will die soon and they won't hear. Will I be curious who even writes for this show? Do you think it's actually Muslims, or hip, funny young people? No, I know it's old white guys writing the same appearances for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> If you look at the CBC, there are Comedy shows, Air Farce was just just getting off the air (thanks!), but we still have lame ducks like This Hour having 22 minutes and Rick Mercer for which we pay, not to mention this poor excuse for the comedy Little Mosque on the Prairie. It's supposed to be offensive and funny? Only the CBC would think that this lama show is quirky or funny. Shame on the CBC for wasting our tax dollars on shows just a few people will bother to watch.
