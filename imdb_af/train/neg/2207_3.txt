Hammerhead is a combination of crazy scientific and killer shark movie genres. In a bit of casting, Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned crazy scientist who develops a human / hammerhead shark creature. Bizarre, this being is actually his son, whom he has changed in this monster to prevent him from dying of cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of associates are invited to the scientist's private island. They are eventually used as shark bait or shark tailor. For some unknown reasons, the head of IT was brought along as part of the team. Who knows why? Fortunately, he turns out to be an inventive, rather overweight, Ramboesque hero. I work on the assumption that he has learned how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day-work in one-line support. An ordinary day for this IT man probably involves someone's network connection, followed by a call for the attempt to damage the culprits. Or perhaps a call to find someone's computer should be scheduled between physical confrontations with land-based human shark hybrids? Anyway, he is wonderful and saves the day. He even gets the girl. <br /> <br /> The shark man is a slightly lame creation, but well, I think of the effects in general in this movie. And the movie moves on a decent fit. Of course, this is completely hokum, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts a man has experienced has turned into a land-based killer fish, then you really have nobody else than to blame yourself. As it is, there are guns, gore, girls and possibly even an explosive helicopter. It's rubbish, but not as bad as some might say.
