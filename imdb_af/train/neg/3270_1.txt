It is pleasant and fast. <br /> <br /> There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen. The most important thing, however, is that he acts very convincingly. It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to throw him. I quickly accepted him as a naive young country boy. <br /> <br /> While being the best performance, most of the others were also very encouraging. In particular, the interaction between the policemen was natural and balanced and worked very well. <br /> <br /> It's only about 45 minutes, so the plot isn't complex. More key is the style of the whole thing. It's very smooth and lively, and the background is atmospheric, especially since all colors are rich. The gangland is identifiable by foreign audiences, but still clearly manages Australia.
