This thing is terrible. The Ben Affleck character is self-centered and pleasantly sadistic - punch-you-in-the-nose fratboy sadistic. And he is the romantic HERO! His cartoon character does not change from start to finish, but his money eventually allows him to buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If I were to be a socialist, I would surpass, but I'm not a socialist. br /> <br /> We capitalize a little Christmas magic as from time to time. It's not magic. I don't know what it is. It's just terrible. And this is a terrible waste of talent. O'Hara has been hysterically laughing since the late 70's. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all underutilized. If Ben was out of the equation, these people might have dreamed something fantastic.
