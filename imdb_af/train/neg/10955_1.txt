This is the story of two guys who got a copy of "Funky Monkey". To find it was strange when it found out that there were still posters for the movie at the local Cineplex Odeon. After seeing such classics as 'Every Way But Loose' and 'Project X', these two guys chose monkeys movies. These guys had a long drive while watching this movie. There was a monkey replaced by a stunt man when there was successive action. It was clear that the monkey was not trained in the school of Shakespeare acting. Maybe the monkey would be replaced with Ben Affleck. Maybe the guys thought. <br /> <br /> Maybe a strong sidekick will help like a Jackie Chan or maybe even Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, this movie had amazing martial artist and Jet Li Look-a-like Matthew Modine. While some may argue that Matthew Modine does not come near Jet Li, camera tricks prove he's every bit as good. When it becomes clear that an untrained chimpanzee can't handle the movie, the movie on Matthew Modine lends itself to being the right star. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there is a brave kid who is developing a bond with Modine and the monkey? Is there a possibility that the child learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie? Even Matthew Modine must be jealous of this one (because the pickup line "I'm the second violin for a monkey" doesn't seem to work with the ladies.) <br /> <br /> Shortly after I watched the movie the two guys received a call from Matthew Modine and said to them, "Seven days."
