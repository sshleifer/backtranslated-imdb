I watched it because it was available and I heard the Thumb movies were funny. This one was not. The majority of jokes were based on "Geranium's" body and in turn Kate Winslet's. I think it's very pathetic that the "Thumbtanic" creators are so low to make jabs with a respected actress, just because she (heaven forbids) doesn't starve himself into the model of ideal modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was the line that goes as follows: "Hey, I have a good idea! Let's swim over to this fast raft that no one else sees!" Thirty seconds of entertainment from a 26-minute movie doesn't detract from its value.
