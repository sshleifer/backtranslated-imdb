Don't waste your time on this movie. It could have been good, but the end was one of the lambs I have ever seen. I must seriously wonder how the people involved in making this movie could have looked at the final scene and thought, "Yes, now there is an end!" and hit themselves on the back. For me it was more like they just ran out of ideas! They built the final scenes to have a cool twist, but dropped the whole build up flat on his face. When the last shot became black and I started to hear the credit, I was in shock. I couldn't believe what I saw and that someone could even call it an end. The best thing anyone can do with this movie is the end of the text and gives it a little dust. Seriously, I really want to get someone who came up with that one in a room, face them and says - WTF ?? !!!!
