Warning: It contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). This one confirms the above limb. The second scene is the centerpiece of all the action. The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. Even more, other sites are being revealed because the story goes back and forth several times. And it made more frustrated. To compensate for the resulting lack of tension, we learn more and more about how unbalanced the characters are. And oh yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P. Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more ?, he is his wife, more ?, he plans to rob his father, more ?, his wife is deceived with his brother, more? Don't be sorry for his mother's death, any more? He's a serial killer, more? and so forth, there is not enough space to write here. I wonder how he can have a top job. And why didn't his wife leave him before. On the other hand, I enjoy much of the actor Hoffman's performances. <br /> <br /> Even here, PSH saves what is spent from my $ 7 for this absurdity. Why absurdity? Because it doesn't make sense, why should I care for the despicable characters? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic (at least pleasant) character. <br /> <br /> It's also a lot of sentimentality, for example, we have to care for the suffering of the widowed father without knowing the parents' life before the crime.
