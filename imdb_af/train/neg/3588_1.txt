Follow-up to 1973's "Walking Tall" continues with the real drama around Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, but this installment plays like a lame TV movie. Bo Svenson takes over the lead role of Joe Don Baker, but he is too soft for the part; He comes down as an embassy country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui finish with very little to do. I will give the movie a strong stance on its good intentions, but the script is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predictions and the production is cheapjack. In 1977 followed by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 by television film "A Real American Hero".
