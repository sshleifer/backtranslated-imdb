Despite its stereotypes, virtually no-name cast and a naturally low budget, I thought this movie was good; much better than I expected to be. I was initially skeptical - the idea of ​​a computer virus that can infect humans has become a little ridiculous. But in the end I thought the movie handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a bit clichéd). <br /> <br /> The role play was pretty good and the two leaders acted very seriously. I can't help thinking that Janine Turner is a bit of a Geena Davis look-a-like. Maybe it's just her face, or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie, but it always swam to me. <br /> <br /> While not a 'must', or a good movie by any standard, 'Fatal Error' is an entertaining movie that will keep you up to the end.
