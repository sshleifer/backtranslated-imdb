This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin has named himself the perfect just and fair prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film never showed any of the defense advice or tried to challenge the audience with a truly meaningful debate on how a country could You must conceal such a terrible road. <br /> <br /> Sure, no one wants to defend the Nazi stance, but THIS was the point of the Nuremberg trail! Four hours to simply sit on the Nazis. This has already been done! <br /> <br /> I really think Alec Baldwin should just stay with Kim Bassinger's husband. <br /> <br /> Just after the movie, TNT showed the 1959 movie, Trail in Nuremberg. . The movie is FAR superior.
