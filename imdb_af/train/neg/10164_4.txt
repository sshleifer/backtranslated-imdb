I just saw it during the Venice Film Festival and can't quite decide it. We were never allowed to get any of the characters close enough to care for them. Perhaps it was the point that we were all in a "bubble" of our own, but these people did not compel me to worry or be shocked at their various destinies. At a running time of just over an hour, the characters were not very well developed. A lot of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, kicks); And the slightly creepy baby dolls with surprisingly vibrant eyes, that made most characters for a life, were somehow more interesting than the living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow it never happened.
