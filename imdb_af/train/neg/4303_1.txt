Previous comments made me write. It says Muslims are blond and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment only says that this opinion can be made racist. Look, race is nothing. I am color blind. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. Approximately? I can add that I'm not 100% Serbia, I have some Austrian and Croatian blood in me, but what's the point. I am dark, half breed? Is that so? Anyone using racial prejudice with such bad intentions as Lantos (producer and director) is racist to me. Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman they are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yugoslavia. Hope they will be. does not show the suffering of Serbs or Croats in Sarayevo, terrible terrorism of street gangs, Muslim extremism. I add: Kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers, Muslims, Catholics or Orthodox who were killed in this war. This film is manipulation with our misery, false humanitarianism, which doesn't help at all. It helps Lantos fill his bags with more doings, okay!
