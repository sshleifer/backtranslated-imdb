When I first heard of "Down to Earth" I was very excited. I'm a big fan, a Chris Rock, he was especially hilaries in Dogma. But this movie was a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his performances, and the movie was just very badly targeted. <br /> <br /> First, Chris Rock. He plays the whole movie as an exciting comedy routine. Clearly, it works well in the screens where he is supposed to stand, but in the rest of the movie it is not. Even when talking to another character, he or she seems to be trying to make a lot of people laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they usually come up during the awnings (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're pretty much there to give Rock to talk to anyone. None of them stand out. <br /> <br /> The film is also poorly targeted. The movie basically has a one-joke plot: old white man acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, it could still have worked, and was rather funny. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white man. It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy who tells Chris Rock's jokes, but for most of the time we just see Chris Rock, so it's not nearly as funny. The few scenes where they decide to show us that the white man talking like Rock is actually hilarious. If he was shown more, the movie would have been much harder. <br /> <br /> Overall, a few moments of laughter could not make up for the fact that "Down to Earth" acted poorly and was poorly targeted. This one was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
