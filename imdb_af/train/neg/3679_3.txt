It's a Japanese movie, but there's quite a bit of English that is also spoken here. It's a beautiful movie, with beautiful visual arts, with the scenic beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, this was the only redeeming quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to watch a young woman for 90 percent of the film, because her "photo" husband is much older than he advertised he was? Granted, it can be a bummer ... but come over! <br /> <br /> Just in the last 10 minutes she does a face and loves him. Too many viewers were too late. We then fell asleep.
