First, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see a movie made for one of my favorite books, a Wrinkle in Time. However, this movie ruined the excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having had beads and glasses and considered very rude. In the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the "sporty type" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine suggested L'Engle Meg. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and had the way she felt when she was young. This is just one great example of how the book and film differ. So I would say, if you want to see it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a dedicated fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I suggest you overshoot this movie.
