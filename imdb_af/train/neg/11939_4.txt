Let me tell you something about this movie. I saw it twice. The first time I was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me. I really liked it. I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was so cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it a few days ago. It was terrible. Really. I don't know why I thought it was funny, but now ... I didn't laugh at all. There was nothing, even slightly entertaining. It was just stupid. The story was poor. The acting was nothing special. There are good actors in this movie, but the acting is still mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that this movie is racist. Really. Don't get me wrong, usually I don't complain about racism in movies. However, I saw people complain about the lack of black men in movies like 'The Shaolin Temple' or the fact that the only black man in 'The Street Fighter' is one of the bad guys or ... Whatever you get point . There are people everywhere racism. I wonder how they will respond to a movie like 'The Meteor Man'. Why? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no white people among the good guys. In fact, there is only one white man in the whole movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All the good guys are African Americans. Don't get me wrong, I don't care, the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green. What I don't mind is the fact that we can barely see a white in this movie. This is the only movie I've ever seen. It's just not realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie, which is the case with 'The Street Fighter', there is no problem. In Japan, most of the people are Asian. But if there is only one white man in an American movie, there is a kind of problem. In the US, most people are white. It's like filming a Japanese movie with a perfect white cast and only one Asian as a bad man. Just not really. <br /> <br /> That's it. I give the movie the rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I didn't have it as a child.
