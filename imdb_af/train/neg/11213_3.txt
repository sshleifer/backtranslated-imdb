OK ... I watch very bad movies. I am proud of the fact. many times there are a few jewels in the B-rated bombs. But this movie is one of the worst things I watched. I like a good horror movie ... but one with a plot of and sense of movement. The opening styles were pretty good. Good music and images. Then it goes from there. One of the main characters has a disability (Ringing in the Ore called Tinnitus). Now it will threaten to reveal his secret. They made it too much of the focus of the movie. So what did he have in his ears and he accidentally put an earplug where he shouldn't have been. No need to stop it. So this guy has a relationship with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table. Instead of letting everyone know about his relationship, he decides to shower the body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well, after seeing her sister over and over (like a zombie like a ghost) and even referring directly to the bodies, she finally finds her. Now the body is recovering and she goes out to deal with the only suspect who killed her. Bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan. Just as if she were her twins and met the man where the body was dumped. The idiot didn't even believe he killed her. So everything was revealed there and even though she had a gun .... somehow she controlled herself to squander. So the last feature of the movie is the "spirits" of her and her twins running out of the water. So you mean to tell me in this movie that the bad guy wins. And not one but two innocent people die. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie: images <br /> <br /> Bad things about the movie: music sound effects long and protracted plot of low grade that some not all actors
