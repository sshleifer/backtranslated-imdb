Cradle of Fear <br /> <br /> It's not a movie where complicated delicate little narrative nuances draw our attention. It's not a movie where the special effects are supposed to leave us. Whatever it is, is a piece of lofi grin that created the imagination, which was created in the eyes of director Alex Chandon, as a throw back to the spectacular '70s and' 80s 'br /> This is' a very visceral experience for 2 hours, where four plot lines are connected by very watery blood, reams of loosened body parts and inner, tied by a gut of revenge. <br /> <br /> The leader of such horrific violence is Dani Filth, lead singer of the metal band Cradle of Filth, who plays a role he intended to play. <br /> <br /> As others have said, there is nothing new about the will of the occult vengeance. In this particular context, a convicted sexual predator and killer, Kemper, the father of our devilish rebellious angel, forces his son on exact retaliation to those who are some related to the conviction of him in an insane asylum. <br /> <br /> What the Chandon provides, which must also be congratulated on the penny and editing of this piece, is the opportunity to release his sick mind. He seems to be in the idea of ​​splashing blood into the openings of those on the screen and in every corner and cliff that can be reached. We are also treated that the skull's drops are bruised, demonic rape and other associated images to detect those who welcome themselves. And for some of those who now follow these kind of movies, there's the strange sequence that you can think of, "Did I just see what I thought I was doing?", Of course, Pretty Woman, it's not. It reminds me of some of the gore festivals created from Italian horror about 20 to 30 years ago, and a number of other works where disgusting images left their mark, but not the context in which they were viewed. <br /> <story 4 of the set is particularly interesting, where the idea of ​​the obsession can eventually lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence by the "Sick Room", where the user is in control of how a life apart can be cut. Further acknowledgments should also go to a sounding soundtrack that enables Filth to practice his talents and effective use of drums and bass, often overlooked in film making as a viable form of supporting footage. . The use of the city of London as a backdrop of real people as opposed to movie standards also adds to the commando feel of the film. OK, classical may not be, but blood, gut, intestines, occult and demons are in a slightly perverse unproblematic way.
