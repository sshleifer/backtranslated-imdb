The acting wasn't great, the story was full of simple turns and transparent characters. It is about the consequences of the struggle between right-wing Flemish blockers on the one hand and the Moroccan people living in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other. Is this a political analysis? Is this a kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The movie is just not strong enough to answer both questions (this is also the director's questions). However, some of the screens can function as a kind of Ken Loach movie based in Antwerp. This city is after all the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish block party and struggles with many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a movie about this situation and it is unfortunately not successful. Yet it tells a story about a very real and complicated situation in contemporary Belgium. The few foreign viewers should enjoy it and realize it's not the real movie that matters, but the social lines behind what happened in the 2000s Belgium, a country of 10 million people. <br /> <br /> Dries Van Dongen
