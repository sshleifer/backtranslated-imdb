The action in this movie knocks Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar owns the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix with Spiderman and Superman. It's hilarious. Apart from the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy, I can't see anything positive in this movie. The story looks like the author told his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unreal that Anil Kapoor's long shot shooting with a shotgun is the least wrong by the director. Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie, there is no other Tashan. I'm sorry about this movie and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I'll give it a zero.
