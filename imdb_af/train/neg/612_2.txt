Going a far B movie, SCARECROW is one of those so bad that it's getting incredibly annoying. A Lonely-lost high school student who is constantly picked up by classmates and rejected by girls lands on his trailer's sex drive with a drunk redneck. He then drives the child to a nearby wheat field and kills him. Apparently, the children's soul has been transferred into a scarecrow who then goes to kill the bulls that have both tormented him and teachers. This scarecrow, besides having each one of its victims a funny one-liner, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on pavements in broad daylight. Also, why does he always look like a dotted look? Just like the two unnecessary successors that follow, it's not even worth a laugh.
