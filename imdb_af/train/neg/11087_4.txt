Second tier American leader Guy Madison plays a character whose fame precedes him in this Spaghetti Western? which emerges with very modest credentials as essential routine (though it contains a nice enough score). The plot offers a bit of light interest: the title also refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by rifles on a ranch ?? owned by the family of their runner-up, cavalry agent Madison. The latter's younger brothers and sisters are determined that the injured party, now in control, will lead them to the responsible gangbase; In the end, does the identity of any mystery man prove to be a surprise? and both become ironic with one of Madison's sisters (another is raped during the attack). Euro-cult star Rosalba Neri is unmistakably appearing as a salon hostess and Madison's ex-flame.
