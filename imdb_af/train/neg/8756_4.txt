Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945. He has only 2 directors and "Black Gold" was one (the one was also from 1936). Frankie Darro sometimes had an oblique version, but in it he played a good child. Of course he was quite popular on the "quickie" circuit - he made so many movies. In this one he plays the son of an old oil rig, who is convinced that he will soon bring oil. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to convince the old man to sell because he knows there will be oil at any moment. A geologist, Henry, comes to the scene and helps "Fishtail's" dad. He also convinced "Fishtail" to go to school regularly. Henry looks at Cynthia, the beautiful teacher. It was Gloria Shea's last film - she started her career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). "Fishtail's" dad is killed when the rig is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his cronies to justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to persuade "Fishtail" to sell his oil lease. It ends well with oil being beaten and "Fishtail" goes to Military School. <br /> <br /> It's good for a rainy day.
