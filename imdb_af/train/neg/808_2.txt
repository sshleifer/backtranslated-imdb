Very disappointing movie based on the James Michener novel. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was Marlon Brando's performance. His southern trek was ridiculous. I laughed at him talking, because he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home. Brando, who was so nice in previous films, was reduced to a stockpile here. Tyrone Power, in the "Witness for the Prosecution", had to be nominated for the best actor instead of Brando. <br /> <br /> The film, which deals with racism, dealt with the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between US soldiers. and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando was confronted throughout the movie. His move from anti-relationships to a pro-one occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and talks made it difficult to see how he could see such new views. <br /> <br /> Only God knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received Oscars for their performances. Nothing about performance was equally impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of her being represented. A better performance in this film was done by Miiko Taka, who did well as Brando's love interest. She showed good emotion as the anti-American who found love with the Brando character. Her face was etched with the unhappiness she had to lose her father and brother in World War II. She realized that her dance was not out of her life. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott has from the Hebrew mother, Yochobel, in the "Ten Commandments" to the grandmother of Brando's love interest. Her performance with Ricardo Montalban was wasted. Patricia Owens, as Brando's first love, showed depth and belief in her performance.
