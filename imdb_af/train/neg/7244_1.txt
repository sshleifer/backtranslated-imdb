I wish I had bought my rent back from this piece so that I could donate it to the Home for Aged Actors. Total rubbish !! Five people watched this movie simultaneously and there was not a single laugh to be heard. Paltrow is a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the so-called comic movie.
