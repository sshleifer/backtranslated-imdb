The only reason I was drunk this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq is now playing basketball for us. I've always heard how terrible it was. The movie did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's outfits. The worst parts were good, just about everything. My 12-year-old son and I just swam and couldn't watch the screen when Shaq got up and we wondered why Max didn't want Kazzam to be the front tooth of her! But for everyone it is terrible, we just can't stop watching it, the story sucks you in, like a black hole or a mercury sand or a tar pit, it was hypnotic. But it was worth laughing and just saying we were actually looking at "Kazzam".
