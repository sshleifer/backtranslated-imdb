It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's about as much as it can be said about it. It starts with a good atmosphere; The hospital is appropriately sterile and alienated, the mood is ominous. And then ... nothing. Well, somethings. Just somethings that don't seem to fit well ... and no attempt is made to explain the connection between the bizarre and not particularly intimidating insects and the hospital they have taken over. I mean, come on, biker duds? Some people looked a little too much Gwar. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite was the head demon, who rather looks like a middle-aged trucker trying to threaten desperately, while at the same time looking like he'd prefer to pocket a capped bank in Afghanistan, his belt unleash, pop a can of cheap beer (probably Schlitz), and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen far-feared trucks. At truck stops. Drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary !! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are even more cartoon, and even less scary. At least, on the DVD, the videos give an explanation of their presence in the hospital ... apparently they just come randomly in places, play a bippy "metal" and kill people. With some good special effects, and it's not quite terrible, as there is no decent writing, there's nothing here. It's just a background noise movie.
