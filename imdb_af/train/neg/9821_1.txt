I don't often look at a movie that is as horrible as this. I continued to watch, every minute that hopes it was just a joke to find it was meant to take seriously. Well, as serious as these genre requests. <br /> <br /> The acting was shameful and the situations were terribly clipped and clicked. If a movie was made in 1920 (for example) and the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its direction, we would think that the theater was then naive again. As it happens, this movie was made in 2000 and I have another movie of the silent era that has as little charm as this one. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the serious filmmaker. <Br /> <br /> [Not appreciated]
