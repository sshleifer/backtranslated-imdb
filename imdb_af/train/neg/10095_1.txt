Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. There is a very high chance that they need immediate professional help, since anyone who doesn't spend 30 seconds to see if you can't star, is very literally scary. <br /> <br /> This movie is ... well ... I think it's actually an attempt to make a horrible porn movie without porn or no real horrible bits (apart from acting, plot, story, sets, dialogue and sound). I mistakenly assumed it was about zombies. <br /> <br /> To see this is actually quite scary in fairness; you are afraid someone will come and you will never be able to describe what it is and they go away and think you are a freak watching homemade amateur torture videos or something along those lines. <br /> <br /> I'm so surprised that I write this review on my phone so I don't forget to try to bring the rating down further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same terrible fate. just suffered. <br /> <br /> I'm the worst movie I've ever seen and I can say (by hand on heart) it will never, never be covered.
