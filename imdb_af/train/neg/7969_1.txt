OK another movie that Joe Swatman and I bought. Okay, it's not the worst movie I've reviewed this week, but it still succumbs royally. We had lots of fun watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> The Monster Jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional student ideas, you just get in trouble when someone equips him with a buzz saw and a shot of shotgun, the movie wasn't so greedy as we hoped, I mean death is a heart attack. Again, I think the play sucks, some of the actors need to be porn star and one gets in her interruptions for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part is the end, it opens it up for a bit of a jigsaw 2, but it never happens. Gunna does it. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br /> <br /> funny 4/100 spot (how much fun we mocked) 73/100 acting 8/100 overall 12/100
