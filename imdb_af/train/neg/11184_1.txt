It's a really horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just writing that some people are sitting somewhere to watch it. If I stopped one person to look after their precious life, I would be happy. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring, though it's Al Pacino stars, I was foolish to think that something interesting was going to happen at any moment. Then the credits rolled, and I realized I was completely deceived to see this incredible drive. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie was as high as a score as it does at IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the voice). Do you agree with people ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please don't look at this movie!
