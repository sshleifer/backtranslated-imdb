The Living of the Saints begins with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city of busy, beautiful streets and sunshine. I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere, but it will be in a story that is not completely over. Othello works for big, fat. Karva, his stepfather of the crime boss (at least think I'm the one he's supposed to be, because it's never really defined, but he lets kittens loose in the fat eaters, so trust me, he's a dot) , and do scant little memories, while giving her scary girl daddy work. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black man who always knocks from A to B. Up until the day he arrives almost dull homeless child, giving him his wish to quit. Runner immersed the lost boy in Othello's apartment, where he immediately began to give more wishes. Strange to fulfill his own desires, Karva kidnapped the boy. But he is not sure what will really bring him happiness. Is it the innocence to be a child again or is it another craft? Anyway, I don't want to see the little one give him the second. <br /> <br /> It just takes time to go and there are many repetitive scenes. The end is trying to be shocking, but since there is no back story about investing in any of these characters, it only serves as a release for the bored. <br /> <br /> Author Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to interfere in a kind of religious allegory that is ultimately pretentious like hell, ironic. If he had given us something more accessible or at least better explanations for the suddenly-acting characters, it would have been a more enjoyable film. As it is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying noises that then develop miraculously apparent intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Whose origin is never revealed. It's just annoying! <br /> <br /> Aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and state of mind, this film has been uncommon.
