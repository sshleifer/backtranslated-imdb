If Edward Woodward was the movie that watched this movie, then he would scream in horror. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but enough is enough. We got Get Carter, the Italian Job, Alfie and now this. What are the agreements? No. It is not exactly a coincidence that three of the original stars Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars are still a British British actor. The main common ingredient in the original is the British film. They were not made to impress Hollywood. They were strange English movies with a unique charm / atmosphere that just can't be repeated in the US. The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult film than to bastard it with a remake or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a difficult task before it even hit the road. Wicker 73 is even more mysterious that other culture films have said; It makes genre, intelligent scripts, A-grade actors, the music score, the pieces that print the description and all the stories around the movie. <br /> <br /> Here's a remake. Do not worry. No originals were harmed in making these remakes. Some important aspects of the story had to be processed for the modern US - communication, paganism, virgins. But it's just about the whole premise. So we give the cop a Nam-style trauma, with shock music flashing for the cheap scarce. Then with no cellphone mast on the island sorting out the communication - but in the real world this won't happen. Police just don't miss out. Give him a blood call for motivation rather than clash of beliefs and you have the remake. Wafer thin though not? <br /> <br /> It's just that it was all made with a trowel. The name changes were simply hammy, almost worn out, there was no sense on the island on the island, no downtown to catch your bearings, just a few houses were sitting over a forest and it was. Willow was just annoying by not giving any information at all and Cage was useless to get her away. When he walked into the pit, you just knew he would shut it down. The script was all the way to the end - and you just wanted it to shake up and end. The epilogue was absolutely hilarious and didn't know when to stop. <br /> <br /> The end is probably the best way to summarize the difference between the two. One ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most terrible day. The other end ends with a post-production-explained-it-all-to-the-thickness-type conclusion. <br /> <br /> I loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to watch the movie. I was grateful for the fact that this movie will eventually end up under a highway, merely forgetting this time forever.
