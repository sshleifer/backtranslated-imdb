For the record, this movie is intriguing, but it's hardly original. Back in 1998, a movie called Talia Shire, The Landlady, had almost the same plot, but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> The story is Amanda Lear had a bad life, abusive father, horny doctor, spiritual homes, etc. She was eventually released from the happy house under the guidance of her distorted doctor ... who was abusing his anal and killing the poor man. (now it was original) The doctor financed a house for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard. After she moved in, she fell in love with a stud named Richard, who recently married a blues singer. If you've seen the member, you know the rest, she's dead or trying to kill someone coming in between her and Richard. (Many of the ideas come from the previous movie, the same idiot sidekick sticking his nose, the same spy on the guy with a bowl of popcorn, the same that flies a bodypress. It had original material, the beer bottle was brutal. The highlight of the movie Amanda's beautiful breasts in the hottest scene, yet another ripoff, but not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
