This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas this is not but one of the better crime films ever done. This movie should be considered closer to the STING Part2 or perhaps speed zone. Remember those gems! The only reason this film was made was to capitalize on the cult of the original. This movie lacked everything De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard. There was not a nice character and it is the fault of everyone responsible for doing so. I hope RISE TO POWER wins every RAZZIE it can and may even find some new categories so it can be a record holder. After watching this S @ * T FEST movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get my bad taste out of my mouth. After I saw it, I wish that Pachanga had come and beat me out of my misery.
