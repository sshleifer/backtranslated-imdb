It's a weird cut movie, you get the feeling that the stock company has to go into this one, I'm not surprised there are no credits on it, which would like to be associated with this movie. The action of everyone involved is terribly quiet and the plot jumps everywhere, it makes all sense. As I said before, it seems as if the bursary company had to go in because there were a lot of footage that had to be shot and all the music was very bad library music (cheap I think). Very, very strange. I can actually buy a DVD from it, if it lets me know what the hell is going on and what happened to this movie.
