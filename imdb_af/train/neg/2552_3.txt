It's listed as a documentary, it's not, it's filmed like a documentary, but I suspect I was just because they got away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming. It has just been released in the UK on DVD as an "American Pie style comedy". This is not the case either. <br /> <br /> Basically, it follows to break a group of teenagers on spring when they go to Mexico for cheap drinks. And with the effort to get there, virgin friend is finally laid. Throwing is a few dwarfs, also on the same kind of quest and you have a non-hilarious story of drunk teens trying to get some girls. <br /> <br /> Considering the 18 Rating it has very little nudity, and almost zero sex screens, mainly I think the rating is for the curse there is enough. <br /> <br /> If you want rude Jackass behavior without humor, then it might be your thing if you have brain cells. left then I will probably avoid it!
