I'm not sure what Diane Silver thought when she made this movie, but of course it had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel, whose film is based. <br /> <br /> We read the novel this past summer for AP English 12, and just watched the movie. During the periodic recording and checking of the watch, I considered the chances of being hit by lightning. Of course, the air was quite clear, and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5-paragraph essay on it. <br /> <br /> Wright's novel discussed many real-life themes, the idea of ​​a murderer and psychology behind it. Silver's movie has a murderer in a victim who did not want Wright (see "The greater was born" 454). <br /> <br /> I'll make it short and sweet: if you want to leave your consciousness, in Raphael Lambert's words, unclaimed, skip the film and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not thought-provoking material. <br /> <br /> ... :: Suck :: Now I have to write the essay.
