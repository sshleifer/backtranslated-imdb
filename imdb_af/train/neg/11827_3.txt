Just came back from a free screen and I'm very glad I didn't pay to see this very sub-par movie. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of children and adults. It looked like it was just the kids who laughed all the sticks and female jokes (good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the cross!). The film is fairly youthful, relentless, predictable, and mostly irritating. The characters just seem to be throwing together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed, without any charm, forced. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is generally with nothing that really stands out. They did a decent job of imitating Wallace and Gromit's clay display, but otherwise it's a very forgetful picture. <br /> <br /> Although I was bored all through the movie, I had a few occasions. This is not an absolute failure, but I will definitely not want to see it again. If you are a parent with children (and you don't care that your kids are seeing cheap jokes), they feel free to see them, but everyone shouldn't waste their money.
