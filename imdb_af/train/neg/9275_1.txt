Omen IV (1991) was a badly made-for-T.V. Movie. Since the 80's passed, I suspect executives are experimenting in meth (the drug of choice during the 90's), as there is no other reason to explain this travesty. Why did they even bother to make it? N. Movie? What happened to them when this one appeared on the idea table? Did they even think for a moment that this movie would attack like that. Maybe they thought it could make it a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy. They had to drop a few dollars instead of packing this extra disc. Omen IV is basically an average American family recovery of the first film. Instead of a funny punk child, we get the haunting girl who is a total blow to everyone around her. If the family had stronger parenting skills, none of the demonic events that occurred in the past would never have happened. These parents have to lay their feet down and do real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, best to avoid at all costs!
