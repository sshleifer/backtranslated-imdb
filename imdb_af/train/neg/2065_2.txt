Rent it last night. The opening (2001) took WAAAAAAAAAY too long. The hitchiker scene served no purpose. Some sketches have just been delayed. I knew beforehand that Chevy Chase was under 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> COCO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song. <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material from a 75 minute movie <br /> All others were either rude or silly like hell. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some advice: If you want a rough movie spoofing TV and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want a less raw movie show TV and movies, rent "AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON" or "UHF" <br /> Otherwise, don't rent this movie. You will save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best movie is still "modern trouble"
