Before I go on, I have to admit I'm a great Bon Jovi fan. In fact, what attracted me for the first time in the DVD case. I would probably have bought, anyway, such a huge horror fan and enjoy the first Vampire title so much. <br /> <br /> But it's not half as good. Not even Jon can save this movie for me. My biggest problem is that it is simply not scary. Apart from Jon's character, Derek Bliss, none of the other characters makes an impression and you can no longer care if they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / drug addict. The female vampire is simply not scary or sexy. Rather, she looks like an anorexic 14-year-old girl, no wonder she's so desperate for blood then. Another big problem is that everything is just too bright. There is no atmosphere or sense of fear. I know the first vampires in New Mexico were not exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness, but it still managed to be dark and prudent when needed. This film has no tension. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants Berzier's cross to walk in the daylight. But the story this time has less cold bones. There is no wow factor to know this is the master of all master - the original vampire, as in the first movie. You really don't care for who or what this one is. There is no army of masters. Instead, she stands out in an old ruin that looks more like a Disneyland attraction than a creepy temple. <br /> <br /> So there you really have it. Lack of scares, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting story. A real deviation for me personally.
