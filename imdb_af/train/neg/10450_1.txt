This movie was the worst movie I've seen since "Date Movie." I laughed at the whole movie instead of being scared. It was funny how the snakes would look for a particular part of the passenger body, for example, to attack the eye, the tongue, the buttocks, the chest. If we have seen a national geographic channel, we know that snakes do not appear on the body when they bite. For each particular scene, the snakes will bite the passengers and keep biting on the body. I believe the producer did not study his snake information and their behavior. I can't believe I wasted my money on this movie. So I don't recommend this movie trust, just wait until it's at the dollar theater or rent it.
