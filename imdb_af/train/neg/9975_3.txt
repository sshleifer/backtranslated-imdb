I remember remembering that this movie was several times as a very young child, and there were parts of it (very actually) I didn't understand. I think I saw it once as an adult, and I understood those parts. The only problem to consider it as an adult was that it was not for me at all. So what kind of movie is it? Is this a "children's movie"? Not rare. It contains language and topic that is not suitable for children. Is it a hyperbolic of what every parent feels they are going through their own children? Maybe, but why won't it focus on John Ritter's character instead of Junior? When a movie has a 7-year-old as a main character, it must be good for the seven and under the crowd, otherwise people will not be able to tolerate older ones (even 8-year-olds will not see a movie about a child who are younger than they are all year round. I'm pretty sure this movie didn't do well in the box, and the reason is because it couldn't find a niche in the market.
