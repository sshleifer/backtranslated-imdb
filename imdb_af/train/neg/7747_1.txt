Just the fact that the cover is a drawing, like this old B-movie, should give you a warning about the quality of this movie. However, this is not a B movie. It's a D movie! <br /> <br /> There are no famous actors, and the animals - WOW - this is the worst data animation ever made during the past two decades. <br /> <br /> You hardly see the SCAAARY sabretooth on the cover. You only hear people screaming, bleeding and dying and you sometimes see a tooth or a tiger leg. This is so amateur! Perhaps it's worth seeing just because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best movie I've ever seen, waiting for their response." He, he. <br /> <br /> The movie is too weak to give it a Spoiler Alert! THIS IS A SPOILER.
