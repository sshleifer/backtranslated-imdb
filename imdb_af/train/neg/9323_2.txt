What did I just watch? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life on one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite frightening. There are many people who are scared of clowns .... but to be it is a 300 pound nursery rhythm that makes a mockery of the genre. I still wonder how the character Mark couldn't run away from the Clown ... he's 300 pounds, he must eventually get tired. The whole end made me stand up and literally say, "What have I just looked at?" Apparently, Brandon is Denise's cousin ... and they got it on the middle of the movie, which means he had sex with his cousin ..... yes, that's something people want, so see * shudders *. <br /> <br /> Another hilarious thing I found was the opening scene where the clown stabbed a woman and she said, "What did you do?" Well, what do you think he did? The last thing that was funny was one second. The main character hits the hitch hiker and calls her breath and then 5 minutes later violence doesn't help. Did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong man? None of these movies makes sense anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie was more or less a stupid, low budget porn I bought (already 3.99) and no entertainment except the sex scene. I'm surprised the fat clown didn't join the orgy. It would fit well. I was hoping the movie would have an entertainment value as other B-movies might have, but I went wrong. It's a moronic piece of garbage that isn't even worth looking at. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
