I'm not sure how related they are, but I'm almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story it's based on). Very similar plot line, and even some of the screens and sets look very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so one sees earlier. <br /> <br /> This one moves very slowly but is a late 60-year-old French movie, which is expected of the style. In a retrospective, tell from the perspective of one of the girls visiting the school. Editing the flashbacks with the current scenes is a bit confusing, especially since the sound of each overlap (that is, hears flashbacks while the present is seen and vice versa). Also, the "girls" are a bit old to think they are in a residence. Finally, not much character development to even connect you to the movie.
