Unfortunately, one of the best efforts in the field of special effects has been made completely useless by being placed next to a clumsy, silly and equally senseless plot and an insufficient cliché. The hollow man is a very useless film. <br /> <br /> Almost everything seen here has been killed - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the elevator shaft) - with the only truly intriguing element of the movie being the impressive special effects. However, this is just the same special effect that is done over and over, and at the end of the movie that is dead. I was hoping before the Hollow Man watched that the Invisible Man theme, which is almost original in itself, will be the basis of something newer and more interesting. It is not so. It is not long before the film emerges in a well-known massacre and mass inefficient histrionics. The hills of clichés jump so fast that it is almost impressive. <br /> <br /> In addition, Kevin Spek does a fairly useless job and his supporting role players hardly try their best. Good points can be a customizable Jerry Goldsmith score (but no competition for its better efforts), a very interesting use of thermal imagery and special effects. I was tempted to give this movie three out of ten, but the effects hit the Hollow Man's merit on one score. <br /> <br /> 4/10
