... there's no one else watching the movie. My husband and I looked last night. It's just a small theater, but there is usually a decent amount of people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the only people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The movie was by far one of the worst I have ever seen. Yes, the CG was good, but it was. The acting, writing and dialogue, directing, editing, etc. Was God-Terrible! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad it was, that it reminds us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat AND The Lord of the Rings. It was as if we were expecting Rita and Lord Zed to see the commanders of Sauron's army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were ridiculous. You can't just lay legions of dino / dragon / lizard stuff loaded with guns without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but it sets and develops them over 3 movies, not within an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The scene transition is terrible. I didn't fall asleep during the movie, but although it was an overly simple plot, I got lost in the plot hole. <br /> <br /> The characters were Caucasian Americans, but almost spoke broken English. because of the poorly written dialogue in writing. <br /> <br /> The final scene that could have saved some value from the movie failed. Ethan didn't cry when Sarah died. Although he had not known very long in her life. He wasn't too upset to stay in "Mordor" because he didn't know where he was or how to get back. We could not find out for the love of God where he was or how he came there, but if he wasn't upset, we shouldn't be. <br /> <br /> Oh, and why did the dress wearing Sarah's spirit look like she'd borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... all 3 of the main hero characters were brought back to reincarnations to complete the work. Sarah completes her task and moves to the afterlife. Jack does it too. Why is Ethan screwed? He was left alone, without the girl, without a card / compass / helicopter to help him get back. What should he do? Send smoke signals? And when he comes home, does he just go back to his job? He had to be given the same grace to kill from the movie that the other heroes had. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money on this movie. We just stayed to the end because we paid it, but once the credits hit, we were out of the door.
