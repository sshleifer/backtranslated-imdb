I think how this movie was made. I watched it while I was at home writing emails and answering the phone. I just watched it because I hoped the "revenge" part would be good. Needless to say, the revenge and the forced plots were not worth the emails they were watching. In fact, I'm not even sure what happened at the end. The acting was as bad as the scenes on the FBI Files show. By far the worst reorganizations (actually only "Arrest and Trial" may be so bad at re-decision). I didn't even know that the top man in Third Eye Blind was until I watched the movie here on IMDb, but that's obvious why he's not made movies since then. I hope he is a good singer.
