Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is completely and completely rude, rough, scratchy and loud. It is indeed the only way to describe this terrible, trashy piece of stand-up. Eddie Murphy goes for shock value rather than trying to win his next one. Sometimes he succeeds funny, but usually loses the plot with obscene language and uncomfortable sex jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget about it! Unless you enjoy Eddie's dirty style. I don't think I'll bother with Eddie Murphy Raw. I prefer Eddie in the boundaries of a film. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
