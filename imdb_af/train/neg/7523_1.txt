Again I went for a chance and rented this bag crap. If a horrorflick billed, there wasn't one scene, not one, it was even shaken remotely. NOT ONE! Sure, there was a little nudity, but all the lesbian action got a bit old. I think maybe it's supposed to be this movie's saving grace? And Dan, what an annoying ass !! From the beginning I knew I was good at that, o Dan spoke for the first time. And he was supposed to intimidate? What a laugh !! All in all, this movie is terribly terrible! How are movies like this made in hell? If you want a movie with some excitement in it, don't rent this one. This movie is about as exciting as the Teletubbies.
