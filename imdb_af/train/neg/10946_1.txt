"That Malcom show on FOX really makes a murder ... can't we do our own version?" Of course I speculate and paraphrase, but in our hearts we all know it is true and that the only thing that NBC added to the 'Malcom' metric was sex. And, son, they added sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a boner and covers it with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally walks with his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching and knocking her. He spied on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window, and she knew he wanted to see her topless, but his plague smiled and closed the window. And that's all in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Take it out of a grown man. A boy's puberty is so sexual and testicular. It is impossible to make it a mainstream audience funny. The only time anyone ever got close is in movies, and you can count it on one side. So it's no surprise that Tucker has the warmth and appeal of a strip club bathroom. Did the network actually think we'd like to see how children struggle with puberty? Isn't that the thing people go to jail? If in doubt about the depravity of the show, consider it: 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes were broadcast; they then made the unprecedented move to burn the remaining episodes by airing them at midnight so no children could see them. Ironically, since children were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> Aside from its general shock, Tucker has a running voice over the main character to flush out the clumsy writing. Even in 2000, it was terribly dated, with the occasional music and super sarcasm. I couldn't love one of the characters enough to joke and the jokes didn't really come a minute per minute. Shame on NBC for this dirty rip-off ... they're better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
