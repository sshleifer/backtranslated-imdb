This is the only movie I have ever seen asking me to criticize any web site, and this is a significant statement from someone holding the "Attack of the Monolith Monsters". This movie is perfect for anyone who wants an unofficial movie. For example, it is without sex and violence. I believe this movie is safe for children of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to be entertained, challenged, or stimulated in any way. Adults can easily catch up with their sleep while watching the movie. Don't be surprised, though, if you wake up to find that the kids switched off the TV and started a board game. As an adult who enjoys enjoying it, from everyday to fantastic in realism, drama, comedy and action, all the adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate the imagination, this movie has nothing to offer.
