This movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> They didn't develop any of the characters and the storyline was terribly played. It was a definite sleeper. You'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strengths, but D-Wars surprised you with a decline in the department. <br /> <br /> The acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porn movie. And that means it seriously. <br /> <br /> I was actually happy to see the end credits on this one because it was just as bad !!! Please, whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like D-Wars.
