My wife and I both thought this movie was a weakened, made-for-TV (BBC) version of Manhattan Murder Mystery ... that was good, but not good. The story has little inter-character tension or chemistry, and not much of a plot. Woody Allen's character is just a kind of crossbeam to run to the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson have little to do. It's pretty disappointing, I have to say. Ian McShane's role is just an extensive phenomenon. <br /> <br /> The first thing that happened to me was, "I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to redeem him from Manhatttan?" He needed the money, and they needed his profession to expand their audience outside the youth market on the two stars. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it made uncomfortable background noise. If you ever want you to have something while expanding or sorting your stamp collection, it will do the job. I won't pay to rent it again.
