It depends on your own personal state of mind when you see it, "Christmas Evil" can either become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller, or one of the most pathetic and uncomfortable holiday-themed slashers ever made. I am personally tempted to choose the latter, because I had no trouble doing any research and only expected a cute and unbeatable early 80's skater in a Santa Clause costume victim. Wrong! The movie actually works over a block called Harry Stadling; Who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a garbage factory and sees it as his responsibility to determine on Christmas what gifts deserve and earn punishment. Harry's issues all started when he saw Santa? his dad in a costume of course ?? Stretch his mother's naked legs at a very young age. Then he just developed into a social wipe, much to the annoyance of his younger brother, who had to get hold of one day. I fully understand why some fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie, but have they really become so boring? There are several overhangs and seemingly endless parts of the movie in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed, but this movie doesn't even benefit from a disturbing atmosphere or unexpectedly dire plots (with the notable exception of the final, I have to admit). Also I would have taken the concept more seriously if the mad protagonist wanted to focus on the naughty children who punished the naughty ones! He does not kill and kill only unjust adults. How is it supposed to take wannabe controversial and original Christmas thriller when Santa doesn't even commit a miserable murder? It would have made "Christmas Evil" a classic, but now it's just a forgetful and spicy piece of junk.
