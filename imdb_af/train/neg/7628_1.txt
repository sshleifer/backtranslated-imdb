Black and white film. Good photography. Global characters. <br /> <br /> Just awful. <br /> <br /> I had another perfect night away to watch a movie that viewed others as "worthy" and "very good". There are some good plays here and the background environment for the plot is good (more had to be done), but it is very slow to grow and never develop. These are quite bases on sex without much romance with very unnecessary nudity. More could be done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to look at your family, it is not in the movie and if you are not having problems Although this film is long, it is only about 1 inch deep!
