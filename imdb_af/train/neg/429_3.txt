I was lucky to see this movie through its star force, but in the end it is all it produces. It is much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern excitement about major urban corruption. The biggest mistake is its predictability and total lack of tension. We know who the bad parents are from the beginning, and just follow them like dominoes. The film she has credit remembers for free violence and sex, but forgot to replace any good, clean romance or excitement in any other way. All the taste of a good, flat, decanted diethole. "Q&A", which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative, such as "LA Confidential".
