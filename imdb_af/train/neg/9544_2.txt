I didn't enjoy this movie. I thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring. A 20-year-old computer that saves the day? I thought it was just a bit far-fetched, even for a movie. I couldn't figure out why they couldn't just switch off, why not take a sledge hammer over it. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, but after the original 80's movie you've been expecting so much more than actually delivered. This movie could be a 21st century version of the old movie, it wasn't. If that's what you want to watch, don't see this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer didn't turn up to save the day, it would be a lot of candles in my opinion.
