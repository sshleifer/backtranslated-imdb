Words can't just describe how horrible this movie is. I watched it on video last night, and I simply couldn't believe what I saw. Basically, "Snake Theater" is about an ex-military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his quest for his kidnapped sister held by Redding-style Rednecks in exile. The film's acting, writing, direction, photography and editing is unfortunate with a song called "Soldier" which must be one of the worst theme songs of all time! <br /> <br /> There is, however, one treat. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" plays in the movie a lazily bad guy. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at ALL COSTS.
