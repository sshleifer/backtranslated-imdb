How a director of Altman's experience ever expects us to spend time, or to worry about what's happening, a main character who is humble, a shutter, a while with no redeeming features - this is the central puzzle this is a very confusing piece of work. A piece of waste. In addition to this crippling error, the plot line requires serious concentration to follow. The set-up of the Branagh character is obviously a proposition that we tend to wonder if the writer and director have completely lost their respect for their audience. The latter problem is at the heart of the film: it represents direct confidence, with deep contempt for the viewer's taste, values ​​and intelligence. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
