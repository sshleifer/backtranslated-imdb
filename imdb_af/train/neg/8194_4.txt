How hard is it to write a viewable movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the authors here. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how Santa is younger and look 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I had missed that part of the story, but in reality it really didn't matter. Many scenes looked out of place and confronted; the kind of "funny idea" scenes that drugs out of the way are too far away where any sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> At the end, the director / producer tried to tear, which would have been suitable if anything that led to it was worth following. <br /> <br /> Ugh, great disappointment. I can see how some people can enjoy it, as many people will use any rubbish they have fed, but I strongly encourage them to wait for this DVD. It's not worth the $ 23,978 to film your family today.
