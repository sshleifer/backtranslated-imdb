My friends and I rented the movie and yesterday we had one of the biggest laughs. The movie doesn't have to be funny, but it is just as ridiculous and it has no realism. First, Phillippe (I forget what his character is called and I don't really care about) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the top security terminals. Not only is it pathetic, but it also comes when its enormous efforts culminate in its finding of the terrifying Lego room that houses the supercomputers. It's simple funny. The tense mood we are supposed to experience is totally spoiled by the childish chick room. The end, like all other things, is very cheesy, especially when the bad man's lawyer appears in time. Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to make fun, you should definitely see it.
