(spoilers) The one memorable part of this otherwise tough and low bit of British cuisine is Steiner's henna coil, one of the worst dyeing works ever. It and the wonderful caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil man who tried to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K is doing an admirable job of making a miserable boring and gray film funny. I especially like the crow killing Mike with his "attack of death", and when he revives himself in the theater, Mike cries: "Guys, I died, I saw eternal truth and beauty! Oh, this is this. movie ... "It would be a departure, coming back from the afterlife to see the rest of the projected man. The movie can make a fortune sold as a sleep aid. Some of the words in the movie were angry: the police inspector "electricity!" Crow- "Shocking, isn't it?" police inspector- "It is lowe, okay" Tom Servo "Very low, right down the floor!" police inspector- "Can I continue?" Tom Servo "He's dead, but knocks yourself out." MST3K is definitely the only way to look at this snoozer.
