I would like to think of myself as a fairly open-minded man and it takes a lot (!) For me to keep a movie, but this one is without a doubt one of the sunniest, tightest movie I've ever seen! <Br /> <br /> I have no idea what is wrong with the people who gave it such a good score (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings). The only thing I can imagine is that people have to vote in one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. While they have been cut out / stoned 2. Got hard cash for the vote 3. Under rifle <br /> <br /> I can't believe I have a good 1 hour 45 min from my life for not losing pathetic excuse for a movie.
