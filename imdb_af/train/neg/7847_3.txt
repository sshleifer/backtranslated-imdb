Just recently I had so much obsession and this movie predicted so much that I almost had to see it. Well, if you have seen it today, the 5.8 rating is quite understandable. I think if you expect such a serious need, it doesn't seem worth it. <br /> <br /> Sure, The Hills Has Eyes 2 has moments. It has a very cool and well-developed storyline that fits well with the real product itself, but the whole thing is so confident that it will be so difficult to follow. And if it wasn't for Wes Craven's production on this movie, it wouldn't do anything with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing makes you go "Is it supposed to be abomination or COMEDY?" because there are many ridiculous, random jumping moments and dumb one liners (IE "There's a hand in sh ** er!" or "you motherfu ** er! I'll kill you all the damn boys of b ** tches ! ") and the play (God doesn't even remind me how bad it was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (This part contains spoilers, beware!) The movie starts with a woman who is giving birth to a mutant baby give (ooh la la!), and then the screen fades to black with the title of the movie, and a monologue, then we go to this office where random war veteran mannequins are placed, we find it for this one scientist watching people who are looking for mutants, the box to find the sounds is gone, and everyone dies! After that scene, you will expect more. <br /> <br /> Then we go to this one team of military recruits training in Baghdad.If the captain parades them a good job at stupidity ", their last day of training is in New Mexico, the desert n where the family stayed in the last THHE beca used they were stuck. While in training, things go wrong, people die, and ... should I tell you more? Because now I have the attention of a goldfish, who just force me to sit here and type it. <br /> <br /> The thing that is wrong with THHE2 is that it just doesn't work. No flashbacks here, and the end is pretty safe ... but with a twist! A dumb one, that is. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket for The Hills Have Eyes 3 will show all its alternate ends, but I'm not sure I care. <br /> <br /> So, if you loved the first THHE, it's almost a sin not to see it, and then you see it. But if different, avoid at all costs. It is for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
