I watched this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkward script for five hours (or how long it actually was). From the beginning, every element of this movie is incredible. This movie made me visit me several times, but they were mainly shocked that the director / writer actually expected us to believe the very messy scattered elements that tried to put this movie together. <br /> <br /> The film's focus is Gray (Graham) and her intimacy issues. Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly much in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, intriguing. Instead of unraveling this story in something credible and palatable, director Gray still holds these ridiculous twists that never really make sense. To be an LGBT individual, this movie looked like all heterosexuals think we are going through the outreach process. (I will be insulted by the writer's evil.) If it wasn't for the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which was casually understandable), I'd give it negative 3 stars.
