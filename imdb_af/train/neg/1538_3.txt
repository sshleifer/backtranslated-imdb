What a shame that a really capable director like Andre de Toth, who specialized in smooth, sliding alliances, didn't even get this concept. He could have helped bring the real potential, especially with the interesting character William Bishop played. As the movie stands, it's a lot of a mess (as claimed by reviewer Chipe). The main problems are with the direction, cheap budget and poor writing. The power lies in an excellent throw and an interesting general concept - characters drew conflicting forces in different directions. What was needed was someone with a vision to gather the positive elements by restructuring the text in a coherent whole, rather than the extravagant, uncomfortable mess it is (trying to find the motivation and interaction if you can). Also, a bigger budget matched with contrasting location and studio shots, and got the locations from the all-obvious LA outskirts. The actual shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast. Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth were covered), Dehner, Reeves, with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely deaths. Few films illustrate the importance of an author-with-vision more than this humble, dark Western, who could have been so much in the right hands.
