I, like many other Bachchan fans, were eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie wasn't. Thanks, they didn't use the name "Sholay" in the movie. Ram Gopal's remake is not worth the title. The camera works, the places, the costumes, the totally out of place dance, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I've ever seen. You wonder if the movie actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the money. The only unpaid actor, the ant, was the only match with the first movie. Abishek's role was completely ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding for Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, don't save this movie or the DVD when it comes out.
