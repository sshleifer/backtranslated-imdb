OK, how's the original? This means that a wealthy old man leaves his estate to his adult children, all leaving ungrateful losers and two Greek servants, provided they spend the week in his creepy old house. What happens that night will only surprise those who haven't seen a movie or television program before. After a series of killings in which the victims look, they are a thriving restaurant cookie, we have a painful obvious end. The film is led by some respectable actors desperate for their salary accounts. There are also some second-level actors who have risen at the time, but are now forgotten. As a result, the movie generates all the drama and secret of an episode of "Matlock." I'll give credit where it's the result. If you are still awake, the closing scene is smart and amusing.
