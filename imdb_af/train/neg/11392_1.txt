For years I remember reading this show "Trouble With Tracy" in the TV Guide. CFTO TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 06:00! I lived about two hours north of Toronto and we couldn't get CFTO, but you know what it is. We always want what we can't have. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this "Trouble With Tracy" was. Did it have a beautiful girl starring? Was there nudity? Was there tension? Was it a comedy? It would have been good if there was a promotion of the show. At least I knew what I was missing out on. But no! The mystery ran my bonkers, until CTV, affiliated with CKCO, built a re-launch in Wiarton, Ontario and broadcast "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO ... Saturday morning at 06:00 !! One Saturday morning I got up and switched on the TV at 5:59 and finally I had to see what "The Trouble With Tracy" was. Yes, the "Trouble With Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and held in the harmless 6 spot so no one could ever see how terrible it was. <br /> <br /> A few years later, talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died, but many would argue that he had "effectively" killed the first time he appeared on this show. When I first saw the cold Saturday morning and fell deadly in my bed, a part of me also died.
