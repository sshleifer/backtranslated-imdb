Having seen the credits with just one name I recognize and this was the minister in this movie (Russ Conway), I didn't expect much from this movie and I wasn't disappointed. A man plans to kill his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life. Unknown to the man is that the plastic-seeking skull he uses, unlike a ghost of a woman, apparently is his first dead woman revenge on her and uses a real skull. A simple plot with a twist of irony at the end. If you are tired of sleeping and sleeping one night, it will help you sleep that sleep.
