Ram Gopal Verma proved himself as a very innovative and competent director. He did a remake / rework of Godfather with Sarkar and did tremendously. It is for Lolita that he made as Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay is the movie he repeatedly says inspired him. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake. <br /> <br /> The scene was from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan threatening the villain Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were terrible and forgotten. The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came down as a second class music video. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the pacing, and the dialogues - which were forgotten. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie in a theater, I waited for the break, and then for the end. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and saw how they left the film. Ultimately, one of the worst films made by Ram Gopal Verma.
