Stefan is an x-con who married Marie five years ago. Their marriage was stable until Stefan passed them and offered to do a courier. Stefan's work is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden, which should be easy. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan Elli, a Bosnia girl who was sold to a strip club owner, met. Stefan doesn't like what he sees and decides to help Elli out of her misery. Because Elli's father fled to Sweden during the war, Elli went with Stefan to Sweden. To make up for the past, Stefan Elli promises to help her find her father, no matter what it needs. Finally back in Sweden, the whole situation seems to be more complicated if Stefan ever thought. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't look like the usual Swedish movies, as it's a lot of Americanism. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist make it all average, but the effects make the film a little too much. See it and sign for yourself. <br /> <br />
