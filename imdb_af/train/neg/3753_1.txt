Due to the 1988 Writers of America's authors, they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It is a lot of shit, which consists of repeated cut + pasted tracks of Season 2 and has been described by his author, Maurice Hurley, as "terrible, just terrible." <br /> <br /> Why the producers can't just wait to make something that doesn't know. Because of the strike, I guess the production went out of money and could only release a jump-off episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick to veto at the time. This episode also highlights the latest appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.
