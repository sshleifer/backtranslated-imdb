Gene Hackman gets himself out of jail through an unnamed government agency who wants him to be assassinated. It goes without saying that Hackman has the skillful work skills. <br /> <br /> No one tells him anything, but he is given because the audience is given bits of information. It is supposed to be tension, but it is irritating and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes on with the mission, but the getaway is messed up and the man at the top of this mysterious entity commands everyone to cover it. So everyone dies in the role and at the end you don't really care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers pointed out that the movie was originally twice as long, almost three hours and a bit chopped. bit. Perhaps something is really lost in the translation, but I tend to think it was an act of mercy on the audience. <br /> <br /> A very talented role such as Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, and Edward Albert are so thoroughly messed up here is a crime. <br /> <br /> And we'll never find out what the federal agency did it all, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA or even the IRS.
