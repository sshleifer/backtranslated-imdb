The problem with this movie is that it is shot at the worst possible camera and the movie is blurry and granular. Maybe it's just the fact that anyone who kept the camera couldn't stay quiet because they had seizures or something. There is also too much jaw and vomit in this movie. There is a braai every 20 minutes and it makes me think that it was made by some bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there is the annoying high stuffed scream that goes on and off and on and off and stops until the credits roll. I also didn't like it when all her friends were shot (or not I know) and she went in the bus and put on tape aids. It was just really stupid to even have it in a movie. How much gas can a person get siphon to get a bus? It must be a whole lot because they are not out of the gas for the rest of the movie. It was a terrible movie and I would highly recommend never seeing it in your whole life.
