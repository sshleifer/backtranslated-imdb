What exactly happened during World War II in New Zealand when American forces were there? <br /> <br /> This horrible story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to watch. Can you imagine that Joan Fontaine is Sandra Dee's older sister? Fontaine looks more like her mother. Even worse was Fontaine getting pregnant in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who showed in The Hustler 4 years later, have no scenes in this movie. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to walk around there, despite being married. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is a widow and finds romance with a very muted Paul Newman. There is even romance for the young girl. Dee here. <br /> <br /> The picture has little to no meaning. Are they trying to say that everything is fair in love and war? If they were, they did a poor job of selling it. <br /> <br /> The conflicts of interest with Newman and Simmons are being quickly eliminated. That's what had to be done quickly with this terribly disappointing 1957 film.
