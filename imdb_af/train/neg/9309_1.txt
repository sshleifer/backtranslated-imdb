Hey everyone ... <br /> <br /> There is not much to say for this movie. The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes some friends on a trip to his cabin in the bush for a weekend break away from work. After a girl is picked up, things start to go wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> The storyline alone (written by the actor playing Brandon, I believe, although I may be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and is being acted upon. The "Clown Killer" itself is a rather sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious but all kinds of intelligent predator, we are rather presented with a clumsy, small-sized rhyming song, which apparently goes through a slight medium crisis. The only thing that justifies writing this comment was the sex scene and whatever was in the movie (the quality of the film led me to enjoy such things). In short: <br /> <br /> In short, this movie falls under every possible set of standards. Of course, I shared a few beers with a good friend while watching it, and we managed to scrape a relative entertainment value from this movie. So it is only fair to mention that S.I.C.K just became ashamed of a two rating. But in reality (and in the aftermath) the one star score is more than a legitimate score for this movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of ten.
