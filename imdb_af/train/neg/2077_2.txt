I had an excuse to get out of the house while the paint was dry - after an hour to return the film and dry the paint. <br /> <br /> I never remember ever running out of a movie, but I really try to stay. The script was not cast and just "ran and went" bad - come on! Uma Thurman does this? Fairly special effects. It was older characters and actors who were superficial, nice 20-something - just kind of annoying and wrong. <br /> <br /> This review is only basic at first hour - it may have been better. I just had to come home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it was going on.
