Ugh! Where to start ... first, Campbell Scott's non-stop anxiety becomes a real turnaround after a while (a very short time), as he interns his increasing anxiety, curiosity and anger. Only we do not care! These characters as presented by the author and director are completely unlikely, and the key lies in it. They have given us nothing to care for us if they are adultery and whether they are still in love with each other. When Scott told his wife quietly, I could kill you before their three daughters at the table. After the shock of his selfish poor timing turned away, I almost wished he had. And then I did the same thing, wisecracking the appearance of Denis Leary before being removed from the looney bin. An ultimate waste of time and perhaps - perhaps perhaps - resources.
