I'm not saying Night of the Twisters was terrible, but it was far from big. Moderate in absolute best. It seems as if every single kind of movie is being released, a second should be about the same time. (Think about Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak). Night of the Twisters is actually only Twister, except worse and with everyday special effects. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the actors in it, even though they weren't big, it was the movie itself, the direction, the special effects, the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret. A series of tornadoes hit a village and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and to deal with the damage. I really don't know why duplicates of disaster movies seem to be. released almost in sync with each other, but this one would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
