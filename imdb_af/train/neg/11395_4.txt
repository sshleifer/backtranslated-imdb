Not just a new story line, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and a drop dead beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale) occasionally gather and wonder if they are meant for each other. Although both are promised to others ... oddly enough, they still feel their soulmate is out there somewhere. A little juicy in some places, but viva la love. Being a romantic is almost obliged to be cut. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow is falling. The final is almost too sweet, but most deserves. It's not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but who in hell can't be beaten by Beckinsale. Striking support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen him. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is strange and funny. Look at your soul mate.
