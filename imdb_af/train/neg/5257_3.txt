For a horror movie made for TV, the movie started out very interesting. I was really intrigued by the story and the secret of the movie. But the end was a total dissappointment. The movie was fast moving and built up, but it looks like a lot of climate anyway. But guess what no end is. The movie is just over and after almost an hour and a half the audience just left and wondered what had happened. Why were all the unanswered questions in the film unanswered. There was no statement at all about any of the key points in the plot. This movie is like watching a murder murder and never finding out who did it. Very disappointed. This movie looks like the producers just run out of money and never completed the movie. A real BOMB!
