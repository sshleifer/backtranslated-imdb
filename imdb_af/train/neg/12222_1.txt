(First of all, Barbra, I know it is you who clicked all the "NO" on my review. 22 times? How many people did you learn to help yourself here? Didn't you do anything better than Steven Spielberg told Barbra?) this is the best movie I've seen since Citizen Kane, it says pretty much everything - and serves as a serious warning! <br /> <br /> What are the ingredients for a movie, and the one that will ghost, never forget the tears of both laughs and pain? The ingredients: Barbra Streisand's face, a musical, feminist, Barbra Streisand voice, Barbra Streisand director and an ultra-corny / idiotic premise. br /> <br /> Hollywood is full of selfishness, so much we know. In fact, almost everyone by definition should be an egoism in Hollywood. Why would anyone want to act? For "art"?!? Well, If you are stupid enough to believe what they are telling you in their carefully prepared interviews, and Streisand has the biggest ego of all of them! d by narcissistic cranes, and yet to bow them all? remarkable. <br /> <br /> Like all of her solo efforts, the movie is an ego journey straight from hell. Every scene in Streisand is automatically destroyed. Stillborn. But if that wasn't enough, did she sing a lot of Streisandy songs? You know, the kind that the Mariah Careys, the Celine Dions and the Whitney Hustons of this world have enabled to poison our precious air waves for decades now. Just for that she doesn't deserve one, but 100 South Park episodes mock her. <br /> <br /> The starting point, Streisand, dressed as a man to become a rabbi, sounds like a ZAZ comedy. Besides being a clich√©, the obvious problem is that Streisand doesn't look like a woman, and doesn't she look like a man? I'm not even sure she's a man. The way she looks in this movie, is it? It cannot be described in words. E.T. Looks like a high school jock by comparison. She looks more strange than Michael Jackson in the year 2015. She looks HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> The songs. They made me shake. Especially "Dad, can you hear my squeel like a demented female walrus in heat?" and "Tomorrow night I will prepare the sequence, YENTL 2: THE BACK OF THE BITCH". <br /> <br /> Did you know that early in his career Streisand had a nose job, but changed her mind when they told her, could her voice change? Can you believe it? She had to do it! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, please email me. <br /> <br /> SHOULD BARBRA STREISAND CLOSE? CLICK 'YES' OR 'NO'.
