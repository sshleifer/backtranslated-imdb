We loved School of Rock and Jack Black. We can't wait to see this movie. It was the only time in my life that the movie was so bad that I wanted to leave. My husband hated it too. The only funny parts were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand outside the movie and tell people to save their money. The writing was terrible. It had every terrible stereotype of the Spanish people who had to be completely insulted. The movie wasn't that long, but for us it was like an eternity. The people in the theater were so restless and quiet, it was like watching paint dry. I made my husband stay because I was sure there might be some redeeming parts, but there was not. Save your money and your time.
