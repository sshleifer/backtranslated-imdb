Terrible use of scene cuts. All continuity is lost, either through terrible dissertation or inertia. The ominous robot ... had to be a jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard (monologues usually drowned out by music.) And ... where do they get their props? The ship looks like a milk carton ... I had better special effects at 8mm at age 13! <br /> <br /> I would recommend that any movie student watch this movie (5 minutes at a time) to learn NOT to produce a movie. Or ... was that the editor error? <br /> <br /> It's really bad, because the scenario was actually a good concept ... just poorly executed. (Sorry Malcom. You should have sent a "stunt double". You're too good an actor for such a stink bomb.)
