I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but it does pretty much make it up. You can't beat the original two for a number of reasons, one of which is Chris Columbous's governing talent. <br /> <br /> This movie covered terribly directing with even more horrific acting. I can't believe these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Painful to watch and watch. The storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a painful quest to get it back. Terrible, rent one of the original drag and enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't even like Christmas at Christmas. Home Alone was from an excellent Christmas-time family comedy movie to a joke without moral or plot!
