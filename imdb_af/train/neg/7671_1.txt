The movie starts with a scrolling text that takes about five minutes. This gives the basic summary of what is going on. It can easily be done with acting, but you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters you are learning a bit, remember this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot begins to fall off the ground and then traps the entire movie. Not only does the plot change, but you may even ask if you are watching the same movie. I have never played the video game, but know people who have. From my understanding whether you played the game or not, it is no better. Save your money unless you sleep at the theaters.
