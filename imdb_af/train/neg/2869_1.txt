The story goes as follows, Netflix was letting me send my DVDs, so I went on to the analog rental site known as "Blockbuster Video". They suck you. Actually, they have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your reading pleasure, but I never want to see any of them. So I saw BTK Killer on the shelf, all by his lonely self. I like watching movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity I will never understand, so I want to see that kind of thing. Anyway, I put this DVD in and suddenly from the first second, it sucks. I sit there with me b.f. and we are like, "what is this kind of crap?" Unstable camera operation, horrible acting. - The first scene in which a woman is killed is wondering if she is going to sleep calmly. Then a rat is knocked under her throat. I really wonder if the director has a difficult thing for this crap. There is nothing decent about this "movie". All I have to say to the director is: "Do you own a freakin tripod?" Every shot was brutally unstable. The music was terrible. It was as they once decided to make a movie. They probably met people from WalMart to show up for them. Not terrible. If you make such a movie, it is your hobby-NOT that you have to do for a life. Don't make it to the DVD renal outlets for movie buffs like myself. Better at home for your friends when you have a party and run with interesting things to entertain them. Then you break your BTK KIller movie and say, "Do you want to see this crappy movie I did once?"
