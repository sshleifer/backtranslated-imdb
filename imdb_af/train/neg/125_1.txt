If only to prevent this type of film from being made in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment, but does not tell a narrative story. <br /> <br /> One can feel virtuous about putting it in because it touches so many IMPORTANT issues, but it does so without any noticeable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up while one's mind wanders, as it will always do during this senseless movie). <br /> <br /> One can better spend the time growing a window at a tree growing. <br /> <br />
