When I first heard of "Solar Crisis", I got a film load, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a big roll. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For a movie that includes outer space, the sun, huge deserts and vast metropoles, it is a terrified and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is getting stuck together so the camera doesn't have to pull too far back. <br /> <br /> And the effects, while good, are pretty subversive; We are talking about the imminent destruction of planet Earth as a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly sunburn. But unlike screaming, sweating and a red glow on everything, there is no real emergency. <br /> <br /> Don't start me about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al do in this movie, without feeling any way to work with the material, is anyone's guess. Wondering whose apartments are not being paid in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> And as far as the end .... Well, let's say it's tense and interesting, but it's too late in an effort like this. If it had been through the movie for so long, I might have heard of "Solar Crisis" earlier. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smithee does his job so much?
