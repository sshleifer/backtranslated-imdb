This budget-hungry Italian action / sci-fi hybrid knows David Warbeck as a Miami reporter chosen by the ghosts of the people of Atlantis (!) To stop an evil businessman (Oscar nominee John Ireland) use a telepathic fetus Use traces of an asteroid to rule the world. Do you have it all? In spite of such a ludicrous plot, it's actually quite a drill and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS cut it with contempt. Honestly, the most (deliberate) creative thing about this movie is the slight rework of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles. The most incessant creative bit involves a scene in a laboratory that is inexplicably shown back and forth. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted to get all avant garde on us in the twilight of his career? I would declare this Ireland's worst movie on his CV, but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS listed there. I would also like to state that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to make a dual feature of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGA.
