Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a pirate ship captain who took over as captain after killing the previous one. Although he testified that a treasure is being buried, he begins to lose his memory and the treasure map he gets becomes empty. So, Dick was forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (put you an ad for that) and help guide a path to the treasure. It's wise to scare how someone can bankroll this aimless movie. Former Goon Spike Milligan has replaced Medak as director and given Medak's talents in the film The ruling class, probably you can guess which of the badly-lighted screens Milligan had in the director seat. Peter Boyle made a short appearance in the first 10 minutes of the film as the doomed pirate captain. He is probably quite grateful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year. It's filmed and canned so he can keep it from his resume. Franciosa looks like the handsome Power-behind-Scratcher, but he and the seller both look desperate, with even Sellers' make-up and her looks very terrible. They had to know that this movie is bombarding even if they have filmed it. With such lines I can understand any possible discomfort: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (to hang) You will pay for this. <br /> <br /> WRITE: No, I got it. I'll do it for free. <br /> <br /> And this is one of the GOOD jokes. It's amazing to me that many vendors' productive materials are still in the safe, but it was made available to VHS more than 15 years ago! How about someone coming to the board and releasing the delightful British television show "A Show Called Fred" in the US, with the sellers, Milligan, and director of the great Richard Lester?
