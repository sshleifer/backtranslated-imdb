Warner Bros. made many pot boilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast, economical and very entertaining. I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life. It's one of Warner's few stiff melodramas that simply doesn't work. Edward G. Robinson plays a relentless editor of the newspaper that brings the 20-year-old story of a killer with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance, but he is surrounded by actors who do not cut the mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad actions of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leader really hurt the film. Starr is especially bad at her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code Hollywood. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches, but he can't overcome the bad acting and unintentional funny situations. Sol Polito's camera work is strong. Somehow, this piece of liquor has an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (in a year we gave M, "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
