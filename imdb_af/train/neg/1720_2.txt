A handful of non-professional actors are plagued by a prehistoric being. These creatures appear in about thirty seconds of a marginal stop-motion animation, but oh how are you going to that margin as for the rest of the movie the animation is being replaced by production workers blowing around an inner tube with teeth. No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through these comic lighting boat rentals, which have suddenly become the main characters; But again you have to admit they are trying to be jokes, rather than picking around at the sheriff. Only at the end is one of them eaten and the other one sits on a rock crying loneliness - it's not nice!
