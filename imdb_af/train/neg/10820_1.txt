What does Franco Zeffirelli think? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can I trust the idea that someone who didn't speak English as their first language just missed Charlotte Bronte's classics? I don't think I can improve on a comment I read below, so I'll just paraphrase it: "Jane Eyre is a wonderful book, the author must read it one day." It is true that the film's two leaders were abused. But sorry for the actors, because the scriptwriter has left out the best scenes. The dialogue with which you understand Jane and Rochester has an encounter with thoughts and a shared sense of fun ... removed from writing. The marriage proposal, the fortune teller ... gone. The rumors, half struggled, which felt half-heartedly, after Jane as a fairy tale from England, come to save Rochester in his despair. Decimated. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Zeffirelli has the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane's interactions with the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he suddenly removed love from one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 series (?) with Timothy Dalton.
