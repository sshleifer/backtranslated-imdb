The Nutcracker has always been a bit of a problematic ballet. It has little parable with ETA Hoffman's original story based on it. <br /> <br /> In the ballet, the story is essentially about the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom <br /> <br /> There is an infinite variety of stage productions that reinterpret the story in many ways (not always successful) to compensate for the ballet's poor libretto. <br /> <br /> Balanchine's version has no sense of drama or story (despite the fact that there are many drama and puzzles in Tchaikovsky's wonderful first-hand music). The result is a completely forgotten first half-Christmas party, after which nothing happens and even the dance (the thing about it) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> The pantomime overworking, especially from Drosselmeier, which looks sensible on stage, seems silly, filmed for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things aren't much better when we get to the Kingdom of Candy (Act II in the Stage Version). Although there are some choreographic highlights, most choreography is slim and uninspiring. It's certainly not vintage Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I've always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets. Look at this movie version of his stage production by The Nutcracker, just confirmed this view.
