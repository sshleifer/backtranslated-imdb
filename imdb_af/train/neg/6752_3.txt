Unfortunately, more downs than ups. The plot was pretty decent. I mean nothing extraordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. The other good thing was the cast. I'm not saying the play was good because it wasn't, but every actor / actress was warm and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the downs is that the movie is only exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was rather boring. Another down (or you might consider it if you want) is the excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys have been showing their buttocks a long time ago. It's not that I'm against nudity, but it was a horror movie, not "The Dreamers". <br /> <br /> Unless you are very desperate to see an old man take his swimsuit and walk naked for a few minutes, or look at a girl, get naked for no reason, or you are a hard fan of Debbie Rochon, if this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
