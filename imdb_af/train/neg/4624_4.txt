This beautifully filmed and written episode has been dropped for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s that spoke, but no one had left an asteroid alone for years, with such a hysterical negativity responding to the gift of a female android. 2) It was not an orroid at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex pop industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode as they did. In fact, the modernization of sex clashes is in the news as I speak. <br /> <br /> Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made, so they could at least act like one. Her carnality would then have added a creepy element. Instead, it becomes a sweet love story about two distant people. <br /> <br /> The Twilight Zone has always spanned the imagination and credibility. Usually no one cares. But this episode was hidden by a Calvinist morality, denying what masturbation would be with a machine, or straightforward indifference.
