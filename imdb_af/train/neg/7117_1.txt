As the movie begins, a narrator warns us THE SCREWS are so frightening that you may be scared of death - and if so, a free funeral is guaranteed. Well, I don't think anyone died of seeing this movie, but some might get bored. THE SCREW is the kind of movie that Ed Wood looks good. <br /> <br /> Very loosely based on the famous Francis Marion Crawford story, SKULL is about a rich but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. Once installed in his house, she is tormented by a half-white gardener, a poorly-executed portrait, peacocks, and finally a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to shout. For her credit, actress Peggy Webber screams quite well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, her ability to do so is the highlight of the movie. The plot is thoroughly transparent, and at least the movie is really good, the screenplay is awful and the movie is so uninspired that you will be ready to scream yourself. True, the thing is about sixty and eight minutes, but it all feels much longer. Add to that a really terrible print quality and there you are. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are so bad, it's fun to watch. It is true that the SCROLL COLD has a few dimples - but the film draws so much that I can no longer work as an occasional giggle, and by the time the whole thing is over your head it will be role. If it wasn't for Peggy Webber's way of screaming, it would be the security cure for insomnia. Give it a miss. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
