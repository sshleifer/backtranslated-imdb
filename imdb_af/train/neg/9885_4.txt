He only gets third bill (behind Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field), but it was effectively David Niven's first lead and he is beautifully stupid like PG Wodehouse's dunderheaded Bertie Wooster, master (only in name) to Jeeves, the most unfoldable of valets . As an adaptation, it's more like an irrigation of the 39 steps as a true Wodehousian outing. And it's too bad, because the interaction between Treacher & Niven is not too far from the point. Unfortunately, the 'B' movie mysterious tropics and forced comedy are getting tired, even briefly. Next year's sequel (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more of the point, without Bertie in sight and Jeeves (of all people!) Who were forced to play the bat.
