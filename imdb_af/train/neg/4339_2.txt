this movie wasn't quite what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie is mentioned otherwise, no one will even see the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> It's very funny because I can't see the point. the prequel and successor can only say doesn't make sense, don't even fit. Maybe I'm naive, but I'm not a full 1 and full 2 ​​that is meant to look after. <br /> <br /> In the first one, Carlito was in prison and died in the original, and in the prequel he lived and did not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was OK, but they had to be changed by some actors and the story line and the name of the movie and that would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really expected it to end like the other one started. <br /> <br /> If someone has an opinion on this post please.
