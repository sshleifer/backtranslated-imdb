So 'Thinner' ... Yep .. This Steven Bachman (reads Steven King) yarns over a man she just gets desserts from a Gypsy Elder he just killed. The story itself is there, no doubt about it, but I don't know why I didn't enjoy it anymore than I could have. I think what really distracted me was the actors. I mean, who's the lead? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And cry out loud, can anyone stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian Mafioso role ever there? And while we're at it, every Mafioso must have an Italian mother paste? The only good work done here is under 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as the Gypsy parent. He's pretty good. But the rest, I make you all, "better actors ..."
