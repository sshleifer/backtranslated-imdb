The original "Cube" is a fantastic B-movie rich in paranoia, greasy characterization and fine top performances. It's creepy, cryptic, and cool. And it stands out well, on its own, without a stupid successor such as 'Cube Zero.' <br /> <br /> This third (!) movie in the Cube series is partially reproduced (most of the booby traps are unfortunately recovered), partial deviation. It takes the brave step to explain what the cube is - something that has never been revealed in the first movie - but as the explanation is vague, I would rather keep it a secret. There are some interesting references to the society outside the cube, but they never develop as hints for a kind of political-religious totalitarian state. So, what little social commentary is there, feels flat and unfocused. <br /> <br /> What works? Actually, nothing. The play is pure amateur hour, the pace is slow (how much of this movie is two nerds watching a screen?), And the gore effects, while rebellious, do not convince. In short, "Cube Zero" reminds me of a "Cube" fan-fic, a messy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely doesn't need a successor.
