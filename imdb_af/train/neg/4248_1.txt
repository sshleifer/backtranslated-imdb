This film has written mediocrity, laziness and ungratefulness about it. If you are going to make a movie about vampires that have been done thousands of times, then you can do better work. I'll be the first to say that this movie just didn't cut it. Some scary / horror movies just fail the form of "something banned and abandoned for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies" clich√©. This one was unfortunately no different, and like all the frightening movies, once you get in the way, it won't go back. <br /> <br /> And the end? How do the heroes do the same work over and over throughout the movie, but then they are secretly wrapped up in the moment and cannot finally do the job? The end was very anti-climate and spelled part 3 that I will never see. Terrible movie.
