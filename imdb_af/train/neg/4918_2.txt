A rich Harvard dude falls for a poor Radcliffe chick to the dismay of his strict father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> Tricky, pure, and especially, juicy story of a 'class' battle when the rich child, Ryan O'Neal, brings a librarian's waif to his sobering parents to spot. Ali MacGraw is the social fianc√© with the dirty mouth while John Marley plays her pious Catholic father, but no one in the film is more annoying than O'Neal himself with his flanking portrayal as Harvard's champion juppie. <br /> <br /> Follow 8 (!) Years later by 'Oliver's Story'.
