A great opportunity for and Indy director to make an interesting movie about a rock musician on the brink of the stars. It could have been a decent movie if it had John Livien's traumatic past and how it tortured his psyche. Instead, it's a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon. John Livien's suicide mother's hero was John Lennon and she wanted to be as strong and productive as Lennon herself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance and his wonderful ability to cultivate himself for others to learn about their own lives, it showed Lennon's legacy as being a confused, drug-addicted soul acting as a God rather than a man. I'm a big John Lennon fan and this movie reminds me of another "crazy" person obsessed with Lennon, Mr. Mark David Chapman, Mr. Lennon's killer. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Should we be reminded of this? John Lennon has given so much music to the world with his music and honesty and I was repelled to see another disturbed person as the main character in this movie obsessed with Lennon, not his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono commemorated John Lennon's memory by making the memorial in Central Park giving his fans a chance to pay their respects and remember John. Instead, the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer's attempt at suicide. I found it so disturbing and disrespectful for Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died a cruel senseless death, and to see such violence near this site felt like a terrible wound to any Lennon fan. It totally ruined the movie for me. It could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his unholy murder by this irresponsible movie.
