Do you ever want to eat worms? Here's a 'documentary' to show you how! Yes ... The child eats live worms! And it's about the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as a bit boring. I totally agree on this. The movie just goes nowhere .... unless you love to eat worm! It's a movie, it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for .... because nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Now on the technical side: They had to give the child a haircut. Who does he look like anyway ... Bozo the Clown. It was almost comical. I almost expected him to change into the rough dog or something. <br /> <br /> And, moreover; the child was too fat to ever look hungry! Would have kept him a few weeks before filming the junk food. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie almost made me sleep. And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before leaving the scene for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I would admit that the scenery was very impressive. And if there was a decent story to go with it, it might have been a hit. <br /> <br /> It looks safe enough for kids to watch: The bear scenes and the oddball eyeball were too weak to scare most kids, and the short skinny dip scene showed nothing no. <br /> <br /> I gave this one a very generous 3.
