Okay, I saw the sneak preview of this silly movie. First, the movie is set up and not really, they all play. They can't sing. They are far too full of themselves. It's terrible. Yes children like 8 to 10 can enjoy, but it's really stupid. I mean they say their driver is a kid. And there is the record company fake. This is stupid. Don't see it. <br /> <br /> As for setting and directing, not so bad. It's a cute documentary, but it documents a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> See it if you don't really enjoy good music. Also, it's very wheat-like. It's not even tasteful. I hate being so mean ... but it's really a piece of junk.
