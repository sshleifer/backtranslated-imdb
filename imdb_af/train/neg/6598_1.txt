This "movie" is a travesty. No, wait - an abomination. NO, TRUE - this is without a doubt the absolute WORST movie ever made with beloved characters created and created by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers was ridiculous and sacred, but even ventured to "remake" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are asinine and money red. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy died respectively from 1957 and 1965. Why would anyone ever think that appropriate updates for L & H in the person of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain would be beyond me. I agreed to be completely scared and ashamed and I was definitely not disappointed. Everyone involved in this pathetic, moronic, shame, must be black ball of anything and everything related to Hollywood and film work. Avoid this movie at all costs - you have been warned.
