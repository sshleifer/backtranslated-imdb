OK - I REACH this movie ... I'll give this movie credit - alone - to make me such a hard-hit horror fanatic. I could never see this movie alone. I also heard many stories about the effect it had in its original release at the theaters. Incredible masterpiece .... Terrible, psychological things frighten my pants. They bless their hearts, everyone who made this wonderful movie. I love it. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is so scary - it's the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life! Not what happens in the movie and the idea of ​​the movie is not scary enough but always got me - was Brendan's fantastic play. Best horror movie ever. Nothing can ever be scary again. Halloween looks at its worst.
