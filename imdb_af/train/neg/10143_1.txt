FURY FLY takes the mantle of the WORST Steven Seagal movie I've ever seen ... Until now. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible drill with no action scenes of any interest, Seagal isn't really trying in here - he's fat and his voice is once again bought. <br /> <br /> The Co-star does not cost better because it is a little happy load of 3 degrees. <br /> <br /> The direction through Keusch is very poor and it is no surprise that he is also responsible for another Seagal stinker (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The script written by Seagal itself is ridiculously incompetent. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb $ 12M was spent on this boring cargo of old tosh. If these numbers are correct, I feel a great tax resource, because nowhere near that amount was spent. <br /> <br /> FLYING FURY is actually a shot for Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - who needs to be better than these trips. <br /> <br /> It has NO redeeming features whatsoever, Give it a MISS! 1/2 * from *****
