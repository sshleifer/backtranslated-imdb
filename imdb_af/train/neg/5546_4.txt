This movie is something like a sequel to 'White Zombie' as it is made by the same man (Halperin) and contains zombies. Halperin, George A. Romero of his day, fails to deliver with this one. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia, and a search for the source of his power so that the zombies can be sent for free. Also a love interest for the evil man. <br /> <br /> Where this movie really excels is in the picture. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very beautiful and the zombie looks very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we don't really get many of the zombies in action and the love story seems to be playing too much for a horror movie (although it later has a valid plot reason). <br /> <br /> I would have loved to see a few 1930s zombies attacking helpless folk, but this movie just didn't deliver. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) waited to fight against our heroes. And using Lugosi's eyes? A good effect, but misleading because he is never in the movie ... why not make it with the new actor's eyes again? Overall, a movie that can be a good one with a small script can work again and can one day be a powerful remake (especially if it's in the same post-war timeframe). Heck, if they can lift up "The Hills Have Eyes" then this movie hopes.
