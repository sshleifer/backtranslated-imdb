I could barely keep or cut off or just turn off this thirst, but I decided to keep it out if it was just for the reason that something might happen. This is the work of a writer / producer / director / special expert, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster film. That's how he wanted it. What it seems to be is a lot of acting, either slightly hammy or just ordinary and without much merit, and scenes that repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the river water (oh, and what happiness does a woman just be naked in it ... even though there are DIFFERENCES!) <br /> <br /> It's just nonsense, but I think it's not too harmful. It's not very stupid and once or twice we get a semi-interesting look at the Brazilian "culture" (which is the father walking through his herd or other pieces of a slope of 'hey, that's NOT America not! '). But any hope the director has had in the decisive Mitchum or Carradine is being washed out at the best pedestrian and in the worst striking banal and stupid dialogue. It doesn't help that when we finally get something from the monster, and the "action" happens, it's also stupid and with just a thin appeal. Usually I feel sorry for a movie maker who had many problems completing a particular picture. In this case, it achieved the better part of the mid 70's, but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it is called ... nah. <Br /> <br /> If you get the Elvira DVD dual feature of this (poor print quality) with Blue Sunshine, make sure you hit this one. Unless of course you die an Elvira and can't help you hear her nice comments; Personally, I'd rather get Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots of Mystery Science Theater on this roasted turkey.
