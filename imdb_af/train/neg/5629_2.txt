I just hired (yes, I paid money to see!) This movie. OMG. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As another reviewer put it, Mrs. Colagrande, go out of movies, PLEASE! Never make or appear in another movie! The lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe. No, it's not fair for the cantaloupe, which probably goes for it. She doesn't know how to act; she affects a disgusting look ALL the time (reminds me of many of my always angry young sisters in Europe). She is not charming; she's not pretty. There is no real story. And the editing! There was nothing I could see! It's pretty bad when you watch a movie and just to get through it, press "forward" on your remote control and nothing happens! I mean! ..... I shouted involuntarily, "Cut! Cut!" What were they thinking? Well, of course, they thought they'd make a movie and get paid to make love on the screen! Nice good deal for them; nice raw deal for the viewer! I think I'm going to throw now.
