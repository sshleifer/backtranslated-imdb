This movie is so bad that it just ignores reality. The filming is on his best school material, the acting is pathetic and the director must be banned forever from filmmaking in any form. It's so bad, it can't even be seen as a comedy like something like the Showgirls. The only thing about this DVD was the cover art. <br /> <br /> All I can write to those of you who didn't have the accident to testify is to do a well-deserved favor beforehand and don't waste your time or money on this piece . of garbage. If you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects, there are many more worthy in such a rich as this trash.
