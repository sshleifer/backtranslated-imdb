If you like movies about hotels, hotels, homes, states (both the Eagles "Hotel California"), etc. What the people who "just go through" read you almost any Stephen King novel. If you want the setting of "Disappearance", start by reading King's "Desperation", but also look at The Shining, Salem's Lot and Needful Things. <br /> <br /> The crow motif, the desert, The family desperate to escape or avoid is tired. Why didn't they just make the movie from the "Desperation" novel? Maybe they approached King and he nixed? Must be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin are happy to be reunited and they both performed well over the years, but they are still TV and direct-to-DVD caliber actors.
