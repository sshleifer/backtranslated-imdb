5 minutes in this movie I was hyperventilating, shaking, and writhing in pain. And not the good way. The story is about a group of idiotic children who make prank calls to a psycho that is always a good idea. Show off psychos do not like prank calls, because in 2 minutes time he is dead at their door, poor Williams, mother and father. Well, come on for 15 years and guess what? Still prank mobile phone calling people. You would have thought a terrible murder would keep them from doing it again, but no. So after about two hours and too many screaming ripoffs I realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a serious urge to take my own life. This piece of crap is not even worth laughing at the rogue production, the "play" or Rutger's diminishing career. I love crappy horror movies, but it's the most unsatisfactory piece I've ever seen. Just don't.
