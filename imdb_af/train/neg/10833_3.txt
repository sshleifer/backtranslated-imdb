I wanted to love Magnolia. The plot reminds me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories coming together at the end, but Magnolia went wrong halfway through the movie and I was lost. I almost switched it off occasionally, but I felt that I had to stay there until the end, little did I know it would be another 1 hour a week. Thanks, I hired, rather than see it in the theater. I shouted in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the finite frog scene. My DVD player hasn't forgotten me yet and I don't blame it once. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring and useless movie.
