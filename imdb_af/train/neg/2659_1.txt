I'm sorry, but it's just terrible. I told people about this movie and some of the bad acting in it and they hardly believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, today's Japanese troops are withdrawn in time for the days of Busido warriors. With their modern weapons, it's almost everything. Once the troops realize something strange happens, everyone in the back of the transport should say "Hey my watch stopped"? Imagine that lines like this are repeated 15+ times before they say anything else and you have the film's lack of greatness in a nutshell.
