I'm sure Operations Dames were a favorite with the drivers in the day. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a plot you might miss if you were otherwise busy. And if you had to get into the mood for other activities, you got some curly tuck on the screen to get you in the mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there aren't many Operations Ladies going for it. It is in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs along with a British thumb gets a little too far ahead and needs to return to the UN lines. Bad enough, but these guys also come across a stranded group of USO girls and their choreographer in the same trouble. <br /> <br /> You know what's sad about this movie, it took women generations to eventually be accepted into the army and in combat situations. This bimbos of the USO backs female liberation. In fact, even the hard-bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men, can hold it in his pants. <br /> <br /> But it was probably better to remind some of what they were with the drive. for. This call is better off if I do not recognize any of them for any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Operations ladies are definitely a teamflop.
