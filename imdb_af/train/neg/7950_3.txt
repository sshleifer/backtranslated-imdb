Cafe Lumiere is a beautiful photographed negligence. Unknown to the work of the director, I am well versed with the filmmaker to whom he pays tribute - Ozu Yasujiro. While not even approaching Ozu in greatness, Keeping nothing of Ozu's depth of emotion and meaningful concentration within a closed space. One of the things he totally misses is Ozu's attention to character - we are not even introduced by Keep to his main character (a perfect page). There is no medium or shots of his people. One of the DVD extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us exactly what Don't Like - a good look at their faces. <br /> <br /> There was a great Spanish movie by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "nothing ever happens". It would be a much better title for this senseless exercise. Throughout the film, clues about a dark Taiwanese composer are given, some of the work we hear on the soundtrack. But the clues, like everything, do not add anything. Unless you are a train engineer, this movie has nothing to recommend it.
