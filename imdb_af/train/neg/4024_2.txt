This movie is just awful. Poor John Savage had to repel this layer to be in another movie. He dies as a rare kind of vampire who helps a lady who looks like a washout and thrown into the street hooker who is a dancer at a local strip club. She instantly tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who is one of the rare vampires, as they are carried away on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is then awarded by a short leader of this rare vampire race that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie just goes crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a miniature with a tattooed spin on his head, also one of the rare ones. He picked up the Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. It just gets redikulas. And then the roughest special effects they can come up with, Corri throwing her organs and pulling them out of her mouth. And you can say it's all to fall. Her son does not know what to do with his mother's new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of calm. I enjoy a good vampire movie, believe me I do, but I just hung this one. Even the photography smells, turns in and out of the camera with the camera this way and it tries to make it look like the vampires are moving too fast for the camera to stop and then the camera is all chasing in the scene of Savage the son of Corri until he makes himself blind. Avoid this one!
