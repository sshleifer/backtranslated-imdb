After watching Awake, I came to a conclusion: director and writer Joby Harold woke up with the intention of laughing at the spectator because the simple fact is that the film is full of ridiculous elements. Wake up many plot holes and it's full of absurd and ridiculous elements (for example, the hospital uniform uses the spirit of the main character ... did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor?). The concept behind this movie is a little ingenuity, but all the plot holes and the absurd things make this a silly and crazy movie. With the exception of the big Lena Olin, all the actors are performing badly. Hayden Christensen has zero expressions, and the same goes for Jessica Alba. The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard has been tremendously wasted on his role. Wake is a laugh of the spectator. It's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation is: Skip this crappy movie.
