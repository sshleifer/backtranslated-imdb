I've never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> It is possible to make a shootem video game and make it into a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: Absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this movie, you don't bind with any characters, because ... you don't get a chance. <br /> <br /> The only hand that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Apart from this unique character, the outcome of the movie is meaningless, as all the characters were lifelong from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Error 2: The worst popularity picture ever. I love shooting battles. I love when the heroes open on the bad and clean house. Heck, I like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes. But this shooting battle was strange. I think the best way to describe it is "Apathetic". I watched people feeling more emotional and emotional while playing the video game. In this movie it felt and felt that the "actors" simply shoot through everything that moved without emotions. <br /> <br /> Why? Where's the trash? Where is the rage of anger under the gunfire? It is supposed to be children caught in a raven. But even real soldiers who professionally and mercilessly depict their people. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters, I recommend Sam Rami's Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the disaster that is the home of the dead. I hope they burn the master and all the copies of this movie.
