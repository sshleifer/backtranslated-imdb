Despite a good first season, this series never came close to realizing its potential. It was a prequel for the original Star Trek series. It was almost doomed by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who forced to limit and limit the definition of a Star Trek series. this futuristic display is becoming increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic point of view). The real performer, Brannon Braga, has not helped by his unspoiled and tired repetition of previous Trek episodes and carelessly takes into account the internal myth of the franchise (it was painfully obvious that he was just for the payroll ). I have never seen a series "that has been so long-lasting, has done a disorder to a cast of talented actors (Jolene Blaylock). It is as if this whole series is produced in bubble outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience (even a Trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic desires and desires, but it seems that Berman and Braga have succeeded in convincing Paramount's higher performance that "Enterprise" is "franchised" "has suffered and that its core has not fallen away, but has been driven away. Product a quality offering that meets the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) will come. <br /> <br /> Simple put, in a TeeVee universe where we are given, there are such as Battlestar: Galactica "and" The Shield ", the powers-it must must be a" Star Trek "that is measuring and dramatically competitive. It's just as simple and easy.
