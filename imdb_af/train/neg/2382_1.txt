There are movies like "Plan 9" that are so bad, they have a charm about them. There are some like "Waterworld" who have the same inexplicable sign as a car accident, and there are some like "Desperate Living" that you hate to admit you love. Cowgirls have none of these redemptions. The casting put together has enough talent to see almost any plot, and from what I'm told, the book is nice. <br /> <br /> How can this movie be so unbearably bad? To begin with, the director seems to have brought a cast of names with no other tie than the 20 somethings will bring. Then tell them to do their best Kevin Costner imitations. Open the book randomly and start shooting whatever is on the page to make sure that the wide expanses of America stay interesting in any way. Ultimately, you are giving up the work of your brother-in-law because the meat packaging plant just laid it. He has twenty years of cutting experience. <br /> <br /> This movie now defines the basement for me. It's so bad, it's not even good to be bad.
