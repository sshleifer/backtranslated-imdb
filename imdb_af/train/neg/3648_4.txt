A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to a doctor (James Karen) to try and get pregnant. It works but Adams is slowly becoming aware that something serious is wrong with the baby. <br /> <br /> A very interesting idea is done thoroughly by a lousy script - the basic idea is OK, but is screaming predictably against the end. I saw every "twist". The direction is poor - he has no idea how to shoot a basic scene. The production values ​​are - to be nice - in common. Very unsuitable. And the gore screens are too unpleasant (I almost switched it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach) with bad special effects. The movie comes down completely when it becomes clear, they have no idea how to end this movie. <br /> <br /> Some good actors make it slightly portable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are all good at their roles and watched me, but it was about it. This film was barely released in 1991 and is still unknown - it's easy to see why. I give it a 4.
