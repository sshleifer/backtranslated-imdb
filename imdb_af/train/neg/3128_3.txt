... of this horrible movie! There are so many things wrong with this movie, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. It's amazing that something goes up and proves it's the worst. The music! I noticed that the movie listed two composers. This should be the reason why every frame has music, from the absolute worst "D" movie style drive. They have never heard of the expression "less is more". It was so painful to listen, I muted the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so good. You must be sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they didn't see such roles in the twilight of their careers. See it at your own risk.
