This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it suffers from some problems, like every low budget production, it's a good start for me. Beaton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story is not very new to movies like The Burning and every Friday the 13th since part 2. But the shows are sincere. So many big budget movies just got the actors going through the movements, it's always nice to see actors trying to grind their craft. <br /> <br /> The story is about the murder (and possible return) of an unsuitable classmate. The other is sworn, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, the friends are killed one by one by a gruesome stalker known as "The Bagman". Who will survive? You have to look. <br /> <br /> If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably shouldn't bother. But if your taste goes more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people hitting their vessels, then watch the "The Bagman".
