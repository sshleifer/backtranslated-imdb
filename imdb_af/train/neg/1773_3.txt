Oh, honey! Rarely did a horror movie get bored or laughed so much. After an enthusiastic start with an intriguing point of view, it falls into not much more than a slasher flick, with some supernatural and sexual side. The usually excellent Alice Krige is in this one mess, and the plot twists are ridiculous. Don't bother unless you're really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
