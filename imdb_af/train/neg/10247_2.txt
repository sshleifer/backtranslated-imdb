It's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, its horrible. Christopher Lee is good, but he's almost not in it, the only good part is the start scene. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the title. "End of the World" is really a bad movie, I stopped seeing it close to the end, it was so bad, just for the hard b-movie fans the brain has to stand this vomit.
