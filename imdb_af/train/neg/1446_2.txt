The movie is an extra-long story of a classic novel that completely fails the original adventure spirit. The scary American Patrick Swayze is played as British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality. <br /> <br /> The movie continues by changing to Hollywood's story by changing both the plot and the characters. fits more comfortably into the accepted form. The film can be predictable throughout, even for those who are not familiar with the story and are plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing battle order. <br /> <br /> All in all, a terrible addition to the already bad collection of films based on King Soloman's Mines and Allan Quatermain's legend.
