My God, what an incredible movie it is! Remind me so much of the similar scene in Mel Gibson's movie "We Were Soldiers" when "the company is not lost, they were just cut off" and the other scene in Pearl Harbor when the British officer told Ben Affleck: "If everything Americans are like you, then God helps the nation waging war with America! <br /> <br /> Put all 3 movies together and you'll have enough BULLSHIT to fertilize the entire Sahara Desert. <br /> < The story of the cut Battalion may be real enough, but the movie could have been done without the American preaching jingoistic propaganda attached to it. There were audible sounds in the cinema during the above-mentioned Pearl Harbor scene.) The Lost Battalion is really in a class of its own. <br /> <br /> "Americans think they are unbeatable ?? Inspired courage? "I actually clipped and condemned, near the puked, to all the swallows thrown out by the diarrhea disaster. The combat scenes were well made (3 stars for that), but if the writing was missing, wrapped in brightly colored ribbons, The writer, James Carabatsos, also wrote the other screamers, Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge, somebody, please shoot him before he writes such garbage. <br /> <br /> The director, Russell Mulcahy is also an Australian, God, the shame !!!
