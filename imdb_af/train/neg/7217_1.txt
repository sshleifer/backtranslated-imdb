I just watched this DVD at home. We love Westerners, so my husband hired it. He asked me halfway through my apology. The hall, costumes, accents - everything was off. The part that made me so angry is where the man didn't shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow, because he took the fat man's soul. His only excuse was "he just left 2 arrows." We looked at it all the time and, as someone else said ... too many bad things to explain one reason why it sucked. I mean, the fact that the boy discovered the evil stone of the collector on the same month and day, what is the point? And why was there a grave yard where everyone died on April 25, but the people whose souls were taken by the collector are still walking around? If you want a movie after a few beers, it can be your movie. However, if you want a true Western, you will hate this movie.
