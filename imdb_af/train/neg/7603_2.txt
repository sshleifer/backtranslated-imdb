I'll be blunt. I'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass, who doesn't want to look for anyone. If any of the governors wanted them, they could only have taken her in a heartbeat. It was entertaining on MST 3K, but didn't rent the right version. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
