Everyone who wants to be an editor should see this movie! It shows you every mistake not to make in editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's actually so bad that I can't write a sentence without an exclamation mark!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs was a pretty good family comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this successor is badly the receipe of the first one. The funny parts can be counted on one hand and maybe half of it. Clavier outperforms his role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because she replaces her), but it is grotesque. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny on her play, she's not in this movie because she doesn't act like she did. I know it has to be difficult to replace someone who was well in a role (Lemercier won a César award for her role in the first movie), but she made a big mistake: instead of her play, she played. • Lemercier plays her role! As far as the story is concerned, it's just too much! Of course, at the end of the first movie we knew there would be a successor, but Poiré and Clavier had to try to write a simpler story like the first episode. The gags are repetitive, childish and dear-vu. No, really, there are no more than 3 funny parts in this. The only good things can be the costumes and some special effects. So you only have 2 reasons to see it: 1) If you want to learn how to edit a movie, 2) If you want to waste your time or if you really need a mindless moment! '10/02
