It is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen, and most likely the overall worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were horrible and they seemed too hard trying to play their roles like dorks, hard guys, jerk, all this, etc. And the bigfoot itself was terrible. It seems to be a kind of computer-generated image of the days of Atari & Intellivision. At one point near the end of the movie as an army of sasquatches was pursued after the remaining survivors, one shot and as it runs, it looks like a poor man's version of Donkey Kong himself! And one is hit by a bullet and the blood that comes from it is just terrible animation. Another thing that was annoying was the music. Way away too much music (classic score or whatever you call) throughout the movie. It never ended. Oh yes, the movie is also boring. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I strongly recommend taking your $ 3 or whatever they pay to rent this movie and spend it on a liter of gas or a value menu. VERY AWFUL!
