I was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to see a horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment, it has become a horror in more of a comedy. The acting, dialogue and flow of the movie were all very poorly done. Many did not make sense. For example, there is a party of about 30 people and they are all afraid of one person, despite being in a secret place and everyone is healthy for young adults and the man who threatens them, haggard sounds. I thought, maybe it was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they tried too hard to make it look horrible - emphasis on trying. <br /> <br /> The blood and gore were also poorly done. I've seen Halloween costumes look more credible than this. A man with his head cut cleanly ... looks clean - missing signs, flesh, flesh, blood, and even the head. A strong downward strike with an ax on a body should suggest itself in something. The man seems to be swinging a bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Reflecting who the main villain was supposed to be, but contradicting other parts of the story. What was in the guy's mind to turn around like that? If there was a twist, you should at least build it up and add mystery and tension.
