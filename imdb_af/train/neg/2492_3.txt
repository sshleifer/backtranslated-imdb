I think I've seen worse movies, so I give it a 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been !! Possibly Xtro (nasty and dull) or maybe Creep (just dull), but it's a struggle to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say it's a poor man's under-occupation, with an even poorer man's Jean Claude Van Damme. The only redeeming feature was to see Casper Van Dien. I always wondered what happened to him to Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> Judging from this site, he is stuck in TV movie hell .... Casper, be more selective .... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just transferred and there is a half decent movie about the named Criminal Law ...... now I'm really starting to get malicious over the last 1.5 hours !!!
