Ronald Reagan and a bunch of US soldiers in a North Korean POW camp. They are tortured ... We learn North Korean Communists are bad people ... We learn that Americans' bearings are growing very slowly during days of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress it but I finally burst out at this movie. It was the scene when Mr. Reagan comes out to tell the Communists that he wants to be with them. Then he asks for a bottle of brandy. Next, acting stone colds newer, he takes a drunk companion, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to m. Martin's hangover to heal. Of course, the North Korean Communist guard is as stupid as they come. So, the drunk leads the wait while Reagan goes to get something from a drawer, which is next to a lot of empty boxes. I'm sure he meant boxes to contain something; but of course, Reagan makes them enough to shake to reveal that they are empty. You have to laugh! I think "Prisoner of War" will especially appeal to family and friends of those who worked there - otherwise it is wasteful. <br /> <br /> * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
