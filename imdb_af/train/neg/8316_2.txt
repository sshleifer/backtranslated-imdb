Cedric Kahn's films are character-based, rather than action-based (I think of L'Ennui and Feux rouges), so it's worth seeing this series of truly expert motorcycle jackets that are among Succo's efforts. I don't find Stefano Cassetti an interesting actor; he reminds me of pro-athletes who are being batted in movies, like Bret Favre. The bare stare looks like a very evil deer caught in the headlights. A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality, rather than admiring his skill in karjacking. <br /> <br /> The little actor there comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl takes Succo through the storm. The interview at the police station is a wonder of stubborn stubbornness with a little fear of the future being mixed. Le Besco apart, there is little recommendation to recommend this movie.
