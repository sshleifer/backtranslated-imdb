It's the worst movie I can ever remember. Everything was incredibly clich√© and delayed. The acting was also terrible. The camera work wasn't bad, but it still couldn't solve it. The author / director of this film should suffer from Down syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career. I want to have the other half of my life back, which I spilled, it looked. I'd rather see a video of the grass growing than that. I can't believe IMDb makes me write 10 lines to post it, but I feel this movie is so bad that I have to continue to warn others about it. The reason I came across this movie is that my friend requested it from the local library to be the Kris Kristoferson movie that eventually "Disappears". I don't know whose fault it was for this garbage that landed in my DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. Finally, the director / writer of this movie hopes I'll ever recognize him on the street.
