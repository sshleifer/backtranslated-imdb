Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it wasn't singled out. I'll try to show this one. Let's be really !!! No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character. There was a good battlefield at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to wonder if old Chuck just can't hang out with the best. Did he delay so much that he should eliminate such a litter and hope his reputation would carry him through the whole movie? Chuck is a wonderful martial artist, and as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a pretty good actor, but the art is to combine both of these features into his movies, and this one. Very disappointing for our Norris fans. Chuck, stay as the main character in your movies, because it doesn't work for you ... Gary
