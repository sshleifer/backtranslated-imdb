Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic direction, the annoying porn soundtrack that is constantly running over the overhand script, and a copy of the VHS cannot be redeemed by using liquor. Trust me, because I held this turkey to the end. It was so pathetically bad that I had to find out that it was a fourth-rate run of Springtime for Hitler. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only thin spark of interest, and it was just because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something similar but a thousand times better, Beyond looks at The Valley of the Dolls.
