It's a very old and inexpensive movie - a typical low-budget B-Western in so many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of John Wayne's early films for poverty driving studios. With both actors, their familiar style and persona had not yet been completely formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not look exactly like the Cooper of a few years later (he speaks in this early movie, among other things). Unlike the average B movie of The era, there are at least some interesting elements that make the movie unique (if not good). If you ever want to see the woman married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita starred as the female love interest, and it is a very strange deciding choice, as she has a strong emphasis (she was French) and was not even close to "movie star pretty". She was also married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But to me, the most memorable and weird aspect of the movie is the seemingly gay subplot - like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s (and we thought it was a new idea). Gary Cooper's character is aroused by two men who hate women and do everything they can to keep a lot of the movie clean of women. This misfortune alone does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues throughout the film that the film's creators indicate. They really tried to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, by the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and dies long enough to crawl to the body of his fallen friend and then fall - with his arms around him! It was nice edgy stuff for the time and I think it makes this dull movie really fascinating today! As far as Cooper and the plot go, the movie is a bit of a disappointment and very passable. Unless you are curious about Damita or the homosexual undertones, do yourself a favor and find a better Western.
