The films of UPA are surprisingly well-rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality light years are behind those of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM at their first. Unfortunately, the UPA style (which started around 1950), due to rising costs in creating beautiful cartoons with high frame rates and beautiful backgrounds, began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. The movies were inexpensive to make and they received several Oscars to prove that the cartoons were now mainstream. As a result, the petty animation was the norm and this trend was not reversed until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA movie is one of the early days. The characters are drawn very simply (any simpler and they would have used stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly. Simple line drawings with colors are added in a very flabby way (often with a sponge and which rarely fills the items). <br /> <br /> Regarding the story, it's a jief story with a strong jazz style attitude. Some will like it, others will only find it very hard. It's the traditional "Frankie and Johnny" story and because of the shooting and everything, it's probably not a good movie for the kids. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, it's not a very good movie for me either! Some will read my review and I undoubtedly think I'm a stool (which I am to some extent). However, I love animated movies and a bit of this minimalist UPA style is going to be a very, very long way and you can't seriously consider big artworks - just very fast-paced cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and try to watch some classic cartoons or something - anything else!
