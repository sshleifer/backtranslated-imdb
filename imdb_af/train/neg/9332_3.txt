It's not really a terrible movie, and Glenn and Keitel are top notch actors. Furthermore, they do an acceptable job with the very poor writing. The landscape is lush and the plot has some interesting twists and turns. Furthermore, I condemn why these actors and the crew made the film, they are professional and they are paid for it. But I'm not wondering why studios spend the time and money making a movie and not releasing it to theater audiences? Even if a movie is a box-flop, it certainly makes money. If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn, rent the video or take it on TV, like me. Allowed, the movie will not help solve the immigration issue with Mexico, but the experience is much better than 90% of the standard TV rate of today.
