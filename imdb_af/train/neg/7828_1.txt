Along with 2 days in the valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just one of the long line of Tarantino frost-offs that has emerged since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere that creates the film is amusing for the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make the unforgettable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to increase the "hip" quotient. You're better off hitting this one.
