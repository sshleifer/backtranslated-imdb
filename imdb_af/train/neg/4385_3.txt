Satan's Little Helper is one of the better B Horror movies I've seen. If I say better, I mean the story. The movie is a new plot, something not so clich√© in the Horror genre - something fresh. But there are also some ridiculous questions that come with it. Questions you will ask yourself throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The first movie caught my attention while I was the Horror section in HMV. I was tired of all the so-called "horrible" Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different. The cover for Satan's little helper caught my attention right away. As you can see, the picture draws you in - it's cool! I knew it was a straightforward DVD release - but I had a chance. I mean, I just saw the "Boogey Man" the previous night, so it can't get any worse! After watching the movie, I was half satisfied. I loved the plot of the movie. It was very creepy how the killer pretended to be the little boy friend so he could kill. In a sick way he thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror. It was a good idea to put the movie on Halloween night. This way, none of a masked man will think of a small child. They'll just think he's his guardian. But this is also where the "plot holes" begin. <br /> <br /> If your son comes home with a "friend," he treated with tricks - that's good. You will not think of it - if he was 9, or about the same age as he was. However, if he appeared in a mask with a strange man, you would surprise and protect your child. You will ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself. You will ask why he is with your son. He didn't know him. You will tell him to please leave. He is not a family friend. He is a stranger. Now we have to teach our child not to talk to strangers. In this case, the mother is completely fine. Huh? They never seem to be a bit strange that the "man" doesn't speak. Terrible, they think it's the girl's boyfriend, but after 10 minutes you don't talk the mask off and ask him why he doesn't say a word. <br /> <br /> The movie goes from there. The thing that had me the most was, though, the mother said, "Do you want some cider?". I can't count how many times she says it in the movie. It's like, oh, you're dying - we do have cider, it's all good !! The movie was promising and couldn't deliver. It was more of a horror / comedy, and even if it failed to deliver. I think you can make it a "Dud", "Flop", etc. Name. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the cover art. Although, something tells me it's not worth the $ 12!
