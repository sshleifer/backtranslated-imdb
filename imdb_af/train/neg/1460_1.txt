If another Hitler ever emerges, it will be partially resigned to nonsense, like this film, which propagates the absurd mind that he was visibly angry from the start. Far from following such a person and choosing him to the highest office in the country, bad people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would have died in a ditch, unnamed and unknown. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading the accounts of Hitler's closest companions - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge for example - will be hit by the fact that people have found him a friendly, intelligent, generous man. He was also a brilliant speaker, and the fact that his speeches seem to be moving over to modern ears ignores the times when they were made when the struggle of pumping in political speeches was common. This is the over-emphasized anti-Semitism, which was not a central plank of the early Nazis - which were mostly anti-communist - not uncommon or unusual for times. The movie makes it seem as if Hitler's only ambition was the Holocaust from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of ten millions, you can ignore fleck-lipped ravers. live the one depicted here. Rather look at a charming, charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work benefits the country beneficially and substantially. I'm afraid his personality will be much more like Barack Obama's as Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I hoped a lot here and did nothing but caricature. The fool who made this thing committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of 'Reefer Madness'.
