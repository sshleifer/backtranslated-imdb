Front: Nothing <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Everything <br /> <br /> Plot summary: A female reporter walks into a hitchhiker who tells her stories about killing people killed by zombies. <Br /> <br /> Review: Never in my life did I get a movie so bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of about $ 20, TZC is a horrible horror movie that relies on lame, forgotten actors who can't act to save their lives and it's more gross than scary. How is a movie like this even made? Simply put, TZC avoids a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> <br /> My last 2 cents: This movie was made humorous by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. Their brain really needs to be damaged to get such a powerful movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If this were for me, this movie would get the negative score. bajillion)
