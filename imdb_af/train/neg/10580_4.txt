I saw it last week after I bought the DVD cheaply. I wanted to see it for centuries, and find the plot very intriguing. So my disappointment was good to say the least. I thought the lead actor was very flat. This kind of part required a show like Johny Depp's in the ninth port (of which it's almost a complete rip-off), but I think the TV budgets don't always cover this kind of acting ability. <br /> <br /> I also thought the direction was confused and dull, and only served to remind me that Carpenter didn't do a decent movie since the mouth of madness. Regarding the story, I was also disappointed there! There was no way I could meet my expectation, but I thought the payout and explanation was poor, and the way he eventually got the anti-click from the movie. <br /> <br /> It's written by one of the major contributors to AICN and you can say he loves his cinema, but I'd have liked a better result from such a good initial prospect. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD back to the store the same day!
