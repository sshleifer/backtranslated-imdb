As you all know, JIGSAW has not made its way to Blackbuster because of a member of Full Moon's own staff, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells all the video chains. He recently released a movie, BLEED, which he sold to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced that the Blackbuster buyer would not take any JIGSAW and double the number of BLEED. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop, and BLEED looks like a hit. The big problem with this is that BLEED is one of the worst movies, and as we all know, JIGSAW is good. I encourage everyone to go to the BLEED page on the internet and vote for the movie that has shunned JIGSAW and all your talents. Similarly, you need to go to the JIGSAW page and cast high votes for it (if you don't already have one). We need to get JIGSAW to at least 8 or 8.5, and BLEED to about 2 (so on the internet's 100 worst movie list). Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> Hope you all do well, - Matt
