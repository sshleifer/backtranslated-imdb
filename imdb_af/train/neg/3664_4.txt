Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a yeti, causing him to become a werewolf. He was accidentally killed after attacking his cheating wife and her lover and later being revived by a female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, in mind, used control experiments. Daninsky later discovers an underground asylum discovered by the bizarre topics of the doctor's failed experiments. <br /> <br /> Upon hearing Naschy's death from colleague Jon Kitley, I drove through my collection for a suitable movie to watch. In my scramble I found that I own not one but three (!) Copies of "Fury of the Wolfman". The film is of dubious video quality, the sound is moderately baptized, the cinematography is sometimes a bad style. And the American versions removed two love scenes. Honestly, without a remastered, uncut copy, I didn't really get the right movie in all its glory. <br /> <br /> This movie claims it's the fourth in a long series about the werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky. I guess that's true, but you won't know about the movie itself. The plot is sometimes confusing, and there really is no indication that it is a successor. If you read the summaries on Wikipedia and compare it to what is printed on the box, you will see that I am not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film's shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through. Although it has been swinging for many years, it was only released in 1973 due to problems with finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic, and he hated working with him. It's really not light accusations, and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say on his behalf. <br /> <br /> Chances are, sooner or later, you're getting a low grade version of "Wolf's Fury". It appears in a variety of three-packs and box sets, so you can accidentally acquire and not even know. What really needs to happen is an American uncut version, with a decent audio and video mix, and the love shows are being thrown back. As far as I know, it doesn't exist. Let's honor Paul Naschy's legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves.
