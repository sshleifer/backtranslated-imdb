I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie just like "28 days" or so ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens, except for a group of women apparently infected by a foreign virus that allows her to eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> This plot gives rise to a series of unfortunate scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> VERY VERY GOOD. <br /> <br /> * Rate: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
