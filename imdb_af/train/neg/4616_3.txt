This movie did not age well. Maybe it's just the impact and artistic characterization, acting, and direction we've seen at The Sopranos, but for the first time I've only seen Prizzi's Honor on DVD. <br /> <br /> The experience to watch It should be with an audience 24 years ago, but it should be quite different. Not just the violence, but the mere idea that it would be a satisfying end. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a good shock, but it was so out of character ... Even when was this move supposed to be set? The cars are all as if they were from the 1960s, yet the World Trade Center towers (completed in 1973) were clearly visible in many city scenes. <br /> <br /> Another way that the film is outdated is the mere idea that a passenger can travel coast to coast with a knife on his person. <br /> <br /> Somehow, in the mid-1980s, the public found this film attractive and funny. In the mid-1980s, the late spirits meet: only you can live.
