I can't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984. It has a little ridiculous, and none of the stupid plots ever mentioned. Who will ever ask the Texas shoulder, Joe Don Baker, to return an Italian man he arrested in Italy in Italy? Not to mention that the title of the movie doesn't tell you anything - it's actually a generic title for a wannabe action / police film I can think of. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I just saw it on MST3K with Mike and the crash as a shield. They notice the female lead's resemblance to Elaine van Seinfeld ("None of them are spongeworthy") and jerk up on Baker's weight. This movie is probably not worse than Mitchell, but Baker's reputation definitely preceded him. When his title appeared at the beginning of the movie, Tom said, "I wish I was illiterate so I didn't have to read it."
