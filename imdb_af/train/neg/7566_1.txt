Prior to this issue, Neil LaBute said about the 1973 original: "It's amazing how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. I'm like, come on! You may not have the new one, but if it's your favorite soundtrack is, I don't know if I * want you to keep my movie. "<br /> <br /> Neil, a word. Maybe you want to go from here too; As Lord Summerisle says, shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent. See, Neil, the thing about the original, is that Paul Giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it. The filmmakers themselves regard it as a virtual musical. Along with Richard and Danny Thompson, and Bert Jansch, it began the 1970s Folk New Wave practically. To undermine it, it is advisable to introduce Jaws without John Williams. Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly. The result is one of the most breathtaking, arrogant, useless repetition of a British cult classic since Sly Stallone's Get Carter. <br /> <br /> The original apparently left Nicolas Cage "disturbed for about two weeks." Thus, during the two-week window, he has the idea of ​​re-imagining that one of the latest films about faith between faith has ever been invented by a writer director who was previously known for his completely unreliable male portrayals jingoism. It's like a parlor game: what will you get if Sam Peckinpah Bambi adopted? Or Gaspar "Irreversible" Something made love again, actually? (I really want to see it). Unfortunately, someone took the playroom seriously: All LaBute managed to snatch out the original's guts while collecting it with his own Gormless Sex War presentations. After she did not rescue a little girl and her mother did a fatal car accident, Cage's highway patrol spiraled into a medication. Then he gets a letter from former fiance Willow Woodward (this one on kudos name memorials), now living on the private island community of Summersisle? those extra 's' stand for 'redundant' ?? and wants Edward to help the missing daughter Rowan. <br /> <br /> Summersisle, it turns out, is a female-dominated joint, sustained as a haven for oppressed women and refugees from the Salem gate trials. Here the matriarchs see the Olde roads, and the few men are near-dumb racial mice. It's like Lilith Fair on a large scale. Summersisle's main export is honey? a symbolic and literal headache for Edward, as he is allergic to bees. "Beekeepers!" weep Edward. "They look everywhere on this island!" Well, that's probably because Summersisle's main export is honey. <br /> <br /> While conducting his investigations, Edward hears of an upcoming Mayday ritual called "the time of death and rebirth". He discovered that the previous year's crop had failed; almost die from bee sting; and finally comes to a conclusion (a conclusion which, although it would no longer be obvious if the local people had a timetable of events), that Rowan would be burned alive in a pagan ritual for a ensure abundant crop. He also meets the Queen Bee of the hive, Sister Summersisle (Burstyn), who has her own plans for him that includes the eponymous Wicker Man: "The drunk must die." <br /> <br /> First, the good news: any concern Kage will be taken out of the air at the last moment of the Wicker Man's flaming jaws. A fleet of black CIA helicopters can be put to rest: it's timing. It's about the good news. "This is a story of which the chapters have been carefully written", namely Burstyn with sublime irony. Although the basic cat and mouse representation (and credits typography) is preserved, it is the original of a scorched earth policy. <br /> <br /> The most important of Shaffer's original script was that, according to ritual, his Christian buyer came to the island of his own free will? and above all, was a virgin; the perfect sacrifice. In reducing cases to a sexual, as opposed to a religious power struggle, LaBute offers the flashiest of qualifiers for a grain offering. By the time Cage worked out, he was the bait, you honestly couldn't care less. <br /> <br /> And Cage is one of the worst things in this; a rumbling, shooting donkey? an asshole whose tongue just looks too big for his mouth. "Goddamit" he moan after he salvaged a drowned Rowan, with all the spiritual agony of a man who left his morning alarm for half an hour early. One hope it is his character's regular dependence on pills that reduced him to this condition? alternately tired, then full of preppy, remaining vim. If so, it's a good portrayal of an intact IQ administered with anti-depressants. If not, don't think so. As Willow, the saucer Beahan is equally awful, and offers her lines as if it is in competition with Cage for the most? Half-hearted delivery. While Burstyn lacks the remarkable threat to convince. Who is afraid of Naomi Wolf? <br /> <br /> Every element that made the original big? The lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs, the ingenious score, the dialogue (Lord Summerisle's majestic "You Have Beautiful!" Were replaced with the rather less attractive "You Made It Great!" Wiea, dude!)? was replaced with a winding battle-of-the-generation thriller with occasional crash-bang wallop. On behalf of women who are restraining; after all, it is a LaBute movie. Cage's Sister Beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes; Impotent little men will be aware of how their ultimate hippie chicks finally got what he got. Hyuk hyuk. <br /> <br /> The closure coda sees the whole rotten crash under the weight of genre cliché: In a bar, two guys walk in a couple of Summersisle girls on country leave, flirty fishing for fresh martyrs. At the moment of their successful pick-up, you expect half the women to turn around and give an exaggerated wink and thumb to the camera. <br /> <br /> Another thing: Experienced creditors may have noticed that films that have an exceptionally high number of producers (anything up to 10) tend not to be much cops. The Wicker Man has a total of 18 producers.
