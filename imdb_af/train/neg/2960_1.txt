This is without a doubt the single worst movie ever created. There is no argument here. This is it. End of the story. The story is youthful and sub-moronic, and seems to have been created by a three-year-old who is fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is just silly. It is unthinkable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining. The jokes are also completely lame. If you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself happy. If your morbid is curious about how bad this movie is, please don't make me describe it. Words cannot express how terrible this movie is. It's not just bad as being a bad movie. Even those who have cohesion, if not entertainment value. This. . . It is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story you've ever told and increase its bad level by 5,000, and you haven't even come to terms with how horrible this movie is. After Pokemon has given the Movie one point, this movie does not give a single point like charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take film class? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. It seems as if some amateur made this film thinner on paint. If you have rented it, please take it back and ask for a refund. And don't even consider renting it again.
