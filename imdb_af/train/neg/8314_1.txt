I saw Chan missing when it first came out, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York. Perhaps it was the perspective of a few years away, but this movie looked as if the essence of the city and its people was better than anything I've ever seen (still). It focuses on a particular community - the Chinese - but that's good, because so many of the city's soul is broken by the institutions, the faces, and perhaps above all the voices of the characters. <br /> <br /> These are not San Francisco's tourists. The institutions are humble and daily: a taxi cab, the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, Richmond district houses, small Chinatown apartments and small business offices, the piers, a Philippine older center. That's how the city looks and feels like day to day for the people living there - even now in the era of Silicon Gulch urban redevelopment. Unlike, says Dirty Harry (in his own way also an excellent San Francisco movie), everything is filmed on street level: We understand the characters' views from the perspective their environment gives them, not from a few fine vertiginous shoot. <br /> <br /> Wang apparently filmed in B&W because he didn't have the money to do otherwise, but one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he reaches. The often harsh, translucent sunlight quality is one of my closest associations with San Francisco. Everything seems to be exposed, the buildings, the hills, the other landmarks in the scale and in a funny way, the people are passing on. The streets look more individual and possibly closer to you than they might be in another place may be. Wang's photography makes it perfect, and even helps the story on points. <br /> <br /> Wang catches the speech and conversation style of Chinese and other San Franciscans better than anyone ever has, I think. If there is something like a true San Francisco accent, then what you hear from the balding taxi medal broker (I think) talking in one scene is listening to the way he speaks to the other person side. yourself! <br /> <br /> The story is poignant and, despite some very small mistakes, makes its points beautiful about the desires that the hearts of people living in old immigrant communities, including the justified political and ethnic resentment, and little ironic amusement, which helps to burn them, all these are delicately communicated - perhaps why some respondents here think the movie meanders. become more personal. <br /> <br /> Chan Is Missing ends with a Chinatown travel book series backed by a goofy novelty song from the 1930s (I think) about San Francisco and all its crazy diversity. caricature, yes, but also not quite from the point.
