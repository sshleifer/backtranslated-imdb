The second renaissance, part 1, shows us how the machines first rebelled against the people. It all starts with a single case in which the machines claim that they also have the right to live, while people are putting a robot, something they own. Therefore, they can do everything they want. <br /> <br /> Although this is an interesting point of departure, the story comes with (violent!) riots between robots and humanity from then on. Somehow it doesn't seem right, as another reviewer shows it, it's a bit too clever. <br /> <br /> The animatrix stories close to the core of the matrix (especially Osiris) work for the best. As for the second renaissance part 1, I would say it is too violent and too stupid. 10/04.
