Say guys, some previous reviewers have almost written a novel about this episode. It's just an old 60's TV show! This episode of Star Trek is remarkable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real place. In contrast to the TNG and Voyager range, which is entirely limited to sound stages. <br /> <br /> This use of an out-of-place (and baby) gives good depth and an almost film like quality to a very ordinary episode of this now-dated and well-known show. <br /> <br /> In addition to some notable exceptions, "The City on the Edge Forever", "Earth" and "Tomorrow's Yesterday". The old series Star Trek must be serious moth -balled and put out it's boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes of 79 are quite a poor batting average. <br /> <br /> It's typical of the boring things brought back by Gene Roddenberry, in fact, unlike the general beliefs that some people worshiped on the ground, he walked, he actually made a lot of garbage! For example, he does not deserve to be spoken in the same breath as Irwin Allen. <br /> <br /> Just look at the set of Enterprise Bridge from a modern point of view. They use wobbly plywood for the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic back and cheap cardboard above the dashboards. You can clearly see the folds in the paper! Any expenses saved or what!
