OK the plot is, wait you got me, there is no real observable plot here just a string of optical stray sex scenes, joined by scenes of photographers taking pictures of beautiful ladies (sometimes a combination of the two). Then a devil comes to death to rape the men and kill the women and become poetic about the meaning of life. Moronic special effects, bad acting and bizarre philosophy, you get what you expect from a movie with a title like this. I think it'll be someone's cup of tea, not mine, because I haven't seen a good Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu-directed movie yet. <br /> <br /> DVD Extra's: Subtitle Maintenance with Director Kazuo Komizu Part 1 (Part 2 is on the Entrails of a Beautiful Woman's DVD); and Theatrical Tailer <br /> My Grade: F
