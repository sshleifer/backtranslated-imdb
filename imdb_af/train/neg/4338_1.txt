really awful ... main actor got OK ... the movie, plot etc. totally crazy and inaccurate, it might as well have been a sequel ... anything that had little or no relevance to Carlitos Way ... and should avoid as the plague by Carlito's ways, fans ... no mention from Gail in the fact that he ended up with another bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how he was caught, no mention of how he ended up in jail. .. they tried to make it like the original with a flash back in the beginning ... but to be honest when I classified it, I was looking for a zero point ... unfortunately I had to rate it higher ... <br /> <br /> It's a terrible attempt to pay cash on what was one of the 90's best movies. Overall it was about Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life wasted ... for all the "action" in it, it was really boring slow and predictable ... again at any Carltio's Way fans avoiding this fiasco ...
