Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. He usually gives regular performances, such as The Straight Story, and The Gray Fox. He also does pretty well here, but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget, poor writing and so-so photography. The Miller-Movie formula gives it a 4. Richard gets a 5.
