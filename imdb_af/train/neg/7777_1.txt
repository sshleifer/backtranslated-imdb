It could be a cute movie for kids. My grandson watched it once. He watched it a second time when I watched some of it with him. <br /> <br /> When the bear gets lost on the ice bath and he is in the water, he tries for a piece of ice. It says, "Come back stupid ass fool." <br /> <br /> I don't want my 3 year old grandson to see movies with words like that in it. <br /> <br /> That's why she rated children. Must be child friendly. This is what I would expect. postponed by warner brothers and G rated I would expect it not cuss words in it. The words don't even fit the movie in most places, as it looks later. And the movie goes out in many parts.
