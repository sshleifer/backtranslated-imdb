I've seen all four movies in this series. Everyone goes further from the books. It's still the worst. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled in any way! The directors and producers had to call it any other thing than "Love's Abiding Joy". The only thing about this movie that looks distant from the book is the names of some characters (Willie, Mission, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names / ages / sexes of the children are wrong. The whole story line is not true in the book. <br /> <br /> I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to make a movie under her title that is by no means correct. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they have no emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, it might happen. It's clean. Don't look at it, though, if you hope for a shortened version of the book. I hope it will be the last movie of this series, but I doubt it. If more movies were made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr. and others closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if followed, will make excellent movies!
