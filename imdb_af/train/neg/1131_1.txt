A disgrace that even a talented director, Desplechin, could not evoke a decent performance from a sly talented actress, Phoenix, did not bring Esther Kahn content to a very concise and clear plot. In an effort to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor's fate, the show and performance were confronted and poorly performed to draw compassion from the viewer. In an exaggerated time, the superfluity of Esther's struggle is melodramatic to be effective and to reduce the storyline in a bad frame of disastrous performance. The content is incoherent and free as Phoenix struggles to execute Desplechin's mission, just as Esther is trying to do the same. Never feel a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never feel victorious in Phoenix's talent.
