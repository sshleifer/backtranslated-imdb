As with most of Ben Affleck's movies, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. This is if you want to call it a story. Many points were not kept in mind. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say this because that would mean that torture would have been longer. As for any of Ben Affleck's failures, this one is no exception and can only be survived by other actors. Even then, the play was confronted for the most part and was not credible. The journey down memory track with actors I didn't see in years was not worth the admission price. Everyone thought it should be told, they would also quickly join the ranks of the "has-bone". My choice was to wait for my car to get stuck or to watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all, I'll laugh it one ... especially because it's all I get from it.
