It is incredible because it manages to be terrible at so many levels. The writing, the acting, the direction and the choice of role play are all terrible. The costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also quite terrible. In a strange way, I actually enjoy this movie as soon as I accept it won't be good. It is a pity that people will spend so much time and effort to make it so bad, when they could really make something reasonably out of the way (though not very credible!), But rather we become rather misleading and chaste treated. story of dragons and knights, which lacks any of the charms of other such fantasy films. Let's just hope the Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis's haircut makes him look like He-Man. Do it!
