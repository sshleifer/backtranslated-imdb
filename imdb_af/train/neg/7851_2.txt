As outlined numerous times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is NOT a reminder of the (generally non-disregarded) mid-80's successor to Wes Craven's 1977 original. But the desire to give these postmodern persecution-to-remake, Craven himself (a double threat to his son, Jonathan) decided to make a movie of the same quality - horrible. Former music video director Martin Weisz takes the reins of Alexandre Aja and is clearly over his head - but one wonder how someone could have scratched a watch movie from the Cravens screen 101. Not only are the characters (in this case a gang of goofball national guards are sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) completely unpleasant and prone to really annoying genre potholes (played without a lick of irony), but they break constantly jokes that are not funny. After watching their total inefficiency during a practice exercise, their fate is against the repulsive, roaming cannibals painfully obvious. Just this time - as in the original 80's sequence - the script is so simplistic (scarce) that any potential subtext is envisaged to prevent the ants from being repulsive (we are treated with a combo birth-murder during the opening credits, plus a free rape for those who did not erase the DVD at the center!). Even the mutants in this outing are personality-free freaks of no memorable stature. The sticky, rubbery makeup FX looks like the rest of the film to hide its face from embarrassment. I really got a surprise at the end of Aja's otherwise excellent movie, and the producers are literally at the end of the "Hills 2", which places the stage. installment ... but the Cravens and Weisz have created a film that is such a cynical bastardization of what works in the 1977/2006 versions, that they are being harassed to find an audience after this insulting slap in the face.
