A general horror story about a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates to hell. This is reminiscent of Polanski's "The Tenant" (a year before "The Sentinel"), but is too far from the film of the Polish filmmaker in any way. "The tenant" was so disturbing, while "The Sentinel" was not at all. <br /> <br /> What is more surprising about this movie is the film: it's full of the big names of the American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veteran actors thinking for food. <br /> <br /> Pronunciation: rare reception. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
