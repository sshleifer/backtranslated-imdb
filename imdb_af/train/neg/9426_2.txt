After opening credits there is about a minute a black screen. A moment of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then she and two colleagues drove to a rock concert, after many wrists they hit something and walked off the road. They wake up in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her descendants. Unfortunately, the murders are very soft for a suspected Video Nasty. The strife ends stupidly and predictably. No one involved in the mess will ever record anything again. So there are still happy ends. <br /> <br /> Eyebrows: Sara Ansley is topless, and Laurel Munson has full front view <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
