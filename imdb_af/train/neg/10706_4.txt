Wow and I thought any Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I thought the movie couldn't get worse, it proved wrong to me. The story was good, but the actors couldn't deliver it. In addition, they made many mistakes about how proper archaeological digging is done. For example, you do not handle artefacts until they are categorized and accounted for. The biggest crime in the decision was the archaeologist girl. She is a poor actress and I felt her play really made the movie less realistic when it was already. The whole concept of the knights who had been underground underground for many years was quite stupid for me. I like the idea of ​​how they disappear and things, so it seems almost depressed. I thought the characters were not good enough. You didn't get much background and it made it harder to call them.
