Creation Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Movie. This movie is a piece of shit right from the start. It has a very stupid "plot," very pathetic "play" and so-called "special effects." <br /> <br /> Some thirty-year-old "post-teens" are trapped in the bush with crazy, reptile, endless rubber suits. What you get with this movie is a lot of conversations and precious little action. You have girls talking through the bush, and then you have guys (with heavy mascara) talking through the bush. The whole thing is so boring! <br /> <br /> Most of the movies rarely see the creature itself. When shown, the image is distorted to mask a man in a rubber suit. The movement shows that it is a pack, hence the reason for the blur and distortion of the image. <br /> <br /> It's NOT a good movie in ANY since the word, and those who praised are probably the ones picked up from the street to "act" in this really boring movie! Save this one for sure!
