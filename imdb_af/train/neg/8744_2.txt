I accidentally finally watched this movie. I'm not sure I'm sorry or not. I felt like I was watching the movie from that group of film school students who didn't make the cut properly. It plays every Hollywood clich√© imaginable, while we are busy with the "corporations" keeping the ultimate evil message. Subtle this film does not know. In this respect, it even manages its own spoilage. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be a computer nerd's fantasy world. The main character is an attractive teenager with a girl, but is a programming genius and apparent hacker (I think), among many other nerd-fantasy-come true elements you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I also knew it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be a good tip. <br /> <br /> Can't recommend one, I'm scared.
