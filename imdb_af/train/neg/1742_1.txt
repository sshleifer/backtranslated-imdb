Well, I've just had a bad race with Hindi movies lately. I asked the video store for Apharan (Prakash Jha), but it was not yet available. So I had to fix this one. It was the stupid Hindi movie I saw (and I saw quite a few). No wonder BOllywood is the stock of the whole world! If IMDb had negative ratings, I'd give Garam Masala a -10. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing a TV show about the jazzy premiere they had for release in Mumbai. All the usual celebs and their sidetracks arrived. For a strange reason, people expect good goods from Piyadarashan. I didn't like Hulchul, Hungama, or his other movies. Hulchul, probably chosen from Tamil or Telugu, has come as a very hard-in-your-face, which doesn't make much sense, except in a Bollywood movie. This last piece of the complete CXXP proved that this guy has NO BRAINS. Who made him a director, even a Bollywood director? <br /> <br /> Anyway, after the movie now. What starts out as a romantic escapade becomes a non-sensual woman. Two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (it's not similar to No Entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and office share? Jezuz Christ, now they copy their own stories!) Well, in anyway, there is a cook or chef trying to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi-lateral love (aka multi-tasking + multi-timing). What finally happened, I have no idea. I turned off halfway. That ridiculous mess. I can't believe they even released it. And how sadistic to run into their own filth! For what audience did they do it - the poor illiterate Indian masses (700 Mil on the last score) or the well-liked NRI Desis staying in Phoren? Either way, it doesn't matter. No group has an idea that makes a good movie and deserves such divine things. <br /> <br /> It's a brief review because there's nothing to write about, but the usual bag of F-grade garbage. Bollywood must change its name to Follywood. And yes, this review is much better than the movie itself.
