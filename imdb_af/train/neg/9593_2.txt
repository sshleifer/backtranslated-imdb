Due to some of the comments in IMDB, I expected an action movie - perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid or one or one, or a comfy, but essentially a action movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever I watched, it certainly didn't feel like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (though the prologue tries to make it look complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of killers. <br /> <br /> Pull the first one off (they never appear in the movie). Then just let one of the assassins, the princess, become a villain on a revenge journey. Add in a rebel love interest with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they haven't been able to change it in a story or movie yet. Between a few random sequences and some strange visual images that Sci-Fi is trying to get on a low budget is a sense of emptiness. The movie just doesn't feel like a movie, but a strange, incoherent, boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
