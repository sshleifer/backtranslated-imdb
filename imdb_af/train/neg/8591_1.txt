I try to decide if jumping into a houthacker would be nicer than this drink. It ends with the destruction of what once was a classic pair of movies. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas's career. He wants us to swallow the Annakin, is Father nonsense? I never believed it was true. This film justifies the feelings. The story hasn't worked since Phantom Moron, and every new movie just piled up the crap until everything left was a toy. I have to go. I know where some new rocks are to be thrown. You want spoilers? Here they come. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Father is NOT their Father. Duke Countoo had to turn his sides on while he could still. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good to anyone. Obi Wan lied to the first two films for Luke. Annakin didn't build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother to collect him from the beginning. Chewbacca has fleas. This whole mess with Father and the fall of the Republic can be blamed on the dumb b *** h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had any brain, she wouldn't have come to Annie in a light year, but she said what George Lucas wrote to her. What a dope!
