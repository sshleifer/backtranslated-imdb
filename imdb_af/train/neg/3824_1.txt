I feel the movie has not portrayed Smith historically. The purpose of this movie was to tell Smith's life in a way that the LDS church leaders would be comfortable. Historical accuracy was of little concern. The film is designed to be a "faith-enhancing" experience, not a balanced view of Smith as a man. I took it on myself to study Smith's life and read both LDS works and no LDS works. The movie, like most LDS projects, was beautifully filmed and performed well. However, this was not a realistic depiction of either the beginning of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> A significant period was given to repairing an accident involving Smith when he was seven. While this event was undoubtedly important in shaping its mental outlook, the main reason for its inclusion in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is to portray Smith's teens. The film is silent about the Smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820s. Another problem is that the film shows that Joseph Smith is doing good fighting, it doesn't show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent. <br /> <br /> I could keep on and on. This movie was by no means historical and should be regarded as a fiction movie about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any purpose other than entertainment.
