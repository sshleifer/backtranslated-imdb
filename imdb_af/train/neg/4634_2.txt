Of course, some talent attached, Maria Bello is always wonderful. but it is just a terrible waste of time, depicting every character as someone who is abhorred and exploited so that someone can make a movie from an 'interesting' story. Well, I hope they get it from their systems. Unfortunately for the audience there is no insight, no sensitivity, no context, and really no human. It will all be fine, except that it has no humor, no horror, no context and nothing constructive to say about the story that is trying to tell it. Bad things happen, you sit and watch it, you don't care, so what? 99% of the time, the words 'based on a true story' form an unintentional warning to the audience. this means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by events they have heard somewhere. They just throw them on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience feel without the filmmakers having to do something about the job. I hope they had a good time making this movie. it stinks on ice.
