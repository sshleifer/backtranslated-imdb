Darar started off with a good start. The first scene really left me at the edge of my seat and wondered what would happen next. Other than that, the first half of the movie is a total BORE. All the first half of the movie is about, is Rishi Kapoor, the head over heels in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do you think he's not a little old for her? Things eventually crawl on the middle of the movie when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; And wow what an ugly he is! He was an over-protective, neat freak with a very hot pace! He defeated bad Juhi for no good reason! One of the reasons I don't really like this movie is because I can't stand Juhi (my favorite actress) being abused. This film generally has too much abuse and bloodshed; I find it so sick! <br /> <br /> Anyway, all I'm trying to say is if you're thinking of renting Daraar, put it right on the shelf where you found it and choose something else!
