Born in the 1960s, I grew up watching TV "Movies of the Week" in the early 70's and the spectacular films that have been featured regularly, including Crowhaven Farm, Bad Ronald, Satan's School for Girls, Kolchak the Night Stalker ", etc., but this one is just stupid. It is clear that the author of a few years before tried to capitalize on the terrible Manson murders, movie stars Dennis Weaver of "McCloud" and "Duel" boast as a father who His family camp on a beach takes the family to meet some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family, for which reason is never explained, and Weaver's pacifist attitude is hard to swallow. Because of that, call the police, beat the hell out of them or something, don't sit there and blow it over.The play is pretty lame, the story is incredible, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini, but it's about it. Ignore it if it ever broadcasts on TV.
