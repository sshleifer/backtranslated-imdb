She resists both his marriage offer and abortion, sends him to a profitable medical profession, and raises her daughter herself in poverty. Flash-forward 16 years and the daughter has grown into a beautiful, loving, young woman. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, still holds a smart but caring relationship with his daughter and? .. I'm running, and even worse, making the movie sound somewhat interesting. The acting and scriptwriter are so top-down, that you will explain a groan in almost every scene. The chief offender is Bette Midler, but John Goodman is close to her as her alcoholic friend. Each scene looks more confronted than the one before to the final, which is really a hoot. This drama is considered a dramatic piece, but no more than Grade D, but as a camp, it is an unintended B +. <br /> <br />
