The Gospel of Lou was a great disappointment to me. I received an email from the theater that said it was a wonderful and inspiring movie. It wasn't great or inspiring either. The cinematography was pretty sudden with the whole movie. Many of the scenes were flashes that were done in a way that sometimes couldn't tell what they were about. The voices are often distorted without cause. Many of the people in the film were also far-fetched. The relationship he has with his former son is never made clear. Also, the whole movie has somehow, and then suddenly BAM, he is healed and inspiring people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the bad things in his life, so he lives his life as he lives, but when he changes, he does not leave boxing, he teaches others how to box. Thumbs off.
