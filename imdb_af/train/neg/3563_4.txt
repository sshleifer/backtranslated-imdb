For the most part, this movie feels like a "made-for-TV" effort. The direction is ham-fisted, the acting (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overwhelmed and soap. Denise Crosby, in particular, delivers her lines as she reads it cold from a cue card. Just one thing makes this movie worth watching, and as soon as Gage comes back from the "Semetary." There is something that is bothering to see a small child killing someone, and this movie may be more than just a few. This is absolutely bone cooling. This movie does just one thing right, but it beats that one thing right out of the park. Most popular only for the last 10 minutes or so.
