Anyone who can find salvation value in this piece of crap should investigate their head. We received the submissive, heroic addict, part-time hooker woman with lacerations over her entire body, lacerations of repeated beating by an abused boy. Now his breast milk is spraying over the kitchen floor. The release somehow came to Helen Keller's hands in running water. We have the man who started accusing a prostitute who is just his daughter (she is upset about him because he came too fast) and ends by murdering his female colleague, having sex with her and then having her cap. We have the child who is mercilessly rinsed by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mother. You see, it's all circular. Deep, huh? The only decent moment in this terrible pile of triptych is when the father kills his son's torture. It is a good thing that this turkey was shot on video because otherwise it would be a waste of expensive movie it would be. If the guy who thinks artists are interested in this scrap, it's really serious, no wonder, most people think artists are insane. We saw this lousy movie, and then on "Zero Woman, The Accused." Oh my God, it was a tossup about which one was worse. What happens in Japan today? Sick, sick, sick.
