Was it a blemish when Tori complained that her first boyfriend treated her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (the killer) became a designer of artificial intelligence? I think so. Scenes to make you squeal: Enjoy in a kimono (what do you call it if you make clothes attractive instead of picking them up?), And a climb on skis! Definitely determine the beginning and end, but you can grab a sandwich during the second action when all the plot happens. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah. Does Tori ever make it to paradise, or even from the snow? Nope.
