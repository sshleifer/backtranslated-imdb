It must be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looks as intriguing as that of Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow worked much better. The plot was worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few of the horrible moments in the movie, a flight attendant stands in the open doorway of a flying 747 and tries to lock the door without sucking the windmill of 250 miles per hour? After that, the plane lands from a few kilometers starting from 8000 feet, which is impossible, even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When she was on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she was instructed to pull the valves, HUH !! Come on the flap is there to ensure that you lift up at low speed when you use the runway to turn the engines and give maximum power! I can keep on small and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my answer will be the size of the English dictionary. It's a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
