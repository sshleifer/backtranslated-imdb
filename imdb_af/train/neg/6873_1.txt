The TV productions at the beginning of 2000 were between poor and bad. Before points such as (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk) were, the TV didn't have the right hit, catching the attention and interests of the 2000s viewer. Titles such as (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena) or even (Baywatch Hawaii) were not encouraging for you to watch and follow or at least not so fascinating and interesting the time as what preceded them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact, it's men in black, meet the X Files spoof! (As if it were the special unit 1). But even according to this brilliant formula; It didn't work well. It was promising; At that time there was already a saturation of the "supernatural" cases after a decade of many X files, so also the natural spirit to do so. But (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest in this, or a strong one when it comes to a comical Sci-Fi show. It was highly ridiculous, for example, where every sexy situation had to become ugly unstable. It enjoyed the bad taste sickly. (Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any supposed sexual attention, was all sleepy. Certainly, the show had a funny look, but overall it was unfit for work. Obviously there was nothing more interesting than his main idea. Below (Evan Katz) 's other works as co - author and co - producer such as (Seven Days) before or (24) later it must be a low point. Despite the distinctive personality, it has become a stupid mockery for most of the time. Therefore, if that were the purpose, they did indeed make one of the syllables! And really, it will be one of the rarest times to be grateful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it!
