Along the grinding films of the 1970s and 80s, one of the undead was probably the second most popular horror subgenre. While slasher movies had 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween' to make the whole thing go, zombie flashes had George Romero's 'Dead' movies. And unexpectedly shortly after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to fill in cash. Many Italian directors were particularly interested, such as Lucio Fulci, who brought us a year after Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead'. , known as 'Zombi' in Italy and some other countries, and it was there that Fulci's film was known as 'Zombi 2'. Apart from the undead, it does not relate to Romero's film, but it is a good movie. It was a great success in Europe and 9 years later a successor was born. <br /> <br /> Benefits: Very beautiful, sumptuous scenery. Awesome Score. The acting is not good, but the game is a game and looks like it has the experience. After some kind of slow start, the pass moves like an action movie. Lots of cheese and unintentional healing for bad movie lovers. Good work on makeup effects. Lots of blood and decent gore. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Virtually plot less. Nothing you haven't seen before. Blatantly rip off some of the first few 'Return of the Living Dead' films. Cardboard characters. Is not overly older due to the bad 1980s rock music (Not that I say that all rock music of that time is bad), clothing and overall feel of the movie. Final Thoughts: First, it's not a true successor to Fulci's cult classics. In fact, I don't know if it was ever meant to pick up where that movie ran out. For those who don't know, Fulci was ill during production and eventually left and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei's films are pretty laughing, but like this movie is very good campsite. And that's all this movie really is, just something to watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (Bad-it-good score) 2/5 (Serious rating)
