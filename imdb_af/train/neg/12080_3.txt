I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I was anxiously waiting to see this episode. I'll first comment on the movie, then the MST3K episode. The recipe for this movie: Take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material and a $ 1.25 budget. Mix well, then drain from all life and movement, to dull and lifeless. Put cold in a large, ordinary stone kettle. Movie, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors deserve at least some credit. Well, now the MST3K episode. I will admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway. I understand this was also the reaction of several other vendors. But when I watched it a second time, I realized that there were a lot of intelligent references and good lines that I missed for the first time. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! It takes a few views to catch each line. Give it a second chance and you'll see what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
