Shortly after I saw this film, I questioned the spiritual power of every actor and actress who took part. Elizabeth Shue is a laudable actress, why would she embrace such an overestimated opportunity? However, I have to give credit where credit is payable. Some moments in the film were unpredictable and rather transfixing, but they barely made up for the indignant tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman who has any kind of self-respect to justify.
