I gave this loooooooooooong movie a "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can't read like a speed reader, you'll never get the captions trying to keep up with the speedy Spanish speed! And what the hell is going on in the plot if you can't read the captions. Endless stare and dots and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or so. A few good cinematography, but also some so dark, you think your screen burned out. How it won something I'd never understand. Difficult to talk about "ACTING" as the lead actors only look and look lovingly when they do not push each other. The character Geraldo is so attractive that it's hard to believe someone will push him away. And what's with his mother? I just didn't get it most of the time, except that there were three guys who all had a history with each other ... but never figured out who was "EX".
