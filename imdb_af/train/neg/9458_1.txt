There are many comments already posted and exactly how I felt about this movie, so I keep it short. <br /> <br /> "The Grinch" I thought was wonderful - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as Being a versatile smart actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laugh by being annoying. I liked him a lot in his "Waynes World" and "So I Married a Ax Murderer" days - but I've never loved Austin Powers and the cat in the hat just finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible - the gags were horrible! Not suitable for children, not only in adult content, but in the fact that some of them were so dated, they did not amuse for 50 years! The plot was messy, messy, messy! It is a pity because the children were very nice as their mother was. They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it wasn't for Myers, and the over-portrayal of the Cat resurrected. <br /> <br /> I mean - does Myers have a look at a script? Was one written? The other actors had one - but the cat just looked it up! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would like to mention that the sets and props were great !!! But unfortunately they can save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Seuss - the man was a genius! Don't ruin his reputation by adapting his work in such a lazy, messy way! <br /> <br /> 1/10
