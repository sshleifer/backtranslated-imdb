The writer turned up a nice, good idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much of the film away that it almost unstoppable. Basic elements such as character development are crossed in the best shine. Inconsistencies also raised their ugly heads. A massive mansion in the middle of rural Irish countryside? Characters that only appear in the gardens in a stormy night (I can add at very convenient times)? All in all, it wasn't bad. I classified it a 4, mostly based on Alison Elliott's story and talent.
