Former private-eye-turned security guard has his latest drone work and is immediately given the opportunity to return to his previous profession. His command: to strike a mysterious French woman who just arrived in California ... and apparently through pack-and-tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the movie noir genre, without enough sting or plot dynamics in the script. Director and co-author Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the photo was taken without his involvement) does not give the impression that he has great regard for the 40 films that his "Chandler" was wearing; his nostalgia is appropriate, but also bitter-toned and somewhat indifferent. The handling is inquisitive, laudable, and Warren Oates is well-cast as this 70-year-old on the private dick archetype, but the movie has no snap. It's nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the movie - although it's not much to do, and Caron's hot and cold running character is constantly busy. Vibrant cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice shooting, but it does not come to any kind of boiling point. * 1/2 of ****
