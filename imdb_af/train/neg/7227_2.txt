While others can claim it by viewing other works by Bilal, one would appreciate this movie better, but it fails in a big way. It is not alone. The plot is a mishmash that confuses symbolism with the substance. Here's an idea starting with a definite story. Then create symbolism around it. We start with two different stories, this woman who somehow changes man, a "god" judged for some reason, but to get one last flake on Earth, and this mysterious John - Character that seems to be developing a kind of resort "just outside the borders of the city. Why? None of these questions were answered. But give us, no. There is no development we want to empathize with any character in the story, the closest we get to Jill and even then the development is at its best spotty, unfortunately, the film is caught up in the whole of the visually impressive (what it is) but at the expense of the motives. see that it has been rewritten by someone who can give himself away from the material and not feel that every picture should be in the picture.
