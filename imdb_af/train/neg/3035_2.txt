We were served - a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I will admit that since I'm white and have no practical experience in the "competitive world of dance dance," I may not have exactly the authority on this type of movie. On the other hand, I know a bad movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> And, son, I just saw it. <br /> <br /> Included in Low Budget Vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid, "How Touching", tells the story of how important it is to follow one's dreams - even if the dreams are surrounded by hard, Annoying hip hop music and talking dialogue will not understand the average person if he or she has had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I'll try to give a little summary of the "plot". First, there are two actors who look like LL Cool J, who work in a motorcycle shop in Toronto (the racial diversity mecca), but still have time to dance eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are a few other guys in this "crew", including a token white man and a man like Denzel Washington in Malcolm X. There are also two women in the movie - one Looks like Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the old "Flip Wilson Show." One of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents had spent all her education on a drug-addicted brother or sister. The other girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, is definitely not good. <br /> <br /> There is another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's Buckwheat, while being another actor who is a Huggy Bear knock-off. These guys are competitive walkers. Apparently, this activity is very difficult in the hood and they all practice the great "Step Monster" jam in Detroit. Because I couldn't understand 90 percent of the dialogue (maybe there were some subtitles, such as in a Bergman movie or one Snow Video music video). It's hard to explain what happens, unlike many of the Serena Williams girl (who never smiles) becomes a freelance stepper (moving from group to group), there are a few dance dances and very annoying hip hop music . <br /> <br /> It's a typical clothing-to-rich story; kind of like "Rocky" with a very bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without the laugh. <br /> <br /> But why a movie that had a huge impact on black audiences should have drug addiction, bad parents and a first-degree title that says the phrase "How she move "? <br /> <br /> However, I was moved by this movie. Shifted to leave the theater as soon as possible.
