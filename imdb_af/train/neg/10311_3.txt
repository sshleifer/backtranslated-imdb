SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgetful action movie, Lorenzo Lamas does his usual tough old / beautiful son, and his future real life, such as Kathleen Kinmont OJ Simpson is a detective who has disappeared on his ever since public genius. Translation: Cable TV Filler. There is not enough skin to qualify as a Shameful Enjoyment. <br /> <br /> The script has some gaping holes. Best / Worst Moment: In a grim scene, OJ's partner expresses his aversion to the mortuary. OJ responds that some of the bodies are fairly warm, or words to it. This vague nile profile is offensive enough; But in the light of the murders that were committed shortly after this movie was released, it is really horrible, and therefore entertaining in an unintentional, horrible way. I was so scared that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose. Now it's a guilty pleasure. BC
