It is not the most well-made burst replays of all time, but for what it is, it is quite amusing. The plot is lame, but death is not bad. I have to be honest, if you don't follow the tapes that appear in this movie, you won't find this movie as funny as it does. I knew someone who watched this movie and was really disappointed by the poor quality of the movie, but you have to understand that it was made in the free time to be on tour, between playing and drinking with friends. It is not taken seriously. It's the best punk uber cheese and with over 100 kills, most of which are ultra gory, it's a fun movie to have friends to watch, drink and cheer up!
