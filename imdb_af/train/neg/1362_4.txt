Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very priceless movie. <br /> <br /> The film shows promise that Ustinov is released from prison for embezzlement. He convinced Robert Morley to leave so that he could accept his identity and start hacking computers at a very fine firm by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duo for movies. <br /> <br /> Morley sounds like he did in 1938's Marie Antoinette. Maybe he had to return to that genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is at best ridiculous. Hard to believe that next year, Maggie Smith has completely changed her ways and has a breaking Oscar performance in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smith was made here to be an apparent head, but by the end of the movie she was the brain of the outfit. Bad the writing didn't go with her.
