Horror spoofs are not just a 21st century thing. Before the Scary Movie series, there were a few examples of this genre, mostly in the 80's. But as the franchise is mentioned, most of these movies are hit or miss. Some like 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' mostly rise above it, but others like 'Saturday the 14th' and his successor fail to deliver. But from all these kinds of movies there is a particularly great offender and it is 'Transylvania 6-5000', a great waste of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Benefits: A great role it does best. The dim humor is amusing. A Corny, but catch the theme song. A few good Transylvania places. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Wireless plot. Mostly boring pacing. Most of the humor just doesn't cut it. The samples are given little to do and little screen time. I thought it was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies? Lame end that will probably make the visitors angry. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: This is a comedy? If so, why are the very funny pieces so few and far between? Comedies are supposed to roll us on the floor, not throw and throw our eyes, hurt that it is over. I can't believe Anchor Bay has released this tired litter. I will admit it's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's worth nobody's time or money, even if you're a fan of any of the actors. See Transylvania Twist instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
