This movie is like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is somewhere a plot among all this debauchery, but the filmmakers don't do a good job of showing it, it's a pity because it can be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid lead in the lead, just like the villain - who unfortunately doesn't appear in anything else. The battle scenes are also not bad - I love the way Deathstalker drinks his sword's blood from his victims and there is a lot of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo. <br /> <br /> All in all, not good, but not necessarily so bad.
