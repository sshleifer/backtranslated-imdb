The only reason I give this movie less than 3 stars is because it's not quite the same as a movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate. This film's biggest crime is the fact that it is surprisingly annoying and terribly unforgivable British. The assumption of this movie sounds potentially promising, the whole teleporting concept, but the direction they went with was totally uninteresting. It was more a movie about research funding and arches than projecting lasers. The actors were wood, ominous and separate. Just like the love relationship between the two scientists - which was nothing more than intriguing. I never knew the attraction between them, as chemistry didn't exist. I also didn't really understand why the facial chief decided to kill everyone he met. At least I know I should always give someone honest hearing before I cut off their research contributions, otherwise they're going to not kill with goofy hand gestures.
