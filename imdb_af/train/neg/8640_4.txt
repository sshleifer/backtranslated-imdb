I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it had such terrible reviews here. It was pretty easy to watch (at 3pm). It was a good decision - Kevin Dillon's role of the sociopath serial killer was very credible - he was both charasmatic and cool. The rest of the main characters were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / suspense movie. A married couple cannot get pregnant, so they go to a fertility clinic for help. A sociopathic "genetic material" donor fixes on the recipients and, in the typical stalker form, enters their lives. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the movie was pretty good. We see "Conan" growing. more and more obsessed with raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. Of course things don't work for him as he planned. Not a bad plot line. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just awful. I'm pretty tolerant of movies (especially at 3pm!). But I was just surprised at how badly the end was written. I actually provoked! <br /> <br /> All in all, not the worst movie I've seen, but I couldn't go through it again (unless I ended). The only reasoning quality here was Kevin Dillon's role - one of the best serial killers ever. <br /> <br /> Try to look around at other channels before watching them. But if nothing is better, I want to give it a try .. =)
