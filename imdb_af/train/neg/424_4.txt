Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries, and I watched the full-feature movie version of "Earth" by DisneyNature. I think, like the car manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really care about the planet, I don't know, but I don't think it justifies a special unit with the word "nature" in it. I know my youngest Mickey Mouse daughter loves, and who should I tell a year-old my personal feelings about Disney? <br /> <br /> Apart from incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Predicted by half a dozen Disney movie fans, with Disney clich√© ("circle of life"), dramatic music, recycled footage (Disney claims "40% new footage"). I even thought James Earl Jones was getting a little boring. I love James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman does every Warner Brothers story begin to wear thin. I really think Disney bought some BBC nature photography that was done so spectacularly. They felt it would sell itself if they beat orchestral music and recognizable sound bits in it. <br /> <br /> And what is Disney's obsession with predators hunting and killing baby animals? There were half a dozen such scenes, complete with quitting youngsters about to snatch their throats. I think Disney needs to admit that animals struggle with a rich and interesting life outside of life and death that appeals to the action movie-oriented teenagers dragged by their parents to this role. I was also aware of how Disney stopped very briefly to say that the man has something to do with climate change. Are they so scared of the small minority deniers that they think it is still a controversial subject? <br /> <br /> I recommend moving this one and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Films are currently best seen by the British.
