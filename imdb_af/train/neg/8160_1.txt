and not in a fun way to look. it's just bad. It's shocking that people have posted positive things about this. the story sucks, the acting is bad, it is not scary, the special effects are not special - oh no! the blackboard came out! oh give - the mirror turns into water! The hair, clothes and make-up in the 50's screens are not accurate, and they have a middle-aged man with a diminishing hairline to play the high school version of himself. It's like a later nightmare on elm street stuff. I enjoy seeing such a cheese-like horror movie as much as anyone else, but there are better bad people out there to choose from.
