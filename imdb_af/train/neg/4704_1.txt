A very bad attempt at a young spine tap. At least the music in spinal tap was good. <br /> <br /> It's really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at its worst. A lot of Hollywood execs, bad musicians and producers are making a "poopie" show so their kids can be in the spotlight. Oh please !!! The humor was even bad. I hate these things when there are many incredibly talented kids (musicians, actors and artists) out there breaking their chicks to succeed and this shit comes along. <br /> <br /> Help you all !! Why wasn't Gene Simmons in it? Ameriac's taste in entertainment goes to the toilet.
