This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least applause! I just think it receives such recognition based on the number of well-known actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals, but she's just a few minutes in the movie. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part for which it is allowed. The rest of the play is hard to judge because the film is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is completely unsympathetic and therefore a drill to watch. There is no true emotional depth to the story. A movie about an actor who can't find work doesn't feel very original. Also the development of the police spokesman. It feels like one of the straight-to-video movies I've seen in the 90's. And not even a good one in those standards. <br /> <br />
