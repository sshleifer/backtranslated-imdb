This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it and thought I'd enjoy great fighting. Man sucked this! Fast flashing tracks, an extremely annoying speaker, and the battles themselves were heavily edited and shortened (I especially think of Jet Li's fight in the Fists of legend and Jackie Chan's battle of drunk master 2). <Br /> <br /> And what's dealing with those brawling streetfighters?! What's so cool about it? I saw more interesting battles on the Martial Law! <br /> <br /> This is a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Don't encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap! <br /> <br /> Instead, go buy the movies where the battles come from and what the battles in their unseen glory!
