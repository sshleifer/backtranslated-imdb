Take a picture of the fugly-annoying goth children of college in a scat movie, throw a pinch of story and a whole bunch of horrible acting, and you're not even close to how bad this movie is . <br /> <br /> Shot bad, bad effects, worse acting. Designated attempt to make scary horror. Everyone I showed it is kindly depressed to see it. The sex scene is disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they are just something you want to end as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just dirty, even before she gets to the old one. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who love watching movies that hate people, so I chose this one. But for your sake, save yourself time and avoid this aversion. It's so bad. I literally threw it into the garbage.
