As I write this review in 2008, we are appointed in a remake culture. Movie studios seem determined to destroy as many classic films as they can with thoroughly useless updates, including King King, The Wicker Man and virtually every movie Michael Caine has ever featured. However, this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, but proven as 'Dough for Doing'. A totally useless colored version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Dough for Do-Do' sucks life out of the original by splashing on the Clampett's original footage and adding some new photos supervised by Friz Freleng. Freleng was a completely inappropriate director to tamper with Clampett's source material, though no director could actually hope to get close to Clampett's inspired madness. It is inevitable that 'Dough for the Do' is nothing more than the rape of a classic with a terrible new title attached. For cartoon lovers like me, this is equivalent to a color scheme of 'Casablanca'.
