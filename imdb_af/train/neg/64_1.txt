This movie was terrible. The end was absolutely terrible. There was no plot of the movie whatsoever. The only thing decent about the movie was the play by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the film did not justify their legal performances. If the script were close to capturing a half-way story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones's performances were totally wasted on a godly horror story ... or a lack of it. Not only was I across the film waiting for something to happen to the movie .... a real movie ... not just the incessant dialogue between characters, because it was absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than a common dialogue that would have taken place again during that time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only particular thing was how Robert DuVall depicted a rattling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthwhile happens throughout the movie, including the end. When the movie ended, I was surprised ... surprised that I was sitting all over the movie waiting for something of interest to see how the movie was worth. It never happened! The role-playing characters suddenly began to roll and it became clear that the movie was really over and I realized that I wasted only 2 hours of my life and watched a movie, without a plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The whole movie takes place in a day's time. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some South Africans on a plantation. How much of a story can happen on a single day (except the film training day)? The acting performances throughout the cast were excellent, but they were so disappointing from a movie than it was.
