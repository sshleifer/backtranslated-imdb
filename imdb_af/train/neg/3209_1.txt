I also saw this amazingly bad piece of "anime" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you have to see this thing, do it with a big audience, preferably after a few beers, then you can get some pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue hilarious. In my mind is the launch of Cremator. The animation is terrible. It was poorly designed and poorly executed. It might be a good idea that the producers have hired at least one person who was not color-blind. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to say, this movie is a failure on every level.
