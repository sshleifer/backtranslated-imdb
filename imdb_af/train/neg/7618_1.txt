It's not a cinema. It's not talent. It is not informative. It's not scary. It's not entertaining. It is nothing at all. <br /> <br /> I got it because my cousin says, "Diablo! COOL!" Yes, right. The only thing about this experience was the only fact that I didn't buy it, but rather rented it. <br /> <br /> It's shot like a bad soap. No wait. Soaps look at least professional ... sorta. This? It seems to have been shot with someone's video camera. It's terrible! Wretched! This sux. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is contemptuous! WHO IS THIS DIRECTOR EVER? I don't even care to look at him. He STINK! The performances by these poor, unsuspecting actors were much better than this treasure. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> It records about a 0.3 / 10 on the "A" scale of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
