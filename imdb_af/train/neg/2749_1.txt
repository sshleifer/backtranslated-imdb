This movie was written so badly. The characters had no depth. They should never have made a movie of this. My 11 year old son can write a better script than Hyung-rae Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor who didn't suck was the zoo guard. He was the only funny and credible one of the lot. <br /> <br /> I love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was on my lame list at number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus. <br /> <br /> For those who actually thought it was a good movie, you are in serious need of brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most of the creatures in the movie were even dragons ... so why did they call D-war?
