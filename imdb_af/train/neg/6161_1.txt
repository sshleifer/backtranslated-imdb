It is possibly the worst fence, sword fight, movie ever made. This is not just because the so-called track lifting is poor, but because the plot, characters are so weak that they have to throw a semi-naked sex scene and later dance a suspected group around a fencing scene in the fence club, I suppose to maintain interest. What a mess of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You are better served with overwhelmed swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that Basil Rathbone has as the villain. As a screen myself, I recognize the impossibility of capturing screen as a sport on film, but if it ever happens, it must have harder, better-drawn characters and a plot with more depth.
