This movie was horrible! I hired it and didn't know what to expect. I watched the first 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb. The scene was bad and there was no plot. The monster is soooooo fake. mouth does not move. Also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster. Just as bad, don't waste your time. (1 out of 10)
