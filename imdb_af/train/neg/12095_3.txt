Elfriede Jelinek, not yet a household name, is a winner of the Nobel Literature Prize. Her novel created a film that won the second prize in Cannes and the best prizes for male and female leaders. Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or have art become so exposed that anything goes? <br /> <br /> 'Gobble, gobble' is the favorite orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. In the movie world, a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by checkout receipts or critical reception. Gobble, gobble and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The embarrassment of this widespread film cannot be overstated. It starts out very badly, as if it irritates the viewer. Credits interrupt unfinished scenes for over 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of the dedicated writer, a rocky piano professor. She lives with her rogue and dominant mother. Dad is an institutionalized madman who dies unnoticed during the action. <br /> <br /> Reviewing the piano teacher is difficult to register. What we see in the movie (and maybe read in the book, for everything I know) is a deadly, exploitative, nonsense story of an emotional pendulum floating here and there, without moving further. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is used minimally, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity, but otherwise completely suppressed. Not quite because there is a handbag on the scene early with her funny-spoken mum with great excuses. If a reviewer had to exploit a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word as a simpler one), Elrika's violent alternatives would be. <br /> <br /> A young man, Walter, is studying to become a "low voltage" engineer, whatever, and playing ice hockey in his few free moments, is also a talented pianist. He meets Elrika on an old-fashioned argument in a luxury apartment in which Paris may or may be. In the slippery way of so much art, he immediately falls in love and starts cherchez la femme. <br /> <br /> Repressed Erika likes hardcore pornography, briefly but graphically for a few seconds while sniffing a tissue taken from the waste stall in the private stall where she looks. <br /> <br /> Walter performs a brilliant audition and is unwillingly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterized by distance, hostility, discouragement and humiliation. <br /> <br /> He soon declares his love and long ago, Erika strives for the Ladies where they engage in soft, pank and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control of her loving swain. She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasant exchanges. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, chillingly jealous of Walter's kindness to a nervous student who literally has the khaki before a rehearsal for a future concert, Erika fills the student's jacket pocket with broken glass, what Causes severe delicacies on those delicate piano playing hands. <br /> <br /> The next big scene (through the genital self-reduction, etc.) turned Walter at The apartment Erika shared with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, bound, clapped, etc. Sensible Walter is currently repelling and marching at night. <br /> <br /> At this point there is barely an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika follows Walter after the skateboard where he practices his ice hockey. They go back to a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to withstand the hands on his pants. His 'baby sauce' is quickly expelled with other stomach contents. Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Reciprocally, but crouching, perhaps the vengefulness of the insult recently burst on the floor, goes back to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what is happening now? It's not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. For a moment he closes maman in her room and hits Erika, the next he kicks her in, renews sex with her and his love statements. <br /> <br /> Am I unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you want, but I won't recommend you. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they are in the right mood. I could be wiped out by the challenging portrayal of human relationships conveyed by this film when I wanted to. But I do not like it because it is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to basic instincts and says nothing. <br /> <br /> I intend to say that Erika has long since suppressed, longing for love, trying it ineffectively in pornography, rejecting it inappropriately when it literally looks, pink and throbbing under her nose, realizes she doesn't like to be hurt, blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the world has not explained, stunt her. She obviously makes a monster from someone who has been superficially loved - but we all know someone might be a violent rapist, because it is his essential nature, but he is trying to tell himself and the world otherwise. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you have the patience to be there, there's a little twist. Before she goes to the final scene, where she must act as a substitute for the underwear-satisfying student with the torn hands, Erika grabs a knife in her handbag. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you're in front of me. She stabbed herself in a no-life-threatening area and left. Rolkrediete. <br /> <br /> If it earned the second prize in Cannes, just how bad was the rest of the entries?
