I had high expectations of this movie (the title, translated, is "How to get rid of the others"). After all, the concept is good: a near future in which the ruling elite is the result of the ruling government's continuing verbal and legislative prosecution of so-called free-lenders and the left wing in general and decide to just kill everyone who cannot prove that something contributed to the foundation (the institution is called "the common good" but actually means the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology.) <br /> <br /> Great idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only, this movie blows its chance completely. The satire only comes out in a few scenes and acts of absurdity, but this satire is not sustained; it is not sharp or witty. And for an alleged comedy, the movie has almost no funny scenes. The comedy is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations, but the situations are largely uncomfortable and excessive, rather than laughing or thinking. <br /> <br /> The font is large with grave bugs available. The action had to be focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing, but instead there was talk of time spent on a young woman who was the one who wrote the new laws for fun, and trying to save everyone. , by organizing a resistance that moves people to Africa. All this is next to the point! A movie like this shouldn't pretend to be so serious! It's a satire! A political statement. But it doesn't even start the problem it's supposed to talk about. Maybe it was scared to go too far? How cowardly. It's not art. It's not even true satire. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark, a very serious and now one of Denmark's absolutely senior actors, was very good. He largely behaved the small entertainment value the film had. Everyone else: nothing special (well, maybe except Lene Poulsen, who delivers a convincing performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, a problem with most Danish films is that the language never sounds natural. Not the wording or the delivery. Why is it so hard to make it sound right? Why should it be so quiet and artificial? I hope that when people watch fifty years of these movies into these movies, people are not speaking in general Danish society. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
