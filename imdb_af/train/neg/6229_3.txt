First, let's get a few things straight here: a) I'm an anime fan. It was always a fact (I watched Speed ​​Racer all the time in the preschool). b) I DO like several B movies because they are hilarious. c) I like the Godzilla movies. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> If you continue, when the movie comes first, it looks like it's your regular B movie, up to the crappy FX, but everything's a sudden boom! the anime comes up! This is when the movie goes down WWWAAAAAYYYYY. <br /> <br /> The animation is VERY bad and cheap, even worse than I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I remember "alive" is when a lot of kids run out of school ... and it's the same kids over and over! The FX is also terrible; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to action for animation was disorganized, the dialogue and voices (especially the English dub that I saw) were terrible and I begged my dad to take the tape out of the DVD / VHS player. The only thing that survived me was jokes and comments like the robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie and survive at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I'm going to pass it on to another fellow Halloween otaku friend for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, painful to watch at the same time and look in a spectacular way. I give this movie a 3/10, an improvement of the 0.5 / 10 I was originally going to give. <br /> <br /> (According to my rating scale: 3/10 Pretty much means both boring and bad. Just as fun as counting to three, unless you find a way to enjoy it, it will be just as fun to count to 15.)
