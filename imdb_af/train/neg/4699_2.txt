Wow, the Naked Brothers Band. What should I say? I think I can say this show just sucks. number one: they have no talent, they probably can't even play the instruments. number 2: on the commercial they said they were known, but no one had ever heard of them until a spectacle appeared. Look, I don't really hate it so badly, I give it like a 4 out of 10, but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such a great talent and Nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics. Deep my ass! He talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. wow, I could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it will be deeper than that. And they didn't get themselves famous, their parents are well-known celebrities and wanted their children to be too bad to make a bad performance. I have a feeling that it will be canceled soon.
