It was on the 30th anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, itself brilliant, but not that. Nowhere have I seen Mel Brook's name here and I can guess why he has much more sense not to be associated with this pilot. My gawd, who would find it funny. Certainly there could be a race problem, but for me it just wasn't funny, because it's simply not funny. It's like the authors didn't even try to be funny, just to include cash with Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to run for several seasons when they made this pilot? Flat out, they don't mind. It was a quick cash cow that didn't thank God. I think it's just useful for historical purposes, or just to demonstrate how stupid and indescribable Hollywood writers can be.
