Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> Hey, I was bored. I watched in my Comcastic box to watch a movie to watch. Zombie nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. Say the filmmaker has a kind of cult that follows in the description. Funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this movie. I could have used that advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 because it's completely wrong. It has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies, and finds everything within one city. This film revolves around a crooked policeman who acts as badly as possible (he must suck so much) while raising women for trivial discomfort and then killing them. Yup, he's a serial killer. Not only is this movie flawed to think it is a zombie movie, but it also gets completely wrong. Serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they go with it and personally with it. This man knocks out the women and injects them with a little poison. He doesn't even have sex with the body or dismember. Talk about boring! Ultimately, one of the brilliant five women he kills, did Voodoo protection for her and for no apparent reason, five came back to life and went down to kill this man. They are all buried or thrown into the sea, but you won't know it buys the crisp clean clothes they all wear. The women then act very poorly and take revenge. Oh yay. <br /> <br /> This movie was crazy in every category. Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier makeup effects. The women do not look like shrubs unless you really have dark makeup around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what a zombie makes. They can all talk, act, think and act completely. The gore is poor compared to even many PG-13 films and the nudity is beyond the short. You see a look at breasts in the opening sequence ... Then the exact same breasts are later! Go figure. Just recommend one actress to go to this trite topless. The police station was so poorly constructed that you could see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse, after which they were filming. You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the minor setup and even if you are blind, you can see the director fails. Steer clear, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
