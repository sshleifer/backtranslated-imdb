Geez, another lifetime movie, but again is not the worst movie in the world, but far from the best. I think the biggest problem is that it's pretty clear who is responsible for what, and it's generally pretty predictable. Even worse, some of the flashbacks eventually became confusing and the viewer wondered: "Well, how much do I care?" One thing I liked was that the movie shows that it is never as simple as "the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad", and sometimes it is angry with evil rather than good with evil. Hadley did not do what she did out of justice, she did it because she regarded herself as a family as a job of eliminating the competition. As for Alicia, it merely proves that a victim is not always a good person. Some of them really do 'come it', even if it was a painful, terrible death. "The burning bed" is a good example of this, but the difference is that the dirty man in "The Burning Bed" has exactly what he deserves. But, did Alicia get it? Some will say she did this, but others do not agree, and the law does not. <br /> <br /> What that means is a mixed bag. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others just as indifferently came to their roles. They were mostly wood or simply not convincing. However, the music was very cool and some of the screens are nice and steamy, especially if you like girl / girl action. The film is not badly shot, but the strengths are unfortunately in the background. <br /> <br /> I heard rumors about a successor, but I doubted it. will happen But I will not be surprised if a successor suddenly appeared. If Alicia is as ominous as people say, then I don't think she'll think, "YAY! I woke up from a coma! Oh, Hadley was responsible? Oh, that's okay! I completely forgive her and want that the charges had dropped! "No way Hadley would be in jail anyway, even if she did at any time as murder did not take place. <br /> <br /> Anyway, worth checking out at least once!
