I can (on the one hand) envision the number of good movies with Joe Don Baker. This is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Interminable chase scenes, dull dialogue and terrific continuity have made this movie an excellent choice to get the upload to MST3K. <br /> <br /> And that's the only way I could see it ...
