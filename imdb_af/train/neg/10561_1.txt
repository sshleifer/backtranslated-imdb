I saw this movie in its own time, when I had a baby out of wedlock, you didn't just ruin your life but bumped your child into a bastard. In these days of "single mothers" who may look very far-fetched, but it was very true. And I'm not fond of laughing at someone who's dumb. Between these two problems I found it hard to find this movie funny. At that time, I didn't know who made it up or what a wonderful reputation he had. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and she just made me nervous because she was so terrible. I loved 'Bringing Baby', but I find this movie just embarrassing. I'm sure the punch at some church functions was probably spiked, but I was the one who needed a drink after watching it again. The idea that the girl should be drunk to get married and get pregnant is just added to the misery. A whole village can touch you under these circumstances, so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part. Of course, shoot me, I also don't like "It's a wonderful life".
