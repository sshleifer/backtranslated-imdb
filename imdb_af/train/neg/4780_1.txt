I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever watched. I would recommend this cartoon to people under 5. I had this show as I had when I was 4 and 5, I just watched when there was nothing. Now I'm another 5 and I'd rather do my homework than to see it. The cartoon was a bit funny, but they weren't enough to let me out. Now I'm older too. I am interested in show witch is not appreciated to us. I started watching Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I am interested in things to do with doctor who so i am not interested in 5 year old cartoons. This cartoon wasn't long, but only six seasons. It was canceled because it was lower on viewers, but some say it was because the authors walked out of ideas, but for most other programs they had at least 8 seasons.
