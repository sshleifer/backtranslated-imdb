In addition to a doubt shadow Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, but retains a love in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and amazingly horrible soundtrack in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest, it is everything you need to see) combine to create something that is hilarious side splitting. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in 'space' is about as impassable as cinematography, as dishwashing liquid bottles obscure your eyes to be muted. dialogue. Before you have time to find out if it is you who is angry, the credits will roll and the action fight to life. <br /> <br /> Apart from the double-headed plastic giant snail terrorizing our heroes, we also get the additional double bonus to have both the original actors vote and the voiced voices at the same time. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> The sad thing for fans of this kind of journey is that I only saw one copy, so the chances of seeing it for yourself are highly unlikely. Maybe I own the only copy that exists. <br /> <br />
