OK, I didn't have high expectations, but this movie descended into depths I couldn't imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it was, involved a priest of an obscure 2-member order investigating the death of the founder of the order through a probe. The Sin Eater makes it possible for Catholics to obtain salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in film with many ennui. Never think it doesn't make sense, then a Baptist can give you salvation. We continue. <br /> <br /> I will spoil the plot without giving away much: the priest goes to Rome with his partner to invest. He brings with him a spiritual patient (I don't care) who shot him during an exorcism and who loves him (not one leak of this VAT is explained), a drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller as' a cardinal. They come to Rome, find some creepy kids who don't do anything in the movie, meet with a slavery S&M anti-pope who knows the drunk Irish guy (not explain) and who gives information by killing people ( o, VAT, he's bad so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot pounded over. Heath cold fever with the Sin Eater, flies to New York with the Sin Eater for a nightmare and then there are other things happening and then (all outside camera) the anti-pop falls and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> One hour in the film, one wondered if something had happened. At the end, something happened, but you can't be sure it's important and since most of the drama happens before the move or scare, you really feel sorry.
