This movie is a perfect example of an excellent movie devastated by a movie. Jacob Did I Love Is Possibly The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen. There is no storyline, plots do not disappear, and editing is terrible. To download it all, the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds incredibly awful. Bridget Fonda's play is decent, but everyone's acting is completely amateur. I would suggest this movie to someone studying to be a producer as a study of how not to make a movie, because it is very full of bad cuts, bad transitions and plays that had to be shot again! Read the book and don't waste your time with this movie.
