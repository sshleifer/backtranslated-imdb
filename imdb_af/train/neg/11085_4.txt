Given his conviction of a rape charge, the film is careful not to portray it as a hero or villain, but a wart-and-all portrait of its rise to fame, the pressure of success and the people who his fate for well-formed or bad. Limited by time constraints, the author is tracked by a succession of relevant details, briefly on important events, culminating in Tyson's (temporary) demise in 1995. Novices are relieved by chronology, while goat friends by director Uli Edel's straight entertainment be. little approach to the material. He describes Tyson's life as a circus in which he was eventually led astray by the circumstances of his own success. In fact, the writing retains most of his poison for Tyson's ex-wife, Robin Givens, who knows her as an ungrateful gold digger who used his naivety.

Scott plays Tyson's mentor Cus D'Amato through torn teeth gates; and Paul Winfield was surely born to play Don King!
