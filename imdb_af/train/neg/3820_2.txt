Watching "Speak Easy" is painful for fans of Buster Keaton. To see such a phenomenal writer, actor, cartoon, director and stuntman being subjected to this humiliating spectacle is to use a Picasso as a drop cloth, or perhaps more like seeing the best Camembert with whey Solids are decayed and processed into Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton was badly cast as Professor Post, whose renowned vocabulary is the only thing he likes to say, "Tell me about the rabbits, George." (Post would have said something: "Please let me know the status of the small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, sir, sir, which I believe is mainly addressed with the epithet" George ".) When Keaton created She Own characters, they can be situationally clueless, but they were not stupid, they were fast-paced studies and became masters of their worlds, not so with Post, who never stumbles and stumbles, and who no longer controls his fate as a bilge-gear from the Titanic, and while Keaton's original characters had a beautiful naive and innocence, Post as such has a deep sexual delay that, if ever he has physically awakened, he has a fridge would put on the swelling and seek medical help. <br /> <br /> There are a few small, redemptive moments, such as Keaton's efforts to get rid of the infamous Thema Todd or his proposal for a suitable outfit for a Greek dance, but it's just not worth the d it keeps all the time. movie to see them. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad movies, get drunk and look easy with friends, a "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But other than that, keep to the silence. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton remembers.
