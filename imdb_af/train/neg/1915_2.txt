It's a pretty good role, but the film has nowhere near the mercy of the original Italian comedy Big Deal on Madonna Street. Anyone looking for an entertaining hijacking movie should visit the original. William Macy may be one of our biggest live actors, but here he is too little used. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I feel sorry for him to fill those shoes. Bogart or a young De Niro can also try to imitate. The artistry is rich and textured, but does not add to the story, the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missed. Even at the beginning of the way they do, it looks bizarre free and takes away the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his strange and brilliant charm and Luis Guzman has that strange charisma, but the love story part of the movie just looks clunky and flat. It's too bad no one figured out how to make this movie, but it's too bad, but it's too bad, we live in a culture where we feel that we have to remember wonderful things instead of just the original. enjoy.
