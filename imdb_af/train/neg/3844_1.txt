First of all, I just want to tell everyone who watched this movie that the actor who played the "Transvestite" is one of my friends, Robert Dugdale, he is a terrific actor, although it doesn't say much about his filmography , he is in various plays and musical. He currently lives in Terras B.C. That's where I come from, he arrives at our house almost every Saturday. * lag. Okay, now about the movie, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't see it, because it's not a movie worth watching. The main reason I found this to be a bad movie is that it never stays in place, it stays back in time, so hard to follow on some points, and secondly, that is really boring * laughs * Although the play is great, the movie doesn't just compare.
