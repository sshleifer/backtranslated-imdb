If you are one of those people who find Jim a big television comedy, it will rock your world. And may I add to prove that good talent, good writing, and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC, who prefers to present Jim Craps's performance the year like year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a great, steamy, brown, German shepherd-sized "thank you" for all the geniuses that loved the first movie. This is exactly what fans of the film and the lesser Belushi deserve. Jim's comic links and project selection is never far behind his blues standard ability. Look for him to try to show all his diverse shortcomings in every project he is visiting at the public, such as a maze chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
