I'm a fan of arty movies, but unfortunately I have to report this movie to be pretentious. Agonizingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise, the experience, we will say, try. Even after bad movies I feel like I am learning something or enjoying something, but there was nothing to appreciate. The point of departure was not uninteresting, but the movie started and ended there. The acting was OK, although the characters were completely boring. For the protagonist to strive for such a zealous purpose, she is powerfully empty. Sorry. I usually enjoy movies that are informal, but a lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.
