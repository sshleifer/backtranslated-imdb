Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a mercurial, warm-haired Hollywood couple, they filmed this (almost) play remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw action thriller about a brief twin. It worked almost the first time, because McQueen was such an important presence on the screen. Even stone, silent and tired, you can tap its clock, its cagey magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league, but he has his charm and is probably a more versatile actor - so, it's not a showcase for his features. Basinger does well and looks good, but James Woods is artificially hammy in a silly roll magnet. A sub-plot of another couple taken hostage by Baldwin's ex-partner was unbearable in the '72 movie and playing worse here. As for the action scenes, they are pretty old hat, which makes one wonder: why does the original make the original again? ** of ****
