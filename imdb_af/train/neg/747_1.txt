Eventually I thought someone was going to do justice to H.G. Wells' classic, not another version set in the wrong place or past, but one firmly on the book. Well, it certainly follows the book well, and that's the only plus for this mess. <br /> <br /> It is 180 minutes (yes 3 hours) long, the book is only about 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had the nerve to come here and say, "If you can do something better ..." I would say "yes I can" and I have never had a video camera use or any kind or drama school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid good money to get this shit to the UK from the US, don't make the same mistake as me.
