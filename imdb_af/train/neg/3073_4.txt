The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co-stars in this movie. She doesn't even appear until two-thirds of the film is over and then it's in a small role. I also don't see it as a supporting role, but rather a "bit" part. Also the plot has many inexplicable elements. Some examples are: why does the main character reject her eldest son? Why is her youngest son driving in the train? He says it's for a "sucker" commitment that doesn't explain anything. It is clear that the scriptwriter does not know the definition of a sucker bet. This movie is not worth the rent. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think it should be seen.
