I watched Phat Beach for a while and I enjoyed it. The fat man is the best character, as he seems to be a good guy. The rest of the characters are just different stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like watching these low budget movies that take a period of time, as they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babies in this movie are strict homemakers. Most low-budget movies have this "local babe" quality, and you can tell the babies in this movie as local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite from their bikinis, that it was funny to watch the "youth" being wild about what was, in essence, a very overused, high kilometer shank. There were also some tuck shops. This is the charm of these low budget crappy movies. You'll see a lot of doggies, and some real tuckers! I checked on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Sorry. It would be interesting if somebody ever managed to make a "Where Are They Now" book about all the tuck shops that have appeared in the history of movies and never returned. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie that looks very much to them, and years later when you watch the movie again on TV, you wonder "what has happened to X?" Anyway, this movie mostly blows, but it has some funny moments.
