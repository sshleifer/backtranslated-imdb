Siskel & Ebert was great at this show whether you agreed with them or not, because of the real conflict that generated their separate professional opinions. Roeper took this show in a notch or two because he wasn't really a film critic and because he had replaced. Now, when Ben Lyons goes on, do I feel like I am "Teen News" - do you know that children's news program is being offered by children to children? Manckiewitz is not much better. Obviously they only experienced a steady diet of mainstream films throughout their lives. The notion that these two rank amateurs have something of importance or consequence to say about movies is ridiculous. If they review a non-formula movie, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they just find it "confusing". Wait - I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper have promoted independent films and only hit the big budget studio productions - what a surprise: these two guys love the big studio clock and can only endure a few Indian. Plus, everyone knows the age group TV advertisers that are aimed at it. The blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake. In what alternative universe do these guys qualify as film critics?
