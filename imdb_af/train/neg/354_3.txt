Take a close look at the amazing array of talent created to make this movie: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, even cameos by Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. They prove, in spades, the expression that a good role cannot save a bad writing. The storyline requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its impeccability even exceeded Hollywood standards. It's not particularly original, and the "twists" are cruel.
