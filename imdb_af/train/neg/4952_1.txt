All right, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series, and even Batman Beyond. I occasionally read a batman comic. So, as I can imagine, I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was VERY disappointed. This series is nothing. It doesn't even compare to the original range. It's like one long TOY commercial. No depth at all. And how was the Joker? Who, in my humble opinion, is the best Batman villain of ALL time and they killed him. I wish I could say his design was the worst part. Actually, I wish I could say there was something about this range that was remotely creative or interesting. In short (because I believe I can say so much more) DO NOT waste any time on this show or your money.
