... just look at the poor Robert Webber character (great achievement, again!) trying to wrest a sub machine from one of the terrorists. Everything in this movie looks a little wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action strong in the reality of the early eighties (the fundamental difference between this movie and the much more fantastic, ironic and therefore timeless Die Hard). The story comes as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas like when a commando shouted. "Good guys do it and all bad guys don't do it so that they can blow away ad lib (with a good conscience), that the main character is not cut off by the gas. Masked commandos, although wearing the same clothes and a weapon Carrying out their arsenal, it seems unlikely and makes it difficult to take the movie seriously, and it just happens to be more than just fun, toilet mirror signal ... <br /> <br /> I don't care criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the established, even heads of power representatives in this film, but the political commentary is rather lame and uninspired. Includes an early show by Judy Davies, who plays the main fanatic and looks for extensive study on the subject, anyway, her performance is a notch above that of the other and somehow I feel the movie leaves her .
