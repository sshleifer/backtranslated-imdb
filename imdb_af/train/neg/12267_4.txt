To speak only as a movie, I didn't really like it. not because there was no FX or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole movie, actually, that was what made me look. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it because the scene was harmful, its "friends" are all happy and then they are angry, but you have no idea why; then they take different roles, one is the believer, others are the antagonist, but they never really make the point! Also the lighting was terrible and I only mention technical problems. <br /> <br /> In a few words, something the movie could have had just "ok I'm out here!" of some characters. Like the woman who doesn't want to hear his version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> About the story itself, everyone is free to write about what they want and the story is proof of good writing and imagination. . I credit the book writer for it, so my 4/10. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, hear the man's story believe it or not, don't just spend the whole time as if you believe he is shocked at what he says and at the same time moves and jokes like You don't believe him. <br /> <br /> Coherence. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading;)
