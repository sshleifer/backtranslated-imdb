There was a good movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately it wasn't. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - cannot convey the great charisma that Biko had. Attenborough's large crowd of screens are laughing. The Soweto massacre was not like this, three neat lines of kids (some car wheels!) Who congratulate the guns of the soldiers. With Biko death, the film falls quickly into the farce. If the struggle against Apartheid was anything, it was a black people's struggle, but somehow we all have to be captured by the escape of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he wasn't. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and she seems totally unaware that she is not in South Africa at all. at all. The Wood's family dog ​​gets more lines than the black girl. As the family makes their escape, the women I have seen with the movie are whispering to almost one in only a dozen black people in a big, full movie. "It's like the sound of music." She had a point. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a film of goodwill as a somewhat unpleasant white liberal about the struggle of a radical black people. And really South Africa needs good white liberals because it needs a hole in the head.
