This romantic comedy is not bad. There are some funny things happening here and there, and there are a few memorable characters in it. <br /> <br /> However, the play is amateurish (with the exception of the banker). While some scenes are fun, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the story poor. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think it's worth seeing if you like soccer and romantic comedies. It's not really a bad movie, and the end felt good. Just don't expect anything from the ordinary. Good enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
