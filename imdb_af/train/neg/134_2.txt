This movie in the way was super smart. These are theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made. Valentine makes ZERO an attempt to be original. What is Valentine anyway? It is a lot of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people the same year. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, and in the one being watched here are some of the movies that ripped it off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4. And other horror movie in which someone kills someone. <br /> <br /> I know there is more, but my mind has become slow in a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came. <br /> <br /> Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. How every horror movie should have a "surprise" killer, people you don't mind, because their emotions take a turn in every other scene. One minute a pretty girl gets an evil B - ch, then she is an insecure woman, and so on. <br /> <br /> Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, again Valentine doesn't. It was as if they were trying to make it PG-13, but failed, so they left the change. <br /> <br /> Don't see this exaggerated inspiration unless you hate yourself and you want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
