Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult movie genre. Yet I didn't like this one at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more suited to a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to briefly return to the life of the desire she has never done in her everyday life. Crappy sex scenes to follow. Why are they crappy, because they are trying so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act. I mean we look porn for sex, we don't. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it's still very erotic and fun to watch. Of course, the girls in that one are very cute. Here we have a rather unattractive main actress and it doesn't help things. If you find the lead in your adult movie unattractive, there is no artistic vision that will make me enjoy the movie. The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre ... I mean there is a snake in one of their people. So for me this movie just failed because it doesn't make me excited, but rather turns me off.
