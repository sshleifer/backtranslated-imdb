It was a very funny movie. <br /> <br /> Every 1 in the movie was trying to be serious, which made this movie so funny. I mean, come on a shark's head on a human body. Can be even harder. Good work Sci-Fi keeps the comedy movies on. I never thought movies would be slowed down. If they stop, they will have to rename the sci-fi channel to the comedy sci-fi channel or something else. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the next movie of sci fi. <br /> <br /> I'm ready with a bowl of popcorn and a beer or a bottle of liquor and I'm ready to laugh again!
