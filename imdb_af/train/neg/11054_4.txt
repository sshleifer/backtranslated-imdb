I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopeless mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK would start their career with a low-budget mining movie like this. Perhaps as a testament to the talent Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz will receive an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers, the Messiah or Evil has potential, but unfortunately it becomes frustrating, as it cannot collect the film ability to finish it to draw. <br /> <br /> The starting point is a young girl traveling to a small coastal town, looking for her father-in-law who has been missing for a while. It does not long for the fragmented story to abandon all hope and to dive into unprecedented absurdity - and it works wonderfully well for a while to the point where you start thinking that perhaps the Messiah of the Evil One of the shocking gut of 70's exploitation as an example of artificial mystery horror. <br /> <br /> The surreal non-successors quit while the girl stumbles upon a young couple in a fraudulent hotel room in town to research the local legend of the "blood moon", a slim and half-alcoholic (played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie) who only warns her of her father to be killed in a alley "eaten a little later, the blind old woman who owns the local art gallery and inexplicably removed all her father's paintings from the store, and lastly a delayed, murderous, squirrel albino. <br /> <br>> Part of the movie's charm is exactly this bran d the bargain basement artsy surrealism that disputes every step of the way logic and genre conventions, while Lynch is clear, it is the sign of a talented creator, with Messiah or Evil, the boundaries between the "willful", the " unintentional 'and the' did not really expect this to happen, but it is g oath enough - WRAP SCENE "Remember" hopeless. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the double story flowing in and out of the picture in a drug addict, feverish, unconscious form, the one coming out of the daughter while she came to find her father, and the others tell her father's voice while reading his diary. <br /> <br /> While we're still talking about a "living death" picture, Messiah or Evil is different and just loosely - at least with the current assumptions of what a zombie film is supposed to be. The origin of the living dead here is a 100-year-old curse awarded in the village by a mysterious 'Dark Alien', who comes out of the bush one day. Meanwhile, Hyuck finds time for mass-consumption criticism in a carnivorous supermarket scene that goes on for a good number of years DAY OF DEATH (you can already hear the MST3K line: "Man is dead, only his capitalist food cans remain") and " a nice thought but poorly performed similar scene in a theater. <br /> <br /> In general, I think the surrealistic work works in cautious, well-measured doses - how is it absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal? Hyuck just seems to melt it out over the picture, and so it is dangerous to stick out. For example, when the albino picks up a girl who fetches her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost think the director is meaningful to the audience, amused and content with his own haninks. <br /> <br /> The general movie level is also quite low. After the halfway the pace is astounded and the story is tiring and apparently nowhere and not very fast. Add to that the cunning editing, average acting and Hyuck's general inability to capture the real atmosphere - the empty streets of the coastal town are criminal abuse - and I will leave the Messiah under "missed opportunity" but still gravel house will be afficionados enough find to appreciate - even though it is not particularly generous, trashy or sloppy.
