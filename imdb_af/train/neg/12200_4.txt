Usually any movie with Sylvester Stallone usually sucks ass. Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception to this. The only movies Sylvester Stallone was in there were Rocky and First Blood. This film is unrealistic and boring. It has action, but not very good action. I didn't enjoy it, and I will never see it again. No wonder why it won the Razzie award for the worst picture. I would give it a 3/10, the only reason it had the 3 was because it had some good action but not good enough.
