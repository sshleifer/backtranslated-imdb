Warning: Avoid this super duper horrible movie ... if you watched it, you'll be SOOOOOOOOO disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are grandma, now old, what are they doing? Try SO HARD to be young innocent and sexy, just don't work. Pam and Denise act so terribly in this movie. <br /> <br /> Plus The writing is absolutely frightening, I can't believe anyone comes up with such crazy ideas. With the development of the film industry, film lovers are not as easy to satisfy as those of the previous century. I bet the filmmakers of the last century will hate it too. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it. I think look at "White Chicks" from 2004, it's so much better that it doesn't make a mistake right now, I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
