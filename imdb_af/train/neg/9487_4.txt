The role play, though nothing special, everyone does an OK job, the story looks like a good idea, the writing is portable and the end has quite a good turn. So is it wrong? <br /> <br /> For a start, the special effects are really bad (if made in the 60's), it may seem, but in 2003 there is no excuse for visuals as poor as this. It makes me laugh that the DVD cover is very proud of 'the special effect creator of Jeepers Creepers' claim. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the direction is poor, this film does not fit the essence of the story. A Doctor To feed the prisoners of the hospital must be souls to the devil (or devil-creature), tense or frightening; It is simply not. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a pretty poor movie, and although portable and sometimes generously entertaining, it's still probably the best alone. <br /> <br /> A rather sad 4/10
