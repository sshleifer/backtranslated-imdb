Apparently, the people who wrote the back of the box didn't bother to watch this so-called "movie". They describe "blind choreographic plot and violence." I saw no "plot". Instead, I saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. I saw no "violence". At least I have seen nothing that can cause me to suspend my unbelief that can be hurt with an impenetrable skin - but here I am too much of a "plot". Furthermore, as a viewer of many and diverse films (some of which include the kungfu movie), I can say that this piece of celluloid is uncompromising. Whatever you choose, I'll always stay <br /> <br /> Correct, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. I wasn't blinded by the choreography.
