I watched Peter Jackson's version of Lord of the Rings as I read halfway through the Two Towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> At this time, the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released. on DvD, but I told myself that I would read the Two Towers and King of Kings before I see it (as I thought it showed the whole trilogy.) <br /> <br /> When I completed the trilogy , I went and brought the DvD, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish. <br /> <br /> I was actively bored for 20 minutes, which was very strange because I loved the book and I was shaken that the creator of this movie might even have thought at least one and a half of the books Customize a 2 hour 8 minute movie. <br /> <br /> None of the characters had emotions when they spoke and they looked or read a page, even my favorite character Gandalf didn't look at all. <br /> <br /> The animation was the only guy in parts of the movie, except for the orchestra (they look terrible) and Aragorn and Sam face. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this movie is going to be released because there wasn't even a good ending, but maybe it was good that the author ran out of money because the movie couldn't get better. <br /> <br /> I just hope no one judges these books. <br /> <br /> 3/10
