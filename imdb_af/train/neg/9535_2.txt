Believe it or not, this movie is worse than number three. it's slower, the acting is worse, and the story is very poor. There is not much good to say about this movie. The battle scenes are more dull than number three, and I would have thought it impossible. It's a very slow 90 minutes. Indeed. I got stuck and hoped it would be better. If you really want to see this movie, try a cheap rental from it. It's hard to find (for purchase, that is) and probably for good reason. Like number three, this movie has nothing to do with the first two. It's the same in name. Only the most I can give the best of the best: without warning is 2/10
