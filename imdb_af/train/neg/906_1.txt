Yes, this movie makes me real horror when I realized that I paid it and spent more than 1 hour of my life seeing it. The bald guy just gives me the impression of a psycho - Junkie actor and the girl are the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me if you appreciate your time, avoid this movie, I understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money, but it is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting. I always support independent movies, when it gets the support, but movies like this make a bad name for this kind of movies. I'm still traumatized. I will no longer trust a good cover.
