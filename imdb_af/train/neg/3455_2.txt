Geez! It's one of those movies you think you've reviewed before, but you don't. I mean, you didn't scratch, but somehow it came to your mind. <br /> <br /> To be honest and short; it is one of the worst, boring and dumb slashers ever made. I can't say anything good about this piece of crap, because there are hardly decent rows that can tell it, made by professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The deaths are terrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot is somehow good considering that it copied "popcorn" from 1991. <br /> <br /> To make things even worse, it's not a movie so bad that it's good. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald is trying her best, but it wasn't enough.
