Unlike many, I do not find the show or theme of this show the least offensive. However, its execution is another matter. Like so many B-minus movies, it looks as if all the decent gags in the trailers are split. For most of the 22 or so minutes, we await every piece of humor in anticipation. Or at least something to prevent you from holding the remote or counting vehicles. With a few exceptions, the play is terrible; The comic over-emotion and gesticulating of some roles may well suit a late-night infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a Canadian.) Notwithstanding the initial original cultural angle, I can't help but think it was mainly shot by the CBC to repeat the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they have the tone - and the writing - completely wrong for the prairies. The final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to do the place work in a real little town (why are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) They thought the audience would be misled by Regina exteriors center ? As a proud Canadian, I hope this thing will soon go away, and that the rest of the world, created by the CBC publishers, will soon forget this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.
