The maths aspect of this is simply a gym to try to tune this TV exhibition of millions of other police shows. The only redeeming aspect of this show is Rob Morrow, but his career had to (undeservedly) depart after the northern exposure when he reported this shock. <br /> <br /> The lame ness of the math aspect The show is included in one episode with Lou Diamond Phillips. It only confirms that this show is the last resort of the damned. To catch a refugee, the mathematician uses a few "bubbles" theories. So, he gives this long explanation that if we saw the suspect in places A, B and C, then we could use "bubble theory" to calculate where he might be. He does it all on a plate, or maybe with a stick in the dirt. I can not remember. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you look at the final product, he basically took three points and picked a point right in the middle and said, "Okay, mathematically, here's where we probably are the refugee will find. " At what point does another character point out: "Oh, that point is also the cabin where the man lived." Is this math? It's not even a connection-the-f ** k ** g dots !!! This show reminds me of the maths manager I used with banking, who had a mathematical analysis that he could do to support 'points' that everyone else had already agreed on by either less complex analysis or basic common sense. <Br /> <br /> It's just to show. If you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can't wait until they keep the NUMB3RS team on OSAMA. They will use the calculus, call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields. cuz hey ... it's all about the numbers. <br /> <br /> Totally ridiculous TV show.
