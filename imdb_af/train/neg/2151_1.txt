It is a hybrid being born in Carl Macek's mind. With Robotech the second generation (Robotech Masters) and Megazone 23 in one unlucky movie, which has no logic! The story is very, very bad, and you can't forgive Megazone's actions when nothing comes up with Robotech. If this movie is so high, it's for the TV show and not for itself !! I said this, the name can't save it!
