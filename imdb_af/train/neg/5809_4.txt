I can't see why filmmakers made this movie again. <br /> <br /> The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an excellent actor and Baldwin is just an insufficient actor. He has no passion in his game. Also, the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It is almost boring despite the fact that the filmmaking was more difficult in 1972 than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how Baldwin was captured in Mexico. I think it's a mistake in the story. <br /> <br /> So I think it wasn't necessary to repeat it, or if they decided to take a classic back, they should choose an excellent actor for the first role, such as Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
