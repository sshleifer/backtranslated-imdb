What a pathetic movie. <br /> <br /> I won't waste much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to get back the few hours I've wasted on it. <br /> <br /> Let me simply leave it - Shaq has NO BUSINESS as an actor or singer. He is completely without talent at both disciplines. It is a crying shame that substantially more gifted people throw away in community theaters and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to play undeservedly in movies and cut CDs. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie's failure was the pathetic Shaq's no-talent.
