I'm sorry, I had high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to keep my attention. When I realized the whole movie was just about an older man who had revived his dream, I deceived me. Certainly, it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper, meaningful. <br /> <br /> So don't buy a big drink or go to the rest room. My kids didn't enjoy it either. Oh well.
