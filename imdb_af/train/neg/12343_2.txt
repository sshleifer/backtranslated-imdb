Oh, brother. The only reason why this very annoying movie avoids getting the total "bomb" from me is because it is at least historically remarkable as the first Three Stooges movie (when they were not alone and still with this painful Ted Healy was sown). But even as a prolonged Stooges fan, I have to say that the young Moe, Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant writers. Healy's higher boss. They are not known throughout the film and their stupid, on-and-off stains paint them more like zany-overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing. <br /> <br /> Most of this toothache goes with Jack Pearl looking in vain to seek the audience himself as a man depicting Baron Munchausen. (Here's a good example of the level of humor: "I object!" "On what grounds?" "Coffee grounds!"). His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even the sknoz itself is a drill.
