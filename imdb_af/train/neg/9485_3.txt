Because others have bothered to summarize the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this movie. There can be spoiled here; I don't mind filtering them out. <br /> <br /> - Given the film's low budget, the creature design was pretty good. It's actually nice to see a live horror movie that's not terrible with CGI. Unfortunately, digital film quality is pretty grainy in places, and it's most striking in the well-lit white halls of the asylum. <br /> <br /> - Ridiculous lighting design pests parts of this film, making nothing of the variations over time. I understand that the director might be able to simulate dementia, but to make it effective, there had to be consistent spending time. Just as it looks amateur. <br /> <br /> - Plot turns were many but consistently predictable. I also had no doubt in my mind about the identity of the dressed cultists, nor that some kind of a lame would be a blunder-good development in the end. <br /> <br /> - It may seem like a nuisance, but characters in this movie reliably fail to employ any common sense. First, regulatory commissions would be about a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee death cardiac-induced deaths. Why would the main psychiatric person also be able to do autopsies? Why wasn't there an intrigue of these impressive qualifications, or of his introduction to his strange choice of religion? What is the background? What is supposed to care for anyone in this? And just as importantly, who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place, see everything that was so terribly wrong with it and then decide that it was still a good place to follow a stay? This film did not even consider its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: See The Wicker Man instead.
