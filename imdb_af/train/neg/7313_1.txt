I got 5.75 to see this crappy movie, so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What was the point of the dog that was split at the beginning of the movie, the disease has nothing to do with the split in half. <br /> <br /> What was the point of dragging Karen into the barn, she'd completely infected her room, they could just shut her there where she would have been safer. <br /> <br /> Why would the Hermit walk around the forest and ask strangers to help him when he just asked his family member, the women's wife, to take him to hospital? <br /> <br /> Why didn't T bother any of the characters walking in town to get help when things get bad, are they all really so lazy? Though Paul was threatened by the man, with the shotgun getting on his wife, Paul could have just sent Jeff or Bert home to ask for help. the girl he loves worsens. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the box? Why did Jeff return to the cabin after he left when everyone was infected, if he was so big for a while to go first, wouldn't he just come back? <br /> <br /> If the police were bothered to collect the kids and burn them on the fire, why did they throw Paul halfway into the river, it wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already infected. <br /> <br /> Who makes lemon juice from river water, that shit has dirty leaves and bugs in it. Why couldn't the two children just use the tap water, it was also infected, so the stupid end would still work.
