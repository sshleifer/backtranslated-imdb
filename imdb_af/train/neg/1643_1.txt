"Torn" is one of the most horrible movies of all time. It's a deceptive piece of garbage that forces me to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000, except perhaps "The Grinch." It is not, as people have said, an informative portrait of modern relationships. It would be a small movie called "High Fidelity". Considering that the movie was honest and sympathetic, "hit" is hostile, cynical, misanthropic film gift. Avoid it like many plagues unless you want to see how really a "comedy" can get.
