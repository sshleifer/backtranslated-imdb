... is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be sure: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst grins her way through her role as silent filmmaker Marion Davies, as she thinks she is in "Legally Blonde." The man who plays William Randolph Hearst persuades to the point where you want to hit the screen and hit it. Eddie Izzard is pretty good, except that he plays Charlie Chaplin, and goes over, oh 125 lbs for the part? Hard to believe that this hamfisted, unequal wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but then he has not yet made a viewable film, what? 30 years? Sometimes it just doesn't come back.
