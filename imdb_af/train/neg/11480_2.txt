I watched it with my girlfriend after I struggled about it. <br /> <br /> I think we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute Christmas movie, but were very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The actor playing the soldier looks like there is no emotion, his face looks the same, or he cuts Christmas tree, as the girl loves him to be kissed by her boyfriend, or when he happily surprised being by the girl he loves, he is a terrible actor, and without pont any of us has nothing but laughing at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is the cute blonde girl, blessed with the ability to cheat dot's and cheat on her boyfriend, what a catch! and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots. So it's basically a story about a man without any emotion or feelings that falls to a man who counts dots and cheats on her boyfriend, it's as predictable as it gets, and a lot of wastage, you get nothing to see it not, except a few weird laughs, because it is so yummy. <br /> <br /> I love it when her father says he only eats French fries and not French wine, and they all laugh, that's the hilly attitude this movie is about, and if my girlfriend's dad so running around, I want to tell him something or not, but not our army. veteran, no sir, he'll let us all be boss. <br /> <br /> The movie is what First Blood would have been if John Rambo burned like the biggest wimp in the world.
