I watched the movie recently and it looks bad as the book is based. I blame it on poor script and direction. Some parts are violently set up (the gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. I actually read the book after I watched the movie and 20 years or so after reading it for the first time. I found it difficult to read and somewhat awkward. Too many different ideas are not imagined at all ... other than sensational parts for the time. Since it covers things that are sensitive, to say the least, during communism, I see the fascination it made at the time. This is no longer the case, or maybe I see things differently or a little bit of both. The film tries too much to cover many aspects of the book, the result is a dialogue of scenes that makes sense to someone reading the book. Yet it is a movie that is difficult to watch and may never have been made.
