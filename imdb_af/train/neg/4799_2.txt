I myself am a big fan of the low budget 80's horror movies. It is not the worst, but still not spectacular. The plot line is decent but dragging too long. You're through half the movie before you even see any zombie action. Death is not very creative and the zombies are not too smart. I really think this movie would have been better if they left the zombies and just made it into a mafia movie. It is vigilant, but I feel that this movie steals at least one hour of my life. I'll give the movie credit for a little original. If you're really into B horror movies, it's worth looking at, but if you're not, don't bother. But you don't have to take my word for it.
