Terminus Paradis was exceptional, but "Niki ardelean" was too late. We already have enough of this and we want something new. <br /> <br /> Big directors should have no trouble watching outside their time, not behind. Why do people only see Romania as a post-revolutionary country? <br /> <br /> We've just been born, not reincarnated, and no one gives a s ** t over old times. Most people do not remember or do not remember, and the new generation of film users do not understand a bit. It must be the first day of the Romanian movie, not the last song - priveghi! Perhaps younger directors should make the move.
