I was so excited and excited to watch this movie when the promotions only came out in November! It looks great and the songs! I was disappointed to see it! It's a movie that weaves 6 couples together. It has a multi-cast of 12 people! A large number of stars worked on this film. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, did not manage the situation well and did not have many people in this movie, because that would make it easier for him. Compared to Nikhil's director Debut 'Kal Ho Naa Ho', 'Salaam-e-Ishq' is falling behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast. I think the best factors of this movie are the songs! The songs are excellent and I think all the songs are great, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did an excellent job and has done great work over the years. I think the ratings of this movie can go up because of the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed about was that the director did not include nudity in this film, which is done by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found it very rude to look at family! Although some may find this naked as a comedy, it's not something you want to see with parents! I think the best acting is done by Salman and Priyanka Overall, I think it's a good movie!
