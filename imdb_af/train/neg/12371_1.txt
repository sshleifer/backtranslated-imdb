This movie could have been good (because it had a somewhat fascinating point of departure), but it never goes beyond pure caricature. The acting is very flawed and there were moments where I was so stubborn that I thought I was going to fall from my seat to the theater. Never and I never mean Look at this divine piece .... Danish cinema has gotten very good over the past few years, but if this piece .... crosses the border, I'm afraid nobody will ever want to rent. A Danish movie. This movie is why I chose to register here. I really felt I had to move people away from this piece .... my sympathy goes out to the people who have already gone to the theater to see it
