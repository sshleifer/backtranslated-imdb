Oh dear, dearest. I started looking at it without knowing what to expect. I couldn't believe what I saw. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to flee in one man, who is unarmed and expects him to catch him and escape with a rocket. If it was just that easy. I finally found a movie worse than "Plan 9 From Outer Space".
