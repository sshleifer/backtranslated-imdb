Cloudsophobic camera angles that do not help the movie: Too long face shots only where you feel most of the time lacking the lower half of the movie (the screen is cut off), because there seems to be important actions On, but you can't see them. Anyway, there is too much confusion in the movie, so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artificial visuals. <br /> <br /> I love artwork and unconventional camera work. I can handle deep and slow movies. But this one tries too hard to be advisable and fails in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Nothing to attach to any of the characters, because they aren't worked out well enough. Working out characters is more needed than just a minute of face shots, at least with this set of script + director + actors. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the not so good acting is the result of writing and director or because of the actors. <br /> <br /> I stay away from movies written and directed by Le You, certainly in the future. <br /> <br /> What an annoying movie even for someone interested in that part of history, and for someone who spent time in Shanghai.
