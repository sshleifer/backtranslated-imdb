I'm watching it now on pink (Serbia TV station) and I have to say it's a crap. Shallow, no acting, effects too messy, I mean, who made this series? <br /> <br /> It was a stupid effort by the Studios to make more money on the success of the movie. OK. The movie was big in 1994 when it came out. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters. I mean, did they actually pay someone to write it, was it someone's family member at the Studio? It's not science. <br /> <br /> The movie was the bomb, the series sucks.
