I want to explain a few things. I'm not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai movies, and I'm very familiar with art cinema; I grow in the seventies of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Art films were then really ART; like paint. People have done this to express their inner feelings, not really worried about whether other people understand something. They were beyond commercial values; Just look at an old Antonioni (or early Picasso) and you will understand. <br /> <br /> The Wayward Cloud has nothing to do with Tian bian yi duo yun. It is an opportunistic movie that is meant to deceive celebrity critics and critics, to play many things without saying anything. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't make sense. The lack of water makes the government promote the use of watermelons to hydrate. A girl in despair steals water from the public bathrooms. There is also a porno start-up (neighbor) trying to make a movie with an actress he doesn't feel comfortable with. There is some romantic awakening between the girl and the pornstar. The mess ends up with a sexual scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked, but I think it's less challenging than you can see in American Pie of History of Violence. <br /> <br /> The two main characters never speak. Sometimes a musical number 60 style appears and explains (through a song) what happens in character audiences. These video clips are really welcomed because the previous scene, without dialogue or just music watching people, sometimes takes 4, 5 or even more minutes, which is too much in movie time. <br /> <br /> There are also a few pieces about "the hard to make sex without love", the "selfish mind of the porn industry". <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie is meant to get away to trick festival grounds and critics. It has some pseudo-shocking scenes (within the limits of Taiwan censorship) and many subjects are open, but nothing is closed or gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks have the film a few (contested) prizes in film festivals and get the movie an undeserved commercial success (I see the movie in France and the theater is packed). <br /> <br /> Please do not be deceived. There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie. It is boring and empty; really a fraud to the public. Boogie Nights (which I didn't really like), Intimacy and 9 Songs are much better movies.
