Before I started watching the show I heard it was wonderful and aesthetically very interesting. What a deception, the scripts are so stupid that I am very sure that the authors are son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And what about the SFX and colors, they are so extreme that it is painful to watch, colors are not saturated, they are over-saturated, as scripts are overwritten and the performance is overestimated. This show is like a bad cake in which a child just had to put sugar and butter and think that because these ingredients are the best it is enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only two components of this show are ultimately emptiness and a complete lack of credibility.
