I just wonder what is the purpose of making such movies? the profit? and to whom they refer what intelligence your brain needs to look like something like this crap? This movie is under the attention of less than 3 years. If you're adults, don't try to look. That's why I think Hollywood has used cartoons in movies with actors like this. You must forget the art of theater, be sure you will have tons of popcorn to digest for the time to pass until this movie ends, also get many cola hamburgers your laptop your phone this movie can easily be used in a restaurant but probably not in a theater, my dog ​​who is always next to my family when I watch a movie. The certainty is that this movie refers to people with no claims of cinema. The only thing that this movie can use is to watch it when you make the grocery shopping list. I give 2 stars to support India's theater efforts, but nothing more.
