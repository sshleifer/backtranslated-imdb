Not a knock on Korman, as he was very funny at the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks' movies ("High Fear"). However, he is not a person who can play a film in role-players, no less. This one is basically a "Gremlins" knockoff, following a tradition of such movies as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It is also not a very good knockoff, similar to "Ghoulies", but with a much lighter tone, it is not as close as dark to this movie. In fact, this one is too light and foam, and unfortunately many jokes end up flat. Although I gave it 3 for a score, it's just because there is a movie that is even a worse "Gremlin" knockoff. Looking at Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know the one I'm talking about ... the infamous "Hobgoblins". This one has a guy who gets a little butter in an underground place. (I only saw this movie once, so I don't remember everything clearly) and it starts out kindly. However, this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and, of course, is created more and that is the movie. More miss than hits in the joke section, and it's also really fun to see Korman playing the evil brother role. Best to skip this one, but then you can only check for kicks.
