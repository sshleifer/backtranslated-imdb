It's almost certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially prevalent for Western and martial arts films. Held to learn that family / friends were murdered, so the hero puts on the right revenge, rolls the ineffective legislature, saves the kidnapped love couple and kills the expert. arch nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula is often successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric of what you will ever see. The essay is horribly simple and insulting; A high school seems to have written the dialogue because it has depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes appears to be baptized. The cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes only facades. The acting is unfortunate; Certainly, some of the artists can blame the writing, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a voice again; Every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing more than the sound of his voice and he sounds like a child trying to act. And talking about Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, looks at his dudes (if you dare to watch this movie): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look like Roy Rogers as a hardworking, thin and dirty cowboy. If you enjoy a movie that just serves to worship the imaginative grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, you get it, but if you have more than two neurons, look something else.
