In total, oblong and filled with more subplots than Swiss cheese, has holes! The director and co-author says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. To start, the comedy is not very funny and youthful. In addition, the movie is not really realistic. Liberties are being taken with regard to the legal system in promoting French citizens against their will and the apparent ease of going down with drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on my big screen TV at home and found that I was screaming at the movie to continue. Eventually at the end, I quickly sent the final long speech that made one of the main characters to his ex-lover's son. By that time I was exhausted by the deadly confused plot about a dead lover, a comfortable marriage and a courageous ex-lover. Sometimes the plot leaves to the families of the two main characters and then returns to one of them - either Ishmael or mainly Nora. To the detriment of the audience, the views of Nora and Ismael change, her former lover limiting his will to a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films that aren't well-developed. The epilogue does not really catch much of the subplots and looks as if the viewer wants to believe that Nora will somehow find happiness, although the circumstances in real life are given to her, the chances are equivalent to a snowball chance in hell. The actors do their best and are tempting, but it is not enough to overcome all the glaring flaws of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.
