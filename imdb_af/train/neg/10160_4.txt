A typical Lanza movie that currently has a limited hearing aid with a weak story line that is simply compiled to justify Lanza's MGM contract. <br /> <br /> As reported by member Lastliberal (top), Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene progress to her (and sometimes on) camera. In addition, his goutmanism and the constant smell of alcohol in her face during plays they did together were untenable. After compiling their second (and last) film, "Toast of New Orleans", the usually quiet Grayson rushed to Louie B. Mayer's office and in no uncertain terms told him she would never work with Lanza again. period. Mayer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM than Lanza, so Grayson's assertion was. Grayson has been featured with Howard Keel and others in a number of (and much more profitable) musicals. Later in life when asked to compare Lanza and Keel, her answer was that there was no comparison between them and that Keel was good to work with and much more appealing to the "real people" in the audiences .
