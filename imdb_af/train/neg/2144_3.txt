I always thought Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen, followed by Peter Pan 2, and other successors like The Lion King 2 and The Hunchback or Notre Dame 2. All these movies are made with the same idea. Because the movie has no plot, they try to make it up by filling in jokes. I'm not saying the jokes are bad, but they make the most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I'd give it a 1/10. But now I think, most kids don't care how good the original movie was, they just care that the movie is entertaining. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that doesn't mean it's terrible. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.
