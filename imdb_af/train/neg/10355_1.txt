I loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. And I read it for each of my 3rd and 5th class classes over my last 18 years of teaching. A movie was presumably made in the past, but I could never find it. Well, my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney made Madeline L'Engle's great book on the screen. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I had the greatest hope. As the film progressed, I became more and more discouraged. They beat it badly! I have never been let down by a favorite book-to-movie adaptation. I understand that movies can't adhere strictly to a book, but they don't have to change things for that! Most, if not all, of deviations from the book were completely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> I first kept my opinion on myself and just listened to my students to discuss the movie. Well, it wasn't just me. Almost every one felt the same way - cheated from the wonderful story Madeline L'Engle created so skillfully! <br /> <br /> Why, did they wonder, did Aunt Beast watch like Chewbacca from the Star Wars movie? Why couldn't Calvin's hair be red? Why did Mrs Mrs not have the right "witchy" outfit that was such a clever play on her name? Actually, we all wondered - why almost every detail had to be changed? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed of how wonderful a movie will make this book. I'm still waiting for that movie. This one was a ripple in time in only the widest senses. I'm going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to do the job!
