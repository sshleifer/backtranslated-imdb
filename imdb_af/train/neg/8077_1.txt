I've seen this movie long ago ... luckily it was free. I must be one of the twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I don't remember a lot of it, but I remember being very bored, the plot had no sense and when I came out of the theater, the only thing I could say was at least now I know what the worst movie I've ever seen. I only knew one thing: if they can make the temperature while reaching the sun enough to survive people, why can't they turn it off to a comfortable temperature instead of being hot and sweaty? How silly do they think we are?
