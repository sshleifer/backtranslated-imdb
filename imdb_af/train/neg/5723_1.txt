Anyone who said it's better than Hostel, speaks completely crap, believe me I'm not a fan of Hostel, but it's just ridiculous. It's just another shot on the camcorder, straight to DVD, low on ideas wasting your time. I can't believe how many of these movies are and I still see a decent one. In the 80's videos, gore and horror movies were made with no budget, but a great story and a load of new ideas and, above all, the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now it looks like they're just pumping out in an attempt to browse people in Browbuster to hire a copy until people stop doing it. I think these movies will continue to appear. This film is so low on ideas, it's just wonderful how it ever was made, the acting is terrible too, the place totally unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying that it believes beggars. This waste of time is absolutely nothing unless you are looking to compile a list of the worst movies of all time. My best / worst part of the movie is when a female character shows a gun on someone and threatens to shoot them if they don't come back, you can see that she doesn't even cover the trigger with her finger but just the grip. An absolute joke.
