I actually love Christopher Lee, but it just wasn't his other performances ... and he was one of the better actors. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't live up to its prospect. It's not so scary, it's overly melodramatic, and it is spinning. Every time I thought, "Oh, HERE, come the good part." The good part has never really arrived. <br /> <br /> The evil one is not convincing at all. Most of the other characters also stayed in depth. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I were in the right mind, I might have enjoyed an MSTie fication at the cost of this movie, but .... Naaahhh ... It wasn't really worth it . It wasn't really good, it wasn't really bad, it was just mediocre.
