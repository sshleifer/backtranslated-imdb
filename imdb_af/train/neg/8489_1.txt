Yes, in 35 years of the film, I am going to watch the stinker who finally watched all the horrible movies I saw. Beat 'Good Will Hunting' Baise Moi 'and' Flirt 'for sheer horror. It is pretentious beige of the first order ... not even pretentious bilge entertainment. The effects are cheap, and worse - useless. <br /> <br /> The script appears to have been written by a first-year film student who doesn't come out much but wants to be full of portraits! The play is simply indescribably bad - Tilda Swinton picks up a career filled with an empty woody train with a display that causes neurotics between comotose and lagable 'intensity'. Apparently, there are a few fools who allowed the director of this movie to make another one ... be warned
