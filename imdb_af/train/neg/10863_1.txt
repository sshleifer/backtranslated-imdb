LOW RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good, but this one really makes you a disappointment. ............ <br /> <br /> This movie really wastes your time and money. I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of his release and v are both taken in cinema .......................... ............................ <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT in this movie was very small and useless. I think SANJAY-DUTT cuts the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ....................... <br /> <br /> The character of the movie is also don't define well like the previous one. This movie shows you the result of OVER CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> <br /> The ideas of MAHATMA are also not defined and confusion ..... ........ ..... <br /> <br /> A VERY LARGE DAMAGE
