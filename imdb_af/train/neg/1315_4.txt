Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle Ollie's new wife and baby will see. The problem is they don't exist - Ollie apparently made them! So it is up to him and his friend to find a lady with a baby who would agree with his family. <br /> <br /> It's not a particularly unique story idea, as I have already seen a few other stills with this exact plot. Best of all was Bobby Vernon's, don't cheat me. It is much better than ONE too much - probably due to the fact that it has become a decade later - when the comedy has become a little more sophisticated and uses less on the useless stick stick. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick movies, people with a gun are starting to kick and strangle each other. With little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE too much, this is exactly what they do. None of it makes sense and it was as if they were just coming out of story ideas. <br /> <br /> Overall, not exactly a milestone in entertainment. There is just not enough payout to watch merit unless you are an obsessive silent fan like me.
