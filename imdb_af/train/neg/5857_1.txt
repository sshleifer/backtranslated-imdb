WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps his biggest mistake was the fact that it did not follow most of the previous Survivor Series. There was only one survival series game. And that surviving series game continued for 45 minutes. In addition, someone with a working brain will know that it ends up with The Rock versus Austin and The Rock that rules for his team. And don't start me on the preview before the event. No matter who won it, it was clear that no one was going to die. There was no need for all those useless hype. Regarding the storyline, it was just a struggle. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of the games: the first match was Christian who defended his European title against Al Snow. It was a good quick game and it is good to see a heel that justifies a game. William Regal vs. Tajiri was boring and we saw it 2 or 3 times before. Edge vs. test was good but nothing good. The tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening. The battle Royal went on for ten minutes and nobody really cares who wins in the first place. The women's title match was not good. No, not in the slightest. The main event had to be the most hypocritical game in history. The Alliance lost but guess what, after 5 months, every single Alliance returned. The match itself was poor. The Rock eliminated 3 of them and eliminated Jericho. 2. The Rock was catching up with his acting to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who endangered the entire game. If I wanted 2 to be eliminated in the early trip, it would be them. Everyone knew Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just guys. 7 games are not enough for a survival series. If ever there is a Survival Series as bad as this, I'll do it again
