Be warned: Zeta-Jones or McGregor does not play the leading role, as the poster will believe you. Their roles are really small. <br /> <br /> The movie stumbles across exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, and is not really tempting. Especially, I find it impossible to create much sympathy for the main characteristic, not to mention his screw-ball friends and sex-obsession fianc√©. The plot is dreadful, and I switched it off after about 2/3 - unusual to me, because I like to finish what I start. The good acting and beautiful environment takes it from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
