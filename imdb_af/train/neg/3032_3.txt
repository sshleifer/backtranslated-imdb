Someone told me it was one of the best adult movies to date. I have since discredited everything that tells me about this individual after watching this movie. It's just terrible. Without going into long descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scene is at its best uninteresting. Jenna in the ordinary street clothes was the highlight of the movie at first (it looks good), but it's all downhill from there.
