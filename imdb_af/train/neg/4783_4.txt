It's another bad movie you should probably avoid watching. The plot can be much thicker than it actually is and would be made better than a blockbuster type film. <br /> <br /> The play leaves something to be desired, though you can't really put your finger on it. <br /> <br /> It's one of those you watch on late-night TV, maybe on the US, just because you can't sleep. See it if you want, but don't expect too much of it.
