It is hard to praise this movie much. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but did not have proper modeling for light and shade. The same footage is also used endlessly by the dragon passing through corridors, which becomes slightly boring. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see Marcus Aurelius in acting credits, wondering what an ex-emperor of the Roman Empire did in this movie! Like "Whoopie Goldberg" it must be an alias, and someone can make him use one if he appears in this stinker. <br /> <br /> The story may be interesting, but the scene is flat and direction is boring. . If you have to watch this movie, go to your friend's house and get drunk while doing it - then it'll be nice.
