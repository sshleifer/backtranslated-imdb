I work my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack collection and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the movies in the set. I watch them with my golden seven-year-old daughter, who makes most of these movies a riot. <br /> <br /> I had great hope for REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES, after watching White Zombie, which is actually the forerunner of as much as the lead of zombies in the theater (think Clive Barker's snake and rainbow and James Bond's Live and Let The funeral scene, NOT night of the living dead. <br /> <br /> Although the title includes the word "zombies", it is no longer a love triangle, with anthropologist Armand Louque beaten by Claire Duval; which, in turn, is taken with his companion Clifford Grayson. What a yawn party, my daughter got halfway confused. <br /> <br /> I had a very difficult time deciphering who these people worked - the allies or the ashes; but I think it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the credits for this movie; but it was, of course, his eyes (from White Zombie) that served as the mind-control device for the zombies.
