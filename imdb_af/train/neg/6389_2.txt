I waited nearly 25 years to watch this movie, thinking it could be a subordinate job. From an era, animation was no longer the quality it ever had. It was one of the best movie villains of all time, based on a beloved series of children's books, and was a Disney Studios production. What could be wrong with that? As it comes out, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and Henry Mancini's heavy point is the movie's two savings. Price is evil, and Mancini earns more professionally than the material. They bring class to a project that is otherwise in darkness. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the rest of the movie, while full of insufficient adult situations, still suffers from a completely dim text, common generic voice work, horrible songs and lazy animations that wouldn't be out of place. on any of Disney's mid-1980s Saturday morning TV shows. <br /> <br /> It was a complete disappointment to me. It's amazing that this movie was almost contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. The cost of a break from this, an independent studio, produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD ran in its endless running. <br /> <br /> The extra star who likes it "horrible" goes to Price and Mancini.
