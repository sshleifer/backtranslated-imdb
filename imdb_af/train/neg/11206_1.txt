No one is a bigger fan of Gerge Macdonald Fraser's Flashman newspapers than I'm. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see Richard Lester directing Royal Flash as I also saw that he made the Three / Four Musketeers. <br /> <br /> Not so Royal Flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since I read and flashed all the Flashman newspapers published so far with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I'm still, but he's never really given a chance). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment (I saw it again when I was about 20 on television and it got worse.) <br /> <br /> None of the sharp dialogue in the books is transferred to the screen. The comedy of Flashman's character seemed to me to have thought like a group of high school students trying to parody it. The dueling and fence were terrible and unnatural. <br /> <br /> Looking back at more mature eyes, but the film did not abuse the possibility of direct satire from earlier film versions of the Zenda Prisoner. <br /> <br /> When you read the book and didn't see the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg to become friends and play a game quickly. Rudi just found out: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about. <br /> <br /> My comment would be more direct if I saw the movie recently, but I'm glad I didn't. <br /> <br /> If ever Fraser can read it, I can only say I think he is a genius - perhaps the greatest comic book writer of his generation, but it's so hard to believe he's based on my appreciation for that corpus of work. wrote the screenplay of this movie because he did all the terrible Roger Moore James Bond movies.
