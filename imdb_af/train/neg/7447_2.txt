I only read "Lorna Doone" 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! It is a classic historical romance that took place in the 1600s when the west country was traveling several days out of London and the law and order were much more difficult to enforce. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes many freedoms with the story and I was incredibly disappointing. The acting and production values ​​are OK, but the way the story was spoken was scary. Why do television adjustments do this? Why would they think the thousands of fans of a book want to change the story? One of life's great mysteries !!! The BBC made an excellent version broadcast on Christmas in the early 1990s, and I still try a copy of it! Take my advice, read the book and don't bother with this spicy version!
