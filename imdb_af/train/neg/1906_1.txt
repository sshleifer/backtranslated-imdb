They played it on the 4th Twilight Zone marathon and that's, hands off, the worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. It is totally out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Although Twilight Zone is a fairly unequal series and many episodes are ultimately predictable, this one was completely out of place. Compare it to legendary episodes such as "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you realize there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material, and frankly it surprised me that someone from his historical comedy stature would lead to the level of this episode. Although he obviously took the trouble, he needed the money ... there was no other explanation.
