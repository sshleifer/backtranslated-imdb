Whoever wrote 'Redline' as a wonderful motorcycle movie must be paid by Daniel Sadek to promote this ultra fiery, steamy stack of amateur chess. Easily the worst motorcycle movie or any movie ever made. It shows Showgirls like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take each cheesy clich√© from an 80s action TV series, place some very special special effects and lame characters without relevance and you have a living proof that Daniel Sadek shouldn't write screens and produce movies, but remain in the property business. <br /> <br /> It's such a lame movie with such a patch plot and the most confronted action series ever. What offends me is not that the creators of this movie are idiots, but that they publicly consider the movie as idiots enough to fall for this crap.
