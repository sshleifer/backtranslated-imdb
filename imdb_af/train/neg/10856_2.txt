Look, I won't lie to you, but I only got this movie for $ 3.99 from a friend, because it had Danni Filth, the lead singer of the most popular death metal band "Cradle Of Filth" in it. Obviously I expected violence and gore, as is what Mr. Filth can depict as a plot line. <br /> <br /> But dear God, I was oh, so wrong. This movie bites seriously, big time. To be a low budget movie (haha, wait, make it ZERO BUDGET), it has of course the beautiful Howard Stern orchestral music and the Spielberg special effects. No, it's all a camera, bad corners and bad blood tones. <br /> <br /> For example, when we star and violent enemy, Filth, killing a mosquito. A grab at the throat and blood spit, but oh me, it looks like there is a juice pack with fake blood in the man's shirt. <br /> <br /> For your Cradle Of Filth fans: You will hear two songs throughout the movie, but with the camera angles and crooked filming, they drag the overall pleasure of the song DOWN. <br /> <br /> My final remark: Get away from it. It's blood, gore, breasts and hay, even a rogue story to go with. So, if you like horrible violence, almost no votes (yes, there are almost no words in this movie), then buy it all. But if bad movies aren't your thing, avoid it. Don't waste your money.
