Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst films mankind has made. The film, one of the many disabled people that originated in the phenomenal success of Black, makes a mockery of the disabled brotherhood. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere caricatures of disabled people. While Swart portrays the poignancy and emotions of a disabled woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who are not worried about disability and half of the world to protect their love interests . Anu Malik's music is fair. Vivek Oberoi, who made a promising start to Saathiya, unfortunately lost his balls quickly in the Hindi theater. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just beautiful damsels in need that have nightmarish times in Thialnd, with no one to save them - except the aforementioned desperados. Boman Irani, as the villain Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the film if possible.
