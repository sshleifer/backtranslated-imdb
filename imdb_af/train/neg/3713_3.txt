TO THE EARTH / (2001) * (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" is such a deceptive and desperate comedy on the home down. The couch looks at a Chris Rock performance on television, looks like heaven. With heaven talking, the film is based on the 1978 movie "Heaven Can Wait." It was a good movie, and it is good to demonstrate how a group of aspiring writers can use spectacular material and change it into garbage. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz miss almost every target. From concept to story telling, "Down to Earth" failed miserably; It's a really bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a common standup comedian, both in his role in this movie and in real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose manager (Frankie Faison) even feels sorry for him when he comes to the local theater of the stage during amateur weekend. Shortly after the writing confirms its lack of talent, the character is killed by a speed truck. Death, played by Eugene Levy, made a mistake to take Lance before his number acted. God's assistant (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to let Lance make the rest of his time on earth, as long as he takes the only available body of a 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> The old man's name is Mr. Wellington, whose life has its own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has a relationship with his assistant (Greg Germann), who robbed him of his money. But that's right, because Lance, within Mr Wellington, fell in love with a young black woman, Sontee (Regina King). Meanwhile, there are plots to kill Wellington, Lance tries to get a better body, and Sontee's tangled feelings are about <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" has some good ideas, but they are in a useless and unconvincing love story filled with contrivances and recycled material. The biggest problem this holds is how we lance as Mr. Wellington observe. Chris Rock is the actor with popularity and publicity, so he will not be absent from most of this movie; All the characters see the new Lance as mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. It is convenient for the love story; we believe that a young woman will fall for Lance, but in reality he is an old gray-haired guy. It is not so convincing. <br /> <br /> The one-joke comic situation is supposed to look at how an old man does funny things really done by a young black man. But what inspires laughter is when characters run into conflicts without conflict. Just look at "There is something about Mary." In the funny scenes, the characters are exposed to uncomfortable experiences, and not according to their will. Here Lance knows he's in an old man's body, and does things that old men wouldn't usually do. If Lance didn't know the body, then it was possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the concept: we never got mr. Knowing Wellington in the first place, so, how can we lance in his body when we don't know what he was originally. To solve everything, Chris Rock must be the center of attention here, making the character too much like Rock. He recites simple exciting routine jokes that are boring and painful; his dialogue is so obvious, wood and straight. I hated the movie's sense of humor. There are so many unknown jokes and horrible comic situations. It's like watching Chris Rock Chris Rock, not a character in a movie. <br /> <br /> Let's emphasize the positives in "Down to Earth." Mark Addy is not doing worse here than he did in "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas." Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are well thrown, but they are gracious to a skull head. These are all the good features that I can name at this time, and if you remind me another week, I'm not likely to get up any more.
