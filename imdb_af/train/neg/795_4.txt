If you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as fellow stars, you expect to find a well-done horror movie, but it was totally different. It represents what I would describe as an early attempt at science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both compete scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to some extent until Rukh Benet conquers with a demonstration proving his great theory. Science was a bit rough on the sides (so science fiction, with the emphasis on fiction), but somehow Rukh uses a beam of Andromeda that allows him to back a few thousand million years. " that prehistoric time struck a huge meteorite in Africa, which left deposits of a substance called scientists "Radium X" - which can cure and destroy. A large part of the movie is set in Africa quite sowingly, on looking for the meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and uses to create a large weapon, which unfortunately infects him with a kind of disease that also makes him a great weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi pulls a roll in which he is the good guy quite good, although I certainly did not find him convincing - especially during the scenes in Africa. kept it, it did not captivate me, since it really is a sci-fi, e worse than a horror movie, and that sci-fi was in the early stages, I gotta get the movie a little slack. It was OK - nothing more, but nothing less. 10/04
