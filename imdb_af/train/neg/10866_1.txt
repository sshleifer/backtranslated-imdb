Let's see where to start ... bad acting; I'm not sure I will even mention it, as it reads more according to the lines of a no-effort script. The actors didn't even look in their parts and were pretty lifeless and listless. Certainly there was a scene or two with nudity, but it couldn't save the movie of its lifeless characters. <br /> <br /> To name the main character, a rapper is an insult to the people who really do. The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and were more in the sense of the senseless rations. <br /> <br /> Budget? Did this movie even have a budget? They seemed to have used less money than I saw in a YouTube home video. Bad lighting, props, poor sound after production. Bad special effects, if you want to go that far to name it. Story could have been good if people actually seemed to make it that way, but there was no life for this movie; I don't care who did it. <br /> <br /> Over the past year I have seen very bad movies and this one is definitely underneath. Don't waste your time, or you'll wish you listen to this unbiased review. Look at the ratings, you will see that the 1's quickly protrude the filled 10's with virtually nothing in between. Wish I would have looked a little closer before I wasted my time. What a sucking party!
