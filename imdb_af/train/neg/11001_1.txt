I have never seen a comedy that was so hard to put through. Not one laugh in it. Okay, maybe a little nice for the Michael Clarke Duncan bit as the big, black, bare gay virgin. But the rest was shockingly ragged. What's more, the "sketch" is going on forever! Get away from this one if you value your time and money. Terrible !!! The worst !!!
