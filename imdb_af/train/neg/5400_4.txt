It's just short of a full blown gore festival based on a Stephen King story. Two tabloid reporters, one crucified (Miguel Ferrer) and one not so reached (July Entwisle), believe that a ceremony killer (Michael H. Moss) can actually be a vampire. Strange than strange, this contemporary blood sugar is not naturally winged, but through a black Cessna he is looking for his victims. The gore is actually gruesome, as the film reaches its stupid final. Keep in mind that Mr. King had nothing to do with this movie. I admit it is a little scary in the early hours of the night.
