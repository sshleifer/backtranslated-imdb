I bought Unhinged because I went through the gory photo on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, just look at the back of the box. All the victims are shown and I can honestly say that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said this, let's look at the plot. A group of college girls driving to a rock concert (through the deep, dark forest in one of the longest row sequences ever trapped on celluloid) slides off the road. No visible damage is done to the car, but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the movie (or maybe she read the script and was already in a coma before filming started. <br /> <br /> The two remaining girls wake up in a large, isolated house. Incidentally, the house is fabulous and manages more drama only through its presence as any of the actors in the film. For some reason, however, this house has no roads. The only way to get to the main road is to walk five miles through the forest. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged listening to strange conversations between an old rich bitch (dragged like George Washington) and her equally homely, sexually repressed daughter. The girls didn't seem to be in a hurry to come back from the concert anyway because they packed more clothes than the Gilligan's Island for that three-hour tour. <br /> <br /> By the time we get the viewers dead dead, we don't care anymore. We wish someone would kill us just to end our suffering. Unhinged ends up with a very shocking ending that deserves to be in a much better movie. It's almost as if the end, the one good idea in the movie, was first written and then the authors tried to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, Unhinged is a boring movie with bad acting, improper directing, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porn movie (sorry. I'm not sure where it comes from) . You will get an idea of ​​how bad this movie is during the opening credits when the screen is never explained for some reason, the screen will be black for about two minutes, while the characters talk about nothing worth doing. to remember. Don't waste your time. You just feel unhinged and want your time and money back.
