Maybe I missed the meeting when the meaning of "B-movie" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good summary of this movie? Take aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that's good about it, and that's pretty much. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes in the movie, the "V-SAN group" (it's the stupid acronym I've ever heard), a vampire-massaged base, and then they climb ( DOWN? What?) A leather that is naturally attached to a sign with an obvious current train in the background. When is it supposed to happen? 2210. Good ... (hold on, I'll be back) <br /> <br /> Yes. the characters. Wow, well, there is the token lesbian Asian chick, the Redneck Cowboy Wannabe, the weathered captain, the goth vampire / Hot Topic timekeeper, and the difficult noob in command. Everyone is played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost hurt me to see Micheal Ironside in this movie. Isn't he enough money to be Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell? The only thing originally from Vampire Wars is about how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Watching this aftermath of a movie, the only entertainment I got was some of the poor attempts to make. Since when have PCI computer cards been pasted onto a wall count as a toolbox on a star ship? The money needed to do this movie could be much better used.
