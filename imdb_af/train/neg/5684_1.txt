badly directed garbage. a mediocre nihilistic sadistic gorefe ... if you're the kind of person who likes ... look shrink. Even if you are that person, it doesn't make a good movie, the play is really poor, the story full of plot holes, the director really just has to give up and find a job because he has no talent for this one. I can see why people do not like yours. We recently had some of his films and these are the best of them, which is really sad! A complete absence of any kind of humanity seems to suit some people, but it only rises here. Horror movies can be full of anger, they can be miniature artworks, they can only look good if there is nothing else ... SEED is just really poor.
