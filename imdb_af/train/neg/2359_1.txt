It was supposed to be the last Freddy movie (and it was for over 10 years) - you'd think they would have tried to get a good movie. But they turned out to give us the worst of the series (and it says a lot). The plot doesn't make sense (I can't really remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you actually wanted to kill them) and Freddy's wisdom cracks were even worse than usual. The only little thing about this was a short (and funny) cameo by Johnny Depp (the first Nightmare movie was his first). I also originally saw it in a theater where the last section was. (Freddy's repeated childhood) was in 3-D. Well, the 3-D was mean - faded colors and the image goes in and out. Also, the three flying skulls that were supposed to be frightening (I think) had the opposite reaction of my audience. Everyone laughed laughter. Look even worse on TV in 2-D. Pointless and stupid - very boring too. Skip this one and see "Freddy vs Jason" again.
