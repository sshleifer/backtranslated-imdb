I read comments that you shouldn't watch this movie if you're looking for a moving Shakespeare dialogue. It is true, unfortunately, because all the moving dialogue, this wonderful play, has been cut, and replaced with songs. I read this play and recently was happy to show it. It remains one of my favorite Shakespearian Comedies, but this movie looks all I like. However, the Princess had no doubt to do what she was aiming to do, and all the girls lost the cleverness of their characters - also touched by careless cuts that not only spared the female characters, but had commented on context - it was a little unnecessary to preach the Princess; "We are wise girls to mock our loved ones so much!" When mockery did not happen at all. The news rolls throughout the movie also disrupted the flow and took away many excellent scenes because they showed them information in the scenes and in modern phrasing. Finally, an excellent game, ruined by a strange concept and frightened tracks. Kenneth, I usually like what you do. What did you think?
