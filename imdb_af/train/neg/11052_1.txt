The Deadly Wake is the perfect movie for movie students ... to learn not to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what did the crew do in this movie? Worst music mix Worst editing Worst script WORST ALL-TIME DIRECTORY Worst observing Worst choreography Worst cinematography Worst props Worst set worst worst lighting. Let's look at this, if this "movie" was in black and white white and black ... it would have been pretty awful. All the scenes were dark (people relieved it black), often the tracks drowned the winding dialogues, which was OK because no one ever spoke two whole sentences without long breaks for effect. The "evil" robot was hilarious ... what was it? Jazz dance? Oh ... I think it's supposed to be tactical or something. I'm sure it hit fear in the hearts of the poor editors. And, how do you edit as many footage of garbage? Impossible. Rubbish is garbage, no matter how you split it. How did anyone ever get it through the mail list? <br /> <br /> Bottom line is - I couldn't stand looking at more than 15 minutes of segments, it was so bad ... but I have the whole thing (with many breaks) just to see if it had any good parts in it. Nope! NO! <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how not to make a movie ... a must see for every serious movie student !!!
