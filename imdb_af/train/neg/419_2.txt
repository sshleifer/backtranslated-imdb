The Invisible Man is a fantastic 1933 movie, a brand new movie for the time when objects on a man who was invisible appear on the resting place. Look at the movie, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933. It was the first true special effects movie. Come 2000, computer-aided special effects look like childrens, audiences aren't blown away by special effects, but they're disappointed if they're not done right. The special effects in Hollow Man, updating the HG Wells story, are good, but not the biggest problem with this movie, directed by Paul Verhoeven, which you may remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist who plunges into the world of bio-invisibility (yes, I know it's not a word), but of course, higher ups are threatening to take away the team's funding. So, as movie characters who want their finance discount, it tends to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for invisibility (yes, I know, I used that word again). The process has serious consequences, no Caine dies, but rather becomes a horny, violent being, also a man. Now that he is invisible, Caine puts a sexy neighbor, a co-worker, former girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue), and the man who gives away his funding. Then a strange thing happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural being, "The thing that will not die". Dissolve in the face of all things of course, Caine faces off the dead and spits in his face, as it takes that feels hours for these creatures to die, to drag the end of the movie out. The film is stupid, stupid and finally laughing at the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man, but of course none of them are being investigated. For a more interesting look at an invisible creature, get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white theater, and look at the 1933 invisible man. Kevin Bacon will still be invisible if you come back, probably still down a volcano.
