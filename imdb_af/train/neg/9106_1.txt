From the start, you will just notice how hard they have been trying to imitate the very clever and powerful 'Intense Intentions', and how flat it landed. You'll also find out what a terrible choice they made by throwing Robin Dunne as Valmont ... And in the second scene you'll meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. That is if you can pass the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first movie. Then the movie continues, you see the cheap romantic story of miles ago, and you see Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past, here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here called Cherie ... How originally it is for a prequel. Then it gets into a low budget "Wild Things" type movie with many and my "twists". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he's a bad actor, he's good. He just didn't have the charisma Ryan did. Amy Adams, who in my opinion is one of the most talented young actresses of our time, is delivering again. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way to save this waste. As a whole, this "movie" feels like a 'Beverly Hills, 90210' episode. The score was stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER score ... Can't they leave that one alone? You will want to pass this one. If you want more cruel intentions, see Stephen Frears's Dangerous Liaison.
