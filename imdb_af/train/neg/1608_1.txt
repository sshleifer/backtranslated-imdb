Che's charisma and appearance has so much to do with his iconic stature as the wrong information distributed by Left propaganda (like this movie) over him. <br /> <br /> I don't know what is worse: being caught by one of Che's killing teams or 4 hours of this typical Soderberghian garbage. The question is not why this pet project was made, but what took them so long. Of course, by "them" I refer to left-wing Hollywood and his "secret" love of Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... take your choice). I was fascinated that it took decades for one of Tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally tackle such an irresistible biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone for years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand even? It's a mystery. All these over-estimated "artists" often welcomed themselves into similar, politically unilateral projects, but somehow, Che Guevara, who is probably the most popular and well-known Communist, has not yet been subjected to a film. <Br /> <br /> "Guerrilla" has all the features of an American truth-telling epic-scale story; There are so many factual details to be found here, like in other similar Hollywood-political political fairy tales such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi", ie almost nothing. The movie stars Del Toro as the famous Argentine revolutionary. However, how controversial and criminal this man could have been, one thing nobody could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a wealthy family. Therefore, Del Toro only adjusts the visual account. Del Toro can be an interesting, charismatic actor and he can physically look like Guevara, but he has no intellectual characteristics whatsoever. That's why he turns Guevara off as too primitive. The fact that Brat, Philips and Franka Incompetente are fighting the role of such means only emphasizes the lack of good judgment of the director. <br /> <br /> The movie is mostly very slow (no surprise there) and visually uninteresting. Even a director who wanted as brilliant as Kubrick, carefully considered a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour point. So it is really to say that this Soderbergh, who first made one or two solid films, would think early in his career that his Oceanic Grandness was up to the task. If you think the movie's length indicates that much of Che's life has been shown here - think again. Soderbergh focuses on Che's last phase, and much of the movie is boring jungle nonsense, full of Guevara's alleged idealism. (Psychopaths have no ideals.) I wonder what a mind is to actually choose this highly esteemed director to ignore Che's past life. Did he actually consider it too uninteresting? A murder of 600 people does not like the viewer, huh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this over-priced charlatan will easily fit one, but two complete biographies into a 4-hour movie. <br /> <br /> To some extent, Soderbergh becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative, dark side - which is more than 90% of Guevara. Spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy ignores the ugly truth consciously (God prevents him from consuming the sacred image of Che). Soderbergh does not prove himself a humanist - a false image that most Hollywood and pop music staff run a lot to maintain their careers - but the opposite: just caring for ideas, never about the people on whom these ideas are tested (as in guinea pigs). Soderbergh and the like are elite of the worst kind; such people often have a latent contempt for the "proleteriat" (which is a stupid term) to which they are believed. <br /> <br /> Half of all students around the world wear Che's image on their red and orange shirts, but without ever knowing why. He became an iconic figure for clueless, uninformed, very often young people, thinking of having the man's face on their chest, which somehow made them look "edgy", intellectually, hip, or interesting. In fact, wearing a Che shirt only accentuates your general abundance and total interest in self-education. (Don't want to find out more about a person before advertising his / her face to the world?) The use of Che's new clich√© image has become so commonplace that he had a Bart Simpson coffee mug. All the "Che-wearers" probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they will ever read about Fidel Castro's dead ally. <br /> <br /> After all that was done in the name of Marx, one would think that this mongrel "ideal" would eventually come to rest. Man never seems to learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, the Iron Curtain, one hundred million dead, more than a billion have physically and / or spiritually destroyed through this system ... so nothing about it? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro has won a Cannes award should only surprise and vote for those who are absolutely clueless about how Cannes and other European festivals work. Tip: Sean Penn didn't have a jury long ago. <br /> <br /> For my music related borders, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
