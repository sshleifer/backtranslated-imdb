Looked at Hulu (too many ads!) It broke the pacing, but still, it was like a very bad friend movie from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were India, I would protest the portrayal of all men as venals and all women as shrews. They cheated on western music sales videos and used many Western models, so the men could touch them. I usually enjoy Indian movies, but it was a great disappointment, especially for a modern Indian movie. The story doesn't take place in India (the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India), but I can't figure out where it's going to happen.
