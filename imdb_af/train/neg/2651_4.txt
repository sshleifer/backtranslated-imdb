The first 30 minutes of the movie was messy and hard to just know what was going on (unless you read the book - which I didn't have). <br /> <br /> If you can keep up with the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet non-less. <br /> <br /> The way it was shot would think it was produced in the early 80's, not 2005. <br /> <br /> No moments, but it surprised me without being bored. <br /> <br /> I want to know why Keaton selected this role. Her part would have been better with a player more on the level of the other actors to keep the balance.
