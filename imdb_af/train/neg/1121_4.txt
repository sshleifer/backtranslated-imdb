Within the first few minutes of this Dutch excitement, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, trying to steal a magazine from a newspaper, and craving a supervisor he meets at The train station. And he is the hero of this nonsense movie that is all dressed (except for crabs in at least one scene too much), but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple, but is released after almost two hours before reaching a meaningful conclusion. Verhoeven has a fine visual flair, but considers screens of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism, and free crying when he walks out of ideas.
