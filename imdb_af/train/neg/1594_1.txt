Wow. This movie bored my pants when I saw it. Mix, useless and disrupted. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash and co. can meet up there with the help of the "Spirit of the Forest" ("Princess Mononoke" many?). There they meet a brave child named Sam, and the "plot" begins. <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) get tall with nature, become hippies and try to free Celebi (the "Spirit") of some weirdo hunter guy. I don't even know what goes on. It all went well. Ash's friends were almost in there, and all the fighting scenes were boring. <br /> <br /> After the day is saved, Ash and his infamous friends must return to their time, while Sam looks away with Celebi (that scene was just creepy. OO;) Then, after returning, Ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival's grandfather. And I think that's it. Isn't it really delayed? If you like your kids, you won't expose it.
