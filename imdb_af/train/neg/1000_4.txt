The Descent plot, if it can actually be called a plot, has two notable events. One near the beginning - one at the end. Together, these events may constitute 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I think everything) in between is basically the directors' desperate attempt to fill in the minutes. I like the story of movies, I like dark movies and I'm not upset by turbulent scenes - but if you expect to have 60 minutes of dark / dark (literally) scenes with NO storyline, you have another thing. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, was completely wasted here. And no, she doesn't get naked, not even in the NC-17 version I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a few hours to throw away and want to see "Descent", take a nap instead - you will probably have more interesting dreams.
