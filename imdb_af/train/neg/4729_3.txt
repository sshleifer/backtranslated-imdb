LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE, is one of Elvis's strangest movies. Share slapstick, share fluff, share surreal and part strange. Elvis meets a very undecided girl with an annoying voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. Story doesn't make much sense as in most Elvis Presley movies, and there are a lot of strange characters in general. Not much music in this one, but what is it that I love, though no one is memorable. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey go to her beach house at night, but a few minutes later a living boy comes in and it is daylight !! What ?? It's about the core of the movie. What ?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks good and B) the dog steals the show.
