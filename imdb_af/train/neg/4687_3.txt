SPOILERS (NOT REPEATED IN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE FILES) <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is pretty good at this as well as the friendly, lonely, emotionally pounded loser. He makes a very human, even sympathetic, psycho, and really disappears in the character - no small achievement for such a recognizable artist. <br /> <br /> Bad the rest of the movie is such a waste. The supporting performances (and artists) will not look out of place in a soft core porn (it doesn't help every character, but she's made 100% cardboard). Sometimes the director actually seems to be trying to frustrate: we know from the first moments that she is a complete slam, b) that he survives, and c) that he is by the police at the end. So, everything we consider is the hows and the whys, and the answers provided are not that interesting. <br /> <br /> The plot is plowing and confronted, and contains some nonsense moments (for example, the man robs his wife for her expensive taste, though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount store). About two-thirds of the way through, she's doing something so unbelievably stupid that one wonders how much he really cares about his great revenge scheme. And the final clich√©d explanation of his psychosis, right out of 'Peeping Tom', is a terrible copout. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is of the absolute worst kind. It's not overridden, or uncomfortable or unbelievable or bad in any other way that can be considered fun, even for bad movie lovers. Instead, each line is purely functional. It's as if the director handed a plot sketch to a newspaper copywriter and said, "Hey, I need a workable script on this." It made me shout to be honest. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a throw back to the suburban popsies of the eighties and nineties ("The Hand Rocking Rock," and although it's definitely unpleasant, it's never really scary. "She's fetishism sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable, but it's not enough to make the film work alone. In the end, there is a lack of craftsmanship for everyone involved, except Robin Williams. 3 out of 10.
