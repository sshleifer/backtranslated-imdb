Unfortunately, this film, 54, was a pathetic attempt by the true story of 'Studio 54'. The only thing that was good about the photo was "Mike Myers" who was a pleasure to watch. "Neve Cambpell," although her role was few, unfortunately was bad. The bottom line is that this film had a good performance from the actors, except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt to a good script.
