While this excursion certainly does not meet its predecessor, it has more than its share of memorable moments. My personal favorite, just after throwing me into a city block with his "Video Disc Cannon", we see a close-up of Nimoy's face. At one stage, as a single slide from his left eye, Nimoy knows more than just a murder machine. The viewer cannot help but is drawn into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat influence was just a facade. Absolute brilliance !!! The sex scenes show a nice balance, carnal but not pornographic. Then I felt that I had a good understanding of how to work the Magnavision Video Disc Player. Bad, they didn't produce them for more than 25 years.
