They probably had to mention this movie The Map, because the majority of the whole silly movie is being turned over to a map of a cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the card are there. The only thing they show more than the card itself is the tiny beads of sweat that constantly build up on the forehead of our main character. It was, of course, the filmmakers' way of showing us how incredibly tense things came to the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on, could they not just show us one of the deaths? We hear a lot about how everyone who is listed on the map falls like flies, but we can't see anything. Some how I bury the Living Bury to keep my attention so was pretty generous with the rating I gave, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with cards or sweat, I recommend renting a better I movie, as I spit on your grave or I drink your blood.
