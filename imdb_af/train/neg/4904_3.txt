Teamo Supremo are three children, consisting of their leader captain Crandall, Rope girl and Skate Lad, all with their own screech (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And outfit and move. They work for governor, Kevin, and were recruited after they wanted to pay tribute and played in that match. They also lead normal lives, and have family and school duties, but most of the action takes place away from school fights. The villains all have quite unique and distinctive features, such as Mister Vague and his men who never know what their plans are, but act anyway. From an evil robot to an evil baron, the three must meet and stop their evil and often weird, planning to gain power, revenge. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is pretty nice and smooth, but the style seems simple. The backgrounds have overlapping color and the buildings look futuristic. The music is pretty pretty, and the show is not too bad, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> The stands are almost always stupid and ridiculous, but it's a cartoon and one can't blame them. However, this would not be in the same rank as Fillmore! or pepper Ann.
