Terry West had a good idea about this movie. He just didn't go through it. There are endless shots of creepy looking school exteriors going on forever and probably the movie's running time. Also at this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as usual, but this movie will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie in the beginning). If the writing on her interesting character is centered, we will have a movie to watch. She is so GREAT !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's earlier (and better) movie "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that this movie feels like someone who is not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke, because the end feels so much the same. Then look again at Ruby LaRocca.
