Give it a crappy movie! I can't understand what people find so scary about "The Wrudge". The director plays one trick (I have to admit a very good one, which is very stylized) and then repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over. As a result, I was shocked several times in the first quarter of the movie, but when I knew the drill, I almost fell asleep because The Grudge became more predictable. In conclusion, I can say that there are much better movies in the genre to start with, so-called predecessor "The Ring" was very scarier and that buying a ticket for "The Grudge" is a waste of money.
