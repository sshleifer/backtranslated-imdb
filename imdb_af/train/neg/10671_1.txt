MST 3000 must do this movie. It's the worst-ever movie I've ever seen. First, you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since the army left in 1993 and paid its rent in cash. There is no way in hell that a person like it could ever be to be as close to a president as not calling a high profile job. Also, the head of security for the POTHUS would not be so emotional that he would start drinking in a haze when the president was shot. This movie sucked. I can't express the extreme of this movie. Every actor was horrible. Even the chick at the trailer. I estimate this garbage. What a waste of time.
