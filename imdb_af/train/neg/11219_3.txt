It was a movie about infidelity and revenge. A twin with the "twin" connection feels something wrong with her sister. This movie took forever to establish the plot. A plot that has been done many times. The acting was mostly common. Once the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with an abused father. The father is in favor of Ashley, so Laura is blamed for everything. There is a promise that the girls will never be apart, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job in a dinner where she meets a married man. Of course nothing can come of it. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to find him. I was waiting for this movie to get better and to find a solution there, but it never happened.
