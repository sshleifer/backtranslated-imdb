Joel Schumaker leads the writing he wrote together and has a group of Georgetown degrees faced with adult life situations. The story line is a messy mess, but some scenes are really good. There is much wasted talent and time here. The movie is more impressive than the movie. Selected are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most notable is McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is rather unpleasant. The age is not so easy.
