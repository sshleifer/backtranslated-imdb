Well, what was fun ... except for the fun part. <br /> <br /> This is my second least favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'. <Br /> <br /> Let's start with the good. The teaser, it was done incredibly well and also emotionally. To be the big animal lover, it is fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But then there are all the bad, and believe me there are a lot of them. Few made sense, so that the animals were abducted and fertilized by aliens? whaaa ??? The dialogue was also very terrible. There were about one or two quotas. <br /> <br /> And most of all, with pretty much all the animals dying, was very unpleasant to me. In the end ... what's the point? they all pretty much died. We didn't learn anything, we were not entertained, and I couldn't even find Sophia's death sad ... just very frustrating. <br /> <br /> * star. ashamed because season 2 did so well.
