The 1980s TV show, updated with fresh female flesh, and raunchy language. The deer of Hazzard overtook me; it was not repeated when I was in front of or on television in New York or California; or, I would probably have looked. Still, from somewhere (like the tracks that include this movie's updated version of 2005), I knew it was about a fast-paced, orange Dodge Charger - and the "General Lee" is still good to go. <br /> <br /> Hunky cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the New Riders of the Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (as Daisy) fills her short briefly - but even her exciting pink bikini can't discount a hostel full of bouncing, topless cows. The stupid plot involves a greedy Burt Reynolds (as 'Boss Hogg') who threatens to change Hazzard County into a strip mine. <br /> <br /> ** The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
