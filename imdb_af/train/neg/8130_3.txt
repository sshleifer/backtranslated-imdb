While some caves are being examined with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat that causes some adverse side effects. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, creepy atmosphere and some decent (though used) makeup effects don't save B horror movie from a sub-parole story of being human being. The bat people aka It lives at night, suffers from its senseless story that is uncomfortable and impeccable in pacing. The plot never looks much more and the movie never provides an explanation for what is happening, or even a satisfactory conclusion for it all. The movie is fairly mediocre in their performances. <br /> <br /> However, I give the movie a few points for its haunting theme song and beautiful filming spots. The makeup work of late Stan Winston is also pretty good, but it doesn't get much of a showcase here. A missed opportunity for sure. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the fewer human beings flicker out there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
