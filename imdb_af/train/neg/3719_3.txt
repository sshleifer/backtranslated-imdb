Imagine pulling back the mask of a deadly assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there ... that's what happens to this movie. <br /> <br /> The opening has shown promise, but it soon leaves all the pretenses of an excitement (or even an imaginative love story) and the only reason they made this story is abundantly clear: to ' to fill a gap in their female exploration market by creating another repetition of a wrongly understandable bad boy (Andrei), meet innocent, wonderful beauty '(Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting any time in creating an original premise, the filmmakers went straight for the treasure: the bad boy is tamed by the whimsical beauty. Hence, a string of sincere and affectionate love scenes sprinkled with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fluff. Andrei's acknowledgment of being a "poet" is being taught the perceived qualities that a Byron hero should have - but even when we are told in heavily underlined writing who and what he is, it is still difficult to do so. believe - or care. <br /> <br /> For a Byronic hero / antihero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation - completely absent here. It's not a modern Phantom of the Opera, it's just what happens if a weak and rather stupid woman (with loose knicker elastic) is a bad guy who meets her, looks as dangerous as bunny slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances saved this movie, if they were good: the female head is looking sexy and "outside world", no matter how forced or ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott seems to be swollen as he bumps through his part. This is not his best job. The glitters of interest were brought by JÃ¼rgen Prochnow as 'Vashon' and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer / brother. A better movie would have complemented the sister and instead held the brother.
