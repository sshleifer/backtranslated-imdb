As a big fan of the original movie, it's hard to watch this show. The colored decorated d√©cor and sturdy illuminated sets rob any style of this remake. The mood is never there. Instead, it has the look and feel of so many television films of the Seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but his smart wardrobe and 'sleek' apartment doesn't fit the mood of the original, or make him an interesting character. He does his best to make it work, but Samantha Egger is a really bad choice. The English accent and California don't look like Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. Lee J. Cobb may be trying Barton Keyes, but even his performance is just gruff, without style. It feels like the TV movie, it reminds me and reminds me what a remarkable movie is still the original. is.
