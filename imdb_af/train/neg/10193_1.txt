With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all the film power while clearly declaring in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity'. Of course this is not. For some reason, many scenes shot by a slant are obviously set (when the poor "accidentally" falls off the cliff, you can see the rifle smoke to the right of the screen!). For the other, his concealment of one important piece of information: the Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason just mentioned in the movie. That is, goitre, a disease caused by a lack of iodine (salt). These goiters are the cause of their cretinism and just had Bunuel the time to do their research. Very, if he checked "cretinism" in a medical dictionary, he would have found "goitre". These people (still, doubtful). Instead, with his film, he constantly judges them and talks about them as 'cretins', time and again, dramatizing the action, setting up scenes to create the spectacle. This is all unacceptable to a documentary claiming to be almighty objectivity. Bunuel has been talking about this movie all the time, leaving no word for the people he filmed. He speaks to them and, even then, condemns them. This piece is flawed by its roots, it is ideology and it is a real shame that it is considered a good movie.
