Tucked and dug out, as a kidney stone turned my cheerful path through my scarring, with nothing but better than destroying the painkillers in the half-story, I caught this movie on the cable. I don't want anyone to think I've paid to see it in a theater, or rent it, or ?? depart from heaven! ?? that I have looked it up. <br /> <br /> After playing this sensationally horrific video game, I penetrated the doomed rooms and kept the House's hallways busy, with the chariots (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041) and Other Impossible sentinels, my curiosity was spurred on how the game would transfer to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> That doesn't mean. <br /> <br /> The banal plot revolves around a group of "crazy kids" ?? a la Scooby Doo ?? Attending a remote island for a worldwide rave ?? whatever it is. (Your kids today with your hula hoops and your mini skirts and your Pat Boone ??) After tearing a boat captain, they got thousands of cash to fetch them there (a stupidity that puts its own rhetorical network) . They find the "rave" deserted. <br /> <br /> A "house" is mentioned ?? supposedly the titular House of the Dead ?? but most of the action takes place on false outdoor sets and other places separated from any haunted haunted house. <br /> <br /> A fallen video camera acts as a flash flute, making the island in the hair of a? Party?! Is this already? Oh, so this "rave" thing is just a "party"? In the great tradition of reaffirming "used cars" as "pre-possession" or "shell shock" as "post-traumatic stress disorder", is the word "party" now too square for your drug addict, silicone-implanted, metro-sexual hunting? <br /> <br /> It's learned that the party is broken up by exciting zombies. Intelligent thoughts stop here? <br /> <br /> I don't think the pins that call themselves writers and directors understand the myths behind the zombie re-animation. Zombies can't die? they are already un-dead. They do not bleed, they know no pain. Unless their bodies are completely destroyed, they will still be animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witches priestess tells me. <br /> <br /> That means a .45 shot in their "hearts" won't stop them, and won't give a buck to the torso. And a shotgun explosion after the chest will certainly not produce gout blood. At least in the video game's logic, the shooter pumps around so much in every monster that it is completely cut off, leaving a fetid mush that can't defeat itself. <br /> <br /> But every actor cut model gets their Matrix circular camera moment, killing zombies on all fronts with single dots and karate links on the chest. These zombies are actually more ineffective than the Stormtroopers of "Return Of The Jedi", who are eliminated when Ewoks leave them. <br /> <br /> I suppose the author, Mark Altman, wrote the author of the movie. Several "Free Enterprise" forced to add a Captain Kirk reference, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who had had to have milk money desperately forced to appear in this aromatic misdrop. There is also a reference to Prochnow's first role in the beautiful Das Boot, when one of the untrained B actors mentions that he looks like a U-boat captain. "I wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square eyes gathered on any of the sharp references to other movies, as Prochnow declares," Say hello to my little girlfriend, who predicts his machine gun moment. <Br /> <br /> Targeting a demographic that does not want to understand the categorical futility of the video game concept (ie the game ends when you die, you can't win), it's just a treasure movie for the wise and Stupid of heart, so everyone dies over time, except for a heterosexual couple of Attractive White People. <br /> <br /> Better use for this film's slim but abused budget could possibly play the part through the act School, though Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, just like her right chest and running screens: priceless! I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she was stabbed, but she seemed just eat ice cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Trying to Do Something More Structured with my time, I pulled out my Digitally-Restored, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, Widescreen Anamorphic DVD from "Manos: The Hands Of Fate". Oh yes! ?? the drugs were quite brain-filled - now were some quality movies? <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
