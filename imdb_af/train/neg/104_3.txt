On the way to a small village that comes far from the track (but looks suspiciously near a highway), a female reporter walks into a strange hitch hiker agreeing to help her lead her to her destination . The strange man then tells a few gruesome stories related to the area: in the first story, an adulteress is planning to kill the woman's husband, but eventually they suffer a much worse fate when they are through a zombie to be attacked; And in the second story, a group of campers cut short their holidays when a walking injustice spent an abundance to give up its grave. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes when making a zombie themed anthology ?? a good idea, but with just two stories, it falls foul short. And that's not the only way this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is common (with Joe Haggerty, as the story tells Ebenezer Jackson, one of the strangest performances I've ever seen); the places are uninspired; the writing is sad; there is a sex scene with zero nudity; and the end .... well, it thinks faith. <br /> <br /> To be honest, some of Sykes' creative camera work is effective (though the clumsy technique used as forest-stricken characters is a bit overused) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten, the eyeballs are pulled out, a face is removed, the brain is bruised and there is a messy dapitation. These positives only make the movie portable, but be warned. The Zombie Chronicles are not a walk in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash. <br /> <br /> I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10 but increase my score to 3, since I didn't get the movie in favor of 3D (although I suspect an extra dimension is not so much different made).
