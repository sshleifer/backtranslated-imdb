If this movie was worse, it would be directed by Your Boll. This unbeatable mess makes Ed Wood like Hitchcock. It has been a while since I saw this steamy pile, but I remember seriously injuring all those involved. How anyone can give this movie more than 1 star amazes me at the mercy of everyone who has seen this time. I give it one star because there is no lower score. All copies of this movie must be burned with salted soil and wasted as a toxic waste landfill. No, one copy should be kept under ultra-secure security and only shown to filmmakers as an example of how not to.
