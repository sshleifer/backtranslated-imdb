According to IMDb Takashi Miike's Master of Horror segment, Imprint, was banned in the US. So I thought I'd translate the Swedish review. I just wrote for it. <br /> <br /> It wasn't difficult to have any kind of expectations of Ichi The Killer director Takashi Miike's episode in the Horror Masters. series. And the Imprint DVD cover showed very promising performance. <br /> <br /> The story mostly takes place in a remote Japanese bordello, some time in the 19th century, and it tells the story of a journalist looking for Komomo, the woman he left behind and for who he promised to return. Tired and sad he comes to the bordello in the hope that it will be the end of his long journey. It appears that one of the prostitutes, a distorted and silent girl, knows Komomo and the desperate man tells her where she is and what happened to her since he left. The story she tells him is as regrettable as it is difficult to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about the episode was how unnatural it was as if the Japanese role for the most part fluent American-English. But I'll leave it, it's not such a big deal. What is a big problem, how bad is the rest of it? Miike's story moves at such a slow pace that I can't see in the 63 minutes how I watched my watch. The extended entry scene, which takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie, felt so unmotivated - and intrusive - that even the scene did not become interesting. I felt it was violent just for the sake of violence itself - without any sense of style or purpose. The only scenes that caused any kind of emotion from me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the fast flowing water ... and in all honesty, the only emotions they caused were feelings of horror. <br /> <br /> The journalist who's looking for the love he left behind is played by Billy Drago, most memorable to me like Frank Nitti - All Capones White Killer in Brian De Palmas The Untouchables (1987). I always found Dragos portrayal of Nitti to be very icy (and that means in a good way), and that's probably why I was almost irritated when I found him so terribly (NOT in a good way ) In this not to be one. His actions seem to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever on displaying some very bad overworking. When his character was supposed to respond to the terrible things that Komomo had undergone, I sat in the couch, turned and turned in an attempt to escape the terrible play that Drago had broken out. I'm grateful that most of the story is told by Yuoki Kudoh (Memoirs of a geisha, 2005), who plays the distorted prostitute. <br /> <br /> The final is probably supposed to be shocking, maybe even rebellious and awful, but I just found it so ... you know ... "blah" (and I looked again at my watch for the uptime, which just wanted the crappy episode to end). Perhaps the final just made me smile, but that's just because I couldn't help but think of an episode of Red Dwarf, and the upside-down of Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, glued with eyes to make them look like Strangers ... Lucky you, if you've seen that episode and now decide to see Imprint, I'll forever destroy the statues of the end for you. <br /> <br /> My first thought, when Impressum finally ended, was the only thing that made it worthwhile, was the main title theme by Edward Shearmur (the same music I believe in every episode of this series used) is a great friggin warning, don't you think? <br /> <br /> One can point out the costume design, by Michiko Kitamura, and say there is at least something that is NOT missing in style and refinement. . But there are so many other movies and TV shows that are so much better to show the Japanese "geisha" fashion. It's nothing less than inferior and I'm disappointed. Takashi Miike's Masters of Horror episode is boring, uninspiring and useless. In other words; It's really VERY LOT!
