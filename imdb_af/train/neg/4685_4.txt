Until the last few minutes of the movie I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the end is so terrible and "Hollywoodized" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility of getting a command to fire their nuclear radius. . Captain Gene Hackman is all up and running, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of first order confirmation. The problem is to start both the captain and the first officer must use their lance keys simultaneously. Hackman is determined to start and Washington stands firm until it finally offers an armed uprising on the sub. Eventually the error is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. But here's the part that just doesn't come true. After being back on land and going before a review board, Washington and Hackman (who only spent half of the movie killing each other) shook hands and all of them girlfriend! Huh? Too urgent an end to making the movie worthwhile for me.
