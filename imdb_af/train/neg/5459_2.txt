It was a very short episode that appeared in one of the Night Gallery events in 1971. The episode played Sue Lyon (from Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby seat and a vampire respectively. The vampire hires a baby sitter to look at his child (which looks like a werewolf or monster) as he breaks out for blood at night. The baby sitter is completely unaware of the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and starts collecting two and two when she notices that he has no mirror in the mirror. There is a strange collection of books in the library on the occult. hear strange sounds while the vampire is going to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally. She bends out the door, the vampire comes out and looks past and the episode is over. I don't know what purpose it was to make such a short episode that lasted just 5 minutes. They only had to extend the previous episode with the same 5 minutes and skipped this one. A total wasted effort.
