Maybe I'm a former Moscovite myself and prevented an elastic sense of humor from throwing this movie into the 'arthouse / festival crap' trashcan. It's not the biggest movie of 2005, nor is it a complete rubbish. It only has many problems. I am also genuinely doubtful that this movie has been banned due to an ideological fear or "conservative taboos" or any other reason, this movie may be "brave" and "inflexible" abroad. This has been banned because the sensors knew that 99% of Russian moviegoers find it offensive due to the bad taste being exerted during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull movie. <br /> <br /> So we shot a strong opening. Wonderful sound design, excellent starting point - loaded with meaning and symbolism. The use and placement of symbols will be consistent with the film's strongest aspects (not that number 4 is a challenging visual challenge). Over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup. An amusing and well-written conversation among the 3 main characters, and we feel pathos for these people, the great country of Russia, the human condition and everything. Then the movie starts to slow down. We are beginning to wonder what lies ahead. <br /> <br /> The rest is rather boring, simple set. Certainly, the man in town is dragging the heartbeats, and there are a few nice moments. Nice sound, sure. But the pleasure of this movie, not to mention the plot, is severely compromised by the pacing problems. And this, the lack of a benefit to be through all the (beautifully imprisoned) misery and misery is what will ultimately make people angry at the "offensive" things (personal, the main attack scene that is bound to be engaging pathetic way that we can get drunk drunk). <br /> <br /> If you want to see a nice movie where Russians are wasted for long periods (the whole movie), see National Hunt Details. Much more rewarding post-Soviet stuff. So yes, a 4 out of 10 for 4, beautiful and symbolic of my mediocre movie condition.
