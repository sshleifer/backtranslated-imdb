If you loved "Pulp Fiction" and like handheld cameras, you should love this movie. I love the strange story (although I feel that "Pulp Fiction" was the most over-rated movie since "The English Patient") and the characters found unrealistic but interesting. It is not "On the Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane" and is burdened by the European pretense. But the worst part of the far is the hand camera. It's so distracting and annoying that I was desperately waiting for the movie to end. I don't know why new directors think this filming method is so good. If you are prone to motion disorder, stay away, the hand camera will get you about 10 minutes.
