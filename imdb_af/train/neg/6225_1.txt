I doubt it will ever be a cult movie. I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I didn't expect much from this movie and got even less. What could have been smart and mobile was champion. It was without the music that Gram made and has more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background on Gram or the colorful people of that era. The characters shown were not known to me, even as a Gram's fan and all the versions of his "afterlife adventures" I heard. Rock and bread are full of stories, including good people, but they must be taken with a salt grain. They can be good stories, though exaggerated. However, this film made a good story and changed into the circle. Stealing any dead body and the resulting implications should never be a boring story, but they somehow sowed it. I am tempted to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, go to the desert and burn them all.
