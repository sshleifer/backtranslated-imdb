"The Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and an offer for free funeral services if you have to die to watch it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a reasonably interesting condition for a horror movie: a scandalous man marries a rich woman with a history of mental illness and tries to convince her that she is jammed with shrill noises, mysterious knocks and skulls that unceasing times arise. Add to the formula a sufficient creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife he is dedicated to. Perhaps it's just that the 1950s didn't have the technology to pull out some of the terrifying scenes needed to juice this movie, the techniques used here look like one's mouth. But when I first saw a home on Haunted Hill, I gave the heebie jeebies the same way. I'm sure this movie did for young viewers of the same era. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the movie is not terrible, it seems to be boring sometimes. But there is a great atmospheric tension in general, but unfurnished Whitlock house, and the gardens and pool are a good touch. For me, the best played scene. Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) tries to retrieve the hidden skull male in the dam, he just scrapes in clothes and everything, in neat contrast with the mentally challenged gardener (double role director Alex Nicol). It makes you wonder what the right dim white was. <br /> <br /> In its own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie: how about the neat roadster the Whitlock's their first appearance in 1958! That made me jump at least from my seat!
