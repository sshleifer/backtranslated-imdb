How the hell did they make it? Introducing themselves as a hairdressing comedy, the miscarried "$" is essentially two hours of people. The usually trusted Warren Beatty looks drunk, and the usually hilarious Goldie Hawn acts as if she were on depressants. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Not even the man with the champagne bottle of LSD can save this litany of worthlessness. <br /> <br /> Am I comparing this movie to "Plan 9 from Outer Space"? I wouldn't do such a thing, even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was made idiotic but became hilarious; It's made foolish and makes you feel your brain just melted out of your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made it up when they co-died in "Shampoo", but then co-stars in the horrible "Town & Country". Maybe they just don't agree in movies. All in all, I'd rather tear my skin off than look at it again. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should try it with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay to see it.
