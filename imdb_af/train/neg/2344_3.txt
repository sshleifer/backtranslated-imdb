For me it just comes out as a soap opera. I think any depiction of unmanned people can be considered "social commentary." But in the final analysis I just don't care how you characterize this movie. None of the characters is very nice or attractive. I didn't get a chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it is lost in the malaise. And in spite of the strife arising from a complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) inversion by Dorothy Maguire on the evidence, the story is insufficient to hold my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology throw in. This story is sloppy, melodramatic and thin. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is noble wood. This is Lauren Bacall's particular role and one of her worst performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances, but her character is dirty and she is pathetic. Robert Keith is the most sympathetic character of the loving, chosen father of two abused adult children. However, the most interesting of all is the serious Robert Wilke in a small role as the bar owner. He is best remembered as a nasty hooker in many westerners, but here he is an honest, enjoyable fellow. <br /> <br /> Thanks, I take my social commentary with an interesting, engaging story and some nice characters.
