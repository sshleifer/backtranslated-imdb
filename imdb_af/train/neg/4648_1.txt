It's a bad B movie story as a cartoon. The movie documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialogue as any other character. It completely destroyed a "documentary feeling" that they might want to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the movie isn't actually a mockumentary is the least of its problems. The movie is not funny. The movie is not sexy. The film has nothing to say about the porn business. It's not even untidy. While there is simulated sex, the amount of nudity is soft for an R-rated movie. <br /> <br /> One day someone will make a good movie about the porn industry. It is not so.
