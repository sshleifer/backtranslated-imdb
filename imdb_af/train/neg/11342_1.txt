I have to explain why I have given it ... "piece of art" 1 star score from possible 10. Because it is difficult or impossible to evaluate it unprejudiced. probably it would have been the same if I gave it 10/10. Anyway, explanations would have followed. <br /> <br /> I don't love these senseless gore movies like HOSTEL or so - I think it's disgusting and pretty horrible (in all possible contextual meanings), but as I noticed after watching this movie - there is a genre called 'historical drama' - and probably that would be the case with 10/10 as it is much of it and Tarantino would have been more fortunate with it (and made Kill Bill 3 to add more blood to the screen as here to show that it is possible). but the thing about the "historical drama" genre is that it is a subcategory of the "garbage movies" where John Romero is the incredible-emperor-of-the-guts and so automatically it cannot be considered your standard. movies - as it is movies that are badly made right and you can't really say if the comic-bad moment was meant to be that way, or it was just bad. It is for the people who enjoy bad acting, bad screenplay and bad things. And by some turn of faith - I'm also one of them. There are days when I have an urge to watch a very bad movie and look for some rubbish and here you go - the day is saved! but it is definitely my opinion and does not correspond to anyone else. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to say is that if you want to see a horrible movie - then Fellini's Casanova is definitely the choice, but take note of my advice and don't set it as a standard.
