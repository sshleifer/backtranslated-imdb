Side Effect (This is not a review of good intentions, it's about the final product). This film is poorly written, outdated and poorly directed. Of course, the story has potential, but the story is nowhere in this film. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a human. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and self-confidence, just like the rest of us. You will never know about this movie from the screenplays. Actually, it suits every character in the movie, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech. An epic about the speech as if it was from an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that plays well in one is the board meeting, and I realized it was making a speech! Every idea she has is incredible in his context and she comes up with ideas that seem like a lifetime of soul that is on the spot. For example, when she sees a wounded man, she will start pontificating on the needs of the battlefield and protecting soldiers and putting on white flags. As in the movie, there is no way she can get such a detailed version. good thought idea in seconds. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film robs Clara Barton of her struggle. It robs her of her humanity, and it inherently rewards everything she did because the writing was written in cliches. The author does not know Clara Barton, and apparently based his writing on an encyclopedia Britannica article. (Yes, they had that) But hey, nice Technicolor! (who cares)
