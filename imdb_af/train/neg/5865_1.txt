I can't say enough bad things about this train wreck. It's one of the few movies I've ever been tempted to walk out of. It was a bad point to start with the first pregnant man, but then they tried to spoil it. What were their spoofing all the right pregnant men ??? It was the worst movie I've ever seen. If it had enough votes, it would be at bottom 100 of the IMDB. If it were possible to give it zero, I would have wanted it, and I would still feel I had given it too much credit.
