this movie was a great fall. the level of ruthless cruelty and violence in this movie was very disturbing. some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and common. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the characters of the main characters were as clever as they were. The sick room / hothouse atmosphere fitted itself to over-the-top theater. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war of this film. Luckily I came to Spain and realized it was not realistic! In addition, using the same sex appeal as a rogue "horror" was also very offensive and poorly treated, while the DVD was packed and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors were uncomfortable in their roles, as if trying to relieve themselves of this mess. I think if you look at how children and pets are brutally murdered, this movie can make you particularly attractive.
