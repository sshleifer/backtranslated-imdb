This show comes with interesting places as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality, but in reality it is pure first-time soap opera. It tries to use exotic places as a facade to bring people into a fake game and then go to hook viewers to the participants soap opera style. <br /> <br /> It also borrows from an early CBS game pioneer Beat The Clock - by finding out about situations for its participants to try and overcome. Then it rewards the winner's money. If they can spit it with some interaction between the characters, even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock, realizing this series is the reality to escape. <br /> <br /> This show has elements of various types of successful past programs. Reality television, scarce, but if you've been chasing the contestants, venue or game, it's your cup of tea. If you don't, this whole series is as I say, dripping with sauce. It's another show hidden behind the reality label. This is the trend it started in 2000. <br /> <br /> It's smooth and well-produced, so it can take a while. Finally, it also does Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch. It only uses professional actors. The intelligence level is about the same.
