Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director anyway, but imagine what he could do with it! The plot has a lot of potential for voltage. John Garfield is almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is thrown at the type. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading lady, but the supporting role is huge and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, it starts pretty early. There are too many coincidences. And an important topic is trivialized because it is ultimately made a little more than a love story. <br /> <br /> It's great to watch Garfield, Massey and the character performers. But it's not terribly good.
