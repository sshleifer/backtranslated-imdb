The explosion of TV channels should be forever grateful for the Randolph Scott Western production line, because at any moment there must be one that looks like a hundred Randolph Scott movies playing at least one non-budget station. <br /> <br /> "Man behind the gun" is a typical early 1950s melodrama with pre-World War II production values ​​based on an action-scenic, historical-murder mystery plot. Pressed to disguise the script's complete absence of character development and thus a lack of tension. In the coming year, the role of these films will be taken over by TV programs such as 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', etc. - and it did the job better. Randolph Scott, who is particularly grizzled about this, is the good guy who is battling the bad guys against whom he will eventually win. There is no more interest in what he is going through emotionally than in what his horse feels, unless you count whether he will sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead at the end. The music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the 'characters' than the acting. But it's good if it drives your boat; and I will not rob you of also enjoying 'Diagnosis, Murder'. <br /> <br /> Really, pedestrians and aging. 3 stars to put together skillfully; 0 for artistic pursuit.
