It was shown on the biography channel and was about as educational as a children's competition! I gave it 2 out of 10 because it was paying attention to detail, as it mostly felt like a 70's and the three ladies who played the original three angels looked right, so the make-up was good. <br /> <br /> It was supposed to be a biography channel biography, but it was null and void of everything normally / usually seen in one of their biographies. No interviews with surviving roles, crew members, production team members, etc. Whether their friends, families and any biographers of those people. I actually know as much about the program as I did before I watched this movie based on the (presumably) biographical book. As if you were actually learning something that no one knew about the program and was not general knowledge, it never happened.
