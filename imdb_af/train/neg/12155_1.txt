If this film is written and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic, it may be a hit. Have you ever seen a movie that was so horrible that it became fascinating in terms of its mistakes? Well, that's it. Each of the acting cast must be nominated for the worst acting performance awards. It will be hard to find another movie, with this kind of production budget, containing so little of any value. The whole thing, from the opening scene, makes the logic wrong. Dialogue is absolutely incredible and illogical. This is for the behavior and general storyline of the film itself. What is really over is that some buffalo in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of waste. Wow.
