This typically melodramatic Bollywood movie inexplicably became a favorite of Western critics. The writing is ridiculous, the play is on top, and it looks eastern. The only reasons to note this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary Meena Kumari. The actress, who was ill during filming and would kill herself at the age of 40 shortly after the film was released, has the same fascination as a train wreck. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but has no authority to perform any task well. Bollywood made much better movies.
