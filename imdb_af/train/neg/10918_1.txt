Manmohan Desai made some entertaining but illogical movies like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he made some craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies what ever was made by him. Mard ko dard nahin hota, but the movie is so bad you are approaching <br /> <br /> The British are making cartoons and the film looks so strange. The scene in the British hotel is stupid. <br /> <br /> The movie has many stupidities like Amrita assault Amitabh and then the whole scene plus the climax the movie gets even worse. There are more jewels like the horse statue to get alive. The masks of Amitabh haha ​​and more. <br /> <br /> Direction by Manmohan Desai is bad. Music is ok. Amitabh has his part with style, nothing but COOLIE, LAAWARIS-type roles. Amrita Singh is okay. Satyen Kapuu is right. Prem Chopra is as usual, Nirupa Roy is her usual self Dara Singh is also as usual
