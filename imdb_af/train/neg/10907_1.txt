I expected a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. However, this dud stood forever. It's one of those flashes that enjoy the sad placement of PG-13 while it's not child. The jokes are not only low-brown or f ** t jokes, they are rude, cruel and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste, except legal and moral decency. Many scenes seem to be hacked to get the PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it could have made a bigger splash than an R-rated movie if the funny one stays in it. (Overestimating? Probably.) I don't recommend this movie. It's a waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and ready to give anything a shot. At 45 minutes in, the movie felt it had to settle down ... and boy was we ready to do it. The end is beautiful, but doesn't save the rest of the rental lighthouse / tourist field. 1/2 star (glad I saw it as a freebie ... would have been sick to pay back hard earned money for this trip)
