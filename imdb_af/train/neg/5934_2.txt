I wouldn't consider myself one of Leonard Cohen's greatest supporters. However, he functions as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear Leonard's reflections on his own life and career. Heating and humble. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians who appeared in the concert did not reverse the nuances of Leonard's musical / literary way. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were the exceptions, although Leonard appreciated Rufus Wainrights' interpretations of his songs. <br /> <br /> What particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to show the viewer who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians are associated with him. Many are said in this respect, but the viewer is not recorded in the person Leonard Cohen. This failed, especially with the interviews with Bono and the Edge. They regard Leonard as a special icon, but cannot translate their exact value from Leonard Cohen. The collaboration with U2 is a farce. The whole registration right looks like a quick job. And just like in the whole movie, Leonard Cohen remains his share and can tell about his own part. <br /> <br /> The whole montage and script is much like an outdoor high school project. The use of effects such as echo, slow motion or flashy images has been put ill. Some of the camera work is dishonest. Part of the score almost remembers any associations I expected. Sometimes it was the filmmaker who added psychotic elements to the film. Perhaps a reference to his one-time use of LSD. <br /> <br /> Some unintentional humor ... Leonard tells at some point how he influenced a musical genre. Initially, he couldn't recall the genre's name, until finally he said it was punk, the punksters really picked up his music. The next scene in the movie is a lively cover of "I can't forget" ... <br /> <br /> "And I can't forget, I can't forget I can't forget, but I didn't remember who "
