This movie was so ridiculous that I never even looked at it. I actually thought someone made their own version and bought it on the DVD from the movie store. This movie made me sick, not because it was gory, but because I wasted 2 50 on it !!!! It looked like my brother and I went into a house and made the movie itself and changed slaughterhouse material in it! I was so disapproved, even the BTK Killer earned more credit than it was even accurate. I mean, come on the bullet was obviously covered in the game or BUBBLE GUM OMG. I can't even get all the words to explain it. Don't Watch This Movie !!!!!!!
