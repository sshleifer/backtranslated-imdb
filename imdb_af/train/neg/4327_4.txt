Some amusing humor, some falling flat, some decent acting, some very horrific. This movie is simply hit and miss, guaranteeing 12-year-old boys more than any other niche. <br /> <br /> The actors in the movie are just unfunny. If you make a family comedy, it tends to be a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to give a funny and daring human performance in the midst of this mediocrity.
