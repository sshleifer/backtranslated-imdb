Each time I will rent an action / adventure movie as a way to relax and not mind my thoughts. That's why I own a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality movie, but it makes me laugh and let me relax for a while. One of these days I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hired this movie because I wanted to entertain without being challenged. For the most part, I have what I wanted. The plot was something like a poorly written Xena episode, and the Kathy Long scene was a lot of community theater (not bad for a professional kickboxer and amateur actress). There were some high points on the side of the cyborgs. Somehow they managed to get some good actors to play the bad guys. Unfortunately, most of them were killed. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts movies, the farther you go into the movie, the more emphasis there is on action, and the plot (which wasn't strong to start) deteriorates almost as fast as the acting. The more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director spends her back. By the end of the movie, I seriously considered it a second time, just to count the number of times. Kathy Long's tight red pants were mid-screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there was just not enough meat here to film satisfying curiosity to see the movie a second time. If you're a hard core Xena fan who needs something to turn a few hours away - go to the grocery store and spend the .50 cents on the rent. There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie. <br /> <br /> Just expect nothing more than to be softened for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Unless of course, you like Kathy Long's derriere. THEN you can buy a copy.
