Only in The Dark is one of my favorite role-playing games of all time. I remember remembering that I came out to the PC screen all night, trying to escape that house and actually getting scary when monsters came in surprisingly. Now you think - I'm tired of "computer player-generated" movies. I don't remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, although some are entertaining enough to be vigilant. And yet, I'm such a big fan of the game I couldn't resist. My rationale was that if the movie had a plot that looks as much as the game, it's right. <br /> <br /> Man, it was 90 minutes (which looked like 300) of my life that I would never get back. If I had that chance, I'd have used them to rearrange their soccer. It is not even in the category "so bad it is funny". You would think even Christian Slater had a little more sense than joining this stink bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. But if the aim of putting this chick in a lead is a sex scene, which I fully understand and support (hey, I'm an old one!) - I saw more of her body at press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to speak of. Won't waste your time sticking it to you. The credibility of the story sinks below: "I didn't have sex with me. Lewinski. The acting is just a few corners above 'Street Fighter', which, incidentally, is one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend. <br /> <br /> Children, I recommend the Video game. It has a much better story, acting and much more excitement. As for the movie, it's a spoiler - it STINK! Waiting for the porn version.
