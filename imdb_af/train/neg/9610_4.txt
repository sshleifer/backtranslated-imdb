In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can make a Western, except Warner Bros. The few times they try, it's always ridiculous (except maybe because they died with their shoes - what is a western cavalry.) I read that Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, saw this big cowboy hat on his head, He said he looked like a mushroom. What! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, in the XX century to be credible in a Western movie. The story here had no surprise, and it didn't help. Every 10 minutes I can see that Bogart and Cagney dropped their small guns and put their hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a 1930s black car.
