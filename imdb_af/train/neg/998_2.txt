It's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the movie itself. The paragraph-long "plot summary" written on the movie page contains details that I couldn't find to watch the real movie. I found myself stopping it to see what details I just missed, which could tell me what's going on (bleep). Unfortunately, to no avail, this movie lets out monstrous pieces of the story if you can call it a story. It's like they are trying to trick us into thinking there was some kind of movie here, which was just as filmed that there was a story and left the rest to our imagination. News flash to the creators: I paid to see you make a movie. I can sit at home and suggest objects and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I have never given enough attention to face the name, and I can see why. She has one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I looked good, maybe she didn't really have the role, she just got a big offer for a movie she was not. in? Wrong. She is listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, don't discuss yourself if you can't act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. Here, too, someone mentioned the white / latino issue - yes, I hate to say that, but this movie appears as a vengeance against white college-aged men wearing baseball hats. This is what happens if there is nothing in the movie to enchant the clock with Latino characters. The Adrian character looks like a scabby who is no better than the story's antagonist. As for the Mayan character, she didn't look like a real person. Anyway, I'm ashamed of Hollywood that this movie was even made.
