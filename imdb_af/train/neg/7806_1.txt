Poor Michael Madsen; he should kick himself to know people found out about this terrible movie. I really can't think of anything I've ever experienced except amateur porn. It's so bad, and everyone here; woodworking, bad script, scary moral ending, you hate it and it's in this movie. <br /> <br /> My question is, "Who made hell in this piece of doggy dead? Michael's sister Virginia could have seen naked in a scene, but I don't even think it'll save this stinker." br /> <br /> For a cool guy who made some exception movies, I want to know what Wacky Church sponsored this piece of crapola.
