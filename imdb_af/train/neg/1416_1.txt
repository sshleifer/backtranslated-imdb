Strange ... I like all this movie staff and dark humor flips; but didn't like this one at all! It's terrible, terrible and certainly not funny at all. Sorry can't make a whole movie plot. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fill the movie; it could have been removed. It must have been in a shorter format. Maybe I expected too much from the crew - like saving the movie. It's also filled with overused clich√©s of characters and situations ... I don't get why people liked it ... "Poetry", "hope"; No, Mom, saw nothing like that! ^ All in all, it is empty and rough, sorry and hopeless. Oh, don't this one ........
