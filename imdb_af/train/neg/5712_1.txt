After sitting through this pile, my husband and I wondered if it was actually the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a movie. It was so listless and formative. But the American propaganda thrown into your face proves - disappointingly - that it is the work of man. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, "We need to save the Declaration of Independence to protect it," look like ways to act like the invasion of Iraq. Too fair. The fact that Nicholas Cage lines like, "I'll never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining board" With a straight face, my husband and I wondered if the entire cast had shot Valium before each scene. The "reasoning" behind each plot turns and new "idea" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was cheated by all concerned for "never shut up." She is clearly in the movie just for looks, but they felt they were a "Dr." must hit. title on her character to give her gravity. At one point the cage's character says, "Don't you always lock up?" and the camera pans to her and look closely at her hands, as if she were a child. Actually grotesque. The only advantage for this movie was that it's so surprisingly bad, you get some of it out. The very scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie enjoyed it. Creepy ....
