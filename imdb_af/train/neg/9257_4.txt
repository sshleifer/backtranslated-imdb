If you are hoping for something new, you have chosen the wrong role. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual repetition of its predecessors can be good. Perhaps the producer and perhaps the director, but hopefully they were not serious when they made this DING. This whole movie is like making a biggest hit of the 1st 3 movies, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
