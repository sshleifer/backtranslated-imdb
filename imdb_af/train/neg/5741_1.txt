<br /> <br /> Whatever the budget, I'm a big horror / sci-fi fan, but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video, it must be the worst of all movies. With bloody special effects (which look like a fried cover in false blood or ketchup that is shown over and over) and people running screaming from left, then right, then back again. It should have been convenience store and stopped there for 15 minutes. Instead, it is dragged very long. It is very, very x5 low budget. Many scenes were far away. Narrator sounds very amateurish as a random person speaks from junior high. This is the only film to lower in my opinion as Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji, and Godzilla vs Megalon despite their higher budgets. 10 snoozes, trying to stay awake through the whole movie in one setting or better still, avoid it as if you were an undead brain-eating gang. The Why-Have-I-See-This-Piece-Of-Zombie-Dung-Blues. Epitome of nauseatingly bath made movies etc. As infinitum. -infinity / 10
