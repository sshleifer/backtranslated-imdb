The original "Vanishing Point" was a good movie. Subtle motifs, characters that were real and spontaneous. The remake was terrible. Preachy, openly obvious; It missed the point why the original was a classic. The black charger was cool, but even that couldn't save this movie. Why hold a white challenger? I didn't think it was the best choice back in '71. Some parts of the movie were inadvertently hilarious. Like when Vigo stands on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his Dream Quest. His Indian pal stands beside him. Vigo wore only his white underpants. I'm sorry - it just looks stupid - he looks at the view in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was at the end - after the explosive accident in the bulldozer - the announcer said the impact was clocked at 180mph. Then he mentions that the police said his remains were not found because he had evaporated, but some people believe he provoked and hid through the crowd. Then it shows him out of the car at 180 mph! First, you can't open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car will not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with no one to send it. It will roll over immediately over 30 times. Thirdly, if you hit the pavement at 180 mph, you will wind up in various broken pieces. No matter, we see him end up at his daughter. All in all, a movie that will offend anyone's intelligence.
