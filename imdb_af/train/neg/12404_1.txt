I have to say this movie is a Mork and Mindy knocks, when I see it, I had the chills, I even watered myself a little. When that Korean man kicked with the spiders in his neck, I was like oh my lord. Asian people smell and suck because they eat the dogs all the time. Any way back on the right path Chuck had some awful performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non-robotic man. Some people will compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyst and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas. This movie is so bad, I put my new born child in a box and put it in Mr. Norris's mailbox left. He can raise my child. I don't leave him in a world where he thinks. Norris is a karate expert. Ill, let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life.
