I don't know what would be so nice about this movie. Worse still, why should anyone see it? First, there is no story. One can even say that a movie even without a movie is worth watching because it sees a kind of strong feeling (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie doesn't do it either . <br /> <br /> You only watch images for +/- 2 hours. There are more useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I think you can say the movie is an experiment and it's risky because it doesn't have all of the above. But is it 2 hours of your valuable time and 7 euros of your money? For me, the answer is: no.
