What a piece of dumb trip. <br /> <br /> I won't even waste time to evaluate any of the points of this show. It's not worth it. The one comment I will make is: Why do you get such a DUMB, dead doofus to be the star?!? <br /> <br /> There are not much more dishonest credentials on the weakening mental state of the networks than the fact that FOX said it would NOT bring back John Doe (a decent series), but would return brain-dead drug like Joe Millionaire returns for another round of killing the American's brain cells. <br /> <br /> FOX lost it, IMHO.
