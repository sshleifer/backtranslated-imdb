This sad little movie bears little resemblance to the 1971 Broadway revival that was such a nostalgic hit. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove regulates that revival, he has extensively reviewed the book. I have a feeling that this scriptwriter has done so much of a change from the original 1925 version. In 1974 I played the innocent filander Jimmy Smith on stage and thought this $ 1 DVD would bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the anticipated pleasure of seeing "Topper" Roland Young plays "my" part was a huge disappointment. Three songs from the play remain, and are done very poorly. Even the classic duet, "Tea For Two", is done as a virtual solo. The very famous faces in this 1940 fiasco do not pride themselves, and the star, Anna Neagle, embarrassed herself. If I feel like I'm spending a dollar, I know the movie should be bad. Another commentator called the Doris Day Edition, actually called Tea For Two. It's about the stage play (the original of course), so those looking for the right No No Nanette might find a recognizable version there.
