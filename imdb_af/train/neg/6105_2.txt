If you are the kind of person who can get a very bad movie, I strongly recommend it. If you are not, stay away. It's a surprisingly inexpensive movie, and sometimes you wonder if it's not just a prank pulling on you. The most positive comment I can make about this is that the responsible people realized that it was a super-low budget bell, so here is at least a pleasure. <br /> <br /> But it's like amateur as it gets. Their idea of ​​giant killer champions is simply guys covered with beige colored sheets that look like garbage covers on their heads. Of course, it is not meant to act seriously (to say the least), but even at your discretion you find yourself a spectacular head. Or out loud aloud, as I did.
