What the reviewers and MST3K left out is the best part (and just the memorable scene) of this otherwise horrible movie. There is a very good rape scene killed by the bad man (Ben Gazzara look-alike) on Mary (as mentioned later by TJ's incompetence). Perhaps rape is too strong a word, "jail sentence" can be more appropriate. The backdrop to this opportunity, yet forced encounter, is the gang that Ben Gazzara hides, "introduces him to the girls hanging at his pool. because the court is at that stage, his first step is to drown her, until his mafia's benefactor tells him to knock it off, similar to the high school girl you did not like, but still loves carnal knowledge Just wanted to say he was going to fetch her in the cabana with her later.
