Urgh! 3 things a movie needs: good writing, good plot and good casting. I watched this movie expecting it to be horribly horrible and sadly disappointed when it was just awful. I lost the will to live halfway through. The only thing that stopped me sticking out with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was why I looked it first). She did a good job as Rastus and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13. It was a fantastic first attempt in a movie. the dog was also very good. both did a good job with such terrible material. Sandra Bernhard thinks I was the biggest mistake of the movie. She was completely disregarded, and I don't think she ever had the character. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 2 out of 10 - and that's just because of Rose.
