Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn will roll over in their graves if they know it. Who comes to dinner Rip Off was actually in the theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a wonderful cultural statement with director Stanley Kramer's 1967 masterpiece. This current day rip off is a joke. Such a white man from an exaggerated stereotypical Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African American girlfriend home (add GASP here) at his grandfather's funeral. His family responses were of course .... predictable. This movie was so painful telegraph from start to finish, my girlfriend actually started to show me that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and hire the original. Take a pass on Wake.
