When I first looked at Robotboy, I found it fresh and interesting, but then I noticed that with every episode trying to teach you how to behave yourself, which is good / bad. Episodes have become predictable. And main characters aren't interesting. Again we see a hyper-smart boy, beaten by his older brother, parents who do not understand their child and his friends: girl and fat boy. This show also has no logic. A super modern robot that works on two AA batteries, and can use many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes. We see two different robots, and it rejects main idea of ​​the show: "Robot must learn how to behave in human society"
