If you've ever seen an eighty shooter, there's not much reason to see this one. Originality is often not one of the strengths of slasher theater, and it is something that this film is seriously lacking in. There really isn't much that can be said about Pranks, so I'll make it quick. The film was one of the 74 films included on the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason to see it. The plot follows a lot of children staying in the back of a dormitory at Christmas. As they are in a scooter, someone decides to start picking them up, and this leads to one of the most horrible mysteries ever seen in a treasure movie. The fact that this movie is on the Video Nasty list is bizarre because, despite a few greedy scenes, this movie will hardly be disturbed or disrupted, and gory slashers if it (Friday the 13th, for example) did not stop banning . But then there are banned movies that are much less greedy than this one (for example, the Witch who came out of the sea). Anyway, the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it, as if the audience can't really care less about who the attacker is at this point; this is done quite well. In general, it's a horrible and ominous shooter that even shooters fans will do well to miss.
