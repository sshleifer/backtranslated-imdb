In a college dorm, a man is killed by someone with a crook. His girlfriend, Beth (Dorie Barton), discovers him and tries to commit suicide. She was institutionalized. A year later she is out, has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and spends Spring Break with Hank and spends four other sensible friends in a BIG, beautiful condo in Florida. Of course, the killer appears (for no reason) and begins to kill again. <br /> <br /> Lousy slasher thriller - a handbook example of how not to do a low-budget horror movie. To begin with, large portions of this film are EINDLESS filler of these six idiots who entertain themselves, with "fun" (more fun than the audience), drunk, acting stupid, etc. Etc. There is also no nudity in this. I'm not saying a horror movie needs nudity, but something to do with it would have helped. None of the deaths are really shown (you hear them), just a little blood and there are no gore. There is one FIRST gruesome one, but it's not to the end. <br /> <br /> With a few exceptions, the acting sucks. Dorie Barton is horrible as the main lady and Tom Jay Jones is like Oz. Chad Allen appears as Brad and he is horrible. Lawrence is actually very good - attractive and immature and gives it all to his shit. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role that does a pretty good job. <br /> <br /> Logic expires in abundance. After realizing that a friend was murdered, two of the girls talked to each other about sex. Baston's response to the belief that a friend is being killed is kind of funny and what happens to Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Deaf, Stupid, No Gore, No Nudity - Skip this one. <br /> <br /> Valued R for Graphic Violence and a little Profanity.
