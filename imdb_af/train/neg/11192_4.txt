I wasn't quite impressed with this movie. It was originally called Sin Eater and had to remain that way, as it was all about the last half of the movie. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the movie had with any of the rest. It was very slow and that was the pick of Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the lead players. It was a sad point. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say, whether you're dealing with things about Catholic religion, but don't expect an Exorcist or Stigmata from this movie. It will probably flop after a few days and the word comes out.
