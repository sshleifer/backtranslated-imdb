It had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I'm 64 years old and a soccer fan. I went to see a football movie. About 10 minutes into it I began to wonder how such a bad movie (especially the play) got in a theater. About half I whispered to my husband that it was terrible and he explained to me the facts behind the movie. Although I had a little offense (and can see how some can be very offended if they were not Christian) to be preached in a cinema, it was not such a big deal. However, it was a big problem to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior, and above all the quality of the acting. It is a suitable film for a church excursion, but must be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater. Am I going to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church if I attend a movie? No. Will I recommend this movie? Absolutely not !!!
