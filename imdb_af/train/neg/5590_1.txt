Horrible movie. About an old crusty painter who was hanging around with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes through the movements in her, and has some of the corniest lines in film history. Richard Burton looks close to death in this movie, and we're supposed to believe he's looking good for sixty. The acting is bad, just like the plot. The characters are terrible, just like the story. It's really hard for anyone in this movie to feel, except Larry Ewashen who plays an old guy in a porn theater that hits Tatum, he's funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you're a Tatum fan, like me - that's why I rented it in the first place - please don't see this movie. She's really bad about it, and you'll wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a fly. It was not, because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it is known that she can act well but still does not rent this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton, rent something if he looks good, not a fossil.
