Went to see the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to general opinion and history in general, the Greek men were not gay. Ever. It is clearly set at the beginning of the movie and strengthened every five minutes or so. So it's safe for American dudes to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Helen Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup. She looks beautiful in all her short-colored scenes, which although many are probably all filmed on the same day, and the director said, "Okay, look carefully ... well ... OK look scary ... well .. ... now looks depressed ... well ... look interested now ... good ... look good again ... good ... "<br /> <br /> Most Greek and Trojan men have British accents had. Those with American accents could not act. <br /> <br /> Trojans looked just like Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt doesn't shine <br /> <br /> Helen's Troy's biggest line was, "They're coming for me." <br /> <br /> Trojan music sounds remarkable like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs go completely up. <br /> <br /> Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but that's right. They were cousins. Remember what history says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell a whole story with just an expression. <br /> <br /> Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names, but their statues either looked Egyptian. or like Peter O'Toole in tow. <br /> <br /> Greek men never touched each other unless they fought, like American men. <br /> <br /> All the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color. Light Egyptian, by Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy only had three women. <br /> <br /> There were many blond Greeks, who are good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise really stand out. <br /> <br /> Despite their coastal desert landscape, the Greeks had the impossible ability to find unlimited amounts of wood to build fires, funeral boards, trojan horses and the like. <br /> British actors look stupid with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun shines directly into his eyes. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers constantly fought. but their outfits always look impeccable. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Greek temples were always in ruins, even back when they were all new.
