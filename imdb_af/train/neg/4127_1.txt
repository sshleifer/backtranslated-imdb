A movie that is so bad must be withdrawn from all stores worldwide. So full of boring, dull, imaginative characters, and with a main character with such an annoying attitude and dry voice, which constantly gives a thoughtless voice to every action and feeling, this movie holds the record for the most challenging movie I ever watched. As I paid money to own it, I felt a duty to see it through, and I regret it. My head is hurt because of the terribly dull characters and their useless, less lifelong characters. A lot of kids with no knowledge about anything, are all cute and worst of all, have terrible dialogue throughout, just surrounded if the main character is trying to get an appointment with the girl. Drilling, so much, my friend shook with hatred and I was red with embarrassment that I would have thrown 6 pounds. The DVD was on eBay the next day and I didn't make much of my money back. Avoid like the pest.
