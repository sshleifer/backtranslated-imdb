Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the last of the series, and as part 4, it is not related to the first three except by the title and the fact that it is a Christmas-themed horror flick. <br /> <br /> Except for the unaware, there are some obvious things going on here ... Mickey Rooney plays a wizard named Joe Petto and his creepy son's name is Pino. Call a bell, somebody? Now a boy named Derek heard a knock at the door one night and opened to get a gift on the doorstep for him. Although it said, "Don't open for Christmas," he opens it anyway, but is stopped by his father who scolds him and sends him to bed and opens the gift himself. Inside is a small red ball that Santa's and a head sprout, and continues to kill dad. Oops, maybe he should have left alone enough. Of course Derek is traumatized by the incident, as he watched it from the stairs, but he did not grow up to be a killer Santa. He just stops talking. <br /> <br /> There is a mysterious stranger lying around, who looks very interested in the toys that Joe Petto makes. We even saw him buy a lot when Derek's mother brought him to the store to get him a gift to get him out of his trauma. And what exactly does this man do? Well, we're not sure, but he seems to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick. He keeps his landlord from promising him by promising to pay him the next day and offers him a "Larry the Larvae" toy for his child, but of course "Larry" is not a good toy. not and he comes out of the box in the car and of course, well, things are not pretty. <br /> <br /> Anyway, finally, what happens to Joe Petto and Pino is obviously revealed, and as with the old story, Pino is not a "real boy". Pino is probably even more excited and naughty because he suffers from Kenitalia (a smooth plastic cross) so he can count on his wrong ways. And the identity of the lousy stranger is also revealed, and there is even a happy end to it. Whee. <br /> <br /> Part 4 steps, but not much of one. Again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Scream Mad George, some decent special effects, but not enough to raise this. There are also some remnants of Part 4, such as Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that doesn't really make a difference. Anyway, I now see the whole series from my system. Now if I could get it out of my brain. 4 out of 5.
