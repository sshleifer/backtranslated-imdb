This movie lost me with the crossbow RPG (missile-driven grenade). It was like someone who cut and pasted Robocop's scene. I half expected Beowulf to say, "I like it!" <br /> <br /> I watched it because I love Chris Bruno from "The Dead Zone" TV show and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it for the whole movie consistently - unlike any of his costumes. They still went in all sorts of speech from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sense. <br /> <br /> There is already much comment on how this film differs from the source material. However, even on its own, this movie's plot is not good. It's just boring, which doesn't even excuse the low budget. Having a low budget means having at least a good story, dialogue and decent action. That cost doesn't cost much. Instead, they spent their money on half-donated CGI and some decent costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
