This little show is of course a little prequel / spin of the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to the live action series, this show is completely crap. The live action show has intelligent jokes and story lines. While the animated series is basically a diminished bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest, I think maybe kids despise this crap. <br /> <br /> The storyline in every episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and useless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. It's basically the idea of ​​every episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina used magic to become Gem and Gem, Sabrina. So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes Harvery to become her slave. It then leads to a bizarre but rather interesting scene where Gem says, "Just love me now" and Harvey comes down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like a god. (That's right, since he controlled her mind). But this dumb spin-off isn't the time or worth it.
