I don't remember going out of a movie except this time. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. An uninteresting plot, characters of clay, violence without point. I do not care when the good guys died; I don't care if the bad guys get it. The fantasy and magic were laid on thick as liver pudding and there was no coherence. In short, good entertainment if you spend an eternity in hell.
