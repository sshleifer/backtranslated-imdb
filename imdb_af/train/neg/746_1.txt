Save the $ 8.97 you will spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and go to the real movie by Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> I'm a filmmaker, and I was a keen fan of HG Wells. I had to buy It hopes to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to watch it because I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes at a time. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a $ 20 million budget for this production. Where did it go? Did he use most of it to buy a new home? Finance its retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is really good about this movie. It remains true to the book AND there are some good performances in it. I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make it a good movie. But good performances are quickly overshadowed by terrible ... and I mean terrible special effects. Any new movie school student could have done a much better job with CGI. For me, it mostly looks like stop-action cardboard cuttings used rather than sophisticated CGI software, which should use a $ 20 million project. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for amateur mail production that was not applied to this movie. My own partner and I set our version of the Ferry scene and recreated with software that cost less than $ 1500.00 and within five days it looked five minutes away from the scene, which looks better and realistic than Hines created. I've seen movies with budgets of less than $ 2 million seem better. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and superior to Hines' special effects in this movie. In fact, I have a much better appreciation for the Killer Attack Tomatoes because of this movie. There is no excuse for today's technology to make a movie look like a 50-year-old B-Movie unless it was the intention that would not have been with this particular project. <br /> <br /> A movie issue I had with the DVD was that the movie was jerking, another demonstration of amateur movie production. <br /> Overall, I have to say that I made a $ 45,000 project in 2003 that has better movies and special effects than this movie. /> <br /> I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good movie recording, or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and see the attack of the 50 footwoman. It will be easier on the eyes.
