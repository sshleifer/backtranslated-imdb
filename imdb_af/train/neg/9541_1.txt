I suppose many people comment / review their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or terrible - I am writing because of the latter. <br /> <br /> I was excited to follow up on "Wargames". I thought the original was pretty good considering its time and content, I felt it was worth more than watching. It was 2008, I had great hope for what they would do with this movie. Computers, games, terror, military diligence have grown so much since the time of the first movie, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" had the opportunity to bring everything into a good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie failed at every level, but I especially appreciate the authors and anyone who has any input on the realism of game aspects. "The Dead Code" was an air flight simulator of 1990 with a few people on the ground waving their arms. Meanwhile, Will Farmer button will contain about 7,000 commands - no impact on what's happening on the screen. Until finally he 'wins' by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that releases gas that immediately kills 20 000 virtual people (no one is near the gas). Beating 5 FLAVES in 15 minutes, it tells RIPLEY (the real life war machine) that it is threatening a high level of terror. <br /> <br /> Although any 5-16 year old could complete the same task - Government believes he is a deadly threat to mankind. They say things like "He has expert knowledge of bio-terror" ... He showed less knowledge than someone reading the first 3 paragraphs of the Wiki entry on Bio-Terror. So follows a movie-long chase scene with about .01% of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles. They have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear the whole thing. Sometimes they are angry, they hardly miss him. But other times they create masterful opportunities, just let him go intentionally to follow him. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I'd write more. But I've been watching it for 1.5 hours. I'd rather watch the Broderick and Joshua play tik-tac tones for 1.5 hours.
