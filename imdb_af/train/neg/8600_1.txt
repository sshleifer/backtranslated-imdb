In all low budget history. this movie must be one of the worst. True, there are some humorous sides to the movie, but overall it was just awful. I just can't understand who couldn't run out of snails. I mean they should be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part worthy of in this movie is the proximity of a snail to bite a man's finger. It was quite amusing.
