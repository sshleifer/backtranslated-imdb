We all know that a movie never completes the book, but it is exceptional. Major characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were similar in character, most of the subplots and main grave elements were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was extremely played, which seemed to her to be a much shallower character than the one I got to know in the book. In the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people, which was again an important element in the life of the family. In the movie she was no more than a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero third, incidentally, is the boy and so comes to Segundo second) and his relationships with Esteban and his grandson of Pancha Garc√≠a (not son, he also recognized) are in half cut and its importance played. <br /> <br /> One of the most fundamental things about the book the movie is but stripped of: it is called "The House of the Spirits". Where's the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family is supposed to turn the "big house on the corner", a line so many times said in the novel. The house is fundamental to the story, but the film shows it unfairly to a mere background. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't read the book before, I would never have guessed that such a juicy, level movie could be. be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.
