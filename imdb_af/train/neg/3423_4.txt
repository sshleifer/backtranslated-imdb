It's a typical 70's soft core sex skirt in the Russ Meyer genre, but perhaps less exorbitant than some of Meyer's work. This film has higher 'production values' than many of its contemporaries, which represent a larger budget. It is a plot, write and act is straight from the B zone. The latter has become the mainstay of B-movie channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in the 500-channel universe. If you have a soft core that you are in the mood for, it is as good as anything else in the B series. Don't expect Polanski, but Sarno is not Sarno. Nothing more, nothing less. Jennifer Welles's performance as the "mom" is perhaps the best of the cast. None of the actors in the film came on a bigger fame. Confessions of a young American housewife are far from the worst example of its kind. It's viewable, if it's your kind of movie. 30 years ago it would be an avant garde and riske movie. You can see more or less the same thing these days on Showtime / HBO series, and in prime time.
