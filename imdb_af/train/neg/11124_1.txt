Generally, I don't care much about violence in movies, or a great deal of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is very good with me and the film brings many of the above to us. There are beautiful pictures, especially of the lake and nature, a good character situation, a good direction. This movie can be voted as a good movie. However, it has been spoiled for two reasons, and both of these reasons relate to this movie. First of all, everything that uses violence against living creatures to make this movie. Not movie violence, I'm talking about real violence. This violence alone may be justified if it is not, and that is the second reason; The film's message was not merely introspection about the directors' distorted relationship with women. Not that we all don't have real twists with women. (Men respectively). But the conclusion of the film ruins it all. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our "heroine" eventually ends up (here is my own hand if I remember correctly, I saw this movie years ago and it got me annoyed, now the guy with a new one movie witch I'm certainly not going to watch) and is now even more clearly portrayed as a natural demon, nature is growing over her, especially her sex. Of course, it is the director who kills women's heroine. Women should die, especially if men are attracted by their sexuality. It seems to be the final conclusion. ** End spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, anything that might be good to me if the director were to keep his views on himself. But to use big pictures, images of cruelty to living creatures, just to say men can be afraid of women, and men are cruel to women. It's just not enough. I knew when I saw this movie, it would be good critics of the "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and whatever approach. But for me this movie has just been completely destroyed.
