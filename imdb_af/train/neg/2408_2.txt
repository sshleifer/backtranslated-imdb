This movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that animated the dead again. He first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a row door. His brother infects the other gang members. In some scenes the zombies are seen very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast, which makes little sense. The acting is mediocre, but the story doesn't help the movie. The makeup consists of blood on the faces of the zombies. The budget for this movie, I'm sure, was very limited. I believe the movie can be made better if the story was more original and with a better budget. If you want to see a good zombie movie, you don't see this one.
