Imagine a woman alone in a home for forty-five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens. Then it goes twice more. The writing is flat and lifeless and jokes, and the bad acting keeps you cared for any of the characters, even when they fight wolf packs and are beaten by brotherhood goons. Anyone who ranked this movie above a two is not quite healthy.
