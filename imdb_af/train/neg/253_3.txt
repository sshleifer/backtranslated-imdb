The premise of the movie was explained and if you got that far, I didn't pretend to be a film critic. Having said that, my own opinion of the movie is pretty low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike, but it's in the category of its not so good work with DOA 2 and 3, and a few others (many). <br /> <br /> The movie looks a free pass because it is a Takashi movie and nothing Takashi can be wrong. This is a high school approach to cinema. For the rest of us we will find and one and a half of a child screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, it takes away from the movie), the rate of the film reaches almost levels of rigomortis, and the acting ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If you are a Takashi fan, you will see it, regardless of your interests. It has no originality (see the Neverending Story) or any character development of the main character in the face of conflict other than a fairly superficial one. <br /> <br /> As noted, this is the first movie that Miike bought with co-writing, but that doesn't matter much, because not what we want to hope will come across Miike's personality in the screen . All we get is from the Miike Shots Award, Fish Director of Photography. <br /> <br /> The movie has the potential to be something good. The premise is not a difficult game to run wild. But this one fell straight into the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is if you just come in. Miike goes with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then roll in his works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.
