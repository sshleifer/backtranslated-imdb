When I saw the commercial for this, I was all to see it. Forgive me now, but it was so long, because I saw that I didn't remember how it went. It is enough to say, the movie I saw does not convey a parable to the "movie" they sold. <br /> <br /> I was bored, annoyed and incredibly disappointed with this movie. And if it wasn't bad enough, they had to sink it even further with the terrible reggae music. Not exactly tuning music for a horror movie, oh me? I think if you never see the commercial (or trailer) you think it's some hot stuff. For my money, the commercial was better.
