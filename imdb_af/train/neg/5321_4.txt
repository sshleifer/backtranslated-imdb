A distinctive unfunny musical comedy that artificially tries to marry the then rock-n 'roll explosion with the suburban sitcom's mid-class sensibility. The result is an urgently dated mish-mash that will not satisfy any of the audience who went to the music, but will at least let their parents sit down. <br /> <br /> A quick look at the promo entry on the Back to video release should give an idea of ​​the content. Tom Ewell is a drunk agent, overplay with so little comic ability you almost expect him to confess "hi honey, I'm home!" The blurb puts it as "So funny in 'The 7 Year Itch'". It almost sounds like an excuse. Which other movie would sell itself to the fact that a leading player was good at something else? It reads like "So funny in the 7-year-old Itch". But this is rubbish in this. "Mansfield, a beautiful girl with rumored 50-inch assets, is unfortunately a bargain basement. Monroe with all the acting ability and comic timing of a rotten cattle-goat. comedy partnership of hell. For her part, the sale gives us: "[Jayne Mansfield] whose more obvious talents are the cause of much of the movie's biggest laugh!" As you can see, a movie sold on the idea that it is leading, a big breast, not the most sophisticated thing, most of these "humor" are men who literally fall over themselves, crack their glasses at Mansfield, etc. Only the Freudian nightmare of a milk bottle overflowing, his "U" certificate is in doubt. <br /> <br /> For the musical side, most adenine players are selected. Do you really want to see Eddie Fontaine's offer: "I love your eyes, I love your lips, they taste even better than potato chips "in a song, Co ol it, baby? Only the Little Richard fire brigade out of the MOR, but is forced to sing some of his more father-friendly songs in a four-minute series. And how do all the acts sing without a single microphone? Attempted satires on the industry are broad and childlike in their conception. <br /> <br /> Technically, the picture was pretty advanced, with special effects (including a ghostly Julie London) and luxurious color (now flattened and artificial, in fact, with its red blooming and fake looks like fleshy, it looks like a colored film). However, direction is not outstanding, and the sound quality is also very poor. <br /> <br /> Maybe it looks like it's so old. A time when men were still smoking on the screen, sickly cute baby actors made adult remarks and black servants just had to cook and dance. (All that happens here). Still, some like it are hot, the African Queen, Ben Hur and many, are much more than examples of films from the era that can still be enjoyed today, so the "good on time" argument doesn't really rise no. The heart can't help the girl. It is a cynical and condescending enterprise that does not carefully inspect. 4/10. <br /> <br />
