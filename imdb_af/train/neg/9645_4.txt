It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the huge releases with massive hype that proves they are duds at the box office. London Dreams is no exception to this. Let's analyze it ... It's all about pursuing your dreams and how far you will achieve it. Sounds impressive right? But unfortunately the movie is not. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big every day. His dream is to perform at the Wembley Stadium before a cheering 90,000 call that calls his name. He is joined by two brothers, Zoheb & Wasim (debutants Aditya Roy & Ranvijay) and a staggering Priya (Asin). Together they form "London Dreams" their dream band. After impressing the head of a record company, they become overnight sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya which he does not want to reveal until he reaches his goal. Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla aka Mannu (Salman Khan), a carefree flirtatious man who has no ambitions in life, to join their band. Mannu is a trained musician and a true talent for whom Arjun later became envious of Mannu's superior skills and relationship with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to blow Mannu. What happens next is the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> In the technical aspects we just feel the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha, who admired us in Namaste London. It feels as if he has simply portrayed the script. To cut it short, a glorified cameraman. Screen game by Suresh Nair dull even if it has its moments. Defined in a predictable way, the display carries you tightly. Camera work was great to capture the beauty of London. This is the only entertaining part while songs are watched. <br /> <br /> Few songs are hummable while others are passionate noise. Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is monotonous and he irritates you. Asin is forgotten and I don't think she'll make it big in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is strict. Brinda as the bitch is what we saw in innumerable movies. Ompuri is in progress with the proceedings. I don't want to make up for the mistakes, because it will be a wonderful job. <br /> <br /> Finally, let me make it simple and straightforward. London Dreams is a sultry movie that you can enjoy better on DVD.
