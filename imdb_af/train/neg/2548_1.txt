The fact that this movie made it all the way to the rental shelter in Norway is bizarre. This movie is just awful. This image quality is just one teenager a little better than you get from a cell phone and the plot is so bad. The main character is just annoying and the rest just sucks. Every person affiliated with this movie must be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this movie call their name is extraordinary. And the distributors; did they even see it? It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Naming it a comedy is an insult to humanity. I urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it.
