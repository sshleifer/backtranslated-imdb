You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you don't want it, a man who eliminates budget crunch budgetary scarcity to less than enthusiastic receipts. But keep doing it all. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounding his Camp Blood films is reluctant and I'm as guilty as anyone. Brad usually manages something interesting in the mix, a neat idea, a cook-like character, whatever, but without the funds to take it beyond base level, he relies on the audience to slice him and appreciate it for what it is and what it can be. Joe Haggerty gives a lively and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and it is a credit to Sykes that he can feel that this oddball twist is going to work within the framework of the movie. Come to a multiplex near you in a parallel universe, somewhere.
