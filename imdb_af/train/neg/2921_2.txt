The story is about a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris) hired by her Estee Lauder-like cosmetic queen. Her aunt (by marriage we are leaving to suppose) is trying to find her long lost family in Europe. All they have to do is take a picture of a young girl standing by an ornate music box. The researcher leads Europe and does her search in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scenery is the right thing and is actually shot on the spot (unlike a murder, she wrote where Jessica was supposed to visit a hidden place and Lansbury never left Burbank). In any case, she meets a young man who is also looking to solve a family murder on his own and to help them find clues and threaten bad people. The dialogue, especially the romantic dialogue, is terrible. I saw it because of the scenery, but the writing was so bad I just stayed to see if it would get worse. It did. Acting was also down. I can see why Mel Harris's career never started after thirty minutes, but she's adequate (looks too old for her co-star though). But the supporting players are straight out of the community's playhouse. I also lost how many times they say "Budapest" to each other. Yes, it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know, okay? I realized halfway through the movie that it had to be one of those Harlequin movies and sure enough. Guess it all.
