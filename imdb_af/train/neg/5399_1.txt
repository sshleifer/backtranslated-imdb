SPOILERS All too often, Hollywood's Shakespeare adjustments are entertaining pieces of cinema. Beautifully shot, they are well educated and true to the text. Films, including Branagh's "Henry V" and 1993's "Many Ado About Nothing", are powerful assignments. Looking at "Love's Labor's Lost", that's why it's such a disappointment that the expectation will be so wasted. Unfortunately, "Love's Labor's Lost" is terrible! The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends left alcohol and women for three years to focus on their studies. However, plans begin to fall apart when the enigmatic Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her entourage arrive. Soon, love in the air and philosophy is beyond the Prince's mind. <br /> <br /> From the start, you realize that this movie isn't quite Shakespeare. Displaced in a 1930s musical by Ken Branagh, the plot is still there and the writing remains, but now it is sacrificed in favor of the hard musical taste. Classic like "The way you look tonight", "Let's look at the music and dance", "I'm in heaven" are all destroyed by bad singing and a strong feeling they just don't belong here. <br /> <br /> Apart from poor singing, we are also treated with an increasing number of uncomfortable performances by regular stars. Ken Branagh and friends may make this film, but they offer us a stomach-changing role. <br /> <br /> The top eight actors (four men and four women) are all equally bad, and the only positive on their behalf is a huge improvement on the really horrible Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, just one individual leaves the film of praise and it's the consistently beautiful Nathan Lane. Lane has proven over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he adds a humble humor to the pity Costard. <br /> <br /> There is little more to say. "Love's Labor's Lost" deserves a soft praise for Branagh's original quote of an old story. Unfortunately, this is where the positive ends. Poorly performed, performed, sung and built, "Love's Labor's Lost" may be the worst Shakespeare adaptation of the past forty years. It should be avoided like the pest and should never be made. A poor, disappointing choice by Branagh and here is the hope that his next attempt will be better.
