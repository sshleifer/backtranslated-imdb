Director Warren Beatty's intention to change Chester Gould's famous cartoon into a live action cartoon (starring Beatty himself as the square jawed detective) had sweet thoughts of innocent nostalgia - quite unusual and intriguing from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the photo is a required ham, fun for a while, but eventually tired. Dick Tracy tries to bring a gang of Big Boy Caprice, who is helped by loving Tess Trueheart, but challenged by the evil Breathless Mahoney. For the first half hour or so, the Oscar-winning art and design is great to absorb, but the plot starts predictably (without a real sting in writing). All Pacino got a surprise. Supporting Oscar nomination as bad boy Caprice, and Madonna (mostly used as a decorative plug) gets Stephen Sondheim's "Sooner or Later", which is the Best Original Song Award. Very heart, thanks to Beatty - who was dedicated to his vision - but the picture is too cool and calculated. It doesn't have heat. * 1/2 of ****
