It was a movie I hoped I could introduce to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to see the movie, I knew I couldn't even see the damn thing to close. You're almost convinced that the real war didn't last so long. Others will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this. But flat out, you can't go looking for Private Ryan to LOC. Forget about the movie budget difference or the audience - it doesn't prevent a director from making an intelligent movie. The length of the movie is not that bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they stick to the same hill, but give different names. I thought the LOC was a terrible site - this hill looks like my backyard. The character development sequence (the silders' flashbacks, which look back to their last moments before it is deployed) had to have been through the movie throughout and not just in one long memory. To this day I still have the end. But there was a much better movie (not much said) called Border.
