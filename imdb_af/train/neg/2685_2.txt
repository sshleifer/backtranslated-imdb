I never posted a movie online, but I felt like doing it after I saw this one. One does not appear at someone's funeral and tells the believers: "My family died, so why should I care about yours?" <br /> <br /> Minus the propaganda, there was little anything it could be called "art". Like the daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly concerned with using deafness as a gimmick. Any deaf person who feels a vibration of that incomplete will probably have investigated, not ignored. <br /> <br /> The word "chutzpah" occurs. As a writer there are few subjects that I would stay away from: the Holocaust is one; it's another. I wish these filmmakers were not so arrogant (and incapacitated).
