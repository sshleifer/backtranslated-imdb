It's really awful. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature of this movie is that the next time people ask me what the worst vampire movie I've ever watched, I would have an appropriate answer. <br /> <br /> I think it's filmed at 35mm so it's already sticky like hell. I wouldn't have bothered to comment, but I noticed that some fanboys (probably linked to the movie) claimed to have been the best movie since the Matrix. Let me uncover the myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good in the movie. Everything shouts tough. The actress is ugly. The battle choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The battle scenes are incredibly amateurish. Imagine a girl helplessly rotating her arms in a circle and delivering poor kicks that won't hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director just pulled people off the street to give their roles in the movie. <br /> <br /> I know the director didn't have much budget for the movie, but even better movies were made on a smaller budget. Unforgivable.
