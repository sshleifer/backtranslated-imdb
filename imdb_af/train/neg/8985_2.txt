Previous comments encouraged me to test it when it appeared on TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is wonderful, but doesn't get enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play well-known but promising characters, but the writing leaves them stranded. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Lee Tracy's ego of character, which at best is a self-centered, physically and verbally offensive push. The reactions of "the public" are poorly thought and incredible, making the "shenanigans" look like a bad writer. And this leads to credibility that the Lupe Velez character can fall for him. <br /> <br /> The "stinging one-liners" mentioned in another review must depend on the observer, as I have not even realized that an attempt has been made.
