.. Wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical movie snob unless you want to brush your typical movie definitions, such as "continuity editing" and "geographical match". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. For a second they are in the present, the next moment they probably run a modern SUV in the 70's and dressed like 80's style clothes. I think. I couldn't pay enough attention to it, since the play was just awful. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d that I didn't watch. If you're a B-movie buff, and with b-movie, I mean BAD movie, then this movie is for you. It's home movie and all the non-sensible style will make you laugh as long as you stay awake. If your taste is more for Goddard and Antonioni, just switch this one.
