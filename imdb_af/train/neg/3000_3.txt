The school note Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a lot of classmates and is then in a laboratory explosion (also set by them) where his face is shaken by acid. Years later, all the jerks are invited back to high school (since closed) for a reunion. What they didn't know was that Marty invited them to kill them. Then a storm started, they were locked in the school and Marty started to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Very stupid. The murders are ingenious and boring and there are some creepy atmospheric shots from the abandoned school - but that's about it. The humiliations applied to Scuddamore are more than cruel (he is stripped, dipped his head in a toilet and burned) and is just uncomfortable to look at. Considering Scuddamore's suicide shortly after it was released, they are almost impossible to see. This movie is also based on its way of having nudity. There is a full front of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie), but one girl decides to take a bath alone. After they know, there is a murderer wandering around to them! And then there's the couple who have sex. This is the type of movie where the killer seems to know where everyone will be and can teleport himself to them. It ends with a twist that curls me and rolls my eyes, then another twist that wanted me to throw something heavy on the TV! The acting is bearable - not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is also here. She is a very beautiful woman, but not much of an actress. <br /> <br /> It gets a 3 for some effective gory killings and atmosphere. Otherwise it runs from the mill and is forgotten. Scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this movie more attention than it deserves.
