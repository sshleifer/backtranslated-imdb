My first question about seeing this movie was, "Why is the title LIAM?" If the intention was to tell a story from the boy's perspective, it wasn't done well. Of course, there were the formal use of camera angles in the boy's scenes, but much of the critical action took place outside his face. Having a "main" character who can't speak makes it hard to give that character much depth. <br /> <br /> Melodrama is defined as: "dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality and conflict." LIAM fits this definition into a T. The viewer becomes hit by the typical stereotypes of the fire and sulfur stone Catholic Church in the back school arm and the well-fed priest pushes money out of congregation members. (A very tiring stereotype) What's more - the Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Much of the movie was predictable ... Who didn't think we wanted to see Theresa kicking the toilet after her mother told her: "No daughter of mine will scrub another woman's toilet not! " I'm a fan of British realism if it's done well. According to me, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
