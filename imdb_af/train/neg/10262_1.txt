Now I just clicked it out of curiosity and had to look - just as you see a car accident. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that it is a spoof, but it shouldn't stop. I criticize the godly direction, acting and dialogue. Seriously, it was named one of the poorest movies I've seen - it looks more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a poor one about it ... Okay - some criticism (1) when the doctor his heart attack before the monster (we never see the monster attack him, so we assume she's a heart attack), the army shell, rockets, bullets at the monster - what the doctor's feet started - started the doctor touched by a missile and still lives. (2) The army is about 100 meters away, and we see a flame gun being used - geez, these things have a range of no more than 30 meters! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers walk in the classroom and burn in the ceiling; the monster falls to the child, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster? come on! (4) The monster looks like something from Power Rangers! (5) There is one scene where the five "good guys" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the child) are all shocked and we get reactions (by hand to mouth) one by one - so Of course! (7) the general refuses to try electricity and does not listen (8) the acting is terrible (9) called the rubber pack monster ???? (10) that god-fearing music, non-stop!
