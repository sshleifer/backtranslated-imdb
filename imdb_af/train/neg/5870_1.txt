I didn't like this movie at all! First, I do not know why, but everyone here says that Clémence Poesy's play is excellent, which I think is absolutely wrong! She's not like Natasha: another look, a different character ... What's worse, she's a very inexperienced actress and so she couldn't play this role! She totally defeated the heroine! It was really disgusting to see her game! In my mind, it would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, as it will be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looks like a drunk man who has not shaved for two weeks and has defeated a fight in which he lost his eye ... (Thank God, in this movie there are some actors, whose play was fantastic! Alessio Boni handled his job very well, I was pleasantly surprised, he is one of the few people who read the book, which is very important to the drama, and I also played with our Russian actors, it was great to see )) The only thing I did in this job was great views and great dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand a true sense, the purpose Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece and perhaps realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 out of 10
