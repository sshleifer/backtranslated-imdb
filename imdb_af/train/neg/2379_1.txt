I will admit. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and made it a mission to see every movie she was in. Unfortunately, this includes the horrific films Batman and Robin, The Avengers. <br /> <br /> It has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes it is even lower than The Avengers). everyone looks lost and it is incoherent. <br /> <br /> Even if you think Uma is a goddess like me, PLEASE PLEASE DON'T GIVE YOU TO IT. you will hate yourself the next morning.
