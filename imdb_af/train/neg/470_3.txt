I loved this movie as a kid, but seeing it again 20+ years later, it actually sucks. Up The Academy was back in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes are much better today than this steaming dog pole. No T&A. No big jokes, except for the one-liners we've already heard a million times. <br /> <br /> I recently bought the DVD in the hope that it would be the jewel I remembered. Well, I was gone! The soundtrack has only 2-3 widely recognizable hits (not the smash compilation mentioned by others) and the regular voice remains were terrible. The only thing that was interesting to me was to predict what the character's lines were before saying it. Yes, I saw this movie back! <br /> <br /> The only reason I write this review is to give me two cents why this movie should be forgotten, sorry to say. :(
