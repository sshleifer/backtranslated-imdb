This is the second British Rank movie to adapt the stories of Sommerset Maugham. Everything but one story of 'Quartet' does not travel well in today's era; and the actor speech is definitely "clipped" as only British pre-1950 actors can be delivered. In any case, 'Trio' looks tighter and more cinematic than the first movie adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the problems these two movies can't overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years before the movies. . As a result, Maughm's (pre-war) populist "little morality" storyline before the 1950s looked rather odd, or not straightforward.
