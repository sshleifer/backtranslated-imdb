Within 15 minutes my whole family was furious with Goldie Hawn's character to die, or at least for Steve Martin's character to leave her. At 40 minutes we switched it off. There are just a few movies a year we try, it seems so annoying that we can't scratch it long enough so the story can be established. <br /> <br /> Normally, I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember enjoying the Neil Simon original. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director of "What the worst can happen" and the author of "Miss Congeniality 2" and I think that's what we end up with.
