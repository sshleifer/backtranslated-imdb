Yes. Quite sure I saw this movie years ago when it was about the Supremes. <br /> <br /> Another reclaimed story has shone Hollywood-style scripts of better-make-it-in-music industry films. <br /> <br /> Nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More makeup, glimmery costumes and choreography = more money for the worthy "talented" Beyonce sign. <br /> <br /> If you Like the setback style, you should appreciate real groups who have struggled (without digitizing voices and a Hollywood empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce's involvement makes this hypocritical garbage.
