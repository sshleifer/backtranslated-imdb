The movie is just as fun as a star at the sun. Pat Pataki is a total delay that can do nothing better than sitting on his thick back. He made a ring of smoke from his puffed cigars and drank liquor while the doctor acted like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking all the so-called "Blood" which actually looked like Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> Most of the plots look very awful to even mention this piece of crap. The rest of the characters In this movie, total waste of time, the end was terrible, the outlines were cheesy and the screens were terrible. What else should I say to your viewers out there? My advice would be to shoot your rabies if you watched the movie. This movie can give you the foam in the mouth if you haven't gotten your latest shots.
