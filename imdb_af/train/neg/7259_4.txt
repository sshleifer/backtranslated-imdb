It's definitely one of the 70's out there movies, and it's known to kick off a Bigfoot hysteria for a decade. It is also striking for the small feelings of madness throughout the movie, especially if the dark, muddy first half is replaced by a MUSIC INTERLUGE of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to ' a character, Travis Crabtree, who walks in a canoe for a while, then ... leaves, never seen again). Although it's now painfully dated, I'm still a fun and crazy movie to show for kids, and anyone who enjoys Bigfoot Lore or 70's from the Hillbilly culture is planning to take it out. My favorite part: a man gets so scared that he jumps through a door for the first time (!?) And the narrator explains that he went unconscious of "shock". Uh, I'd like to break a door and his head is more likely why he was unconscious, but whatever. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad Americana.
