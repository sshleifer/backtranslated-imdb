Let's see, here are the "highlights" of The Brain Machine: 15 that create shots of a pool and a house; 15 setting shots from an indescribable office building; 5 countdown by a mere technician; 7 close-ups of a looming guard; and a myriad of technical bumps to show us it's a high tech experiment. <br /> <br /> Several posters commented on the inconsistency between the 1972 copyright date and the release date given on the 1977 DVD box. It's an easy one to explain. This dog has been sitting on the shelf for just five years, until someone has knocked it off and thought it fit perfectly with the post-Watergate mood of government mistrust. Now that I've seen the Brain Machine, it's my only wonder that it's never been released!
