The first cruel intention, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how on earth can they make a prosecution so straightforward. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie. In this one, Amy Adams sucks. She's terrible. And couldn't they have found a chick that actually looks like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely horrible compared to Ryan Phillipe. The Sebastian in the first film is devastating, deceptive, and far more evil than the Sebastian in the prequel. And what's with the story line. It's basically going as follows: 1- Sebastian has a bad rep at his first school, so the film says, although it doesn't mention anything about him and his dating life and how he moves with girls 2-Sebastian to New York, and suddenly decided to turn him around. He falls in love with Danielle (may I remind you that in the original says Sarah Michelle Giller says, "You broke with the FIRST PERSON you ever loved because I said - so, how can he in love with the prequel ? ???) And he's all nice and charming, and all the good people, since he makes sex off the chick that his dad did. <br /> <br /> 3- He does a full 180 and ending <br /> <br /> I mean it's terrible, and I loved the first one so much I haven't even seen the third, I hope God is better than this prequel.
