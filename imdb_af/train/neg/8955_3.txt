As far as the movie goes, it's an OK science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes. It is said, it is not so good, and some of the things are quite far-fetched. <br /> <br /> To name this other cube movie, the complete and complete bullsh is! T. This is the definition of the milk of a large and inventive original film. The whole feeling can be somewhat translated at the heart of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube itself is somewhat stretched ... <br /> <br /> I gave it a 3 *** due to the backstabbing of the original. This one must have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to call them all. <br /> <br /> Watchable for those who haven't seen Cube & Hypercube, but not recommended for fans of the series ...
