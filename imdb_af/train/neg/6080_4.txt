'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its children's achievements, forest settings and the discovery of the ruins of a castle. Yet the film is essentially an unusual psychosocial study of adolescents. With the dream series that begins the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his threatening dog, the film describes his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who promised her love for him, and his ultimate romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The film's psychological complexities give the film merit, but there is no doubt how unnecessarily the film is in portraying nudity and sex. The performance of the film is more in its beautiful places rather than specific cinematographic skills, and there is no doubt. The movie's biggest asset is the horrible children's chorus soundtrack. With its strange dream quality, the film, in turn, is interesting, but alongside Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' of the same era. Certainly deserves the art versus pornography debate, because unlike many forbidden films, such as Pasolini's "Salo" or Larry Clark's Ken Park, the film is quite unbeatable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to gradually lose its ability to shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' has to be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release. Shock value, however, is one reason alone, the movie is memorable. <br /> <br /> The movie does have its defenders. Yet it also does Nazism.
