"Ask the Dust" looks intriguing about the trailer, and we especially like all actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not compelling enough to be considered a drama, and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy. It almost seemed to be cigarette, and no entertaining effect. After seventy minutes waiting for this thing to get better, my wife and I went out and appreciated the fact that they didn't waste any more time on such nonsense. It was simply not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It seems to be written, produced and directed by a high school child; Worse still, it was such a shameful waste of extremely talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
