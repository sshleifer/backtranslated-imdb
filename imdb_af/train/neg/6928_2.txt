All the other comments have already said what I'm going to say, here's going anyway. I thought it was Italian first, sorry about that, Italy. I was not bored, because I was waiting for something to happen. Who has that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather went back to? Was it Alan Parsons? Seen it on a Brentwood 10 suit and the quality was as expected, terrible. Full of stripes and stuff. The movie was a disjointed mess. Goofy music and clueless characters. The chief had to know in the first minute that the doctor was more useful than the patients. I thought the "doctor" directing the "fight" would never end. Have had some good babes already. It looks as if these dumb ass movies always throw a mere chick or two and it gets you addicted. I gave it a 2 for the Nekkid women. The bird that people dance has made me stick out my own eyeballs. Poe probably did about 3,000 rpm in his grave when this thing came out, because it was loosely based on a story from his.
