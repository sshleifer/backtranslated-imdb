I don't know what some of you smoke, but I suspect it's powerful. <br /> <br /> Calling away Awesome will be an insult to the very concept of horror. The play is frightening and I do not choose Madonna here, we all know she is useless, but someone must have warned everyone that her ailment is infected. My back literally gets hurt if it's so bad at poorly rendered lines. The editing is so sloppy, it's beggars description. The photography and composition (which in this era must be the power of any budgeted movie) is surprisingly inactive, even the lighting is awful and unnatural. These are basic elements of film filming. If you can't do this, look for a different line of work. It is so confronted with a Grade 3 production of Snow White, except nowhere near or well made. <br /> <br /> The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor, excellently performed and written, with breathtaking visuals - You can taste the sea salt practically and feel the wind-blown sand in your hair. The sexual tension feels real and immediate ... those who have found Guy Ritchie's version unfortunate should see it, this is actually one of the landmarks of world cinema. <br /> <br /> Those of you who thought of the remake. is a kind of masterpiece should examine your heads.
