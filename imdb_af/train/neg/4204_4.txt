David Arquette is a young and naive home security alert <br /> <br /> salesman under Stanley Tucci's wing. Arquette is a <br /> <br /> golden boy, who has sold a great deal on his first call to widow Kate <br /> <br /> Capshaw and her dim son, Ryan Reynolds, played. Things are going <br /> <br /> good for Arquette, he appears in ads for security <br /> <br /> and he falls in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Dan Tucci and his right-handed wife, Mary McCormack, allow him to break into a little secret <br /> - they sometimes break into their homes <br /> <br / > Customers to scare them and get neighbors <br /> <br /> to buy firm security systems. Arquette decides not to become <br /> <br /> involved, to take Capshaw to meet his family and go through life <br /> <br /> with a dumb smile on his face. Then someone breaks in <br/> <br /> Capshaw's home and kills her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci, and fixes a series of skins, causing a gun to his bob head, as Tucci pleads his innocence. <br /> <br /> Based on a stage play, "The Alarmiste" is not opened well. The <br /> <br /> scene where Arquette takes the Capshaw to meet his parents <br /> <br /> is badly played and completely unfunny. They are also out of the game <br /> <br /> playing the character Capshaw as she gets drunk and <br /> <br /> sexually explicit stories tell Arquette's mother Michael Learned. Other <br /> <br /> Like these screens, Capshaw is not much given, but its <br /> <br /> does a lot with the little she's given. <br /> <br /> Like Terry O'Quinn, Stanley Tucci is a riot as the <br /> <br /> security firm owner. He's a creep that doesn't really understand. <br /> <br /> Arquette's moral disorder. However, when he changes into a <br /> <br /> snorkeling beater after Arquette kidnapped him, he is hilarious. Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack seems to be taking on a bigger role, but <br /> <br /> she mostly agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> is too old to play a stupid teen but he's funny, especially <br /> <br /> to tell his own explicit sexual story to Arquette. <br /> <br /> The script also starts from romantic comedy to dark comedy <br /> <br />. Capshaw who meets the parents is completely unmotivated, <br /> <br /> except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone can break <br /> <br /> in her home. Capshaw and Reynolds are just in the movie <br /> <br /> to give Arquette a reason to take revenge on Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who proves he's a good actor, is terrible here. He <br /> <br /> relies on the stubborn concern he received from the <br /> <br /> AT&T advertising, and he's not strong enough to <br /> <br /> don't build movie around. In fact, Reynolds might be a better <br /> <br /> choice. <br /> <br /> Dunsky's direction is good, nothing that will soon win an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Christophe Beck's light jazzy score is reminiscent of the type of film that this film is trying to be, and it is also very fascinating. <br /> <br /> Despite the pluses, Arquette's failure is a head start and the mini-dissertation <br /> <br /> schizophrenic quality sinks the film. I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> It is rated for (R) for physical violence, gun violence, a bit gore, <br /> <br /> strong curse, short female nudity, sexual content, strong sexuality <br /> <br /> references and adult situations.
