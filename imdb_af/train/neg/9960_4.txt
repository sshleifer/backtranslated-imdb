MY BROTHER TOM <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> Sound Format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> Following an episode of sexual abuse in the hands of A trusted neighbor, young Jessica (Jenna Harrison), forms a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw) she meets in the bush. Unfortunately, Whishaw has no secret of its own, no less disturbing and far more dangerous. <br /> <br /> Dour drama, fueled by bold performances by Harrison and Whishaw, in which two related spirits immerse themselves in nature in love after being traumatized by their experiences in the "real world". Unfortunately, their friendship disrupts as the harsh reality begins to invade, leading to an inevitable tragedy. Directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in digital video format, the movie looks in places (too much awkward close-ups and messy room camera moves) and takes a while to get its feet, but the dramatic down payment is silent. .
