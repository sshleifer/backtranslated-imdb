I was prepared to deal with the original _Cruel Intentions._ It came with the plot and remains true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this movie was, in my opinion, a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices. I didn't really care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I wasn't clear until I read the IMDB that this movie was supposed to be a prequel, especially since the title contains a number '2', I expected a successor, but then decided that it was a companion must be. Over all, I have to say that this movie reads anyway, like a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
