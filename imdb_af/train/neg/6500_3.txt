Look, I'm sorry or half of the world is offended by this, but life is confusing enough. I don't need to see it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew it would be a steaming pole of Quentin. But this thing is not well shot, and it is not risky - even if it is artificial. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and quick changes, not this "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation" excuse. This thing will hurt your head. It's the fastest moving picture you'll ever have. I still love AH, and I will always give him another chance, but if you don't have time to look at bad ideas, skip it.
