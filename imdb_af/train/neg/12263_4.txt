If I see this movie, as I was only on Turner Classic for the first time (calling it 'Dangerous Woman'), you can only multiply your appreciation for the 1947 Bogart Astor version. be. I hope he remembered his dentist and his Brylcreem salesman in his will; they made him the actor he was. The women are all good, but not better. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting is the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who delivers a lot of the individual tics, but almost nothing about the changing atmosphere of their successors in roles, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow exceeded the essentials of their characters in remake; here Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can't. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't really stink; it lies like a big cut ham. His main value today is a reminder that big movies like the '41 'Falcon don't just happen. On a scale of 1 to 10, I estimate it a 4, mainly for camera work and supporting players.
