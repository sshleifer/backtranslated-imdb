Very bad. Very, very bad. As a fellow striving to make, in the - or at least - the cafeteria table at a movie set, I find it hard to criticize independent people who actually made a movie of any kind. But this movie ... oh dear. <br /> <br /> The realization of Frightworld does not strive for anything more than rough exploitation (an honorable thing in itself) and to make it meet more general standards is a mistake. And to be honest, it's more entertaining than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not much. So I won't try to criticize, just ask me to cast some observations. <br /> <br /> 1) If gore is the point of the movie, don't you see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you rent, three good men should make sure at least one knows how to use the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie, your main maniac should be scarcer than a smurf doll. Difficult I know, but really ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are many talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of which you can really rent cheaply. Get one who knows how to make a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use post-effects and other cool apps doesn't mean he has to do it every two seconds. <Br /> <br /> 6) Kudos to get the girls, but next time, get girls whose tops we want to take away. <br /> <br /> 7) Edit must help tell the story or set a mood. At least in this kind of movie editing should sell the gore gags. A chain saw that suddenly appears in characters is not scary, it's messy. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all of the acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I loved Acid when she started fighting again. There were some neat images, unfortunately they were thrown on the screen without rhythm or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I also like the moxie of Frightworld. Next time, now that they have a movie of all kinds under their belts, I hope everyone is doing something better than Colman Francis. Upgrade at least Ed Wood.
