The fine cast can't lift this routine story of a secretary killed by her married paramour. In fact, there are more questions than answers in this one-sided story of romance and murder; and since we are only provided for the prosecution, none of these questions will be answered. This is the kind of prize that appeals to the "He Woman, Man Hater" clubs of America. As suggested, it is the story of an innocent woman who is "trapped" in a relationship with a married, high-profile lawyer. Is it possible that IF, she wasn't twice her son's friend and had a relationship with a married man, could have avoided the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident? If you see it, don't worry about the fridge, you won't miss anything.
