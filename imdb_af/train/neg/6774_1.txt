As a keen fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this movie and cry with laughter, as AMC announced it as a comedy. I've never been disappointed with a movie! Cary's ordinary charm and effortless comedy is AWOL of this whole movie; He comes across as tense, bored and just not himself. Mississip's character is one of the worst stereotypes I've ever seen. His accent is terribly exaggerated (and wrong, according to which part of Mississippi he claims to bring), and when he delivers a line, it's a few decibels higher than any other cast member. Mississip tried to portray himself in the film as a lovely, land-bumpkin goofball, but eventually he only succeeded in forcing the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscure pop-up as a Hollywood sex kitten, and while she was never known in Hollywood for her acting ability, the film screams that she never had the ability to start. Ray Walston's character was pure and eventually confronted. For four men on land leave it was the furthest leave I have ever seen. I watched this nightmare to the end, and while I won't spoil it for someone, I'll tell you it's the most absurd thing you'll ever see. The film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of guilt to the fighters, but the film misses the point completely because of its poor plot line and poor role. Sorry, Cary!
