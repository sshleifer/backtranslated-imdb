They show it on some off-networks. It's pretty crazy. While it's not as bad as the B-movies, they show on the Sci-Fi network on Saturdays, but still a rather large stack of shit. The play is acceptable. The plot and writing are fairly substandard and the pacing is far too slow. Every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they pack things before the credits - not the highlight of the movie, the denial. Also, large portions of the cast look over old for the age range they play. The whole thing is predictable, boring and not worthy of being watched. Save your time. It's not even worth seeing for free.
