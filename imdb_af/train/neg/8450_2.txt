What happens to ITV Drama. First, "Los Gemma", simply, the worst TV drama I've seen for years, and now, "Perfect Parents", is a complete bump from start to finish. Anyone responsible for commissioning these drives must receive P45 at special delivery. <br /> <br /> In most Drama / Thrillers is a requirement to suspend certain levels of faith so that the plot line can develop, but "Perfect Parents" has taken it on a new level, I have so much conviction suspended at the end of this nonsense. I felt fed on a truck's "Magic Mushrooms" load. It was as if the screenwriters decided to try to create a "Drama by Numbers" that included some serious issues - Religion, Education, Greeting, Fear, Murder, Paedophillia, the only problem was as major Eric Morecambe once said. played when he played a piano: "I play everything right - necessarily in the right order". For your next Script guys, I suggest you try to read some script development books as "Script writing For Dummies". <br /> <br /> Because of the ridiculous Scripture and the total lack of tension in the direction, acting was a suitable low key, not the actor's fault, as the throw was also. But I suggest that all the actors involved in this sorry piece of drama should instruct their agents the next time the postman tries to deliver a script from the ITV drama department, make sure the mailbox is nailed tightly!
