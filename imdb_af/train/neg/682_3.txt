Note: I see from the different posts that there was an original silent version and also a good version of the same movie. I saw the sound version and it was aesthetically pleasing. Considering some indicates that the original version was LONGER and without the mad dubbing, my review should be kept in mind. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Rene Clair has a good reputation as a filmmaker and Louise Brooks, he has a bit of a cult sequence, in many ways a technically poor movie. While Hollywood changed to sound mode around 1929, until early in the 30s, many well-known French films were essentially silent movies - with some dialogue and sound effects that were very poorly beaten over the film. The lip movements in many, and in particular this film, do not even agree with what is being said. This will explain why an American like me. Brooks can do a French movie. It's just sloppy and I would have liked them to have just made a quiet movie - and as a silent movie it would be an average movie - with excellent camera work (sometimes) and some decent silence. br /> <br /> The problem I encountered with the movie was the too simplistic plot. For a quiet moral play about 1920, it would have been good, but by 1930 the plot was a bit hoary (it means "old" - not "endty"). A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiance can't handle it. She gives it everything temporarily but is lured back to the fancy life and it spells her end! A little melodramatic, huh? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> Finally, the character of the fiance's friend (?) I found very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and abused a lot of the movie and picked it up by the friend and everyone. As he had just taken it through the film and there was no decision, his character was unnecessary and the treatment was moderate. Were audiences supposed to laugh when he was abused? It seems to me that this implies and I don't like it at all. <br /> <br /> There are NO better French movies of the era (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain, and others) as well as quieter movies. I can't understand this movie's high rating.
