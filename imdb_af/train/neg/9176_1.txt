You know you're in trouble when the opening story tells you basically who survives. It all goes from there. Unnecessary "Matrix" influenced bullet-time camera work. Pointless tracks for video games. Corsican old sea captains and wacky sailors. Ravers who become skilled fighters in the eye of the eye. Even the zombies are boring. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for at least a "so bad it's good" zombie movie, but this one is "so bad are those involved in the creation of the movie excluded ever to a movie to make again ". <br /> <br />
