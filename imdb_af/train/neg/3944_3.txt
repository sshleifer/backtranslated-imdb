The film My Name is modesty based on an episode that takes about one page in the 10th humility Blaise novel called Night of the Morning Star. It describes an incident in which the young Modesty (17 in the book, mid-twenties in the film) claims her leadership in a war over a casino. As set before the real Blaise adventures, her reliable sidekick Willi Garvin is not in the movie. This is one of the biggest problems, as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin has always been one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long-term cartoon. The other problem is that the movie is simply incredibly boring, because it's just one small episode that is blown up in a screenplay. The decisive is good, but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young modest. I get the impression that this movie was a quick and dirty solution not to lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.
