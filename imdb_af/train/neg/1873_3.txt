You have to joke !!!! Let's entertain the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, not just entering the actor's club. Actually, unless it is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on David Mamet - a terse, confusing dialogue alternately given in machine gun quick or monotonous (think Ben Stein) mixing - or a flat, dry comedy ; this movie should be in the rock for a Rotten Tomato award --- or worse. <br /> <br /> As if the stiff and uncomfortable Posey wasn't enough, we got the stiff and even more awkward Jeff Goldblum. There is more wood in this movie than a toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> With this already bizarre decisive addition, there are several other roles, all populated by forgetful actors, who look at America's Next Top Model, or sound, Don Pardo, or even the child, what the word " like saying "bean, which only draws our attention to the fact that there is so little of this film, we analyze his accent to guess whether he is Canadian or not !! I think I have laughed heartily at places that are supposed to be serious and have taken serious departments to be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alarik Jans music for Mamet's "The House of Games". If it is taken as a spoof, the film is almost dull; if taken seriously, just a self-conscious piece of clothing.
