Lame, cliched superhero action movie drive. I had high expectations for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioners is one that I do not despise, but very rarely do I see a storyline as sad and ridiculous as this one was. It would be forgiven, as it is always in these types of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately it did not. The action carries the brand security and the upper nature of HK action, but it is not very obscure, obscene and, in fact, often quite incoherent (perhaps it is due to re-release for American release, it shows signs of many plastering) . I was very disappointed.
