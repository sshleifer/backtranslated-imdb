I went to NEW PORT SOUTH for a surrogate movie about the Columbine homicide that is similar to Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT, and certainly the synopsis in the TV guide, saying that a student sociopat rebels against the system gave me the impression, but it is a very boring movie. Where little happens, warn yourself <br /> <br /> The story is about Maddox, a Chicago high school student who decides to hit back on what he sees as an authoritarian regime. The biggest problem is that the character is endorsed and the actor who plays Blake Shields cannot decorate any shortcomings. You have the gut feeling that Maddox must have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden, but he never appears as an evil teenager and it is impossible to believe that he can meet any disciples. The subtext of your overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime just to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious, meaning NEW PORT SOUTH is a totally unconvincing drama that is not worth going out of your way no.
