This movie has some andrenaline kickers, but it is an old story that simply can never happen. Navy protocols can never break down so much that a crew who can far less than an XO ever go so far against the Captain. I'll take Dr Strangelove any day if I want to see this plot. Side notes - the US fleet did not support this film.
