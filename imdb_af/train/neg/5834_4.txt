I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between Â£ 3 and Huis, MD. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially inappropriate of choice, similar to Laurie's character house, but without the sharp white Laurie goes to Huis bring. Meanwhile, Tucci's "straight guy", the distinguished doctor Seger, has not developed into a more interesting character, such as the bad 'straight guys' Cuddy and Wilson. Indira Varma's character Adrienne Holland is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron to be an incident. <br /> <br /> Of course, someone at CBS noticed the success of Huis, MD, and told his staff about him (her) a similar performance, hoping that imitation would be successful. However, the copy of a show like Huis demands the same high-level balance of mind and tension, and Tucci and the company are just not up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> I didn't know the show was canceled until I read the reading. comments on IMDb, but it doesn't surprise me.
