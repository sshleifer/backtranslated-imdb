A family looking for old roadside attractions included in the father's coffee table book comes across an old, horrible old freak show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family breaks down to leave the sideshow, they are forced to stay at an almost abandoned fishing camp. It was the place of a jail break for decades. <br /> <br /> There were many movies in the freak sub-genre of horror, ranging from Tod Browning's beloved 'Freaks' (1932) to Alex Winter's hilarious 'Freaked' (1993). It's both classic (or soon with "Freaked"). "Side Sho," will never be. And if it ever reaches classic status. . . Well, this will be a clear indication of the sad state of our genre. From the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17-year-old daughter who is of course older than her natural mother, this film did not do much. The writing was subpar, but not quite terrible. . . just boring. The direction was poor, and the scarce freak effects were pretty awful and incredible. The acting was uncomfortable and the casting was even worse. Anyone who would believe the ages of these two adolescence teenagers hadn't been a teenager long ago. There was not enough gore and violence to make up for the lack of any other quality. . . And when there was some violence, it was not well done. And I can't forget to mention the finals that were the worst in all I ever saw in a movie. Overall, it's an easily forgotten and poorly made horror movie to be earned, just below the dollar tray. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
