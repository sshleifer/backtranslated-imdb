:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was terrible. A Catholic / superstitious / exciting thriller runs across all the good treads of previous movies. <br /> <br /> The dubious priest. Sex and the priesthood. Politics and religion. Church hypocrisy. Conspiracy regarding the church. The dawn of a new evil age. All kinds of dark magical voodoo battles between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Slightly silly and crippled with a poor storyline. The story revolves around two concepts: Absolute, better known as the Sacrament of the Sickness of the Sick - the last rights one can ask to cleanse the sins of man on the brink of death; And communication, the act of cutting someone from the Church. Basically, a Workout cannot receive Absolute. So it comes in the Sin Eater, and I will release it with it. Throw all the dopy stuff I've already listed and you have "The Order". <br /> <br /> I found the sex scene with the priest who insulted shots of a photograph of the Virgin Mary, who insulted the Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger who says, "I am the Savior and the Savior of sins, I live without love blah blah blah". He can walk in a dark alley with a long ditch coat, the Matrix. <Br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 1 because it was not just crappy and unoriginal, but also because it managed to insult a whole faith in the process. If you want to see something better, I suggest "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
