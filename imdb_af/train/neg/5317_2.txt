For the first 20 minutes or so (I watched it on a PS2, so I really have no idea how long it took). Alienator sets an interesting prospect. I don't think I've seen a treasure movie with a stranger from another planet other than the bad one before. But interest will soon be astonished by unbelief, because you realize the 'stranger' is a great builder-woman in a steel bikini. Yes, alienator is remarkably ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Don't think I like it. In the world of horror cruelty, it is clear that it is ridiculous, often a good sign. The blatant stupidity of his point of view, however, is that the film really goes for it. Alien is funny like hell, but it's also the highest order shambolic suckfest. Actors are hoping for unsuccessful attempts to be serious. Potential genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are invaded by unmanned incompetence and the direction fails to summarize even one or two decent set-ups. By the time the movie is finished, you can hardly see the original concept through the haystack of the total voyage that the team has piled up. <br /> <br /> Add to this the fact that the 'Alien' kills them by evaporating, Unlike a "slashing" as such and you have a huge beating hope of good ideas to rot. You will laugh at Alienator, but with it, not with it. If this is your thing, go ahead and check it out.
