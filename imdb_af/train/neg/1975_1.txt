To be honest, I haven't seen so many Western films, but I've seen enough to know what a good one is. It is by far the worst western on the planet today. First, are there black people in the Wild West? Come on! Who ever thought it could be a cool off of the wall film that everyone wanted, was slightly, no no, totally delayed! First, women in the age group, especially black women, were not inclined to wear or use weapons. The Asian Chick speaks perfect English? If the environment is western, Asia is not where you go. Finally, the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just from the beginning. Now I'm not wrong, I'm not racist or white, or don't get it when you read it, but this movie, this movie is the worst presentation of black people I've ever seen!
