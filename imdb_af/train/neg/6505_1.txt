A confused mess from start to finish. As they said about the Beatles songs, there was a secret message if you played the LP backwards. If one had the patience to watch these films, screens started off from scratch, with the same degree of disappointment. <br /> <br /> Apart from all this psychedelic hodge podge of flashback and fake, the clearest characters were the filmmakers, out of revenge when the movie was not sorted. There was also nothing to keep these two. Persuasion, screaming and threats were presented in the comic book. I think one-dimensional was an over-declaration. Well, so maybe the artificial types are rolled up their eyes, in that, unlike them, they didn't just get us. Well, I'm afraid there's nothing to get. And the two cardinal sins of any bad movie carried from beginning to end. A non-existent and pathetic story line if you want to call it, and by far the worst, not a single character you care about.
