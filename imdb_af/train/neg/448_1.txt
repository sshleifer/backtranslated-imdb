What I hate about this show is how poor the lead is written. These women have no self-respect or dignity. The whole plot is they throw themselves at guys. Amanda Bynes's talent is completely wasted. She was brilliant on "All That" and her own show. Why would they pursue her and Jenny Garth as fleeting, lazy head, desperate men, pursuing "old" wannabes beyond me. <br /> <br /> Their plots and dialogue remind me of "The Simpons", Homer says when his cartoon character Poochie is not on the screen, "Everyone has to ask, where is Poochie?". All the talk is about a guy and looking at a guy. Sometimes they change it and the guy blows instead. Then they come together again or break at the end. The 2 women are either level, stupid or sex addicts. The only word I can think of is "sucks".
