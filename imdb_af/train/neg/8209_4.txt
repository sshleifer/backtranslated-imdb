The acting, other reviews, despite the fact, were remarkably well done. Brad Pitt maintains the role of an annoying, unpleasant Austrian climber. Other plays are good. The story might have sounded, but somehow it missed - one never understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story that was quite dramatic could not sign in this audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkable dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world we live in - but I couldn't try to try myself in this story. As an unknown Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to love this movie - and yet it left me cold. <br /> <br /> It may not be in myself, but I tend to point to the creative end of this movie - direction, script, production, editing - somehow they lost me. This is a pity, because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it had to be wonderful. It wasn't. Probably looking, just to make your own thoughts about it - but don't expect too much, and maybe you won't be as disappointed as I was. Most of it is boring me.
