I'm afraid you'll find that the vast majority of people who consider this movie a 10 are highly Christian. I'm not. If you're looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you have to go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I was irritated by the characters and their illogical behavior. The premise of the film is that the doctrine of morality without learning that it is Jesus which is the basis of morality is itself wrong. One scene shows the main character telling a boy it's wrong to steal, and then the character goes to say that it was Jesus we taught it. I find that offensive: must we believe that you will not steal, come from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? And stem was previously acceptable? I rented the movie from Netflix. I had to realize the nature of the movie from the comment. Oh good.
