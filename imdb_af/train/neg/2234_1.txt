I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I realize why. The acting was the worst I have ever seen. The lighting and sound are at its best. The plot doesn't make sense, even when it's sober (WARNING: It is not advisable to watch this movie when it's sober.) This movie feels like you're watching the home movie of someone who doesn't come out much. It is a pity that all the little money spent on this project has fallen so far, I look to see if any of those who have had a career other than Eva Longoria, who is the only "star" of this movie is. It didn't seem to have hit the bad play. I'm sorry that nothing of this criticism looks constructive, but I will say one thing to James Cahill, don't try it again. In the words of squirlyem: "It is badly lacking in the good department".
