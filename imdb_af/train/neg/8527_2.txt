There are three movies with this animation style that I remember from my youth. This movie, "The Last Unicorn", "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit." I own copies of both "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and I haven't seen The Last Unicorn for more than a decade. It was until today and now I wish I hadn't. What bothers me most was the writing. It was incredibly messy and often unwise. Things will happen without cause and other things will happen without explanation. We're not just talking about small things here; We're talking about key plot points! The story itself is not so good to start with, but it could have worked if the writing was proper. Not even close. In addition, the music was terrible! I know music in movies like this rarely has what you would call classic pieces, but the music in this movie caused me to unknowingly beat a bowling ball. It was one of those movies I would show one day to my kids, but it just cut. I don't think I can ever sit through that crap party again. Disappointed, it's light.
