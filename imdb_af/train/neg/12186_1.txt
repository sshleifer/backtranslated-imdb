This re-recording of the original 1962 film in the book has some very good parts to praise and some fine performances by some fine actors. But Scorsese picks the end for the most formal plots and an embarrassment of the Shakespeare ruin that has caused me. look at my watch. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is an excellent actor dedicated to giving her all the work he does. However, he needs the direction to focus his talent. It's a lot lacking in the last five minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck's cameo is useful, but nothing more, while Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with so few lines like this. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte turns in a better performance than Lorenzo's Oil, but is not in the same shape as "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has a few good lines while Juliette Lewis once again proves that the talent is overshooting a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? The initial credits (!), The first view of Cody's return when he falls into jail, the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats, Sam Bowden's decent full-fledged panic, Cody's outwardly calm but impeccable prescription. <br /> <br /> The worst? The "cleaning woman - BUT NOT VERY !!!" Share. Kneeling on the bottom of a car for a hundred miles with high speed. (Is there no speeding in the US?) The "He Is Dead - BUT NOT VERY NICE!" parties and the aforementioned rounding off. <br /> <br /> I can look again at the original, but I have been tempted to see the remake in four years since it was seen.
