OK, Mr. Agrama's company (involved in a dubious business with former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi) has a terrible mish-mash by Mr. Carl Macek made. <br /> <br /> What is this terrible mish-mash I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three completely unrelated Japanese sci-fi animated series (Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added TONS of dialogue. They thought the American audience was dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence. the whole lot is heavy for violent content, added a few metaphysical mumbo jumbo, which it called using some of the worst voice factors. This side of acting Hell (Reba West's song was - and still is unbearable and a total indignation, especially when compared to Mari Iijima) ... And the result was an 85 episode series with hundreds of continuity issues and plot holes . <br /> <br /> Of course, the mecha was cool to look at (especially those in the "Macross Saga") and the plots that remained unharmed were good. But what was good about Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the "voice talents" he recruited. It was because of the effort and effort of the (unreasonable - why? Should I be too fat to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who eventually got the wind and compared the original to Robotech now wish that we were never exposed to Robotech. The original is so much better, of course, and makes much more sense. <br /> <br /> Robotech made it worthwhile: it asked legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to launch a campaign to protect Japanese anime creators' Intellectual property of such unauthorized and incessant reworkings that produce talented people like Carl Macek.
