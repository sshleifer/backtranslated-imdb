There are many things that can be said for this cartoon; The backgrounds are rich, lazy colored and full of beautifully finished art deco details. The animation is on the usual studio standards of the time, which is undoubtedly higher than the current time. However, I find it very much for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> The music: it's definitely not Scott Bradley's regular standards. Although it is probably supposed to be a "Great Gatsby" institution, at least it becomes sleepy, repetitive, and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous is not the same as Beethoven's 5th symphony testifies). Since most people (including me) close their eyes when yawn, there is a lot of the visual part of the cartoon missed by the average viewer. <br /> <br /> The storyline: I'm not throwing away any secrets that aren't already in the plot - country good, city bad. It's a common theme in movies, both animated and alive, from this era. It is a misplaced nostalgia for a non-existent rural idill, which is reflected in today's nostalgia for "values" that have never been.
