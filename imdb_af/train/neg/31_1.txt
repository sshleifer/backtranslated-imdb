This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely, Venus does not officially exist in Canon TMNT. There will never be a female tortoise, it has kept away from the tragic story of 4 male unique mutants who will never again have a family, once more. The biggest mistake was to go over Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the tortoise's voices were wrong and they all acted out of character. They could have done such a better job, better design and animation and ANY VENUS. <br /> <br /> Don't struggle with these people ... it's valuable stuff. the lip flap was slow and unnatural. they totally ignored clippers. The headquarters, a few dragon-lover wives, were wheat. the turtles watched with things hanging from their bodies, what is the thing about the rap dog? the crazy, seasoned plastrons! <br /> <br /> If they look normal, act, and get rid of Venus, get rid of the blunt kiddie cartoon sounds ... and writing better could have been good.
