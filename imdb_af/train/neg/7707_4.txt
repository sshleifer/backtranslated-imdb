With a title like 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!', Anyone going into this thing will expect a a) a bad science fiction movie or b) make a comedy that makes bad science fiction movies. It is supposed to be a mixture of both, with a dose of parody being flushed. Unfortunately, it falls very fast. <br /> <br /> Never take this movie seriously, I realize it, but you think I'm funny, right? I just got some of the jokes or situations were funny (that is, the phone conversations next to each other, the Russian Olympic spy eating steroid grain, Superman walking through Lois, etc.). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but it does not. A cultic classic is a film that is so different that only a particular group of people understand it (or a similar description). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" can be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor. Therefore, it does not qualify as a cult film. <br /> <br /> There is one good actress in The whole thing: Sharon Taylor and Lois Fairchild. She is a thin, gawky reporter, but has an engaging personality, likes to work, and is a natural comedy. Unfortunately she is badly used here. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" is not as funny as "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie", but it does have a few hilarious moments, so I'll still have it recommended to see it once. Avoid the director's cut, it has interruptions by the movie producer and some so-called "lost" footage dubbed in a former African dialect (it can be found in English on the print band).
