For my life I can't understand the blind hype and dedication to this amazing movie ...... and I think I have the qualifications to say it .... I'm a former special operational soldier with 14 years in the "lifestyle" ... This movie was completely unreal and obviously written by someone who did very little research on life in the army, in battle or on team or platoon level. <br /> <br /> Three EOD guys marry Baghdad on their own ????? Get Real ... No Chain Of Command ????? Get Real ... EOD Cleaning Of Buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Qualified Goat Sergeant ???? Get Real .... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad guy and let two guys take me without shooting another shot or not being hurt at all ???? Get really .... I carjack an Iraqi citizen, while just armed with a 9million break into another citizen's house, hit by his wife, camp it again on foot in the middle of Baghdad the night without so much like a scratch or confrontation ???? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no compliance with {Army} military protocol and no parable to any army unit I even experienced. Absolutely unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of EOD who are in violation of this poor movie, is not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos, but highly qualified professionals do an incredibly difficult job.
