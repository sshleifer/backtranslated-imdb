Start with the good bit: Swayze speaks Zulu to his friends several times or the language is heard among the tribes. That's a good plus, as usually American and British movie audiences think all people are speaking to this planet English (only if you are one of them: no, they don't). <br /> <br /> But the acting is 'tumbling' as we say in the Netherlands (it makes your toes curl - not in a good way). I like Swayze, but here he is terrible. The muscles in his jaws make overtime and he flashes the whole movie - as one has to tell him it looks butch. No Patrick: It looks stupid and is compensation for lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) chose a style of acting that did not meet the style of her co-workers. Her acting is so relaxed that this movie could be set in the current days. And it is not. Your dress was a clue, Alison. <br /> <br /> The best acting came from the people of the African continent and Sidide Onyulo as Umbopa I liked best. Bright, warm and character, his performance is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> General: It's mwah-entertaining on a rainy day. Sorry. Could have been better. Pocket the director.
