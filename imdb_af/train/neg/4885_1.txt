I had to listen. I warned, and yet I paid for this. After reading all the reviews, I knew the original was "so bad it is good", and that part 2 doesn't fit in that category can't resist. Exactly what happened here? Part one was Hilarious, it had so much political misconception, and others Crazy, Fat Entertainment, and this one, there just couldn't be a worse successor on God's green earth, not Basket 2, hell, not even Troll 2 no. It is truly the worst successor in history and it really says something about the groundbreaking bottom of the original quality of the walk. Criminal Insane Part 2 was just another brand of bad. Shot on Video, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original, and on top of all the crazy, fat Ethel lost part of her perimeter. I mean, honestly, is this a kind of sick joke ?! Thank you, Nick Milliard. 1/1
