The main aspect of the Superstar movies in its later stages was the frequency, the lacuna between one film and the next. Being an established star of the South Indian movie was the feedback he received before Baba was big. <br /> <br /> Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he performed in Tamil in 11 years as a mass hero has only 11 at the rate of 1 per year. All this was a big hit. He had an image that many thought could not be easily broken down. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999) he went into a state of Hibernation. His fans around the world, especially in South India, were ready to watch any kind of movie with their superstar in action. So, the Tamil theater industry has decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers thought the fans would take everything they show with Superstar. But it clearly didn't work out in this movie. As usual, the hype of the media and the expectation of the fans was very much over. <br /> <br /> Rajinikanth's image is completely damaged. The supporters had nuts. The movie's collection did not reach the expected level. Reputation of large people has gone down. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this movie was the songs of A.Rhhman. Rehman is known to have made good music for some of the worst movies like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Couple Paravasam, Star, and Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, and so on. Well, I never thought this movie would join the league. <Br /> <br /> I feel very depressed, not because the movie was bad, it is because of the superstar's image that goes down. It took him five full years to get it back completely with two movies Chandramukhi and Sivaji and back fans who really look for them in a superstar movie.
