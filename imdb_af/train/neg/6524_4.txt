The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Like 'The Man From Planet X', it's a bizarre science fiction story that disappears from an era where fantasy and science fiction are still condemned near the same thing . Meaning, we have some highly ridiculous special effects and turbulent pseudo-science devastation as science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" that is released in high quality transmission with a sharp picture and sharp sound - by Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So, the main reason for watching this movie? Oh, it's definitely the whole time our spacecraft is on Mars. (What did you think "Angry Red Planet" refers to Neptune?) Before that is a little poor-quality spacecraft staff who enter a spaceship, where they smoke and visit sexist chauvinist banter aimed at the "disabled female" member of the crew. It would be slightly offensive according to today's standards if it wasn't so funny. But Mars is the real reason we watch this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars screams crimson. It is filmed in this bizarre red plasticy shine that gives the angry red planet an interesting appearance of excessive redness. It's really a face? As the (ha ha) strangers viewers are to testify. The best is the "ratbatspidercrab." You think it's a joke? This is what they call it in the movie! It is a giant chimera (small puppet) of a thing that combines characteristics of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It borders on all dolls and scares the k * t from our "heroic crew." There are other strange and poor imaginations, strangers to be seen, but one takes the cake. Eventually, the sexist crew after their annoying experience on Mars marched their "ship" and returned to what planet they came from. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone. Science Fiction movie buffs & curiosity seekers, and some general movie buffs. Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have a field day with this one (if they never got it on the show). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern Score, 6/10 Nostalgia Score, 4/10 Overall. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
