The name of Nick Stahl, the young role and the attractive cover of the VHS made me buy and watch this movie and expect me to see a good teen slash movie. What a crap! The full clich√©s screenplay, the dialogue and the performances are terrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, terrible ?? summary, a total waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, just an absolutely boring story, with shameful plot points. The movie starts with six characters, indeed three couples, together as a group of friends, but indeed many nasty people who appear to be enemies play, a ridiculous senseless game called "Taboo", and with each one writing yes or no for certain taboo issues. This is it: no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationship. Then there is an ellipsis one year later, and the same group gathered in a New Year's Eve, insulting each other in a very bad way. But the plot and the twists are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre and incredible, which no longer deserves in my review. Only one advice: Don't waste your time or money on this garbage, you'll definitely regret it. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo ?? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Taboo? Play With The Killer")
