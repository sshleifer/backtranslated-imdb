I first saw this movie on MST3K. And although I laughed at my joke at the jokes, I don't think this movie is so bad. Certainly, it was a bit difficult to understand it was a fairly low budget, but it had a lot of Hitchcock-like plot and I can honestly say that when I considered the non-MST3K version, I was really entertained . This movie was screaming for a Hollywood remake.
