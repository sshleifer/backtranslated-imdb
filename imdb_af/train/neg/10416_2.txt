Before I saw this movie, I would have said that I love everything Kathy Bates did. Now it's all-minus one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his acting. Someone had to tell him that "arm" is not synonymous with dirty or ignorant or clich√©. This for Randy Quaid's stereotyping. The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who is not a strong enough actor to carry this mess. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy the view. This is the best I can give. <br /> <br /> I'm a serious fan of both independent and peculiar movies, but it's just awful.
