Really bad. Why someone thinks it's a good movie, let alone, funny is a real secret. I like comedies as much as the next man and I loved a Christmas story. "The fact that it is the same director and based on the same author's memoirs, completely surprised me why this film is such a complete failure at every level. Charles Grodin is disgusted as the father first. another does not look the same pacing - it just does not flow well, everything seems tired and forced The joy of life that penetrated the first film is completely absent here - you just want the movie to end. Not even recommending this movie for curiosity seekers enjoying a Christmas story, so bad.
