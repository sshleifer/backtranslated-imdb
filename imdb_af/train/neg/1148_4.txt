Pedantic, elongated manufacture that attempts to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Launching quite promisingly, with an nevertheless relevant sin in an airplane explosion, the melodrama including James Stewart and Vera Miles just got in the way. Miles had a habit of compelling clumsy women and her checkered nerves came straight to schedule. Former director Mervyn LeRoy healed this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent, the picture didn't make much of the impression. The best performance is rated by Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner, but most of the dialogue is ridiculous and the obsolete pacing causes the movie to appear twice as long. * 1/2 of ****
