In this memorable moment, 40-year-old Norma Shearer captures a fluttery, girlish socialite in Monte Carlo, caught between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame this movie's failure on the dim, talky script, or director George Cukor, who is never interested in making the film's general comatose. Mostly, this is the fault of Shearer himself, who desperately wanted to play "young" parts as long as she could get away with it. Accidentally, 'her cardboard lover' makes a bizarre monument to an aging woman's vanity.
