The fact that this film is entitled to the most successful film in Switzerland's film history, makes me shake my head! It is true, but sadly at the same time. A movie about the Swiss army can be much better. <br /> <br /> The story sounds interesting, at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to evade his military training by the army while he is in. The church, married his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). <br /> <br /> The action somehow does not really differ from just a few recruits who get drunk and are actually stoned. Melanie Winiger plays her role as the strong Michelle Bluntschi mediocre, personally I found her rather annoying. <br /> <br /> The storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance that doesn't work as expected. The romance part is too trashy, and the comedy part is not funny at all. It's just a cheap try and doesn't change throughout the movie. It's fun for preadolescent 12-13 year olds, but not for those looking for an entertaining comedy. The humor is poor, except for a few shots. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cool! Steel? Cool! If you want a proper comedy about Swiss RS, make sure you haven't relieved your military training yet, and even don't expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give it 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is pretty funny during his screenplay. Not a hell of a lot of screen time though
