In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and funny comedy ?? The best thing he ever did. Ten years later he returned to regain the plot of 'Home Alone' in this second successor, which is not related to the other films, but is just as uninspired and sadistic. The four crooks? That's right, celebrate! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for launching this revolutionary change in the series! ?? is nickel-plated with metal chairs, heard with barbels and painted with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new child is even less charming than Culkin. You'd think the departure of almost all the key players from the first two movies would prevent Hughes from fossilizing the same old routines, but the only surprise is that he didn't even come up with Home Alone 4.
