Went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the Jet Li, we were amazed at Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, too many of his fights are so clearly false that it even took that pleasure out of it. The flying kicks would be very impressive if you couldn't see the wires while flying through the air for 4 seconds and 9 shots. <br /> <br /> Cartoon and very disappointing.
