Okay, first of all, I'm a big zombie moviewoman. I already loved Romero's movie and enjoyed the Dawn of the Dead's recurrence. When I heard all the critics who had this movie, I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be a very good movie, I enjoyed it if it wasn't just a fun zombie shoot-em with a half-decent plot. However, this is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half-judgmental plot, and video games inserted into the movie. Whoever thought in their own minds was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term losely) I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out of the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a horrible movie and he can do as well. Everyone else acts as if they are doing Shakespeare. And I can add very badly. Basically, the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity if you are a.) Is a big zombie buff and must make every zombie flick or b.) Like playing MST3K, the home game. See it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs. <br /> <br />
