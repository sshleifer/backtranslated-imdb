Unfortunately, realism is boring. This movie, which I thought would never end, would have been better if all the characters were hit in the first five minutes. Where's Blade When You Need It? While being as dirty as COMBAT SHOCK, DREAMING a DREAM, and as nightmare as BOISE MOI, DEATH CREATURES isn't nearly as entertaining as any of the above-mentioned dark movies. While gratuity cannibalism made the wannabe Jeffery Dalmers heartbeat a little bit faster, it wasn't nearly as interesting as RAVENOUS. Really, I found it so interesting as late-infomercials, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic features, otherwise you can not tolerate it. I was really surprised that this one was not made by the people at Brain Damage, because it was the quality of Dead Beings.
