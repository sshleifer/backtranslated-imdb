Acting was poor, but in a horrible movie I can live with if the story is good. It wasn't. The initial event was a clumsy and obvious crap to exploit most people's worship of children. Okay. Fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of the ghosts. OK, cool - this will be a supernatural kind of horror story, with partially in our world partially rotting ... where. Then the action begins to pull like a threefold dog in a wave of cats and birds. Is there an evil force that attacks them directly? Is there a bad force they are trying to attack. Immediately - do people make terrible things they wouldn't really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is a kind of psychological echo room where the disagreement of the environment can fall back into murder? OK, hold on - maybe it's just one small, spiritually entangled "Delbert" style Redneck boy who misses his Mama and somehow beats like a K-Tel Norman Bates? Oh yes, extra points: the only black character seems to be the grandson of a "Our Gang" pullman porter. The actor plays it as straight as he can give the crummy dialogue, but the fact is, his goal is: "You're done, I'm going to finish, boss!" At least they write him smart enough to get GTF out there. The little bit with the little girl who was silent and moved away was definitely dirty, as the chick was in the shower. It was just two of a few nice treats in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways, such as a bite of steak, a little chocolate and a bit of a gummi bear. Everyone is good on their own, but mixed? Bleah! Such potential. Wasted.
