I give this movie a ONE because it's really a horrible movie. The soundtrack of the DVD is so bad, it hurts me. But the vision, no matter how diverse, shows something really fancy in Italian society. I won't go into detail, which was actually so shocking, but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal. So for the kink value, I give it one. Otherwise, the video, photography, performances of adult actors / actresses are simply substandard, a practical jock for people who love foreign films. Roberto, the main character, has a whole spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being incredible. Anyway, the kids in the movie are mostly 3/4 years old, and they are real and the movie gives a glimpse of Italian life.
