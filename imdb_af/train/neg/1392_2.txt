"Gray Matter" AKA "The Brain Machine", but the video people thought it better; the screen says 1972, but IMDb says 1977; It's such a movie. The government has a keen interest in this four-person "brain machine" project. It's roughly a philosopher, a horny priest, a crackpot veteran and a patriot who has an abortion - to put in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrible secret thoughts. In the end, the government is violently taking over the lab and everyone is dying. Here is a film that is incompetent in every important way; MY s *** has better production values ​​than that. However, it was my interest to just see what exactly these exploiters thought they were doing, dabbling in four-person-in-a-room character drama. The answer: a channel on how science is inferior to God. Thank you very much. It's like making a kid egg and getting your 30th goddamn puzzle. The priest is played by James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, the philosopher of Gerald "Republican Simon" McRaney. Also, with many, very, very long-standing and large-scale transition shots, it moves almost as slowly as the Liberal Convention.
