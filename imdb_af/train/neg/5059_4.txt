If you want to see a movie about two completely unpathetic characters, this is the one. The acting is excellent, both of John Cassavetes and the insane paranoids who, as the saying goes, really come out, and of Peter Falk as his lifelong best friend, for whom he is changing for salvation. Big mistake, but being both amoral mobsters and misogynistic bastards to start, it's hard to decide who to root LESS. Only writer / director Elaine May could have got away with this one. I thought it was interesting that he included on the DVD in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the script, that the director was almost impossible to work with, that the director of photography made impossible demands from him, that the crew was constantly angry to wake up, and so on. This mood of one large, very dysfunctional family is evident on the screen.
