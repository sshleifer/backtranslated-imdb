I didn't know it was a silent movie with narration. I don't care for silent movies - the crowned humor, flickering lighting and film, etc. I'm sure the low score attributes I attributed to. It was about chapter 8 before I found interest in this story and I had popcorn that I threw on the screen. Maybe it's a call to the sci-fi crowd? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the whole theater. Isabella Rosselinni tells this movie - the one pleasant aspect of the movie. No one commented on how much they enjoyed it and also appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story. I can't recommend this movie.
