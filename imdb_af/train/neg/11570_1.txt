The intentions of the directors for these films are honorable, but his history of his productions made me aware that it might not be much like the other filmmakers would. keep his big 30-day TV series in mind, but also in his MTV production, "I bet you will do it" she is serious about any of the issues he documents and also reports in his rather disappointing production. "lift me up", I did not. hope high. Unfortunately, this movie has disappointed me. as with an upshare after a while I asked myself what exactly was the point of everything. Clearly, after half an hour, the main statement becomes clear, but the rest of the playtime is filled with rather useless things and repeats things that have already been shown in the movie so it carries out and becomes extremely boring. the end.
