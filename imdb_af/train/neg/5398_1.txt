This self-destructive debris can hit the kibosh on Mr. Branagh's career as an adapter from Shakespeare to the theater. (Released 4 years ago, not an adjustment since then.) I just watched it on the cable - holy God, it's awful. <br /> <br /> I agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said the review of something so clear and sad is terribly an ominous act that suddenly comes across. Having said that, I would take the risk, even if only because * Love's Labor's Lost * is the perfect reward for Overstated Branagh's direct abilities in the past. Branagh has always been a nice director: smart literal-minded; star-struck; unforgivingly ominous to his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but loves himself more and makes sure he gets all the good lines.) Along the lines, the sad fact that * Love's Labor's Verlore * is barely worse than the tireless, horrific, puffed * hamlet * from 1996. In fact, this movie may be preferable, even if it's just about 1/3 the length. Branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of Shakespeare's to Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Yada Yada. So he set the thing in 1939, leaving about an eighth of the text intact in favor of true interpretations of the standards of the Thirties (wait until you see the actors moving on wires to the ceiling during "I'm in heaven") throwing actors who are not known for their dancing or singing (even included). The result is a disaster so surreal that one is dumbfounded that they did not just mention a horrible end to the whole thing after looking at the first daily newspapers. I don't even estimate the role. To paraphrase Hamlet, "The script is the thing!" No one can get out of this hodge podge: the illustrious RSC alumni don't cost better than Alicia Silverstone. Who can possibly do this thing? <br /> <br /> Branagh's first mistake was to think that * Love's Labor's Lost * was a play worth filming. Trust me, it's not. It is an anomaly in the Bard's canon, which is explicitly written for an educated coterie of courtiers - NOT the ordinary audience for which he wrote. Therefore, there are many precious (and VERY!) Word games, references to contemporary scholastic ignorance, parodies of Lyly's * Euphues *. . . In other words, hardly the kind of material to address at a broad audience. Hell, it doesn't appeal to an audience that has already been exposed to the Shakespeare comedy. The play cannot be performed without drastically cutting the text and it is desperately "updated" with any emerging gym. What the question asks, Why bother? <br /> <br /> Branagh's second mistake was to think that Shakespeare's room play of a play could be served with an order from Gershwin's marmalade. It was clear that the idea or hope was to make an unintelligible Elizabethan exercise for modern audiences by giving their nostalgic American pop culture at the same time. But again, it asks the question, why bother? <br /> <br />
