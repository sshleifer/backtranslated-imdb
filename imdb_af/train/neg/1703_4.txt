A Vietnamese veterinarian decides to take an amok in a rest camp, and anyone in his path is eliminated (including women). This action-drama mishmash with Kris Kristofferson's lead, which was born just before a star, was released, thoughtless and common. Filmed in the Simi Valley, CA, the results are truly unwavering, with redneck clich√©s and senseless violence making up most of George Armitage's writing. Armitage collected a most curious 70-year-old film for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters and, in a little while, Loni Anderson; The centerpiece of the whole thing, however, is Kristofferson, who is uncomfortable and rude. It earns points that I suppose to be a completely unsympathetic driver, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) cover the entire project like an ugly spot. * 1/2 of ****
