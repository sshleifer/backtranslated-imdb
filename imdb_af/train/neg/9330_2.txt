Have seen this movie recently and have higher expectations. Not so much based on the director, who previously did not make a cinematographic release, but more based on his cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (starring in Body Double, a masterpiece of Brian De Palma) all played in movies. Not together, and this fact hasn't changed exactly because of this one. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that might make it a bit attractive is the choice of places it was shot at. In my humble opinion, don't waste your time on this one.
