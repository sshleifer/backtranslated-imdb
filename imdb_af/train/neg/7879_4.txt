First, I must say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my 9th grade class and it was wonderful. We also decided to watch the movie be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing for me. The movie cuts out characters and misses many of the main points of the book. It jumps around a lot, and doesn't explain anything in detail. If someone watched this movie without first reading the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie for me was the end. The end in the book was the strongest, and in the movie they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and kind of melting, but the movie seemed to rebel against the pigs. In summary, I do not think that this film caught on the real meaning Orwell portrayed in his book.
