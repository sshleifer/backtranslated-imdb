Why do a show that watched millions of us love and love children and make a full joke? They asked why Hollywood didn't make the money it used. Because they pour out garbage and actors pay huge sums of money to be garbage and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good IL boys are coming up. It wasn't windy, but it was fun. This movie is rubbish! Hollywood can't get anything up, so they take something good and ruin it for a few dollars. I just hope this movie makes 10x less than it costs. The only one who has fun with this crap is the guys that General Lee needs to run. The audience is the victim. <br /> <br /> Don't see it, just look at the reviews of the TV show. They still hold 20 years later.
