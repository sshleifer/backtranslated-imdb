Fixed comedy entertainment, with musical interludes, creates a fast pace that runs badly through a maze of humorous and chiller complications. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong set of sinister villains. The script contains all the standard mystery movie props-sliding panels, secret passages, thunder and lightning and poisoned blow arrows. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre go in for heavy learning and obvious melodramatics of the gaslit era. Kay Kyser and his band presented good entertainment to the people who lived in the 1940s, who tried to forget about the horrors of World War II.
