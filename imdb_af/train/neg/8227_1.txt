I'll keep it fast and sweet. Five girls on their way home from a soccer match decide to take a 'shortcut' that leads them on a deserted forest road. Of course nothing but good things come, and they come safely to their destination. <br /> <br /> Well, they don't. Soon they are being chased by a distorted chick who has serious mental problems, and which is 90 minutes of sheer boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope to never see any of these actors in any movie. Their screaming voices gave me a headache, and the writing was so poorly written that it included many repetitive phrases and nonsense hysterical screams. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror flicks I've ever seen ... and I saw a lot.
