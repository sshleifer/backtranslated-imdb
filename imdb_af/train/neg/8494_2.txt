Expecting a combination of scifi and periodic film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc., was disappointed by these movies that have uncertainty about the pseudoscience and blend of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that his writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a real understanding of the math, technology or history that makes up the film's subject, but rather works of some kind of vague artistic impression of them. It hurts me a lot because I have long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to mislead the scientific terms and ideas to the point of confusion and abusive, for example: Emmy Coer: "Information waves have a half-life", Ada : "I'm not sure half of a life is better than no life." <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than not entertaining - it misinforms. The only redeeming value I can imagine is that it can attract a viewer to learn about the subject that is so distorted. It is more likely, I think, to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any measure, which is impossible of magic.
