After the success of Part 4, another successor was a natural move. However, they had to stop it before it started. Alice, after surviving Part 4, finds her pregnant and it seems Freddy uses her unborn child to get to his victims, of course Alice's friends. Strange Nightmare movie, heavy on religious images and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the movie itself is not.
