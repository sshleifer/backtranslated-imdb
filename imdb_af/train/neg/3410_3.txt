Yes, this movie has kids going to the campsite and it starts well enough, because you met the kids and learn the ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that couldn't possibly exist in 1986, as they have nothing to do with that kind of artificial intelligence. Kid becomes a friend of robot and robot pays the child's friendliness by shooting him and a group of other children in this outer space campsite with a very limited supply of oxygen and radios that cannot reach the signal in space. This camp is also not very nice, as these kids are really trained and get the instructors anywhere in the camp for failed missions or doing the right things. Give it a rest, they are there to have fun, not just to become astronauts, just give them the experience of space flight, not a military camp. However, you get Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role. So, in the end, a movie that in some areas is trying to be realistic, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, you also had the opportunity for the children to fight space strangers, above all in the movie. the movie is a bit nicer to me. Probably also for a few others who would otherwise see Kate Capshaw's face torn apart by a strange super-strange being.
