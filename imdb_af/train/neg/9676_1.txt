Movies have slept before, but no movie has done it twice, so it actually did my three sittings to complete it. The dialogue was bad. Women talk quietly and the men were caricature. And two of the so-called Japanese women looked at Chinese, had Chinese names and spoke with clear Chinese accent. I'm still trying to find out why the Emmental men have sexually wrapped up. 10 min 8 1/2 is a tough choice: Do I give this movie a rating of one? or two? <br /> <br /> Movies have slept before, but no movie has done it twice, so it actually made my three sittings complete.
