Following the success of "Paris, Your T'Aime", a group of directors decided to come together and make a similar anthology style film in New York. Unlike the original movie, the stories in this movie sometimes seem too fast and too fast. By the time you think of a story, it is in too many cases. And, often start and stop and start again - with the stories being woven together. Consequently, there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and that it is less formal in structure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while "Paris, Your T'Aime" hit or miss (mostly hit), most of "New York, I love you" was missing. The stories tended to be much more sexual in nature, but also much less sweet - and often very terrible. It was an incredibly dull and uninteresting movie with just a few extraordinary stories - and perhaps the often depressing music made it look more like it. Now understand, it was good quality music, but its gloomy toes really made me cut my wrists! Among the better people was the story of the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair, and the couple talked about the deception outside a restaurant (although it was also in the first movie) and the old-fashioned old couple. It's so sad because I loved the first movie so much - and I really wanted to love this movie. I respected what they were trying to do but didn't like it much. <br /> <br /> By the way, and it's not really a complaint, but I was amazed at how many people were smoking in the movie. For a recent movie, it was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> Also, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included as extras not included in the movie. One consists of Kevin Bacon (with a cool fedora) who eats a hot dog .... and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes. The other has a teenager who spends the video of the video on the world - including a very unhappy couple.
