It will be the best known for the Ferrari who crashed when Eddie Griffin promoted. <br /> <br /> Racing and betting stories are made poor by the numbers that seem to have a director not the numbers. Largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a salary. It's not a good movie, but it's not bad enough to be vigilant and end up as a few who have nothing worth filming, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that one of the leaders is a woman, Misoginist, this is a film made clear only to get the producer and director near pretty girls. Do you want evidence? There are long, long-lasting shots of women that mean nothing but maybe getting a gig from people who are also afraid to rent a porn or sports illustrated swimwear DVD. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
