In fact, it is a light shadow of High Fidelity, which was a spectacular and wonderful movie with several winning characters. Detecting the detectives has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The prospect of a video store network has wiped its feet through a strange mystery woman, but it is never fully or adequately investigated, thanks to a very poor writing and miscasting of the lead. Not to mention the lack of a real visual story-telling style. I mean, this movie is centered around MOVIES, but it's incredibly immeasurable! However, there is a big problem. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that we just don't care about the main characters, because the writing and the actors (Murphy and Liu) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any way. So the movie is just a series of episodes that include two people that look, well, not terribly interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, another thing: For a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And the romance is also not very romantic. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. Even at its 90-minute minute run, it's just not worth going through.
