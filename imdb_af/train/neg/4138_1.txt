I will be a good movie, because I like zombies and horror movies in general. But I didn't think it would be such a piece as it was. The only zombie in the movie is at the start and he is run by a goddamn car !!! The movie seems to be written by a porn director and filled with porn actors, I will never call them actors! The costumes are stolen from a local school game. It looks like a road movie with almost no monsters. There is no pleasure in this piece, just horror, but not as the director planned. I'd rather be raped by a pedophile than ever to see this movie again !!! ugh!
