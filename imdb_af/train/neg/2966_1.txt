I can't understand all the hype about this movie. OK, if you like cheap plow, you'll love this movie, but if you want good stories and good actors - don't see it. Personally, I didn't like the actors in this movie, they were rented straight from the street. The Dialogs are completely flat and you always know what comes next. The overall quality of this movie is lacking in the initial very low budget. When we saw this movie (me and 3 other people), we all had in mind that this movie was made by some people who needed it, just to get their graduation at a film school - with the lowest effort . Another problem that really reduces the whole experience is the bad camera (very shake) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recovering with a single microphone.
