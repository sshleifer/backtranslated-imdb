... 99 out of 100 times, the producers lied by their teeth (or someone else) to let you rent or buy them mercifully *. <br /> <br /> Shock-O-Rama Cinema proves the truth of this once again with the release of the "Massacre of the Masses", a potentially deliberate but totally dishonest and dishonest entry into the zombie genre . People, it's not just low-budget movies, it's VERY low-budget filmmaking by a lot of people who - I'm sorry, I know they have families they love - will never be In Variety in any meaningful way . It is a baaaaaaaaaad beautiful 'jug, people, and not just because it's cheap. <br /> <br /> The acting is mediocre, but I don't violate the actors; they had no direction. They had no direction, because the script was a half-baked zombie fantasy with no sense of true movie narration. Characterization is at its best thin, no because of poor dialogue and sophistication. Did I mention that the writing and the direction are pretty lame? They are. There is no drama, no tension, no great character moments, nothing. The whole assumption of the government's suppression of the media is on sophomorous "commercial breakage" and an unrammatic story that denies lack of rational analysis and suffocating uncomfortable to his ridiculous rounding. Syd Fields won't be happy. <br /> <br /> How can the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when its reality is visible everywhere? Why would they try to give it more than a curse? On this day and age of wireless mobile phone cameras, which in turn can reach them for more than a day or so? Now, if they cover something, like their own debt .... but "massage the masses," never explore such possibilities. Instead, it lives on absurdity and poorly advanced events to dig for laughter and / or meaning. The audience will not see the near total lack of production value as basic filmmaking. Did anyone pay in this movie? I hope the actors did it, if only for their time on career blind people like this one be wasted; at least, the technicians gained some legitimate work experience. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will get little to get from "Feeding the Masses." The gore is remarkably tame for non-budgets of its rank, and there are no distinguishing pieces or memorable effects. They are actually forgotten. KNB has nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even garbage like the Aussie stillborn "Undead" was miles before the "Massing or Masses." Sorry, guys, back to the signboards and take your misleading marketing with you.
