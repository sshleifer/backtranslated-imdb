I read all these reviews here on how this is such a good movie. Jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty boring. The acting was mostly below average, especially by Mckenna. I didn't see a more pathetic effort to make someone a badass in a movie. Oh man, this movie was a decay. I also read somewhere it could be a cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just an average piece of film. <br /> <br /> The screenplay was paralyzed, mostly the play was lame, this movie was lame. <Br /> <br /> Yes, pray for the man who was in Cheers earlier. He really looks bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably the man in Office Space, and he was in this movie about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
