Hunters chase what they think is a man in the bush, although the audience sees him as a werewolf. The hunters never seem to realize it, because after they shot him, it seems normal when they get over him. <br /> <br /> A doctor transplanted the wolf's eyes to a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment. The man, Rich, gets sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before he even removes his bonds. <br /> <br /> After leaving the hospital, he found that his wife had also deceived him. When a smoker passes clouds past an amateur painting of a moon (with a false tree branch in the foreground), he becomes a werewolf! His upper body becomes larger, his shirt is divided and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in his eyes. His pants remain intact. The mouth chewing indisputably, although some kind of robotics (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows sometimes gives him a resounding look. <br /> <br /> In spite of the poor voluptuous costume, there is a good amount of blood and gore, and it's done pretty well. There is even a pretty good deal later in the movie. But when a man falls from a height, a little bad dummy does the job. <br /> <br /> Rich has a friend named Siodmak, who is a kind of occult expert and accidentally falls over a little man with crutches called Androse who is also such an expert. They are trying to help him a little. <br /> <br /> Empire kills people who've done wrong. A policewoman is investigating the murders and trying to hit Beaton. He doesn't care much about lesbian scene, so nothing comes from it. <br /> <br /> Very cheap but between the nudity and blood and gore, and a non Terrible story combines (kind) The most dangerous game with the hands of Orlac and the Wolf Man, this is somewhat entertaining. Available on its own, or in the box, set Scream Queens Vol. 1.
