I honestly had some high expectations when I started watching the movie, but it was probably one of the most boring movies I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> First, the pace is incredibly slow, so it looks much longer than it is (and it's not short). I'm sure when Jane Austen wrote the book, she made it a few pages long, filled it with description and didn't want to read to people. One day, or it can drag and drop the appeal, which "Emma" certainly did. Now, "Sense and Sensibility" has had this slow-paced error, but at least it had lively lines to make it up, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> This brings me error 2, That is, of course, acting. While I'm not really making anyone in this movie, I'm sure they can do good work, but I haven't seen much in this movie. It was as if people were trying too hard to be too greasy to be "top class", too hard to be British (well, some of them) so they all just came down as a lot of actors and not as people <br /> <br /> # 3. The cast, as I said, was just like actors, and not really like the people they play. Maybe it's a good thing, because the people they really played were not so nice. Why does everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich, attractive people in front of them, but she was a terrible gossip behind their backs. If her friends were ugly, she didn't even bother to go behind their backs. So why is this girl so good? Why do people have to tell stories, "just to make her laugh?" Of course, the snob can't do it right. I had enough trouble with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" didn't change my mind. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I don't care about this one. I'm sure it's a lovely book and everything, but some books aren't really meant to be made for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
