Chilly, alienation from the adaptation of Rebecca West's army captain's book returning from World War II service with his memory disability (now there is an original idea!). He seems to remember the old flame Glenda Jackson, but not the current woman, Julie Christie, who must be enough to pick up some emotional sparks. The extremely well-spoken soap brings Alan Bates, the leading man, with director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the waves are all low. There are a handful of good scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but Bridges' pacing is incessantly slow and endured with the film's filmed color. For a long time, this "soldier" forgets the forgotten forgotten. * 1/2 of ****
