I have never understood the appeal of this show. The play is poor (Debra Jo Rupp is a notable exception), the parts of most episodes are thin and uninspiring, the dialogue is poor, the jokes are indecent and it is painful to try to even half an episode sit down. Furthermore, the connection between this show and the '70s' is extremely tough outside the style of the dress and the scenery and backdrop used for the show. It looks nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old, unknown, clich√© scripts that modern sitcoms dressed as a show twenty years ago in the hope that it will get nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch as opposed to this terrible, pathetic excuse for a show.
