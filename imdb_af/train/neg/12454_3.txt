Here I read posts about Wonder Woman's costume for this TV movie. It should be pointed out at the time the movie was made, she didn't wear her traditional outfit. The producers were actually captured by the comic book writer at the beginning of the seventies. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie itself is concerned, I have to agree with many of the other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a kid when it appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was at the right age to appreciate a comic book movie. Yet I was so busy with the plot, I watched it in the movie for three quarters. <br /> <br /> Of course, I wasn't at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
