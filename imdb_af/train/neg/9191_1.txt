Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after I thought about this puddle. Why? Because I have to make it known to you all, just how bad this movie is. It's incredibly bad. Just to let you know how bad it is, I'll give this little detail about the movie. During screens of chaos, which usually consist of people shooting or kicking zombies, they cut screens from the video game. Yes, you heard my right. This movie really sucks. In fact, this reminds me of the fact that it costs ten dollars these days to just come to the theaters. And to see how wheat is filled like this? There is no story to talk about and the movie basically has nothing but the occasional boob shot and really cheap death. I'm very disappointed about this, knowing I was watching. OK, I'm dumbstruck. It's so bad I can't even find the words. RATING: Zero from *****.
