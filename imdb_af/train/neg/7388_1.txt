drss1942 really took the words straight out of my mouth. I loved Segal's early films and felt like the only one still faithful to him. I just saw this movie (ok, I fell asleep 90%, so I didn't see the end). When I woke up and saw I was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I was no longer subject to the movie and did not dare to find out what happened at the end. There was something strange about the voice of Segal and others. Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Max where the voice was baptized, but in the same language (Australlian is English, right?) Anyway, if I had 10 inches, they would all be about to do this Segal injustice.
