The director Sidney J. Furie has created a postmodern, absurd masterpiece in Hollow Point that challenges challenges and constantly surprised the public. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to ask the question what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterization' when you remove the crutches of 'motivation' and 'reason'. <br /> <br /> The result leads me to say that my opinion of him may not be higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this movie makes sense, the law enforcement agencies are unattractive and the organized criminals are full of insane.
