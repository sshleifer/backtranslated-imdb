"Transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant but sometimes funny and atmospheric mid-80's horror parody with some famous names in the movie and a handful of real opportunities to complain in the screenplay. Two bozo journalists from a gossipy tabloid newspaper are often sent to Transylvania for a story about the alleged return of the mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some beautiful little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film, like a little guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes used to put cream and sugar into the breakfast table. However, the sound of the film is not as successful as it could and should have been, with jokes and parody situations that are too long. The Roger Corman production "Transylvania Twist", which came out four years later, is much harder and much more recommended. The movie is parodying the classic Universal milestones of the early 30's, so make sure you have seen it if you want to understand all the little gags and references. There is a fairly original twist indicating that the Frankenstein character behaves just like a malicious evil scientist when he enters his lab. It has also been revealed that he is actually more of a Father Damien kind of messiah who is only concerned about the condition of the exile of monsters. Michael Richards, the freaky man who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, dies as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I'm pretty sure John Turturro's character in "Mr. Deeds" is inspired by Richards's role here.
