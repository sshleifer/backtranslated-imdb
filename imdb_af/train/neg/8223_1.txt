Definitely, the worst movie I've ever seen, no questions asked! Conflicters of this opinion can argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others, as it is an independent, low-budget movie, but is it? amateurism and slender innovation are frightening. <br /> <br /> Agree with everything that was said about this movie, for example, the thoughts that are weak are acting (when it's so bad, you take another shot to shoot, goddamn it ), the thing that I found most annoying was the total lack of common sense in writing, assuming such a thing existed during production. There was a clear absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers, the girls switched personalities a few times and they showed absolutely no sense of any rationality or even brain - five relatively fit girls against a light female psychopath? ? gang on her, why don't you? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered somewhat of a conquest for this title is that the camera does not leave any time, so the viewer sees everything from inside - what is, like the rest of the movie, a good idea exponentially terribly executed. <br /> <br /> ?? and overwhelmingly, this movie is nothing like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a handheld camera? it is an effect and not a trait! It is cleverly used, but it can be awesome, but in this case it is an excuse for inadequate cinematography.
