It's not a bad movie ... but it's the kind your girlfriend shows you. The story is not bad ... it only lasts one and a half hours. It's hard for me to dirty this movie because I really like the idea, but it was just too long and thin on the story ... too bad. The main character doesn't actually look that much from beginning to end. I mean, go through something "life change" and he can barely break a smile. I really thought Mac was really good. His strange peculiarity hampered the movie to be a complete disaster. Maybe I just didn't "get" this movie. If anyone can explain it to me, I'd like to be informed.
