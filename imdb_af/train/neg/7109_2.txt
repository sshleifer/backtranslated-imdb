Now I understand. The title refers to every member of the audience's immediate aftermath of 68 minutes of spiritual torture. Try too hard to be scary, have a good dialogue, even any fear of the matter, make the Scream Skull more like a snore. Although the house and property in black and white suggest a dark tone for the movie, it's about it. The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on it! Remember the coffin guarantee in the beginning? It could be the funniest thing I've ever seen on the screen. The bad thing is that viewers are probably hoping that director Alex Nichol has been put in a coffin by force, nailed, and buried alive for his lame attempt. Jenny, who is placed in this horrible horrible situation, never really sympathizes with what you will feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a ghostly cranial container. Also, her husband, John, comes down as a patronizing wannabe smooth talk, but it doesn't work and he ends up proving how difficult he is by beating a helpless cripple! Oh, Mickey? The days before you could get a punitive order against estate guards like him. This man's approach is not very good, or maybe too much aircraft glue. Yet, despite his peculiarity, Mickey is probably the only good thing for this movie that offers a slight sense of entertainment and I can't get enough of a guy who says, "This was Mary!" and rummage through pots in a greenhouse.
