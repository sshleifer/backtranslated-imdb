My God. This movie was terrible. I can't complain too much. I went to see it, just to be pulled out. It has become enough, kind of. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was at the very beginning where the woman was forced to give a terribly mutated baby. <br /> <br /> I also think it's funny that most notable actor in the movie was the Spanish soldier, who was a supporting actor next Friday. Everyone in the movie did a horrible working job. It was one of the worst values ​​I've ever paid to see. <br /> <br /> I also expected it to be much more horrible than the first one. It wasn't. I expected it to be more horrible because it is a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually far less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more horrible, since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie this time (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but it was not as horrible as the first one . was another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing, but the filmmakers tried so hard to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also have the whole concept of showing the clip of the female soldier's son on her camera phone: "I love you, Mom" ​​FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to try to make us feel even TRUE for by showing it three times without reason. This movie was a joke.
