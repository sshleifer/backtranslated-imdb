The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought, "Oooh, it's getting interesting" a few times. Nevertheless, the interesting plot lines are inexplicably or ignored, as they never did. The main character was annoying throughout the movie, and at one point I was fella and I both shouted that we wanted her to die. There are a few ghostly / scary moments, but it is overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed me of hell. This is another of those horror movies that arouse and intrigue you for a while, but ultimately leave you frustrated and a little confused about what the filmmakers are trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy, but if the bath is more fun than the main character you know, you're on a loser.
