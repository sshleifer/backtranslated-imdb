A doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplant is secretly experimenting on corpses of hospital with varying success. His final best chance comes when he loves folding his girl's head in his jacket because he saves it from a burning vehicle. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese and with this premise I believed I found it. It has all the bad movie hunters - chest and brain surgery with the surgeons who leave with pristine white scrubs, unique camera angles (I like to always watch the rear passenger wheels of cars), cheese-like clarinet troop music and one of the longest death scenes in movie history . But unfortunately, these bad-good moments cannot overcome the too bad stink slips. <br /> <br /> Jan in the Pan irritated me with her drunken monologues in a whisper whisper, the slightly less than the evil laugh, and the fact that she was kept alive with some Colombian home baker coffee and 2 DD batteries. <br /> <br /> I couldn't even entertain myself with Dr Bill's terribly persuasive and moral self-righteousness. Usually such a ham makes the movies I think I should see. In this case, I was bored. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best part of the movie was the 1960s version of body shopping and I even cut it off. <br /> <br /> Don't spend money on this one - there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor.
