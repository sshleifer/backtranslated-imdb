Half of the reviews were good, so I had a chance for $ 10. Sure Priscilla Barnes had chats, but it wasn't much. The whole plot later that she might be the other actress mom and documentary author for the young woman, stretch it. It's not funny, it's not so racial, it's nothing but a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult industry. It's based on nothing that ever happened in the industry. It could have been shocked by what is popular today in adult movies that mock today's gono videos and that big orgy they had 5 minutes to shoot that did a joke a bigger orgy bigger and better decades ago in the early 1970s .
