I'm still trying to determine if the previous installment was worse than this one, or vice versa. Since it's been almost fifteen years since I saw this movie, the fact that I remember so little about it is not well spoken. Maybe it's just because I just watched it once or twice, but I doubt it. If something was worth remembering about this movie, rest assured that I would remember it. <br /> <br /> By the time this movie was released, the franchise continued to penetrate its stalemate, so much media coverage was provided. It is never a good sign when teen pop magazines contain explanations of the basics. One such article had to explain that Freddy was left too weak to infect adult dreams, and so he decided to go to Alice's unborn son. So far, so well, but it is the work of the author or director to explain to the audience. It should not be left to some unrelated publication. <br /> <br /> Use the trivia given in part three about Freddy's conception. One can expect half the scene that this joke from the "abomination for babies" category will lift. But, unfortunately, it wasn't to be. It's about the mere idiot of the American rating system that a piece of B'harni dirty garbage like this can get the same appreciation as a really scary piece like the original. <br /> <br /> By now, the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you see it, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting. Or maybe she just looks competent compared to the rest of the cast. Anyway, since her last role in something called The All New Adventures of Chastity Blade, she doubts she's going to have anything else for her. Even poor old Robert Englund is in better productions than in the past fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Given that the return of the cash register was a steady decline and not just for this franchise, at the time thought the studios would realize that they were nudging their films, making them no longer salable. In fact, this particular film, such as its immediate predecessor, was so neutral that it could not just draw a new audience. Both managed to alienate the core that originally supported the franchise. In spite of this, part five must get credit because they do not have the bright, luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at. <br /> <br /> I gave a nightmare on Elmstraat Part Five, one in ten. By trying to appeal to everyone, or the MPAA's idea of ​​everyone, it manages to address no one. Like parts two and four, one can completely erase it from continuity, and no one will see the difference.
