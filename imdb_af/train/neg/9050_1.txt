I saw this movie in the 1960s and 70s, yes it's horrible and can be the ancestor of the "Faces of Death" series popular in the 80s and 90s. Considering the state of the so-called driver training these days, this one must be required for anyone preparing to learn to manage. If you see violent death in all its abominations, you will definitely (if at all feel it) get a better perspective on the responsibilities needed to drive safely, which can do one moment of ingratitude or inattention to the wheel. I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70's and 80's, and at one point there was a security class. I found this film in the company library, showed it during the session, a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them later said, "I never knew a car accident could be so terrible!" This film, and another, 'RED ASPHALT', is definitely the reality in its most graphic form. I will never forget, I just wish I could have got a copy when my kids attended "driver's ed" at high school!
