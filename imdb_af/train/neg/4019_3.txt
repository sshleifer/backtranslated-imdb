Dakota (1988) was an early Lou Diamond Phillips lead. This film is similar to the later released film Harley. There are some differences, but they are both the same. I don't know which one came first. I think it will be one of the riddles of life. But they are both upset "kids" trying to turn there. Instead of bikes, this one includes horses. They are basically the same movie and they are both cheesy like hell. If you have a serious L.D.P. fan, I recommend you both look at them. You get some extreme concern from L.D.P. if you are a game then go for it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended except for L.D.P. supporters !!!
