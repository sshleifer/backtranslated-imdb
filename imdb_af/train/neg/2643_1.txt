This because of a lack of a better term, the movie is common. Where do I start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemahotography - This was perhaps the worst I saw this year. It looked as if the camera man's camera was thrown to the camera man. Maybe they just had one camera. It gives you the feeling of a volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of scenes, random, thrown in without any continuity. When they did the split screen, it was absurd. Everything was flat, it looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The color tones were far away. These people need to learn how to balance a camera. This movie was badly done and badly done. <br /> <br /> The plot - You must sheep. If I were an SS agent, I would sue the producers. Like the Marks brothers with radios and guns. Sutherland was in his '24' mode - I can see it for free. Eva Longoria would have been better off with a little less, and more. As an action bimbo she wasn't much. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see a real plot except Douglas holding the President's wife. Never said why the mercenaries were trying to kill the preserve. I just don't see the United States president running for life in the utility tunnels of a building like a rats in a maze. p-l-e-a-s-s. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie is the proof. I like the big screen. Since then I have been a child. Much more 'movies' like this and I'll stop. As far as Hollywood is concerned, so many chicks have made, forget about making a real movie? If I own a theater, I start running the old movies. The one with real actors, good story lines - and good Cinemaphotography. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is a dog. Don't waste your time or money on it. I rate this movie a zero! Douglas is not fit for this role. I can consider his age, but she's just too much of a wimp to wear it off.
