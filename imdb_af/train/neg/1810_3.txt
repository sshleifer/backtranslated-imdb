Think of this movie as a Saturday morning live action program of centuries ago. Even the little ones will find this one difficult because it runs like molasses! I can't fully understand how awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too many warrior wizard movies used out there have used the same old plot line many times, but it is mighty scarce considering the appeal to small darlings. And who in the world would have thrown a topless mermaid in the first place? I thought it was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another great jewel for your 1999 TV season!
