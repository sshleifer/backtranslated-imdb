Soldier Blue is a film with pretensions: predictions to be a kind of profound statement about man's inhumanity to man, about the white man's exploitation and brutality towards indigenous peoples; a biting, infallible and sardonic comment on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, sorry, but it failed to be any of those things. What Soldierblou actually is is malicious, urgent, badly done, dishonest junk. <br /> <br /> Another judge hit the nail by saying that it seems to be a hybrid of two completely different movies. What it is basically is a lame, clich√©, poorly activated "strange couple" novel. Strauss and Bergen conquer their prejudice about the other's lifestyle and fall in love (ah, blessing) - recorded by two sickening bloodbaths that would not have been <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the repulsive, prurient, gore-drenched climax, in which cute little indigenous American children are suddenly screwed, cut, demolished, and kept in love and graphic close-up, and grandma-indigenous American women are molested, raped and uprooted - no excuse, that is, except the box office. (The massacre itself, while repulsive in its misplaced intent, was heavily staged and shot; a bunch of actors who walked around with bright red paint that had been smeared on them, with some special effects ranges of decapitation / disassembly - which contained real amputee they used filming. Now that's what I call exploitation.) <br /> <br /> Forget about all the porridge you've heard (including the ridiculous comments the movie starts and ends) about being a " protest is "a charge of American brutality against the indigenous peoples. This movie doesn't give a bunch about the state of the Cheyenne; If it did, it would include some American characters who would like to get to know and care for the nameless, faceless innocents slaughtered at the peak. Instead we get the stupid white bread romance from Bergen and Strauss (both turbulent actors), with lots of blood, bowels and cut heads that are thrown in to attract curiosity. <br /> <br /> Which is a terrible shame because there is a movie to be made about the Sand Creek massacre, about all the real life killings the US (and Britain, and all the so-called "civilized") nations) participated over the centuries?). It's just not that movie.
