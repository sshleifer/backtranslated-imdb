There is a very good film that lies just below the surface of the layers on low cheese which is the "Pagemaster". <br /> <br /> I found it when I looked back this morning after neglecting it for years and years. I remember hating it with a passion when it first came out, but this time I found that the special effects were pretty good. The plot is just the "Neverending Story" with a creativity endktomy, but it is a good little movie for anyone who just wants a great eye-candy. The animation is incredible, and I especially liked how the animators look their characters and act a little more surreal than the norm. I give it a grade of three as I would have given it as a two (just for parody value) if I ever decided to watch this movie and expect it to make my mind judicious.
