You can think of it with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter that this movie would have been much better. Unfortunately, the movie is hard to believe in characters, as well as a large plot problem that seems to make some of the characters seem. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Ingrid Bergman who will work for the Stoddard family. Everything is so peachig and swell - the family welcomes Bergman and things cannot be perfect. Well, this is until the mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market falls in 1907 (the family's fortune erase) and Bergman is forced to return to France. This part of the movie is a bit tough but not bad. <br /> <br /> Later, after the family's fortune improved, Bergman returned. The four boys are now all grown and there is really no conceivable reason why they will hire her again as a governor. But, briefly, everything is swelling again. But when WWI takes place, the four are all going to war - gosh! In the middle of this, one of the sons (David) brings his new wife (Susan Hayward). Miss. Hayward's character is as black and white as the others, although while they are all good and swell, she is, of course, a horn devil. To make things worse, she came into the family's home, while David was in the war. <br /> <br /> Now here is where the movie really gets stupid - brain-like silly. Hayward starts a relationship with one of David's brothers, but if the dad sees a silhouette of the lovers, Bergman comes into another room's room and suggests it's her, not Hayward with Jack! WHY ?! Why would a healthy person do it to save the buttocks of a clear malicious woman? This was exactly the kind of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the gutter once and for all. It is just a case of lousy writing and makes me angry ... and probably did the same in 1941 to the audiences. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is a failed event after failed opportunity for Hayward's anger to be exposed. It just flies against common sense and makes the movie a silly melodramatic mess. However, as expected, the truth eventually comes out and everyone swells again. --- Happy to be a great, lovely wonderful family, minus the slut, Hayward. <br /> <br /> The film is suffering from poor writing. Hayward's relationship did not make sense - at least how it was dealt with. And with characters that are so good or evil (with nothing in between), this movie sinks to the level of a two-day soap. The only thing that saves it all is acting --- they tried to try the best with a turgid script. That's enough to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who made this movie were hit with a dead chicken!
