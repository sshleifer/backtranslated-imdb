Spending time watching this movie was wasting time. I don't like science fiction. I do not reject any genre per se, as good work can be done in any genre. However, this movie is not good work. I can't blame the displays (when it comes to strange makeups), and the special effects are impressive. The story wasn't out-of-and-out BAD, for a trekkish comic book. But the fx footage was, of course, where all the makers' interest / attention / money went. The direction varies between slow and confusing (one was certainly not exactly what did and with what and to whom at least one critical time had). The "acting" was mostly very bad indeed. There was no basis for most of the line readings, except a hint of "It was so on the page and the director told me I was angry / sad / scared / whatever. Well, so, it was" An SF series pilot has been an excuse for correct clumsiness in areas where it has to be considered essential for a dramatic medium, and I'm surprised the pilot sold the series, or the money is also in the hands of technerds?
