Unfortunately, I have to agree with the critic written by Halope. <br /> <br /> For a short movie, cinematography, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else are great. Initially, it looks surprising, but I told you that the technical crew that worked on it consisted of professionals so the quality could be expected. The problem is as usual in the story itself. <br /> <br /> Thing is, it's not really a story. To tell a story (or in the case of the movie, show a story), you need plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the main character: events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason he can't get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. He is a kind of supernatural entity that man observes. That's it. So what we have here is a pure outline. Instead of being a story, we simply learn things about this Tim Watcher individual. Of course, taking into account the peculiarity of Tim Watcher and the short duration of the movie, it's difficult to get enough background on him, so the movie switches to Voice-Over Narration. In this case, it is used in the worst possible way to provide information that we will never pick up. In fact, if it wasn't for the VO, we'd think the character was just a crazy old man who was going to look at things. To make matters worse, the VO also explains what happens on the screen! The images we have shown are just adornments for the text we are listening to. <br /> <br /> I can say that this short movie would make a good video for a band or something, but because the images aren't "It's impossible to say it. Of course, what remains is a measure of the crew's technical abilities (not incredible, but good), but fails to entertain, entertain, excite or at least show a story.
