I regularly comment on the absolute dirth of truly scary movies on the market. Unfortunately, White Noise has only served to reduce my belief that the film industry is still capable of doing so. I was surprised to find that I was becoming more and more tired as the plot wore and my static-induced headache increased. I found White Noise to stay by as our best efforts to suspend unbelief. Even after experiencing Michael Keaton's imperial trial, I was totally unaffected by his demise. To the credits I was eagerly waiting for something - anything - to commit myself to the characters' story, but such relief never came. Certainly, there were occasional heartbeats, but only because loud noises tend to do so on the sniper. <br /> <br /> While the play was lame, Michael Keaton could have played his latest role. Perhaps the only redeeming quality White Noise offers is the impressive architecture in both Keaton's residences. In general, White Noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are guarded in a world preserved by three malicious shadows, and try to deceive life into following the dead to their own graves.
