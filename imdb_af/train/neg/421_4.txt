My title above says it all. Let me make it clear. If you saw the BBC's "Planet Earth", which I guess most of you have, then you won't have this movie too much. And I own all the discs of "Planet Earth". I saw the rating for this movie very high and read good reviews about it. I was excited to watch it out. <br /> <br /> Oh, I went to the theater and started the movie. I've seen it's a Disney movie with production companies offering BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first screens over the polar bear, I recognized them from my DVDs at "Planet Earth" home. <br /> <br /> The movie continued and continued, and again and again, me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all of the "planet earth". <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed because I think 90% of the footage is "Planet Earth". I say 90% because some of the screens I didn't recognize. I have the feeling that I simply didn't remember them. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, this film is a compilation of different footage of the various "Planet Earth" slides, with a narrative aimed at children. Yes, the narrative is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they leave the cubs from the mother cub, the narrator says, "The cats are not like human children. They don't always listen to their mothers" (I don't remember the exact words, but that's how it is ) So in a nutshell. It's abbreviated "Planet Earth" for kids!
