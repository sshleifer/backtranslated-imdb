This is the most clever and worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Every scene is worthy and the two main players - Corey and Danny are so annoying. Corey was very stupid and naive and had never listened to Danny's fake promises. <br /> <br /> Neve Campbell and Urban Legend's killer are the only redeeming features in this poor effort to make a movie. Danny (Dean Paras) looks in his late thirties and the girl he's trying to bed - Corey looks like she's still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this movie is called Too Smooth; There is nothing at all about this movie. 1/10 Avoid
