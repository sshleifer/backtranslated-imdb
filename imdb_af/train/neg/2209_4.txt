If you read my review of SyFy's "Dinoshark", you know that I appreciate the low budget clause that these television movies can offer. They're stupid ... they're stupid ... but they're pretty nice in a "so bad, that's good" kind of way. So, blamed for the so-called (and recommended) unmistakable Hokey "Dinoshark", I sat down to watch "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", a SyFy Original movie about a half-man, half-haired monster that people terrorize an island. With the SyFy Channel's sure-fire recipe for creating B-movie creatures and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it actually misses the point ... not much, but enough to make me recommend. Why? Well, first, his titular monster, the dreaded hammerhead human hybrid, takes a backyard to a bunch of faux military thugs who have really become the movie's primary villain. Although the hammerhead picks up the body composition, he (or whatever you call the thing) just comes to hug and go straight ahead. The rest of the movie is stuffing, defeating our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. It is not so compelling for me to see a hammock head! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
