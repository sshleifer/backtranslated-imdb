Well, on the endless quest for abomination, we will overcome this movie, apparently released on DVD for some wicked reasons. The transmission is terrible and the quality just sucks. I don't think it's due to a bad remaster or anything. I just think the movie was bad. It's obvious that it was filmed on an abandoned school with a budget that was undoubtedly wasted on cheap beer and No talent hacks, "High Slaughter" started slowly and didn't take up to about an hour. First, we get a 'nerd' as he is picked up by a group of ... I really don't 'I even know what they were supposed to be ... jocks? The ringleader, with his ultra-achnose, is so ugly that he should definitely be thrown into the nerd. Then there is a "big man" and a few stupid losers and chicks who are supposed to be "hot" but not. It's a mystery why this group picks up rejections on one of their own, but I think the viewer is to accept it is "cool kids" picking up a mop. The decisive choices are terrible, as most of the high school players are played thirty-thirty. As other reviewers pointed out, the actors (if you can call them) are a bunch of Brits, whose accents go through the crap many times. We must assume that this group of children is the only student at this school, as their 'reunion' is just their school, which is now leaving, they are just them. <br /> <br /> Death is lame, the gore is not big and the writing is like Scooby Doo with real people. lines like: "This place gives me the creep ..." and "Someone gives a beer a highlight ... It's just not good. Skip this one, unless you're wiped out with some friends and want to make a nice effort at a treasurer. If you want to see well, Bava's "Bay of Blood" gets done 14 years earlier and a lot better. If you want to see a good BAD scraper, see "Just before Dawn" or "The Burning." 2 out of 10, kids.
