I see that the previous reviewer (who still stays at school) has given this movie a very good review and I can only assume that this is because the judge did not see the far-exceptional 1989 adaptation of this classic novel. The biggest problem I had with this version (1999) was the decisive Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy who became famous after appearing in the TV mini series "The Choir". I can only assume that he was cast for the role of Tom Long on the basis of his excellent play in The Choir. Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in The Choir, by now, grew "Tom's Midnight Garden" into a long and gang youth, and as such, Anthony was not convinced as a schoolboy Tom. It's too far from the imagination to believe that Tom (as played by Anthony) will befriend the far younger Hatty. In the 1989 version of the BBC, Tom and Hatty are much closer to age and the development of their friendship is so much more credible. For a 1999 movie, even the special effects are not convinced and there is no noticeable improvement on the 1989 TV effects. The decisive and acting version of this version is inferior to the early adaptation and overall the movie was a brilliant version of a true classic. As a final comment, I would point out that the 1989 BBC version of the VHS fetches more than £ 20.00 second-hand, while a new DVD of this version can be purchased for less than £ 5.00, I have to say?
