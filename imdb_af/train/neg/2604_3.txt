Doppelganger has his moments, but they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it's a B-blend of pop-psych thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family was murdered and she was at least one of the main suspects), or did she just disorder a lot of personality? George Newbern is her new roommate, and most of the action is on him. <br /> <br /> Newbern's character is pretty sympathetic, and both he and Barrymore do decent work (though not exactly right). The mediocre (sometimes temporary) scary writing and the unbeatable direction combined to make the rest of the performances sink into oblivion. Leslie Hope's character is memorable, but so annoying that you will forget her. <br /> <br /> The plot finally ends in a bifurcated (one story arch is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) foreign climax that so poorly designed, acted and photographed that it was most of the value the film had previously achieved effectively counteract. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film has the feel of what can be expected to be the result of M. Knight Shamalyan's first. undergraduate film class. The acting and the script for the two leaders are just good enough to give you a little - at least until the film completely and completely disappears. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your dapper but avoid a first person encounter.
