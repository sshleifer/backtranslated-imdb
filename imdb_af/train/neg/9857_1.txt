I just finished watching this movie and I found it was basically not funny at all. <br /> <br /> I'm a RPG Gamer (computer type, not one of the DnD desktop), but I didn't get any of the jokes. in this funny at all. <br /> <br /> Some of the screens seemed to have been a lot (tilt and zoom could be cut down to 5 seconds rather than a minute) and it felt like the director was trying to fill in time . <br /> <br /> I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The acting itself was not so bad, the standard that a B Grade movie should have. <br /> <br /> I suggest not to save this movie unless you are a big DnD fan and even then it will probably be best to remove it.
