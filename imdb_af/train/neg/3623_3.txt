(aka: BLOOD CASTLE OF SCREAM OF THE DEMON) <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> It was a drive-in feature, along with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production, where a series of women are murdered in a town at the same time, sees a domestic score by the name of Yanos Dalmar, on horseback, with his "man-eating" dog behind him. <br /> <br /> The townspeople already suspect that he is the one behind everything and wants his castle to be burned down. The murders only started around time. Count Yanos's older brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was terribly burned and killed in a laboratory accident. <br /> <br /> Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) who hired Igor to help his death appeared in his experiments. Yanos agrees to rent her instead of his brother and together they find the formulas for regenerating dead cells. Yanos wants to revive Igor's charred body. <br /> <br /> Of course, Igor still lives (though terribly burnt) and stalking and killing the women in town. We see that his discolored face appears at several points in the film so we know he's still alive, so the whole thing looks a little too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor meets another fierce end when he enters a fight with Yanos over Ivanna, with the burning candles falling on the same bed, after which Igor stumbles, and meets another final discolored end. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source. and looks very grainy and bad. Unlike a scraper, no extra extras are included. Although it has a beautiful, creepy Spanish castle and good atmosphere, I have found it to be rather boring and predictable, with no excitement or mystery. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
