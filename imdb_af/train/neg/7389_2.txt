I buy or watch at least every Seagall movie. He came out with a handful of good movies and then crashed into bad stories, working bad camera and a penetrating person, he almost lost me. A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he's forgotten again. This movie is seriously dark (at any level you give to mention). There is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no observable purpose unless it is used as a warning against the army. <br /> <br /> Seagall has had a stand-in for many of its scenes, as it was often too dark to tell and the other's voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was the bad man who had killed his guard to escape detention and then went on to collect devastation all over the place. Good since when did we put an armed guard in the room with a prisoner? Anyway, this bad man was at least colorful and very focused. There are many gores if you want that king of the thing. It seemed to me that the bad parents had torn the same gas every time. I'm just glad they didn't suck the blood of their fearless victims. I'll get you back to my summary. Actually, it's a horror movie disguised as an action film.Dec 6,2006
