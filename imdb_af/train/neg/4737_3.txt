I loved the first "Azumi" movie. I got me. Ueto seen in a variety of her TV appearance and I saw my fair share of samurai and ninja movie. I must say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Given the movie's cast and essay in "Azumi", they had to do a lot better work with this movie. but instead it was slow, broken in parts and sprinkled with very poor, unconvincing and woodworking. <br /> <br /> When they first hit the movie, they did it in a way that was pretty loose. and weak. In "Azumi" the title character is the best of a group of superior killers. In "Azumi 2" it looks somehow diminished and less impressive. <br /> <br /> That's not to say it was a total loss. There were some decent fighting scenes and some over-the-top characters. Unfortunately, the film is generally due to the fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The latter two really captured the "manga" feeling in their screenplay while the former never succeeded.
