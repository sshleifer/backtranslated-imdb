This show was absolutely horrible. Because one George is not funny, and his children are sneaky little brats. He also treated his mother without respect. As a Spanish, I am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed. <br /> <br /> Plus the dysfunctional family thing has been killed. For once I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other programs have done it millions of times? I thought ABC would come to his senses and pull this piece of garbage out of the air, but unfortunately we have to stomach it until they jump the shark. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, they have already done so.
