Pretty awful but viewable and entertaining. It's the same old story (if you've lived through the 80's). Vietnam veterinarians fight back together as friends against injustice in the states. A team meets Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time goes on, the soldiers go home, and years later a friend is in trouble. No, wait - the friend is dead and it's his father in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is murdered by an extremely frightening meat maker when he tries to defend his father's small local "protective" gang in spite of being born of war. Desperate for help, the father talks to Sarge, the leader of Joey's old unit from Vietnam, when Sarge appears for the funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the squeaky wheel gets the fat, and the old gang gets up for the city. You can imagine most of the rest of the movie pretty much. <br /> <br /> The one thing that got me was that Sarge is planning his men and how they are really good at what they do when they plan ahead. But Joey would not have been in a wheelchair in the first place through a Vietnam shooting if the unit did not run around! Then, when things go really well in the city while they fight the gangs, they do it again. For no reason whatsoever completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present. PHH !!!! I disgust my hands. Foolishness! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious moment when all the current members of the unit make sure they eradicate heroin from the gang to make sure it's real. EVERY single one of them. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Keep looking, I think. The movie is not too horrible to watch, but it is a plague. There are all these climbing moments when nothing really excites. The most dramatic happenings are those at the start of the movie - the explosives in Vietnam, Joey's death struggle, and the gang who kicks an innocent teddy bear (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I guess my main beef with this movie, I feel lowered. Even the confusing subplots with "mystery helpers" and their bizarre cross-motives were not enough to save it at the end. But someday, maybe it will be right and they will make a successor. Ha ha ha ha !!!
