This movie is terrible. Give me the dentist every time! Can you believe that one of the most important TV stations here in Arabia had it as their Christmas movie! I can only assume they expected to entertain the crowd with Dudley Moore rather than it. The last time I looked at my hot water bottle, it had more acting, better plot, more drama and more interest than this celluloid waste. Don't even see if you're drunk!
