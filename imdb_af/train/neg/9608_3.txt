Man, how hell were the people who made this movie? And more importantly where can I get? The opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman who burns naked in a circle, changing into a werewolf. And it's not a Rick Baker "American werewolf" transformation, people. We're talking about the worst makeup ever captured on film here. I can only suggest a stoned Italian glue on the naked Annik Borel (which Daniela plays, the movie's appearance (is it a word?)) And ask her to roll in fur. That's how bad it is. <br /> <br /> It doesn't get much better from here. Minutes are wasted as theatrical art chewing male actors, waffle over Daniela and her condition or something (I can't remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh at it.) <br /> <The funny thing is Daniela is not even a werewolf, she is a psycho who goes spiritually when there is a man (understandable, as she was raped). She thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor (the opening scene). She can't help tearing the throat of everyone she meets, and she just wants to love! Things start looking for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buffalo stuntman who doesn't run her episodes. Take a look at the fitting here, one of the cutest things you'll ever see (laughing and hugging the dive head first through a window). <br /> <br /> Daniela's happiness does not stop because the film takes a cruel turn, she is suddenly beaten and raped by a group of thugs killing the stuntman. Recall "I spit on your grave", Daniela vengeance on her rapists. <br /> <br /> It's 100 minutes of my life. I will never come back. But hey, it's the game you play if you're a movie geek.
