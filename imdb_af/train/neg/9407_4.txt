Houseboat Horror is often regarded as the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film that promoted the promotion: "Watch the movie that can't get an Oscar award". An underground disco band member starts dying dead by burning maniac as they try to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian offshore. Lead action and written shooters flicker with zero tension and annoying characters. It definitely produces the gore: heads are split in half with a beaker, throats are cut and a woman is killed with a hoof. If you like cute treasure movies, you can try this one, but you're warned. At least it's better than Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
