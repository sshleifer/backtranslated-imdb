When you think of fasting, many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, unpleasant, inconspicuous, unseen, incompatible and incompatible. <br /> <br /> I hated those mid-late nineties movies, which were actually Scream's rypoffs, but these new Saw knockoffs are starting to make those movies look like classic. They are still flashing the same demographic that those other films were so successful in doing, but now they are adding a new level of degeneration that makes the twelve to fourteen year old girls. They are aimed at feeling hardcore and hip. <br /> <br /> This movie is a load of boring crap! What happened to the Larry Cohen? His name hasn't been linked to anything good since 1993! Yet I was still surprised to see that he had something to do with something, it's bad! Was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest was one of the psychopaths? Didn't anyone know when they first saw him? Only someone who has never been in his or her life has ever seen another movie!
