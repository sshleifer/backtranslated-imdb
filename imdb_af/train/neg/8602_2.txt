All you really need to know about this movie comes to the opening scene, where a man falls into a lake and is eaten. Then they start with the title credits: You see "Snails!" in large letters, followed shortly by "The Movie." Wow! I was worried that I accidentally agreed to "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show." Anyway, from there, the movie falls into a murder party. You see a man cut off his hand because he had snails in his garden gloves. Two people are attacked by snails while they have sex, and a girl who falls on her back in an underground passage is killed by murderers. It's a nice silly movie that falls into the "so-bad-it-good" category. It was also shot so badly with such a grain film that you were shocked to learn that it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I am very surprised that it got so high as it has here, because most people here don't give that kind of movie any love. But if you want a movie that is trying to be frightening but ultimately ridiculous, it's one of your top candidates.
