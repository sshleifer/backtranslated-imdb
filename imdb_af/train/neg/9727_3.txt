Another part of me in the bargain, this movie has exactly what I expected - a load of trashy horror with screaming ladies. <br /> <br /> It all started so well - I have the small intro with the "news rule" about the young couple exposed to a nuclear explosion, and are completely absorbed until the first person has set fire to . <br /> <br /> From then on, the movie descended into the clear silliness, and has become almost embarrassing at times. When the heroine with the same condition hit the main character (the ability to lift his own flights without the help of a match), it looked like someone was throwing the idea at the last moment ("it'll be good!" you can hardly hear them say ...) As for the almost psychic connection between the main character and the nuclear power plant, it is good ... <br /> <br /> The movie came about so cheaply - if you were over Â£ 1.50 pay for what you did.
