Despite a sequel to the stronger original, it is more of a comic repetition of Friday THE 13th regarding the further antiques of psychopathic Angela, killing more nubile teenagers for their "injustice" at a camp. <br /> <br /> Bruce's sister Pamela looks good. There are some funny funny sex scenes with some pretty lady attractive girls, but the movie is so (unintentionally) comic rather than exciting, it's a stinker. <br /> <br /> * from ****. <Br /> <br /> MPAA: Grade R for graphic violence and gore, nudity, and for some sexuality, language, and drug use.
