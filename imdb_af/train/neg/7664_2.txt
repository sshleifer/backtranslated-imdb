Spoilers forward, but do they really matter? Have you ever read a movie review that consists entirely of questions? Could it be that? Why bury an ancient civilization artefacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text inconsistent? Why would a nun (she sure looked right!) Hand over 20 orphans to a man? Was there always a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mines leave the shafts in the courtyard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly appear at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist open a clear valuable solid gold chest with a sledge hammer? Why would modern computers still show green pre-Tron era grid lines of objects, with a few "beeps"? And should all movie-movable timers have digital displays? Why does nothing in this movie make sense?
