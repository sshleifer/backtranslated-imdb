The worst movie I've seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, no humor, nothing! The action series look more like a series of randomly merged Akshay Kumar ads. Heavily influenced by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle, but very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much, but watching this movie is a surprising experience that makes you wonder "What did these guys think? !! <br /> <br /> The only thing you may remember after watching it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini. <br /> <br /> The reason why I'm not a '1' score every time I think I've seen the worst, Bollywood proves to me wrong.
