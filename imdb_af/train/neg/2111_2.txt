"Bela Lugosi reveals in his role as European horticulturist Dr. Lorenz in this exorbitant story of horror and dementia. The good doctor's aging woman needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins to keep her youth and beauty spot for the doctor to keep his supply as at the altar, where he kidnapped the unsuspecting brides before they could complete their vows and bring them into a coma-like state, brought them to his house to gather his infected abundance. The short description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie. <br /> <br /> ** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Elizabeth Russell
