It's going to be the most useless comment I've ever made, yet I have to do it to warn you about the horror of the theater that Freddy's Dead is. This is not only the worst chapter of the Nightmare series, but is right there with the worst horror successor of all time! It was boring, useless, and almost dead. The horrible 3-D-ending and over-the-top CORNY death is enough to manage this "movie" in the ground. But it doesn't stop there, just add bad plays, a horrible script and a number of casey comos, and you have this heap of Guano! It's no wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, made two post-mortem incidents. I would also go out if I went. It's a strict movie that is only fans, don't be shy.
