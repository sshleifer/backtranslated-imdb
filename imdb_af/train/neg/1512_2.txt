A bad rip-off attempt at "Seven", complete with sub-second-degree acting, horrible camera work, half-baked story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda. Yes, their "sexual offenders", they live next door and you will really be raped. <br /> <br /> No surprises from the vice-terminatrix woman, she acts as always - as convincing as a piece of wood. Richard Gere remains lower and lower - and is as low as a late Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> The singer woman with the crazy eyes is best when she is dead in bed; and even the wolf was inferior (though she was the best performer in the movie) - maybe they fed her before the shots or something. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Seven", which is a (made) up but interesting story, after which one can relate more or less of the country, this movie looks like a single obsession in the US. If one does not care much about sexual offenders, and the statistics are the lack of exercise and bad diet because it causes more pain, suffering and death. There is little reason to see it or to be scared. <Br /> <br /> There are a few body parts fetishes and a few sniffers, but the gore is less than mediocre and fails both as artificial device (because it is senseless) and as gore, because it's not enough . <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this one.
