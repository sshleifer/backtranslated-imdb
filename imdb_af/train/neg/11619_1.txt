I watched the whole movie and waited for something to happen. Maybe it's my fault to expect bad and horror instead of psychology? Is it a strange repetition of the Oedipal myth: I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and put together his musical theater? I didn't understand why some plotting elements were even present: why was the construction above, why was there such a big step with a perfect place for someone to fall to their punishment if nobody really did, why? Have the Scenes Completely with the Dad at Work, Why Do You Have Such a Great Kitchen If You Just Want to Eat, Why Should The Boy Be Baptized and Parents Be the One to Resist Them Instead of the Other. I see very good reviews for this movie ... have damaged my taste by going with 70's b-movies and old sci fi flicks?
