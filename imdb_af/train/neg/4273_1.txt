There is nothing unique in the TV series or the movie. What a prelude to the TV show, which is not found everywhere in life and entertainment. Both told David Lynche's disgusting style of story, and then. <br /> <br /> From the moment the body of a poor, deceived girl was washed on the beach. And is introduced to some of the most sensible, harmful, immoral character of the Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> In the thought of being almost pedophilically disgusting, the movie seems to tell romantic about the destruction of human life by some arbitrary psychological phenomena in the movie Twin Peak: Fire Come Walk with Me. <br /> <br /> I just watched it all to make sure I didn't miss anything. I didn't. It is simply a man who is obviously a long-range sexual fetish, accompanied by a ridiculous excessive pornographic movie. Save yourself the torment the tension and watch anything else that has at least the ability to tell a story, rather than seduce you into some kind of spiritual porn movie. <br /> <br /> I heard a lot of reviews, rants and raves about how big David Lynch. Because of his ability to define misery and tragedy and make it into some sort of a wonderful thing. It is not a life that mimics the art, as much as it is a sickly-turned version of art that does its best to inspire the whole mindless life. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid it from rubbish.
