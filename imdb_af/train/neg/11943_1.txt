The scenery is beautiful and the dog is cute. Otherwise, this movie has absolutely nothing to recommend it. Jack Warden is pleasantly brilliant as usual, but the writing is so terrible that he even goes bad. The plot doesn't make sense, the dialogue is stupid and there are many smaller mistakes. But the dog is cute ...
