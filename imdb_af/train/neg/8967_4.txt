Follow the same path as most successors. The first one was wonderful. The second was average and this one, full of bad acting and some stupid dialogue, and also a lot of suspension of unbelief. This movie was weak. <br /> <br /> Too predictable and I couldn't get it done, Henry Wrinkler as a boss with that stupid eye, there was so much more they could do with it. I like the first one a lot. I wish they'd gone more than they did here. <br /> <br /> There was too much inexplicability needed to be explained, how long it was, and why was there an old-fashioned phone in that room? <br /> <br /> I understand there's another in the works. <br /> <br /> Blah!
