Good sadness I can't even begin to describe how poor this film is. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect much to start. Let's look at it, a PG-13 slasher movie is destined to miss the ummm ... cut, so nobody should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and clich√© displayed on the screen in all other aspects of this movie that really blew me away. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is just as useless to find yourself for the bad man. And here's a refurbishment for the books ... They never change - so the cardinal rule of basic writing magazines - character development. If you think at the end of this movie, the poor girl is going to turn around and finally kick, think again. <br /> <br /> In addition, we may be the least intriguing (and certainly the least) killer ever to grace the genre. I don't make a joke when I say Dora the Explorer has villain villains as this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, because all the potential for voltage or gratuity is removed by the improper (and apparently thirteen years old) director, what could possibly be left to fill 2 hours of screen time? <br /> <br /> Clerics, that's what. <br /> <br /> Many and many cupboards: large cupboards, small cabinets, mirrored cupboards, toilets to Narnia, so many damn cupboards you don't want to dress for a year. In fact, this movie only had to be called "CLOSET", and had a photo of a big and crooked coathanger on the DVD case. At the back it could have taken a picture of the audience asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of: "what the f * @! We just watched our time!"
