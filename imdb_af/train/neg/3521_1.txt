I still shake the thought that I will ever see this movie again. <br /> <br /> I saw action movies, I even liked them, but this one goes over. <br /> <br /> Not only has the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) starred, but the plot of the movie is so stupid (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground not be much easier), it requires a person with IQ to be less than his number to believe it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot has no real twists, a three-year-old child can guess what's coming next. This is a set of cliches (of action genre), with Sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in Rambo III if you considered the movie as a comedy rather than action movie). Now there's an actor who can't act A) Surprise B) sad C) anything other than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I still want to point out that this movie has two factors that some people like. EXPLOSIONS is excellent, but then ... you can see better on July 4th. Landscapes are wonderful, but then ... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas, so you can see better that way, rather than wasting time on this movie. <br /> <br /> Look at another movie instead, There are hundreds, even thousands, of better action movies.
