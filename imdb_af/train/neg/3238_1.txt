Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies fall into two categories of those with a plot of plot (Give it a happy pizza boy) and those without (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's Experiment falls firmly in the latter category. <br /> <br /> This is of course the horror version of hardcore porn. An almost completely plot less 43 minutes waiting for the money shot. Shot on video in 1985, it consisted of three relatively unknown Japanese boys torturing a fairly unattractive Japanese girl. The torture ranges from the banal (strikes her 50 times, kicks her hundred), the stupid (ties her to an office chair and turns her around), the fear factor (a bath of stomach pigs and sheep) and finally the lap. (A well-executed eyeball piercing). <br /> <br /> That's it, no plot, no motive, just Blair Witch's tree shots and torture. The girl looks bored and with the exception of the scream: "No one expects the Spanish Inquisition" during the office chair scene, I was silly crazy. Stare dumbfounded on the screen, waiting for the money shot. Just like hardcore porn.
