I thought this movie had absolutely no morals. I mean, how would you feel if your fiancee left you on your wedding day for your cousin? I'll be sad !! It is classified as a comedy, but I didn't find it at all. I thought it mostly laughed cheaply and took it. I usually like Julie Stiles movies, but this is an exception. Jason Lee starred in another shameful show, proving that class and decent morals are not relevant in today's society. It has a complete lack of flavor and I despise movies like this. I understand that people will defend this movie and it is moral because it is "just a movie", but I still face the fact that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you are a bad person, since everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and parts of this movie were nice, I just say that in real life people like The characters in this movie were ashamed.
