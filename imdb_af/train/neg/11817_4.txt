A nice average scifi movie. The plot was clear from the beginning. Although the play was pretty good, the script clicked a lot, using ideas taken from many films. <br /> <br /> The basic plot: Scientists working on a deep space research platform save a fighter from the red dwarf accident they were sitting. On board they find a stasis pod, which is instantly malfunctioning at that moment. After 2 or 3 minutes of the man waking up in the pod, you realize that he is quite lean. Something that completely escapes the 3-person crew of the research ship ... <br /> <br /> It then completes every other film that includes a psychotic killer who terrorizes innocent victims. Overall, I think Speed ​​2 was a better exploration. of the subject, which I also did not regard as a good film. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, get Aliens out and watch again. <br /> <br />
