I saw this movie once, and I have no desire to ever see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Preston Waters, a hard luck preteen who is always by his family and apparently always short on cash. All this changes as a bank robber runs over Preston's bike and hands him an empty check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1m from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a mansion and says that as an assistant to a mysterious and affluent player, Macintosh (named after his computer) works. Then he just gets crazy with the money. <br /> <br /> On paper it looks like a good idea. On the screen, however, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. For one thing, it's too incredible. I know some parts of the movie were incredible, but I draw the line with a twelve-year-old boy who goes out with a thirty-year-old woman, and is in charge of an imaginary person's small fortune. It was also a shallow movie with poor acting, a predictable plot line and characters that were less than memorable. The characters were either cheesy, over, irritating or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
