There is only one use for a movie like Bulletproof: it just reminds you how bad it can be. We often see movies that we describe as "pretty awful" or "not very good", but then you come across a movie like this and you can see that although all the other movies are not good, they are not so smelly bad as Bulletproof. It was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds through a DVD bargain bin at our local supermarket to fulfill an obligation (ie to give me a gift). It could have been a serendipitous find, but it was not so: it was so completely split, so badly written, so poorly directed, so badly that I was surprised that everyone involved was not arrested and for 10 years Downloaded. God, it's terrible. I suspect so much of about 30 seconds, but continued because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad, it can be nice. This is not one of them. It's just bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I will throw it in the bowl.
