There are so many words to play on the title of the spectacular bad Valentine I don't know where to start. I will say it; here is a movie that drops me to the complexity of the Valentine's cards we spent in primary school. You know, the one with Batman cried out: "You're a super crime fighter!" <br /> <br /> Valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony, one of the few horror movies made in recent years. ignore the influence of Scream. The villain is omniscient and almost invulnerable. The heroes are easily scared when people run around the corners and grab them at the shoulders "HeyIjustleftmycoatbehind!" The score is more offensive than Norman Bates' mother. <br /> <br /> The thin plot follows several childhood, now large and very crooked. Since the film has nothing to do with them, they are waiting for a masked stalker to kill them one by one. This stalker seems to be former nerd Jeremy Melton, who is constantly rejected by women and hit by high school men. As Valentine's Day approaches, the women start frightening cards indicating their punishment. Melton looks like the obvious suspect. Just a problem is, as many characters warn, in 13 years, Melton could have changed his look to look soft and handsome. So (terrified here) everyone is a suspect! <br /> <br /> Here's a problem. To have any tension when looking at Valentine, you must accept a reality in which a high school nerd is able to become David Boreanaz. Nerds don't change in Angel when they grow up, they get older, bulging nerds. He is not a terrible actor, but the writing, by no less than four writers, gives him and the rest of the game nothing to do, but shouts and excuses. Denise Richards (the vibrant Hollywood actress, never to die in Baywatch) is being exploited; shameful in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before an important tension scene. Note for self: always bring a bathing suit at a Valentine's Day party. Just because it means February, doesn't mean you want a little dip. <br /> <br /> The treasure in Valentine dress in head-to-toe black with a Cherubian mask. Here's problem number two. The filmmakers clearly thought it would be a disturbing image to be the head of someone who hit the face with hot iron. Flat and simple, it's not. Instead, it just made me wonder how a man with a mask covering his entire face, including his eyes and ears, can move so suddenly without bumping his peels on chairs or tables. Then again, given the things the Cupid Killer does, maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands. <br /> <br /> Not only is the movie bad, it's not even who the killer is; the final "turn" is more "Huh?" as "Hah!" If you don't scratch your head, you throw and then groan and search for the nearest exit. Don't see this movie. Even if you are alone on Valentine's Day, find something, ANYTHING, different to do. You'll be glad you did.
