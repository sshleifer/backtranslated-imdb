This movie was so written, directed and acted that it believed beggars. It needs to be recreated with a better script, director and decision service. The worst problem is the acting one. You've got Jennifer Beals on one side polished, professional and totally credible, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who is badly mistaken and just in this particular piece of brush. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just as horrible as the slaves who own (and hold), although they usually work well. The actors (and directors) didn't have to try to accent at all - they are inconsistent and incredible. Much better to be focused on doing a good job in real English. The casting is ridiculous. Why are children of an "African" trader (so less socially desirable for the generic community) cast with very light actors, while the so-called socially desirable Marcel Africa attributes, including a bright blonde who have clear color? It's as if the decisive directors can't read the writing they are reading, and to choose appropriate actors from a large pool of highly talented and physically diverse color players. It's just so strange! It can be a good movie and must be re-created, but with people who respect the material and choose appropriate and skilled actors. There are many good actors out there, and it will be fun to see Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben play an appropriate role, good writing and decent direction.
