Jude Law gives her everything in this beautifully filmed vampire movie that offers little other value. Totally lacking in eroticism, excitement, or front ladies with appeal. A decent fight, a few moments of light tension. And a one-note plot. <br /> <br /> The movie becomes philosophical in a series of talks between the character of the law and a daughter killer played well by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors were captured on the cross of the film's banality. <br /> <br /> With a lesser actress starring - and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinematography - crocodiles will interfere with the low-budget vampire quickies.
