Since I watched a new Jet Li movie to watch some but kicking and brainless hand-to-hand battles, I grabbed this title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie contains more gunfire (ala Chow Yun Fat but nowhere near as well), as Jet Li and the company's acrobatic battle. It was therefore a deviation. <br /> <br /> The crane crash was interesting and even funny, as it was a totally unexpected in a Jet Li movie for me, more on Jackie Chan's line. <Br /> <br /> But unfortunately, I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master, or even the Enforcer about this dissapointment. <br /> <br /> Rating 4 for Martial Arts Rating 3 for overall movie score
