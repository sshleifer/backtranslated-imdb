OUR FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Film) <br /> <br /> Stan 'Ollie is blended with a few floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after coming out to visit a theater that burns in their absence! Needless to say, their tyrannical women (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are not amused. <br /> <br /> Leo McCarey's OK comedy has the narrative framework for William Seiter's masterpiece SONS OF THE DESERT (1934) with L&H To play prosperous casualties, forced to tell a monstrous lie returned in a spectacular way. Much of it is very funny, especially the scene in which Stan is harassed by Deslys, leading to a violent game of pressure and push. However, some of the fun is suppressed by Oakland and Flowers, playing their roles completely straight, adding an element of unpleasantness to the henpecked husband's scenario. Originally released in the UK as our SLIP.
