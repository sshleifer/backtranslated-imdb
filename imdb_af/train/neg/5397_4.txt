I think it's one of the worst of the Kenneth Branagh Shakespearian works. After so much effort as Much Ado About Nothing, etc., I thought it was poor. The movie was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???) but my biggest gripe was that they messed up with the Bard's work and cut some of the plays to put into the musical / dance sequence. <br /> <br /> You just do Shakespeare and then waste with the play. Sorry, but this is just wrong. I like Cole Porter, just like the next person, but jeez, don't mess with the Shakespeare. Skip it and see "Prospero's Books" if you want to see a brilliant Shakespeare adaptation of the Tempest.
