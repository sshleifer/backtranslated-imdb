The uprising of the zombies is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty far below the list. When an expedition to Cambodia is sent to discover the trick of making zombies after the First World War, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions. And he succeeds, at least in the first place. A love triangle complicates the story a bit. <br /> <br /> It was really a boring movie, with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who zombies and who were. The dialogue was a bit better and the plot was incredible (not the zombie part of it, but parts related to "romance"). And while I'm not a student or an expert on filmmaking, the camera didn't work much of the movie either. <br /> <br /> Having seen some movies worse, it's unlikely to be anyone. It's bad, and NOT in a bad-it-is-good way.
