The complaints are valid, for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is aimed at women. I'm okay with this night-time soap, like Gray's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are interesting stories, even with the fact that they will never end. However, when the idea is parallel to the day's sails aiming to place only brave men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) in sexual tensions and tricks, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called small hospital, it seems like General Hospital ... or a female counterpart to Baywatch. It was what men wanted and they had it, so if that is what women want, it must be, but the idea that it is a high look (or something that people will see) is unrealistic.
