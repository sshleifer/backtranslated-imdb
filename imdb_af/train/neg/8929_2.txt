This Hodge-Podge adapted from a Gore Vidal novel (actually one of the great American writers) makes THE MAGICAL CHRIST and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS like Fellini works of art. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and she's not very long) in a starring role (except for KANSAS CITY BOMBER when she was pretty good) plays Rex Reed's (bad movie star, not critic) alter-ego, surrounded to become Mae West, horny John Huston, a young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (pre-Lee Majors, who is a disgrace), and other various creep azoids to pretend they also want a spoof, things are not going For this, except between the split old movies clips (ie Widmark in KISS OR DEATH, Lena Horne) ... JUST so they can continue to bleed life from everyone. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Best performance = ?. It's so bad, it's worth seeing!
