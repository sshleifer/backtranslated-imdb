I think this movie had to be shocking. But the only way this is indeed shocking is how shockingly bad it was made ... and simple. It is one and a half hours of torment. Even more for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). Probably the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically good, as it is a horror movie. And I (usually) like horror movies. I have no problem with violence in these types of movies. However, all the violence in this movie does not serve at all. It's not a spectacle, except that it's just grotesque. It's so lame that it even gets boring, and very fast. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if the above was not bad enough for you) about this movie is that they have been trying the Blair Whitch Project, by filming with cheap hand cameras. But (again, that too) doesn't end at all. In the "Blair Which", probably enough, there is an explanation, namely they are with a camera looking for the blue witch. In this movie there is no other explanation than: "Hey, we'd like it, like the Blair Whitch !!" The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed. The girls are shouting so hysterically that many times you can't figure out what they are saying. Also, no attempt has been made to make something better, sound-wise or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the sound track, which is just as bad as the rest, ranging from cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard rock ... <br /> <br /> My advice : Don't look at it under any circumstances.
