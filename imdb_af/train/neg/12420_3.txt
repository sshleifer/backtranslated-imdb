There is just not enough here. There are a few funny places, but not really enough. I was very disappointed because I love silly movies. I expected it to be a hidden gem. THIS WAS NOT. It was a hidden maze. <br /> <br /> All the time I watched it, I thought, "Geez, I can do better than that and I'm a moron." Don't believe the few good reviews. I was caged by them. At no time did I laugh aloud. Maybe it was funny or cutting-edge in 1987, but the man has become flat today. This movie has promise, it just didn't deliver it. Maybe if they do it a few times. I can't blame the actors. They weren't the best, but they just didn't have much to do. This movie failed due to urgent writing. CARE disappointed.
