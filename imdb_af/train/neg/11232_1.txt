It's so sad. Although it's shot with film, I think it smells a little more than flickering like Blood Lake, there's nothing out there. The music they play here is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I love the brother and sister in this movie. Both are not trying very hard to sound sarcastic when they say things like, "My friends are going to be so jealous!" Hey, how's the killer going in the beginning with his mask? It's delayed! I almost ignored the second half of this practice. My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when using the ax. The same exact sound for each hood!
