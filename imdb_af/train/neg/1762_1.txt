This movie is a rip of many movies that have been dealing with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be warned that "Art Heist" doesn't add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin returns to movies, and frankly one wonders if he has a good agent, or is it that directors and producers of his unusual goofy look, complemented by that strange hairstyle, he sports in most of his movies. The only good movie he appeared in is "The Squid and the Whale", in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading lady, doesn't cost much better; there is no chemistry between Mrs. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin not. <br /> <br /> A movie is seen at the viewer's own risk.
