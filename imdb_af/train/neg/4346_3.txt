Why, why, do people take good material and feel the need to change it? After reading the book on which this film was based a few years ago, I can say that there is little or nothing in the original book. I went into this movie with low expectations - I knew it would have a crazy telemovie feel to it - but it didn't even meet it. <br /> <br /> It's not a prequel - the only relationship with the Original is the name. It's not the story of Carlito Brigante, it's the story of a totally different character given the same name. They just spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; Add offense to injury by playing another role by Luis Guzman, who plays an important character in the original movie. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that now that this film has been made, no other film will be addressed to address the original, untouched material of the Carlito's Way book - something I really liked. I felt the same way from Chopper - they had four books as well as interviews that were fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure. Instead, they made a ho-hum movie about a confused but strange pathetic tiny timelapse (though Eric Bana's performance was over). Now we will never see Carlito's true initial rise and fall. <br /> <br /> The three stars are because we only consider it a stand-alone movie, it's not that terrible. There are some decent performances. (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito, but he can be good at other roles) and the story is not bad. Even Puffy Combs fits his role. But they completely understand the nature of the underworld at that stage (I'm a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff) - something that got the original film and books done (written by lawyer at that time and now Edwin Torres Judge) <br /> <br /> The fact is, it's not a stand - it's perhaps the most disappointing event ever filmed.
