I must admit I erupted when I saw a reviewer, comparing it to LOTR. Well, if you exclude the dwarfs, throw the thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the elegant direction and all the others. What leaves you with the walk. And son, run this movie! As Mr. Piano had his way, it would probably be an uninterrupted three-hour hardcore running through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so, this troublesome Martians appeared for a few seconds to interrupt him before he left a little go from a ramble. You've never seen so much in a movie. If it really had a budget of $ 20m, most of Mr. Piano's shoes went, because he had to walk through all the pairs through all the walking. What explains why there is no money for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. Honestly, it's like watching a little shy fetish video for people with a thing to go for long in costumes. Even on the fast track, this is a paycheck. <br /> <br /> As for the sci-fi stuff, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the movie: they just came in the course of the run, which is clearly more interesting to the director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr. Piano asks to walk dogs?
