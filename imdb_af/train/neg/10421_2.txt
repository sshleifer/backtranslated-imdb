I saw this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 now) and it made me uncomfortable for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this movie of the way it was drawn to the music (of course) the violence. My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say they would never let me see such a movie. I think they just say I know I have such strong feelings about it; 0) I am currently reading the book (from morbid curiosity and the fact that it is a classic) and it is really a wonderful story. However, I don't think it should be done in a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe the kids will find it beautiful today, but it gave me weeks and weeks of nightmares and I still have a hard time seeing rabbits that are similarly drawn. Give me some heartbeat every time. Yah, I'm a wuss, but I strongly suggest that any parent who wants to show this movie to their children read or read the book first to make sure they approve the content. Not everyone finds it as disturbing as I did, but we are out there; 0)
