I find it sad that Christians (and I am one) feel that we have to make movies like "behind". We have much better stories to tell what shouldn't be so preaching. I was very disappointed with this movie. As an aspiring filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this movie as the perfect example for what I'm not going to do with my film career.
