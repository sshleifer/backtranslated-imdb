I watched this movie recently, and I can't understand why the makers made this stack of crap. I mean, yes, it gives a good impression of Hitler's environment, and I mean how they reproduced Austria in the late 1890s, WWI and the Inter-war period. What I can't understand is why they depict Hitler as a 100% pure evil, crazy, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. He was a very considerate, loving and intelligent man who, of course, had his dark sides, no doubt about it. But why, in heaven's name, does he suggest this way? All his positive aspects were cut from the scenario, and nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had ever had the greatest influence on modern civilization. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War. Yes, he was racist, and yes, he was sometimes unstable, especially at the end of the war. Everything is true. But again; Why did they make the LIE public clear? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely don't think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they could now stand up for heavy global weakness. The fact that this evil was so recognizable, however, was so gripped by almost every German (not to mention Austrians and many other people) making it a warning to modern civilization, not the fact that Hitler was such a stranger . If it had been as the makers believe us - I would have been convinced that the German people were delayed. A man like the one in this movie would never have been near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
