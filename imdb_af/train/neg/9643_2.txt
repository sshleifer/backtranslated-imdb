Under average movie with poor music consider a movie based on music ??? Ordinary writing and direction with full blunders. Salman Khan was on his usual acting. Ajay's performance worsened with time as his appearance, especially his styles as a Rock Star, was pathetic. Asin was just a show. Overall, I felt that I was using my money in cinema. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in the movie all boring except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song to impress the British Music Sponsor was the most unimportant. "Khanabadosh" can easily be understood by an English Music Sponsor. The other movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid", which was a simple, slow love story with good direction and acting despite average music
