The movie is boring, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, incredible, the action is hilarious. This movie is a big mess. It almost looks like when the action music comes in, the impressive stunt is going on. Or the voice is being persuaded by Mr. McGregor or steved sang too much and it changed his voice. There is far too much dialogue in this movie, and very bad in every way. The movie is a good sleep therapy. The battle is laughable. The eye shape shifting effect on the evil designer drug addict female was decent. The biggest villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed. The chief villain was used to explain the story by interrogation, he would just throw random plots like (spoiler) "CTX (his designer drug) is going to be in the water supply" which is never in the conclusion or even mentioned. again in the movie. This movie is highly recommended to pass.
