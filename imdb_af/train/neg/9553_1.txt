No wonder it was released straight into DVD here in Australia The dialogue was hokey, the acting, terrible and the writing sucked !! Who thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow-up to the far superior John Badham movie, Wargames of the 80s, should they be of something, because it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good at it as the eye-catcher / love interest, while Matt Lanter was good as the other lead - it's about it. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code for All, watch Hackers or the original Wargames movie. Both are better than this piece of crap !!
