DOC SAVAGE: THE BRONZE MAN (1 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Dreadful, dreadful movie ... based on the pulp magazine / paperback series by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a superhero adventure hero in the 30's and his five assistants, all experts in a field of effort enable them to fight the evil. It was a nice hokey series ... but nice to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a movie version in the 70's, with Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never had a chance to see it. It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I've finally seen the movie, I can understand why. The plot and characters are never treated seriously. It's all kind of tongue-in-the-cheek and camping ... kind of like the old Batman TV series ... just without being beneficial ... or having any visual flair. Corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, stupid stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad acting. Actually, I find it fascinating in his bad ... what could they possibly think? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumored to be in the lead in a contemporary remake. But I don't think it would have been much better.
