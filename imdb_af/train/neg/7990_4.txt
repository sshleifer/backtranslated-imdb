'Anita and Me' is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic Britain, rather like 'Bend it Like Beckham', or more, 'East is East', which represents a 1970s institution. The tone is resolutely chirpy (despite the black black accent), but the film is missing 'East is East's power and the result looks rather thin and thin. In addition, depicting the film's central relationship, between an Asian girl and her white friend, is insufficiently deep to justify the way the film is structured about it. I also got tired of movies where the hero is a writer for years. Of course, this is often something that real writers have experienced, but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story. 'East is east' was fun and sharp; 'Anita and Me' seem clear and boring in comparison.
