Revenge on us, the watching public, maybe. I sat through this 2 hour movie and I waited for the second action to kick in so that the movie could remain his title. But Costner never denies his beloved fate, she dies and the movie ends. I left and wondered where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called Revenge, hell gets better at the end of the movie. I had the choice to see this or Black Rain at the theater. Thanks, I saw the other brother's movie at the cinema. I caught this turkey on video. There was one good thing about the movie and was his beautiful tame. Listen to the cd.dont look it's awful. 1 out of 10
