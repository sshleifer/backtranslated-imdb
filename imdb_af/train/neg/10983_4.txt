When this drama was shown by the BBC only 30 years ago, it would have been something different for the time being. Therefore, some people would have found it terrifying, and could also impress the impression of the special effects. <br /> <br /> Watch the play in this day and age. It doesn't seem scary. More, even the special effects can be overlooked. <br /> <br /> Would a train really be allowed to pass a RED LIGHT in a dark tunnel? I don't think so ... but if you see this play again, you'll see the first train entering the tunnel quickly through the RED LIGHT! (maybe that's how dickens it was)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the footpath leading to the Signal Box is very steep and in poor condition. Certainly there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down the cut. <br /> <br /> I won't take anything away from the scene, both Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) made wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's going on ...... I mean, was the ghost the traveler, or what ??? Does anyone really understand this confusing story? (Well maybe I'm the only one who doesn't) ??? <br /> <br /> Summarizing ..... <br /> <br /> The play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout, with great character. It suffers from the fact that it is not so scary, and a little or not very confusing in places, and has quite unusual signaling practices. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review.
