Well, what can I say, there are B-Grade movies and there are B-Grade movies and it definitely falls into the latter. But as it goes without saying that even the film's creators know that it's not a credible movie (look at the closing credits), it can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a convicted psychic killer killed. He accidentally mixed his genetic material with an experimental acid that is combined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes the form of a snowman - if you can believe it. The snowman, Jack Frost, is in the village of Sherif sitting behind bars. With that, Jack Frost ends half of the village. <br /> <br /> This movie has no real fears and the effects alone remind me of the B-grade movies of the 50's. It alone makes it worth looking for a laugh. A movie to pass the time away.
