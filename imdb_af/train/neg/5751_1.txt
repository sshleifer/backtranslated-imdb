The film must be shot in a day, there are scenes where you can see the camera's reflections and its red pointer, even the green light that blends with the actors! The plot and lines are really awful, even if the slightest inspiration (At least as a thriller genre movie). Everything about Poe in the movie has a level and childlike approach. The movie is full of clise and no excitement. If you want to watch a funny b-movie for a relaxing evening with friends then go and enjoy it (as I did), but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
