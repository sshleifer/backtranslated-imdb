A typical Goth chick (Rainbow Harvest looks like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets even with people she feels, with the help of an old ghost mirror she finds in the new home. buy her mother (horror mainstay, Karen Black, the only pretty good thing about this travesty). The play is pretty low-key (especially when Rainbow changes with the above mirror) and there is no fear or tension. This film inexplicably exploited for 3 successors, each slightly more gruesome than the last. People who want a similar theme but far better theater work will be well advised to look for just the episode of "Friday the 13th: the series", where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. It packs more chills in the barely 40 minutes than this entire franchise provided over four films. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Cookie Card: Charlie Spradling Offers Compulsory T&A
