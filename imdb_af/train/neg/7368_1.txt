I had the misfortune to buy 10 times to buy SS new movie on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can usually suspend my belief to watch movies like this. A clink of salt and some beer on a dark night on the couch watching a noisy late night shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha man like me. I bought this movie and thought I'd see and shoot cool. <br /> <br /> Did I do hell? Segal is old and bloated, the plot was even ridiculous by SS standards and to express everything from Segal's play (as it was to start with) is extremely bad. It is so bad that half of his voice is transcribed by a man NOT sounding like Him. Either SS can no longer act (a lot of point) from the crew was so terrible for their work that they couldn't properly record the sound. The voice will fly back and forth between Mr Whisper Segal and the man who is doing voice loss for Honda ads! <br /> <br /> Plot wise is not the problem, as most action movies work on the same premise as this one, nothing new there. The usual combination of characters who will die horribly as gunfire and stereotypical bad guys waiting to be blown away. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if you would prevent walking before a speed train or a dose of H5N1 bird flu. <br /> <br /> Full garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> It was a public health alert.
