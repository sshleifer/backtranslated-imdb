Honestly, if someone has a brain, there's not one positive thing. <br /> <br /> Saying about this movie so ever. <br /> <br /> I rented $ 1 to rent it. I'd rather laugh at Will Smith and say, "If you have a dream, you must protect it." <br /> <br /> All actors must be bored or have no fame at the moment. even Matthew Mc Conahay * but you play it * was better than all the actors in this movie, when he played a psycho in Texas Chainsaw. 4. If you see this movie and have something good to say, your IQ must be very low, with such a bad taste in movies, it hurts. Thanks ... and the TRUTH is spoken! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from the misery. <br /> <br /> Get Devil's Reject, now it's a classic.
