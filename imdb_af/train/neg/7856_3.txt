This movie sucked. I'm in the army and the soldiers portrayed in this movie are terrible. If you are in the Military and you see this movie, you will be the entire movie and be because of the way they acted as a group. It was ridiculous. They acted like a lot of ordinary people with Army uniforms not knowing what to do. It was a nice movie I had to say the least. There were a few scenes where they were trying to make you jump. I would recommend seeing it if you're bored and wanting to see a violent movie. It will also be a better movie if you are not in the military. I should also say that I liked the first one better than this one.
