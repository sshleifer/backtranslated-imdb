I agree with one of the other commentators about good story and good actors, but mismatched, and I will also say chasing. It's been about 24 years since I read the book as it was at school. But I felt like you had to get to know Jane Eyre's story if you look at this one as bits are left out and that's why it doesn't make sense. For example, Jane and Mr Rochester barely spoke and suddenly he proposed the marriage! The actors don't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about every thing that happens in the story. The actors are good, but don't get enough time to do this story justice. I'm sorry to say that, but I didn't really enjoy this version. The 1970s version with Susanna York and George C Scott would be the Jane Eyre movie of my preference, but you need the 1983 mini-version of the BBC with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in the lead roles. I love it so much that I watch it regularly. There is a shortened version that lasts for 225 minutes or the full version for 330 minutes.
