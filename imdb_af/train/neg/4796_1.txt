I love John Saxon in everything he does. Once, he takes the camera over, though he is titled a more appropriate movie. "Please don't call this movie: Zombie Death House". The $ 1000 dollar assurance certificate is the best Fred Olen Ray's tough way to spend your $ 14 on a filmed spill that is poured out by a huge 70's cheese legend. Ray is the leading man at RetroMedia. Ray makes Charles Band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a Ford Falcon. Just bad now, the two of them - and boring. It is wonderful that Ray excavates these old things and in some cases it is public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters, but in the case of Zombie Death House (the word "Zombie" suddenly added to ownership and interest in add in FOR) The only way to do this service is to put it on the DOLLAR market for the CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND FANS OR SAXON !!! If you want to see true Saxon, pick up Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
