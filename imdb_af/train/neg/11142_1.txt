It's the absolute worst piece of shit I've ever had to watch - actually it was so bad I just had to see it :-) <br /> <br /> The CGI is so bad, it's fun! It's not even close to the Shitty CGI animations in Spawn, it's how bad it is, she has ... <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at the fact that some distribution companies actually put money down to free Put it on DVD, but I think they will get more money from it, because the cost of making it can be no more than a few hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It's so terrible that a nursery school could have made it. <br /> <br /> Watch it and laugh!
