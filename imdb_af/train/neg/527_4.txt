Thrown to die in a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave dies but before her she is going to tell her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> It is one of those movies that shows the appearance and expectations of a big movie simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it, so it looks like it is different from the pot boiler it really is. Not so bad, but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all good performances), you expect more than a bad story which is a bit more than a harlequin romance. <br /> <br /> Waiting for cable.
