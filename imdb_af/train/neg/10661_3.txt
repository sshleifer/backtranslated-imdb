This is the "F.B.I." Reed Hadley, with an all-cast guest cast! The movie starts with a casual (convenient) kidnapping, leading to one thing and another - which is not really the main story, which is a "Big House, U.S.A." is not. prison break story. The story is very unlikely to say the least. It's like a TV show, just more "violent" (for times). <br /> <br /> BUT - the role play is a journey! Picture of this: Ralph Meeker was sent to prison; his waiters are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (read a "Spier" magazine!), and William Talman (read a "Detective" magazine!). Honest! You must know that an early scene reveals what happens to the "missing" boy, who answers the end of the "voiceover". If you don't want it hanging out, don't miss the opening scenes between the "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian does well as a breathtaking runaway). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, U.S.A. (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
