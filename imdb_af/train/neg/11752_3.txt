I like animated shows. I enjoy the Nick prize pretty much, including Hey, Arnold. But moving a TV show to the big screen is not easy and it just didn't feel enough. It was more like a long episode of the show, and it just didn't move that well. Judging from the behavior of the children we had with us, they didn't play well with them either.
