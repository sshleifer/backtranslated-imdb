ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is contemptuous. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention she will probably be psychotic, depressed or worse. Think of Diana Diana and how she longs for privacy. Now the poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone. No wonder Greta Garbo fell asleep and said, "I want to be alone". How much does this little girl make? Does ET have nothing better to report? I bet there are many people who really don't care about what color her birthday cake and balloons were. By the way, I never heard Anna Nichole ever win any of the wills and heritage court cases. Who pays for Larry, Howard and Little Dannielynn's lifestyle? Can it be ET?
