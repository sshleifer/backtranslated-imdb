I hired this movie because I heard of the fuss that it was not raised for an Oscar prize, but after watching it, it's easy to see why it didn't. Despite the beautiful photography, the movie is incredibly slow, despite the fact that it hardly has a plot. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a young boy trying to agree with his parents' death what may or may not be an accident (the movie is never clear about this) and how did his grandfather tell him stories. The fairy tales contain the only clash of interest in the plot, but they are very short and do not really look like a point. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale story is about a boy trying to get a magical flower for his dying girl to save her life, but slow down the boy by first tasting the flower to make sure it is not toxic. in him a few seconds to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then states that the moral is that the boy was impatient, but it doesn't make sense, because it was over-caution and slowness that led to his failure. Perfect metaphor for this movie really. <br /> <br /> However, Skye's photography is beautiful, but then Stardust released this year is another fairy tale movie filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and this is infinitely better than this.
