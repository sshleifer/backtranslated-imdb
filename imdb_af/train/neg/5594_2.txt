This is the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie. "What was the point?" This movie was nothing more than half an hour of confusion with totally unlikely people (not using the word actors) and a script you could tell didn't exist. <br /> <br /> One of the things that made me laugh most about this movie, how it said "Victorian story written by", means there was actually a script for that part of the story. The whole Victorian section had no dialogue, and was just out of shots from a guy staring at a girl and vice versa. Make the movie part as a camera that leaves at a train station. <br /> <br /> OK, time for the story. It starts with a man sitting in a chair and never getting out. Oh, who's gonna need you? These newsmen come to his house and ask him to tell this story about these dead girls. So he started the story in Victorian time. and here's how the scene goes. (Guy and girl are in a field. Beautiful music starts playing) (staring at girl) (girl staring at man) (staring at girl) cut back to movie. It's almost all about half the movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is incredibly uncomfortable dialogue about a lot of models that want to buy an apartment. So this broker shows them one and when I say the dialogue is uncomfortable, I mean, if it was a dancer, it would travel during the MACARENA. None of the characters in this movie are nice. The models are incredibly annoying, the Victorian people don't talk and the guy who tells the story has the personality of a bag of onions. So all the girls are eventually killed. and by killing, I mean drug offscreen. ooh. you showed ONE dead? And by death do I mean to hold her face until they put on the blood? Awesome. <br /> <br /> HOW this man even knows that this story baffles me. He says it's because he saw it. but how? there was no guy in that apartment! the door is locked without turning, the windows are attached to a fire which was too rotten to work, how did the HELL see it all? O plot gate. we love you So the movie ends with the newswoman saying, "I think you made it up. You're wasting our time" despite the fact that she begged him for the interview in the first place. Whatever. This movie was stupid, useless, and had no sense with many plot holes. I can keep on about this movie, but I don't see the need. I'd rather spend my time doing something indifferent. Love something. "Hel's Threshold" belongs more to purgatory with 2 stupid models. out of 10.
