I will spend so much time on this review as the authors did on the screenplay. It is easy to pursue the WORST ever made. <br /> <br /> They tortured Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield's performance GOD-DIFFERENT, so everyone was elses !! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The writing seemed to be written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen name Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How the producers managed to express such a hidden film expression is beyond me. They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston look like a talented buffoon. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> I want the 96 minutes of my life. I looked back at this alleged reminder of a brilliant comedy so I could try to convince everyone involved in this film religion.
