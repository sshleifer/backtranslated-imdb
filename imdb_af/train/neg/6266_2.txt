It looks like someone can make a movie today. It's like everything you need is a camera, a group of people who are your role and crew, a script and a little money and you have a movie. Problem is that talent is not always part of this comparison and often these kind of low-budget movies seem to be dudes. The video store shelves are filled with these so-called movies. It is not even guilty of pleasure, they are just a waste of celluloid which has been better forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for making trash cinema, but most of their films are b-film gold. Some of the films they've printed had nothing to do with, and some, like Nightmare Weekend, didn't deserve any kind of release. <br /> <br /> Benefits: The role players do the best they can with the common stuff. Some unintentional hilarity. Move at a good fit (should be at 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Terrible writing, which includes a spoken dialogue and numerous plot holes. Poorly lit, especially the night tones and the end, which you can not make out at all. Don't make sense. Weaknesses. Cheap and highly dated effects. Total lack of character development and you will not care for anyone. It is supposed to be a horror movie, but it is lacking in the area and is not the least scary. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Load with unnecessary padding. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I never expected it to be a forgotten gem, but I never thought it would be so bad. I don't know if it's the worst movie ever made, but it's a definite contender. Troma had to make this film rotten instead of giving it a release. Don't make the same mistake I made and get your curiosity the best of you. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
