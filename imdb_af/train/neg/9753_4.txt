I am grateful for one thing and just one thing - that this woman will be thousands of miles further on a completely different continent! Yay !!! This program formulated exactly how Victoria Beckham became obsessed with herself and her family to the media in the name of self-promotion and "Brand f * cking Beckham". <br /> <br /> A few years ago I was very accustomed to 'Posh and Becks', but I do have David's talent very happy, but I no longer respect him. How can you put someone who has his wife's hand back to work like a puppet. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was about Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing happened at Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that he has earned about four kilos of pounds. He sold his soul for the American Bok and will end his days for a team struggling to get promotion from Division One in England. - But at Baseball and Basketball you rule - soccer you do!) <br /> <br /> Anyway - I split. It's been years since I saw such an over-the-top, totally fake show of Posh. It is only played during her cricket-like red carpet action following the Rebecca Loos debacle, as opposed to all the cr * at David he earned, she desperately clung to his arm and tried to save the million pound spinner. Her marriage has become. <br /> <br /> This whole PR stunt was pathetic. Why can't she calmly go there, support her husband with the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down? When did she become so big of self-interest that she felt the move to America should be covered by this great danger? <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw David Beckham's documentation last night. He kept at least a cut of grace and humility. Two things his wife can do with learning. <br /> <br /> One more Victoria - you complain that you are constantly being hung over. Small hint - stop beating them over your place where you are stupid. <br /> <br /> Good Luck America !!
