"They are among us" is poor science fiction at its best. Moderate acting stories in this movie. The plot holes are numerous. Strangers who have somehow come to a meteorite and have hid from us for over 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to make their appearance. In their alien form, they probably have exo-skeletons (which is why they require plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and fingernails. The heroine's father "disappeared" after the Project Blue Book was closed, but was probably an F-16 pilot. And up and on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie, select 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and see how it's done right.
