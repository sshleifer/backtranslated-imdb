As a poker enthusiast, I was looking forward to seeing this movie - especially because it had Scotty Nyugen in it. <br /> <br /> Basically, Scotty Nyugens are short spots in this movie all that goes. <Br /> <br /> The characters are unattractive and annoying, the soundtrack is terrible and the plot, well, there is none. <br /> <br /> I honestly had a headache and found myself barring the bar code number on the DVD box after twenty minutes. It's actually ashame that Nyugen was in this movie, otherwise I wouldn't have lost $ 16 to buy it from Ebay. <br /> <br /> Take it from me - Avoid 7 2 offsuit !!! Dire. :(
