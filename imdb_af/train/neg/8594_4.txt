At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neil (Cillian Murphy) why she is constantly looking for an adventure. She said "because I am drill phobia". That means she can't really go on with her life by doing compulsory activities. Well, I think her reason and the way this movie goes is very ironic. Because "the detectives look" is a brave boredom. <br /> <br /> Did any of these characters actually do something exciting? Neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop. He and his other geek friends usually hang around the shop and watch movies while debating them. But Neil's life is completely reversed when Violet walks into his shop. She is an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. Anyway, after some dates, they decide to see each other. The problem is: Violet is a person who does prank jokes on Neil and can't really do anything normal, while Neil is completely against hair. The question is. Are they in love at the end? Your bet. <br /> <br /> "Watching the detectives" is a clich√©-romantic comedy to its core. And they even made it worse by pretending to be something else. From the first set of the setup we know that Neil is a nice retired man who didn't really do anything. And then, Violet enters the scene, looks strange and annoying. At this point, we all know that we are going to put all the meaningless situations out to find out how they will eventually end. Is it worth waiting for? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they were trying to give something more to the audience. "Look at the detectives" trying to talk about dedication. To see how far people are going to reach for something they desire. We finally knew that the foolish things Violet did, all the test, how far Neil is ready to go to win her heart (or whatever). Well, I think it's totally bullshit. This movie ends pretty fast as Neil just said to himself "Forget it, that girl is one of a nutjob!" After working with many great directors recently (Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" and "28 Days Later", Ken Loach's "The Wind That Shakes the Gars" and Neil Jordan's "Breakfast on Pluto" to name a few), it's rather strange choice for Cillian Murphy to make a movie with one of the Broken Lizard comedy gang, Paul Soter. Anyway, he's not bad (as usual), but such a talent actor like him shouldn't waste his time in the movie like that. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly dreadful as Violet. Her play is a mess. I mean it's all over the place and so over-the-top. Tony Montana would have been proud. <br /> <br /> The last but not the least mistake the movie has made is a completely irrelevant title. You simply can't link a plot between the plot and its title; And then you will eventually think it doesn't make sense at all. In short, "Watching the detectives" is enjoyable as a forgettable movie that you may have the chance to catch on cable television so fast that you can't imagine. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
