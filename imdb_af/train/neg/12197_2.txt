Beast Wars is a show that is overheated, overheated and over-rated. Let's meet the characters of this disturbing show whose creators must have been acidic to make such a show. <br /> <br /> Cheetor Serieus, they must have censorship bars on this guy. How does he get from the viewers who have the same voice as baby Taz? (at least Razzoff of Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is pronounced by Slip & Slide). Action Blast - If you want a series of changes, get G4 Tranceformers Cybertron - a show to go into a toilet. Good work creators (sarcasm) Show it self-deliberately and boring (at least the Super Mario games are better). This show has many followers, it says, should bring it back, but I believe it has been canceled for its own good.
