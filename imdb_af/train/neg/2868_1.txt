This is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events in this movie are not even close to the truth. Why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make sense, as the real-life events are more interesting, then they are captured. Don't even waste your time watching it for free. Low budget and a shameful picture of events that shouldn't be joking, which is what this movie did. If they would allow me to give a movie to this movie, I would have liked it. The play sucked and it looked like it was shot on an old VHS video camera from the 80's. Save your time and money by not watching this movie.
