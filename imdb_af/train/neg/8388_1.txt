Come on this heart-warming story of hope. Hope you never have to endure this terrible thing again. * cough * Razzie award * cough * <br /> <br /> I didn't make this movie because it was rude, predictable and inappropriate. While I was watching, I felt I was in a psychological experiment to determine how low film standards could get before people complained. When I requested my money back at the end of the film, I informed it because I watched the whole thing, "I wasn't entitled to compensation". I was told by the assistant manager that several people complained and had already received refunds. <br /> <br /> The movie summary is pretty basic. The midget thief steals a diamond and puts it as a baby to evade the police. However, this clever exposition presents a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious sketches. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Are you aware that people are affected by pans? Do you like jokes? Do you like to see midgets as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired breeds jokes? Do you think babies say "Going to go?" Are you shooting? <br /> <br /> If you answered yes to any of the above, this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been billed in some places as 'The Worst Movie of the Decade', there is probably a movie or 2 that is worse ... somewhere. I can't say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review, with only one star, will be the reviewer of the reviewer and then the review will not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This lowbrow comedy is meant for a less intelligent audience and I cannot recommend it with good conscience. Save your money for something funny. <br /> <br /> Respect
