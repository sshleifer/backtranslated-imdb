Note: I couldn't force myself to write a constructive review of Prom Night. It just can't be done. Instead, I went through what I thought about while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Things I thought about watching Prom Night: <br /> <br /> I'm so tired of those dreams where this extended death will take place, just for the main character to wake up before she bites it. Of course, when I say "extended deaths", I mean the screen throat or sting in the stomach. Didn't the whole "it's just a dream" thing ruined by Dallas? Talking, wondering if a few sticks in the gut will immediately cause death. <br /> <br /> The movie is just ten minutes away and I can already count the horror clips on two hands. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - Just after meeting the captain's boyfriend, I'm convinced he'll die. Anyone want to place bets? <br /> <br /> The killer in this movie is a teacher obsessed with the main character, Donna. (Incidentally, does anyone think "Donna" is a terrible name for a main character in a horror movie?) He spent three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and celebrating Donna's high school prom. While there is no taste bill, I seriously wonder who will take all the time to knock someone as dull as Donna. <br /> <br /> - High schools make proms happen at hotels and don't keep up with the students. Apparently, students can buy a hotel room perfectly and go in and out as they please. I think if this plot point was not in place, the movie would be bored for 90 minutes and bite them randomly when they went to the bathroom. I suppose the devotion to their excitement is my total boredom with everything. I've played "count the cold gum under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I'm just in the 20-minute point. How else will I entertain myself? <br /> <br /> - Don't forget milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> - Dear Writer: You used enough false scares to get through this movie and remember every other horror this year. <br /> <br /> The 1980 version of this movie was not so good, but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane, or at least The Godfather. It had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her many post-Halloween horror movies and it had a bit of a twist. I miss Jamie Lee. I wish she would act more. <br /> <br /> - At prom there isn't much dance going on. Instead, the girls come into battle with their boyfriends where they plan to attend the school. I hear that all these colleges are named by name, and I can't help but wonder who these scam girls should be cheating on. <br /> <br /> The killer must carry a really effective cleaning agent and wipe out his mess between scenes. It's the only logical explanation why he stabbed someone on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time someone was going to the hotel room, there were no traces of a fight. (On another side note: This is a very lazy killer. Michael Myers hunted for his victims.) <br /> <br /> It's official: the whole audience in the theater is stirring up the killer. What caused it? Was it when Donna went to her hotel room again, while sirens went to order everyone to leave the building? Was it her constant dreams, and how did she even start her actions to a tee? Or was it Brittany Snow's unconvincing performance? I'll have to say it was all of the above. <br /> <br /> -Okay, who has "died from the screen in the third action"? You win the pot. <br /> <br /> -Finally, the movie is over. My friend turned to me and said, "Donna wasn't too smart." It's the understatement of the week. Like saying that a tornado is a small storm, or a week-long power outage is a bit of a nuisance. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to go to Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone has given it a favorite review. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it. I refuse to recommend it. It's so lazy from a horror movie than any, and the only way to enjoy its cheese-smelling plot is if you're under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately for the theater makers, alcohol is not served. <br /> <br /> Rating: * from ****
