Some people don't like the animation. Personally, I think the animation was quite remarkable when this movie was done. There are many older cartoons I just love. My trouble with this movie is not the animation, but basically the way it is built. The characters are all just ... good, goofy. And for this movie they shouldn't be. Apparently, everyone in LOTR has a limping problem (for starters.) Just the way they acted generally annoyed me. My two sisters and I laugh at most of this movie. I think if many people saw it before they saw the latest, they would not have gone. I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy it. There are few movies that give me headaches. It was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, though it does. Or out there, depending on your view.
