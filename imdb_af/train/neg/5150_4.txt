I expected the DVD from the library to get a good idea of ​​how things are going in the background of a great opera production. I must say, I was very disappointed. The subject had so much potential. The sets in a Wagnerian production must necessarily be expanded and impressive, and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. Instead, we get it a hodgepodge of people's clips moving around big items of scenery, vaguely helping out with a comment that doesn't keep my attention. I listened myself mainly to the background cuts of music from operas. I was impressed by the enormous amount of effort needed to place such a production - it seemed pretty good and next time I'm on the opera. I'm sure I will remember the part as this video - but left with the lack of detailed comment and explanation.
