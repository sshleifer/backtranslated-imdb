It's not a good movie. Too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par. The 3D was OK, but not excellent. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young flies that want and follow adventure. The characters are missing, I don't really care about these characters and feel there was nothing to interest an adult. Pixar this is not. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see more special 3D effects. I also got used to seeing more flight disasters than the mother always says, "Lord of the flies". Pretty sexist to make the women look like women and go to bed.
