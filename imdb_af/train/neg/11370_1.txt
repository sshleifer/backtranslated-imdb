This video contains an excellent way to confuse and manipulate Americans on Islam. It is a pity that the people who did it really believe that American people are so stupid to believe it, perhaps as an American citizen, everyone should protest against this kind of crap. If you want to know the truth about Islam, don't let anyone tell you. THE QURAN IS PUBLIC! you can read it yourself and decide if it is true or false ... <br /> <br /> The video uses many audiovisual strategies aimed at manipulating and associating things that are not even related. The music used on some points prepares the public to hate what they see, even if they don't really understand what's going on. They use images that are misplaced from their original content. <br /> <br /> To end the comment, I'd like to make a reflection ... Don't you think you can have the same exact movie with every religion in the world?
