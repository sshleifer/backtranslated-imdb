After watching KHAKEE, I felt I would see another good movie, but unfortunately. The movie is a joke and is actually trying hard to introduce Aryeman. Afterall is his father, Keshu, the manufacturer. <br /> <br /> RKS talked so much about the film during the promotions, saying the movie has flesh as opposed to movies released that time, I wonder what movies it is talking about. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually a typical Masala movie with lots of comedy, romance, action, everything has jumbled <br /> <br /> The ease with which the kids kidnap the family is one of those Funniest parts ever. Imagine kidnapping the kidnapping of Dawood's family <br /> <br /> The end is a complete stumbling block with sudden change of characterization <<br /> <br /> RKS gives its worst movie to date, except some Bachchan screens. The movie is a drill. <br /> <br /> Music is boring. <br /> <br /> Amitabh is trying to play the role of his role. He does his part well, though not his best, although he sees his face too much when he pulls a trigger and does a strange look while smoking the cigar hok. The double is not correct at times <br /> <br /> Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats his act and hammers <br /> <br /> Aryeman looks expressionless, trying too hard, but overdoing it in a few scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika is the best of the lot <br /> <br /> The rest is good
