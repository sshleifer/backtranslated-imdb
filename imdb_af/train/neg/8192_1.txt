Well, I have to say, this movie was so bad I went out if I didn't have to review it for work. And the worst part is, I wanted to see it so badly that I was driving anywhere in the city, paying $ 10 parking twice because the newspaper was wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I saw him playing someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. Anyway, the plot has potential - it sounds good in the preview, but it's full of completely ridiculous, predictable, poor plot turning points. And I was hoping it would be one Christmas movie where Christmas wasn't to be saved, and Santa didn't need a replacement, but not. The only cool part was the sleigh rides, and the little leaf was the best character. I'm sure this movie will be great for young kids, but for adults it is so nice that it's chore to go through.
