An ever-ending madness of clever visual irony does not necessarily create an engaging movie. The "Blonde Wedge" half of the movie never appeared, perhaps due to too much self-denial by its creators. <br /> <br /> The Wong Faye half (with a lot of playful, watch Karen Carpenter, Faye Wong) is much more appealing. All the ingredients are there, but the girl-meeting boy story element takes a back seat for artificial cleverness. Character development is uneven. Emotion is missing. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, Wong Faye's "Mung Jung Yun" (Cantonese version of the Cranberry's smash hit "Dreams") is effectively used in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also has a Mandarin language version called "Zhen Tuo." Logged. Both are on CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" is found on the official movie soundtrack CD.
