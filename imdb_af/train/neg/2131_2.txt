I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (as this film was pronounced), but this one failed me. For me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I quickly lost interest. I feel sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for joining this movie. I will be a fan of everyone, but only time can feel my healing. The one thing I can say positively about the movie is that Hillary played Yonica's character so well that I didn't even recognize Hillary; It took me a few scenes to realize that it was her. Luckily I rented it for $ 1 through Red Box; If I paid to see it on the big screen, I would really be fuming !!
