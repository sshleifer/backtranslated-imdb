I looked at the other comments and was thoroughly amused to make it clear that only people who actually worked on the movie commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, it shows a little. "Pioneers" are a bit at the top. It's a Boston-based college production that doesn't even reach the level of most amateur college movies. That's what you'll expect a lot of kids to do. A silly action movie without much creativity. It's pretty funny if you're willing to do fun with it. Not something you'll ever see unless you're a student at Emerson College.
