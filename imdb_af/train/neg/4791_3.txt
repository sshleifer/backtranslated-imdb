* Spolers * do not read further if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Pick up after depressing "Phantasm II"; The longman kidnapped Mike while Reggie and the new child Tim were trying to spend most of the rest of the movie getting him back, not as slaves on the Tall Man's "Red Planet". This one gets really stupid: the thief of thieves in the bright pink hearse was just there for comic relief. The black karate chick (can't remember her name) was so annoying that I couldn't wait to see if the Langman had killed. her character. This one almost seems like it will be Tim's character, coming late and eventually being the hero, but ... it doesn't quite work like that. By the end of this story, Liz was beheaded by the killers, Mike implanted a silver ball into his skull. The spheres get Reggie and the dwarves get Tim, and there is no one to stop the long man. The bad guy wins - now, how does it surprise for a surprise at the end? <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1993 and derived until 1995. The end of this one was final at the time, and although disappointing and anticlimactic it was also an appropriate and appropriate end for this strange little series. But the fourth one changes this end and adds nothing new but more bad jokes, and an even worse and more stupid end. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
