I never want to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I have to get very hard on it. Talking about Vivah, this man, Sooraj Badjatya, completely lost it. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so cheesy that Badjatyas Johanna and Chopras left behind. <br /> <br /> There wasn't a single moment in the movie where I could say 'Oh! at least this thing is good '. Aloknath does clich√© in a role of Girl's father, Shahid kapor looks bold and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster, except ugly sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, tough actors, cacophonic background music. , cheap soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Now, the spoiler, I warn you that happens in all his other movies, after a disastrous movie on a happy note ends.
