Movie has some good acting and good moments (though, of course, reasonably low budget), but poor rating due to the fact that the basic premise is poorly developed. The main point of conflict between the two leaders does not have to be realistic at all. There are a few scenes where they disagree, but no discussion of a great depth that would explain how they can be together while the world is seen so differently, especially as Glenn's work is so in this part of his life has been contracted. (And Adam is active enough with her that he supports it with time and money.) Several times, Glenn is negatively portrayed because he is the way he is (apologizing to Adam for his past), while Adam is proven to be sincere and traditional is. , "which the film finally states to be the" good "way. I don't like to be preached. I attended a discussion session with the director after I looked at LTR and he said he was having this conflict between them offered, because if he was in Glenn's shoes (and he said he is in real life, it is related to Glenn's view) that he can never date anyone with Adam's views. had to have done a much better job and explained how Glenn could do it in the movie. Director also said he first directed it, after reading, Directing For Dummies. but far from an upper end, I've seen worse, but I rarely let movies feel that it is frustrated.
