As a film student I want to think I've seen a variety of movies, some good and bad, but I'd have to say that 'Summer rain' is the distant movie I've ever seen! I chose the movie in the hope that it would be a great British classic, such as 'Secrets and Lies' or 'Lockstock', but oh no it was so bad that my apartment was talking and I eventually laughed and curled up at the ridiculous play and cheesy script (reminds me of a bad 'theater in education' school production). The main characters Michelle and Gary have begun to accept us from the beginning. 'Michelle', the main character living with her two friends, has the kind of face you would never get tired of sleeping and Gary was so wet (he broke every five minutes in tears) that I really did at the end of the film was not one of them condemned. All I could think of was, "I paid Â£ 3 for this pole." I have never written a review, but after watching this movie, it has prompted me to warn people of this disastrous production. So avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.
