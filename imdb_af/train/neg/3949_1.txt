I have a DVD of "Bogeyman" and this stunker was an extra feature. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was linked to the original. But you know what they say about those who "accept": it makes an "ass" from "you" and "me". I read before reading that BII contains many footage of the original and that it has actress Love. Looking at the "Return of the Boogeyman", I decided to hold onto the original footage to see the infamous death-to-toothbrush scene. Before I knew it, the movie was over. Tear off. I think I thought it was BII because it has a similar title on one of BII's alternative titles. Oh yes, at least it was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my error and start talking about the movie's mistakes. Many, many, mistakes. Who does this old Ulli What does he think? He really thinks the same movie will sell in different forms. There is nothing original owned Part III up there. It's basically a springboard from the original through the eyes of a psychic, which gives us a worse boring play-by-play, as everything happens. It's the movie. Oh, and a star-for-stereo scene, but you can read it from someone's review. My interest in Boogeyman II has been lost forever. <br /> <br /> Final Note: It's not a series of movies to look back on.
