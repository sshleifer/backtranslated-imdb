It's not as funny and stingy as the DVD boxing claims. I really love twisted and cruel movies, but this one is really boring! It's an hour of penis detached, Baby Born dolls flying and lots of rape! I think the intention of this amateur sleaze was to make It's a bad-it-good movie, but it failed. It's just bad! A few scenes are ok, but overall it's a mess. If you like amateur like this one (Only way better), I would recommend Andreas Schnass's Amazing Shit 2 and 3.
