This movie was absolute torture. First of all, it's a great 4+ hour long! The Kargil War probably had several points captured and fought, but each of the battles does not have to be shown. So maybe it's a documentary, not a commercial movie as advertised. Certainly it didn't seem as enough background information was not provided and there were errors. The battle order was so poorly executed. I was terribly disappointed by the man who donated good rows in Border. Each battle was exactly the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (It may be a waster.) The whole army marshall up, five or so soldiers swear five thousand times each (they also use the same scratchword each time), one of the lead players being shot, someone shouting for a carrier, the actor says, "No, don't get a portable. It'll take 6 men from the battalion," and then an actor dies. That exactly the same thing happens over and over and over. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The movie of the movie is too big for its own good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters were well developed. The actresses had minimal roles. They are all dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were synchronized. It was so comical. They moved their hands and heads exactly the same time and then bitten their dupatta together. <br /> <br /> The list just goes on and on. I know I forget something. Anyway, I think I have based the movie enough to get the picture.
