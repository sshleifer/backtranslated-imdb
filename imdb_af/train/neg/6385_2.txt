Gayniggers from outer space are pretty much summed up by his name. Running only 27 minutes, it describes a spacecraft of gay blacks coming to Earth to free the men of women. Seeing a little meaningful for the plot is also very illogical. Granted, it's meant to be a comedy / ghost on society and science fiction. I laughed myself several times, so it succeeds. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. When the spaceship floats above Earth, you can see the stars without a clear reason. The asteroids shown in the beginning seem fake, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several spelling errors in the text, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are messed up; In general, the whole thing doesn't take seriously. If you are over all the things that make it a bad movie, it is very accessible and easy to see through to the end. Some parts are hilarious. Although the only thing you are left with is remembering, it is one of the most ridiculous concepts ever. <br /> <br /> Since it's a short movie and has some funny aspects, it's not the worst to see. But it is illogical and has little long-term value. I can't really recommend it; If you see it, do it for the unique concept, not the quality.
