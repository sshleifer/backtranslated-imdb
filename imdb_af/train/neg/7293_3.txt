Aaron Spelling made it for television westerns who were terribly plotted for a seventy-three-minute movie. It plays like a likely failed serial shed. <br /> <br /> Handsome Clint Walker is American Marshal Dave Harmon, who walks in the Yuma, Arizona area, in time to kill one of the local bigwig farmer's brothers. a route. <br /> <br /> Walker takes the other brother to jail. Walker also meets a "cute" homeless Mexican child sleeping at the prison house. One night, Andres slumbered when a villain and another man dressed in Army blue took the remaining brother in the street and killed him, and the Walker murdered. Not good for your first 24 hours at work. Walker visits the local army and arranges the chains of the commander. The bigwig hears of his brothers' deaths and returns to the village in time to get his chains. The local indigenous people, who are briefly changed by the army on their beef, are also attracted to the chain area. With all these chains, Walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner. The army involved in the murder is dead, the local cattle buyer is involved, the Indians do a lot of repugnant speech, and the climax leads to an unlikely performance, as Walker has to prove the villain the villain is a boss had. , somebody we think is too helpful. <br /> <br /> There is a semi-subplot that includes the death of Walker's family in the hands of Army raiders, and I think it would be the power behind the series, it was picked up. Instead, the movie suddenly ends, and I've still been waiting for next week's exciting episode. Due to the fade-outs for non-commercial commercial break, the pacing is off and the story is in the pipeline. <br /> <br /> Walker is attractive, robust and has a voice deeper than a well. The rest of the film is full of television actors you probably saw in other television films. Much of the action is pretty lame, and the violence is lukewarm. The first brother to be killed gets a shotgun explosion, and falls without a scratch on him. I didn't expect "Reservoir Dogs", but it's the wrong movie to use to teach kids about the gossip of guns! When you talk about children, the Mexican child goes very fast from "cute" to "aneurysm-invasive annoyance". <br /> <br /> If you don't like Western, you won't like Yuma. If you like westerners, you'll still love "Yuma". I can't recommend it. <br /> <br /> It is indefinite but contains physical violence and gun violence. <br /> <br />
