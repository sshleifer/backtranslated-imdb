A semi-conscious attempt to bring Elvis Presley into contemporary times, but despite a sexy scene and a pseudo-Playboy magazine subplot, Presley is surrounded by the same, old, clipping clich√©s. A woman chooses E.P. on the beach and then continue to take over his life - and he doesn't care! Dick Sargent is disturbing in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Try hard as Elvis's two bosses (he's moonlight, you see). Some of the songs are pretty good, especially Almost in Love, but if you want to see a looser, hipper, updated Elvis sex comedy - look elsewhere. When Elvis and his fatal attraction go to sleep, there is actually a wooden board between them! Really get it. ** of ****
