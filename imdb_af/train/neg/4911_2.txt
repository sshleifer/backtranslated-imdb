First To The 2003 <br /> <br /> I would first admit my mistake: I didn't realize it was a TV movie. I was "thrown" by the "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the film is about 40 minutes long. The direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part, the cast was exceptional and had a good job with their characters. The back of the movie is that it definitely falls into the "chick flick" genre. Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should call an R rating. There is no nudity or free sex scene. Actually, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all guests at the SG-1 series, but this movie did nothing to promote their careers, as they were all used as low-level supporting actresses . Robert Patrick was fantastic, as usual, and Mitch Pileggi reminded me of a contemporary Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher, who I regarded as an actor during the Millennium Series, gave nothing challenging to show her abilities. The biggest disappointment with the cast was Tracy Pollan. Apart from an under-average actress and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I touched the TV during the dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Lifetime TV type programs. I would not recommend paying any money to watch this movie. Since I didn't find anything that would cause censorship, it's a movie worth watching only on television, as nothing will be cut out. As a TV movie I would consider it a 5 out of 10. As a movie with a "R" certification and like a strong roll, I rate it as 2 out of 10.
