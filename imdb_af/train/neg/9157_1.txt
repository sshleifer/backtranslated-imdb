Your first idea of ​​being a cheese film is that it was shot on video, not movie. The story is over, and the production is incredibly messy. For example, note that when the title pair is on a plane that is supposed to land in Vermont, where they will celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony, the plane is shown at an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palms, which will not last five minutes in the New England climate. On another plane trip, the founding ship shows off a FedEx cargo plane. Presumably they could only afford to manage. Regarding the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, the divine Christian brother of Arthur, is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his brother is gay. Not only that, but the pastor eventually puts Victor up with a hit, to have Ben and Arthur murdered to cleanse their souls from sin. Apparently, no one in this church ever heard of the Ten Commandments. If it wasn't for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this movie won't have redeeming qualities at all.
