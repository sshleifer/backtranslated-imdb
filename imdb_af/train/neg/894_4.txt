I just saw it yesterday at the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before I came here, I came here to see how it was named, and then it was 7.4, a nice, good rate ... After 15 minutes I died to get out (never done that not), but was ashamed to do so, because the movie producer was in the show. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it, the dialogue was shallow and nowhere else, the characters are shallower than the windows, nothing goes anywhere and the worst and worst: many Siemens and Organics commercials on the movie . In spite of the fact that I have already paid to go to the movie and entertain me, I still have to be bombarded by the main character talking on the internet and Siemens's cell phone beats all the time; or another character who has a bath or hair cut just to display Organic shampoo on the screen! All these things would be bearable if the plot, characters, romance anything good, but was bad, really bad! A "Do not know how to do" sex-in-the-city. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money.
