I knew I would be in an "interesting" time for the 14th season of the Baccalaureus ("On the Wings of Love"). I looked at some of the past seasons of the Bachelor in passing; watch an episode or two and miss the next three or so. I find that the Bachelor is often attractive and intriguing, although its quality and morality are often lacking. <br /> <br /> "On the Wings of Love" is the journey that Jake, a 31-year-old commercial pilot from Dallas, Texas, has to find true love, as truly a love as one can find in a season-long reality-drama dating show. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. He started to get to know them a little, but it is mostly superficial; how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minutes? Jake tries to reveal his true intentions from the beginning, at least for the audience. He noticed that he didn't just want love or a good time, but he wants a fianc√©e or wife. We can only accept that he also made it clear to the women in the competition. If that is the case, it can explain the behavior of women in some cases. The women are super competitive. While they don't even know Jake at all, they are still winning it, regardless of the cost. <br /> <br /> Not only were women competitive, but also confident and caring. "Watch out!" Threats, Step Back and Warnings everyone shows that these women were not there either. Jake noticed that he was not just looking for sex appeal, but was looking for a "connection". However, the girls both stopped to impress Jake with the sexual appeal. They arrived at home in skimpy dresses ?? either low cut or short. <br /> <br /> While some girls wanted to keep their feelings of decorum, others totally missed the memo. One girl, Channy, noticed that Jake was a "good guy" to whom she could be a "naughty girl". She further said that Jake could land on her runway at any time. She cut some of the other girls for her challenging statement that shows them these situations. <br /> <br /> So, a reality data show can't be that bad, can it? In addition to the obvious issue of sex-driven appeal, there are other issues that cause this seemingly innocuous display. Is it the right way to find a future mate; to fight someone's attention by disturbing yourself to extreme relationships? Unfortunately, however, what America has reduced to this day: pleasure and sex without commitment and some luck on the side. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment that many of the girls are bound to Jake. A few girls in particular were too exaggerated. One girl said, "If I don't get the first impression, it'll kill me!" As mentioned before, they didn't even know him and she talked about a particular rose, not just one of the 15 roses to eliminate. <br /> <br /> In particular, Michelle seems to have some attachment problems to Jake. The other girls also noticed it. After a certain Michelle outburst, Vienna alleged that Michelle had a "mental break and we were just an hour here." Michelle had the last rose of the evening on the first show? narrow dissolution is missing ?? and was very emotional about it. The other girls thought it was simply ridiculous. Another girl also cried, but because she was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor, and from there did it just go down? reality tv. It shows our entertainment interests as a country; If we didn't watch the programs and gave them good ratings, the networks wouldn't keep them running. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of America is addicted. One thing is clear: America (in general) loves reality TV and subsequent stampings. <br /> <br /> It asks me to ask: why is it that we even want TV reality? What is that about us? Is it because we see the similarities with our own lives, or is it because we want to be sure we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Whatever it is that we draw upon, we must be careful about the media and entertainment that allows us to fill our minds. I'm not saying that all reality TV shows are bad; However, I say we have to evaluate each one. <br /> <br /> Episodes used for criticism: Season Premier and Episode 2.
