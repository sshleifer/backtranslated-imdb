The good thing about this is at least fresh: almost no movies about dance music and the club scene (if even made) had the theater. And it also radiates a lot of energy, from the music to the portrayal of Ibiza. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that it can't decide what it wants. Although it's definitely a mockumentary in line with This is Spinal Tap, the makers also realized they didn't want to play copycat. However, it fails roughly because it is not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped. And it has no bow in its writing and directing it to 90 minutes, so why not change it to 75? The production department and cinematography still try to save the day (eg Paul's house). In a strange way and unexpectedly. It's all gone. Pete Tong works much better than a simple drama in the line of almost familiar. Especially the plays with Beatriz Batarda offer some acting power. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's a mess, it entertaines a bit at a basic level, but you better give an evening to your favorite club.
