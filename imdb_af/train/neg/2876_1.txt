I question the motives of the creators of this fictional version of the BTK killer's motives. Are they portraying animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible? Don't they think the people involved in this monster are injured enough? What a blatant disrespect and exploitation of victims! It was like a personality experiment: What saves you more, the butchery or human murders? They used real names of some of the victims .... this movie was abhorrent, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this movie use this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to wake up and revive the line!
