'Masters of Horror' has proven a poor arena for 'message episodes', and while Joe Dante's 'Screwfly Solution' (one of the best episodes of the series, period) can make a definite case, most attempts to do so to do as an anvil-heavy and unimportant (nothing disregards horror more than a soapbox). And 'Pro-Life' simply collects reactionary views with ultra-violence; Young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), who is seen by the bushes, is almost hit by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who are only working at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a rock, outreach sacred role that will do everything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. If there is nothing else, Pro-Life has been a bit rushed for its controversial issue, but John Carpenter deals with this whole venture with exciting indifference. He looks even less interested in a movie than the script itself (which is indeed poor); the slow pacing does not build up tension and simply brings the overall plot to a crawl. Even when Dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, guns are burning, it's a beautiful non-event; Later, when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion', the scene comes out unnecessarily and unnecessarily - an attempt to fill out the underwritten film. The poor performances (Perlman is unfortunately wasted here), become a root of the writing, and the Carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if 'Pro-Life' is the source of his next hot meal. By the time a spider-like creature with a human head and a man in a latex monster suit were testing the aisles, just wonder what the thoughts behind this mess were.
