Foywonder's review of this cheap STV hits the nail square on the head. Make sure you read it. If you don't, a group of scientists in the deep bush of the Pacific Ocean are heading north to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal. The Big Foot family does not take it kindly and continues to pick up the team one by one, mainly screen off. Big Foot itself has a clear monkey-like face, but is less scary than Harry of HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the movies have the wood, generic actors pretending to turn scientists around and move away. This is a non-budget movie in which very little happens, at least on the screen. We look at the sexiest of the females while watching one of her male companions, but nothing comes of it.
