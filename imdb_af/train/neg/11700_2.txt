I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but after watching it, I was very disappointed. The best bit was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk cannot act to save his life and neither of the others. Some of the shows even made me laugh aloud! The movie wasn't like I imagined it, after reading the book that was wonderful, I thought it was darker and much more frightening. If I were Stephen, I would really be angry! <br /> <br /> I don't know why they've changed the end, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you're just the cake that killed your daughter, won't you feed it to anyone else? <br /> <br /> Book was so much better!
