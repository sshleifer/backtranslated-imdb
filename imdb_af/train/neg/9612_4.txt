To the end, the bad guys have the upper hand - always - what kind of power the good guys compromise. A few innocent-man-accused-of-a-crime plots are annoying. A few unnecessary dialogues discussing several dull legal issues. It's just a mediocre stupid oldest, so what is this nonsense to keep things realistic? Cagney's atypical western presence is one of the few - if not the only - entertaining thing about the movie. Somewhere in the middle there is a ridiculous proposal for marriage; kind of like "Where is the child hiding? Where is he?! ... Oh, and by the way, do you want to marry me?"
