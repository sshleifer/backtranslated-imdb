Imagine the scenario - you're just in the movie because you're in Washington this weekend and it's raining and you've finished the Museums. You think you might see the Sarah Marshall movie because the trailer looks so and you don't have to get your brain involved. It's sold out. Options? - The Bank Job, In Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom Night. You've seen the Bank Job (incredibly decent heist movie) and in Bruges (again, pretty good), so you're up to two. You don't like watching Clooney, or the nice one from the office is running around in the 1930s, so you're going to see Prom Night right? Wrong. You take the $ 8.50, walk to a stranger in the street and ask him to face you for $ 8.50. It will be better spent money. <br /> <br /> It's actually more of a comedy than a horror / thriller or whatever. If I fund that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I don't know if I should laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence ... my roommate laughed most of the movie out loud, and for the acting they might have thrown robots (or maybe dogs) into the roles, they would have been more realistic. The detective may have to be the worst actor I've ever seen. Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his play so much, I don't care how you play his name). You are relieved about your title (s). <Br /> <br /> So summary 'not good'
