There is nothing new here. All the standard romantic comedy scenes, even up to the taxi to the airport to keep the woman away. The only thing that saved it was the actions of Alison Eastwood and some of the little characters (shiny and you'd miss Gabrielle Anwar), which of course had fun. <br /> <br /> Turn it off when the pair is. in bliss, and you will not have to go through the inevitable plot pain.
