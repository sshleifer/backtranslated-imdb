I see Stuart Bliss the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and the plot ridiculous. I get the fact that the main character's wife left him, caused a spiritual collapse, but it became so stupid and boring. After a while I could have warned less of any characters. <br /> <br /> The movie continues over and over the same ideas without something fresh or surprising to add to the plot. The whole thing with the Geiger counter became too much after a while after Stuart opened his wall to see what was behind, after the counter indicated that there was something. <br /> <br /> Then there were the repetitive scenes with the flyer and the confusing kids where he met himself. <br /> <br /> I had to guess that this movie was a flop when I didn't recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie comes, read a book! You'll be better off.
