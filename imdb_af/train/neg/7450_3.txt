I saw this movie at the cinema many years ago and one thing surprised me so badly that I couldn't see the virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was thrown as a policeman who never smiles or smiles while she smiles and smiles two of his brands. Danny Glover was cast as the bad man, but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough to believe in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not credible as the former drug student. The tension was just not there, because the killer was known very early. The final was again, not dramatic or tense: nobody around me cared about what would happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing evening spent at the theater.
