Fox's "The True Story of Jesse James" (1957) is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James". I'm not sure where the mistake lies, but the decisive role in this version of the two central characters, the uneven direction of Nicholas Ray and the ham-fisted script must surely have something to do with it. <br /> <br /> In the late thirties and forties, Tyrone Power was Fox's leading man, but in the fifties his star began to decline and the studio Darryl Zanuck began caring for new winner Robert Wagner. It was a big mistake on Zanuck's part because Wagner was less than a fit replacement. With the possible exceptions of "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Tween Heaven & Hell" (1956), it is difficult to think of Wagner who distinguishes himself in anything! Jeffrey Hunter was also nothing but a Fox contract player before being assigned to play Frank James for Wagner's Jesse in "The True Story Of Jesse James". From the studio of the previous year, this actor's one distinctive point is his excellent and revealing performance in John Ford's classic "The Searchers". But she's playing here, with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers, nothing boring. No player brings any personality or color to their respective roles. They miss the point completely without the charisma and attraction that Power and Fonda displayed in the original. The movie is also spoiled by too many flashbacks and with Wagner, like the Robin Hood of the American West, it comes as a charmless introverted twit that you don't have to give. The supporting role is hardly worth mentioning, but it is unfortunate to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead barely looks at when Ma James sees. <br /> <br /> The best aspects of these uncompromising westerners are the wonderful Cinemascope / Color cinematography by great Joe McDonald and the excellent music performance by the underrated and little-known composer Leigh Harline!
