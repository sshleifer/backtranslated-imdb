I must say I hated this movie. I don't like to say because Gerard Butler is in it. About half an hour of a boring conversation, sorry for everyone who actually cares about the plot, I started to move forward to Gerry's scene. I really don't know the end, I was so bored. If Gerry wasn't in it, I probably did one of two things: fell asleep or turned it off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie, as he is with most of his previous films. If you're a fan of Gerry's, don't worry, he's just as nice and precious as he always is, but if you really want to see the movie for the plot, good luck because you will need it, or lots of coffee or soft drinks to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's just because the casting director had the sense to put Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea how to spell his name!
