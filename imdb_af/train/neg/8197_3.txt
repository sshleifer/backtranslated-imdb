I saw this movie tonight and I have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he ends even more annoyingly funny and the movie is more than a remake of the crappy 80's classic "Santa Claus the movie", but with the camp or the bad Sheena Easton song at the end. The story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family coming back to see his family for the holiday kind of things, but with the North Pole as his environment. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the family coming home after a series of setbacks that include his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a cameo role), and he comes home to meet his parents and his more successful brother Santa . Claus (Paul Giamatti) and wacky high jinks follow with a little sibling rivalry and a little anarchy that threatens all Christmas. Now if you think you know the end of this movie, I think you'll be right, because it is predictable for the mountain. Regarding the acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same beloved loser he always plays, but this time he finishes more annoyingly than nice, Miranda Richardson plays. Claus, but the role is more than one note. Elizabeth Banks plays Santa's assistant, but she is not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and arm Kevin Spacey basically ends playing the same person he plays in the movie "Glengarry Glen Ross", but a little more anal . The only two actors who come out of the film with their dignity are Paul Giamatti, who warms up a true sincerity and warmth to his role as Santa Claus, but he seems a bit embarrassed to be in the movie and you can't do it not guilty and Rachel Weisz, who does much more with a very small role than most of the lead players with theirs. This is a pity because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti have earned much better than this writing. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell, a big disappointment.
