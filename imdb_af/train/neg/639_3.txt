The cliché of the shocked soldier's house of war is tainted here. Sorry, a wonderful rollercoaster acting on the bounds of their high talents cannot redeem the return of the soldier from its solid lack of inability to move the viewer to emotional engagement. Best moments, as another reviewer noticed, come when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; But even Jackson's cracked good movie does not pull off the movie's chestnuts from his cold, never hot fireplace. Ann-Margret, his sex-kitten reputation and too often accused of the lack of acting ability, finds her real and rather profound wastage here - despite her speaking with an impeccable Middlesex accent. The cut score, which is delivered to many frightened TV miniseries slathered-on-saccharine emotionalism, is at an annoying chance with the emotional distances of writing, blocking and over-baked formality of the direction; Except for his score and corseted script and direction, 'The Return of the Soldier' ​​has all the right bits, but it fails to let them work together.
