No laugh whatsoever. Yes, I watched this whole train track, but just so I wouldn't want to wonder later if Cleese came to his senses in the last part. (No, he didn't.) <br /> <br /> It could be interesting for you young people out there, to see that British "humor" included thirty black jokes like this thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What's even more surprising is reading the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge that it's not very good, but then turn around and give high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies you've seen are even worse than this one, then I'm sorry for your painful existence. <br /> <br /> The humor level of this show looks like small children, but the subject is not. So who is it for? People who enjoy repeated and prolonged doubles, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other "low" humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were also a child for me. They made an effort to make jokes work. However, it was detached. I fear that this is the end of civilization, if these things are really accepted as worthwhile. Next you will tell me that tabloid TV is popular. :(
