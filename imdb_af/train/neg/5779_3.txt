I saw this movie a few days ago. What was hell? <br /> <br /> I love movies with Brian O'Halloran, they're funny and enjoyable. When I saw a name for this title and genre, I thought well, it might be really good ... a parody for slashers or other gore movies ... but ... then I read and thought of a preview right, that might be good ... but it wasn't ... my opinion: if they look movies, they look like documentaries, with a little comedy trying Moore's movies or Alien autopsy, they're really about something . this one was empty. <br /> <br /> Put a comedy on the title ... no comment ... really bad joke
