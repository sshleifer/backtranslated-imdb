I almost just made it through one episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was quiet and rounded, and it was fair. The acting was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite his best efforts to be dramatic, usually remains expressionless. His eyebrows indicate a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could just as easily play the girl in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical gear in the plot, mostly random, winding plot. Cheesy special effects can be excused given the TV miniseries budget. But try to create tension and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the incompatibility. I get the feeling that the end was supposed to be sensible and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. Comparing it to the overall quality of something else, I would put this episode of Nightmares and Dreamscapes in the same way as the NBC's Hercules.
