Actually, it was pretty funny ... in a "god, how hell made this movie" kind of way. If you enjoy the life of movies ... what I do well ... watch and watch ... but if you actually think, is it a good movie? 'eff. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie sucked the scene with the worst acting I've ever seen in any movie .... usually they get five minutes in it before you realize "this movie can suck" but no, you know right from the bat. This movie talks about Edgar Allen's poem ... never tried to explain it, to people who did not memorize puppy's life story ... so I don't know if any of what was said is fact. <br /> This movie is about an author's "ethan poet" with his cousin "ann". They are both descendants of Edgar all over ... or are they?!? Apparently, people give one what their ancestors did. this man ethan poet is actually ethan "usher", which is supposed to be descendants of the "home of the army" story written by Edgar Allen Poe. Ann's brother sometimes appears to rape her ... Ann also gets stuck at one point in the movie by three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... they are screaming at her as she walks and she doesn't even realize ). The characters being murdered are pointing to the end of trying to save the day .... but they can't. In the end, Ann shoots etan while trying to kill her best friend. Of course, before she shoots him, she should never scream. this movie should never be seen again!
