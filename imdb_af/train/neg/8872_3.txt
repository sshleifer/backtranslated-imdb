Big Payne was not very good at all. Despite the fact that it was funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the acting was poor. Groot Payne's voice and temperament were particularly annoying. The idea was ridiculous and the things that the boys had to do in that movie were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
