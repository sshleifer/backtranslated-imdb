If it's supposed to be the black experience, leave me at the front or back door. <br /> <br /> One mama's son sees 2 young bonnets one day, and from then on he is completely hilly. Angela Bassett, the one shining grace in this film, she plays on protective, religious mother. In spite of her anger about how his life turned, in the middle of the picture, she really decided to accept it. She allowed his friends to come in and suddenly it was right to use the curse as long as it wasn't for the children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad situation regarding gangster rap. You knew where this movie was going. <br /> <br /> I literally laughed aloud as Bassett accompanied her son's body for fun, saying that while his life was cut at age 24, he became a man. Which man? He was a convicted criminal, wrote the most horrific rap music with constant vulgarity, and the contemptuous society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that he, as a sanitation worker, earns more than the teacher, is a perfect example of what happens in our schools. The complete and total lack of respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> The east coast, west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained. All we see is guns burning. <br /> <br /> A terrible picture does nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible role models are these rap singers and their dirty music. The African American community must, in essence, show itself. Who was this classless vet who portrayed Biggie? He made Rerun look like the old television program. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that changed this thin little one into the vulgar monster he was. What a sad state of affairs when it is called a movie entertainment.
