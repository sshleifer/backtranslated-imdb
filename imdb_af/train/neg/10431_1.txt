I loved the first season. The quality came down a little in the second season, which, however, had a good hub (Pegasus!). Third season was fairly novel and original and was OK. The fourth season quickly began to descend because they never even started to give us explanations when we really needed it. What was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the point of Angel-Kara who led the fleet to a devastated Earth 1? What kind of past did the last five cylinders have, and how did they survive or were they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere. <br /> <br /> Then comes the end. Earth 2 (our Earth) in the past. Well, okay. But destroy the fleet?! Give technology up and give any kind of urban life, and spread a few thousand people paper-thin across the planet? It's not just anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show then seems to be that mankind is forever trapped in a cycle that goes from nature romance to a decadent capitalist society that destroys A.I. it ruins everything. It is without vision, without hope for a greater future for humanity, and that is antithetical to proper science fiction. And don't start me on the angels first! Religious patch of the worst kind! The ultimate disappointment! <br /> <br /> The whole "everything happened before and will happen again". The thing had to be related to the previous incarnation of the series, not just to the Earth as we know it. Making the new show somehow consistent with the guy would be the definite stroke of genius. Frenchman shame. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
