If derivative and predictable rape generators are your thing, then you are dealing with a rare treat ... They are not really doing me, so I couldn't find one thing to leave this strange story. It looked like something straight from the 1980s, another age when it was going straight to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are doing OK work with a poor script and a boring scenario. But what does Gillian Anderson do to get involved in a movie like this after the glamor of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV Bleak House adaptation last year? The director said he was influenced by a rape and seeing his work on documentaries, but even that is not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural dogs sustained Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in the theater that was laughing. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this movie - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in several major independent British films in recent years. Forget distributing Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads does not deserve to be named in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers who will make your artistic judgment? It's a great spot on both of your reputations. Listen carefully: Can you hear the thousands of independent British film fans crying in despair?
