There is only one thing I must say about this movie - the scene where Shaq wants to be in a musical number with Francis Capra's character about a genius; Never see this movie. The story is terrible, the acting is terrible (it's, Shaq!) And I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy (just as horrible) before I ever see this movie.
