It's a good thing I didn't watch it while I was pregnant. I would definitely cry out and / or vomit. It was kind of gruesome, especially disturbing. I personally thought the baby was in its own twisted way. But as a mother I clipped when Beth stabbed her in the stomach and when Virgina didn't stab the child during her 3rd trimester with rusty tools. Even as an animal lover almost cried when she scratched the cat on a bloody pulp. How rude and sinister like the baby, I was rooting to live. And so distorted like the movie, I'm very shocked to see the sequel ...... ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... ... ..
