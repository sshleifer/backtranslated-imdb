I don't get the score for The Amati Girls and I think I really love and give it a 4 out of 10. What else could have been a wonderful story, actually a set of more or less decent actors, has a total danger in my eyes. There are so many cliches in that movie, the women's hair is just awful and most of the screens are more than unrealistic or resemble. There is no real passion in this movie, but a bunch of actors who rise over the bounds that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. If I see this, I couldn't believe how something like that made to my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But. Maybe it was still OK, and it just translated into translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen and it's definitely not in a good way! Sorry.
