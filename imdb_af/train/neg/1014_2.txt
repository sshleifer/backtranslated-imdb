Timberlake's show almost attacked the screen. It wasn't bad, I just think the reporter's role was wrong for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the typical rapper role, the toughest, worst guy. I don't think the crack has a smile in the whole movie, even when suggested to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman almost carried the whole movie. He has some funny scenes that are the highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey wasn't good or bad, he was just there. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a Deaf movie. bad plot. very bad acting or wrong roles for actors.
