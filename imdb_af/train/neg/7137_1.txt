The cars in this movie are wonderful. The acting in this movie is terrible. The plot and management styles don't make much sense and are just as bad. If you are really bothered by movies where someone is shifting and suddenly ridiculously quick, save yourself the trouble and money. Good movie for racing? Well, there's a part where they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally driver. If you can't tell the difference, look, you'll have an explosion. It really comes down here, there are really lots of nice cars in this movie, they are terribly managed and are totally unrealistic. The acting is terribly mainly due to the extremely bad plot. If you want to see hot girls, call mtv or vh1 instead. I'm disappointed that such beautiful cars will be represented in such a bad movie. If the class of cars were to match that of the movie, they would have to ride with rusty bikes.
