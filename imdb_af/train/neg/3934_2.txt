Look forward to seeing this movie and see how these great actors act. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the writing and the whole story of the story. David Duchovny (Dr Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", 04, was the doctor in the drug-using story and lost his license to practice medicine. Dr Sands was visiting a nightclub and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded client and was assisted by Angelina Jolie (Claire), 'Take Lives', '04, who immediately attracted is up to dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", '04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man of all sorts of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to be in most of the scenes and is completely out of his mind trying to kill his gang members. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series", plays a major supporting role and portrays a true COOL DUDE that is a so-called Raymond Blossom guard. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby-red lips that attract a lot of attention from all the men. This movie is not the biggest, but it is entertaining.
