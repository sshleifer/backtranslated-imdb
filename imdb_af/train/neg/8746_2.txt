Independent attack on Microsoft made by people who do not appear to be intellectual property or market economies in general. <br /> <br /> Loony liberal tim robbins play a painfully obvious caricature of account gates and are a cartoon-like corporate villain who orders murders. right and left. <br /> <br /> While Microsoft may be involved in some competitive activities, it's unlikely to actually kill people. That's why the movie is over the top and ridiculous from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The "deeper" point is apparently that major technology innovations should be free to the public, and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, it ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property. <br /> <br /> It's one thing to be against competitive competition - it's common sense. It's quite another to face market competition in the first place. This is what the film's mantra ("knowledge belongs to humanity") represents. <br /> <br /> Another example of Hollywood is totally out of touch with reality.
