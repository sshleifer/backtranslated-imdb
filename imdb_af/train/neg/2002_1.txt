A shaking hand camera was used, presumably to give the film a documentary appearance, but the effect was so exaggerated that I started getting motion sickness just to watch it. Someone with cerebral palsy seems to have held the camera (no offense meant for CP sufferers, but I don't think you'll expect to get a lot of work as a movie maker!) The camera work was so deceptive and so distracting that my wife and I considered it uncompromising and gave up 10 minutes of torture. I checked in later (it showed on TV), and it didn't get any better. I suggest you miss this one unless you have to get rid of bad sushi you may eat!
