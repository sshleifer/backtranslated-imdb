this movie definitely dropped me. It was a good concept that was devastated by a terrible script. The story just didn't flow and was at its best in full. There were so many elements to this story that were not explained or forced with a real thought. elements such as the love story could be expanded on a little more and the guns should be written in better. The whole main character growing up needed more training and less standing. everyone loves a good "little old conquer" story and it has shown promise, but with the dissertation failures was not to be. While it had some pyrotechnics in the last battle sequence, it was unclear because of a lack of choreography. it made for a maddeningly boring watch <br /> <br /> it could have been so good :(
