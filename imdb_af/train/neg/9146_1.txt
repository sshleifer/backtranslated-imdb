Sam Mraovich should never touch a camera again. If he does, he must be arrested on the spot ... at least for minor injuries. Anyone who even pays an amount to rent any of his garbage must file a claim and be reimbursed. It was innocent my first viewing of his "work" ... and that will be my last. Ed Wood looks good to me now. <br /> <br /> When I return this piece of crap to the video store, I will personally ask that it be taken out of the shelf. An active supporter of gay theater, I am furious and angry that this twisted, exceptionally unsigned male child is allowed to spread and pack such a thing, with a beautiful, beautiful boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who is lucky other acting credits in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait, and then renting it as a "movie". Trust me, it has no place to be anywhere; it is simply not a movie in any sense. Offensive, irresponsible junk like this can only be detrimental to the efforts made to promote and support gay theater (hell, gay rights in general!) For those who are requested to rent it out because of the cover, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not so flattering to look at film as he is on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt - that's it. Instead, the domestic Mroavich enters his own disgusting, sorry chosen dough nudity. <br /> <br /> This "thing" he "collects" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend, Michael Habousch (who I understand, put out similar messy garbage) are terrible in this. Mraovich deliberately sets as a complete non-talent (in all areas) desperate to grab any 'loser' attention he can do for himself. He is condemned.
