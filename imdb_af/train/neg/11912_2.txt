The story behind this movie is very interesting, and in general the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, pacing, action series, stunts, and using CG, all cheap and spoil the film. br /> <br /> First, action ranges. They are all pretty unaware. Most of them consist of someone who gets up and shot, makes no effort to run, fight, evade or whatever, even though they have been in the world all the time. The rows just look at something made in 2004. <br /> <br /> The CG has very nice and animated effects, but they come out cheaply because of how they are used. <br /> <br /> Pacing: everything happens too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a few hours, and can return from the beginning, etc. Why are they so acrobatic? None of these are explained in the film. As Lilith she would not have needed to do flips back. Maybe she couldn't, since she had wings. <br /> <br /> We also have rows like a woman running through a car, standing up and just going into a deserted room with a sink and mirror, and bumping into the throat , all for no apparent reason, and without any spectators really caring that she was just hit by a car (and then the secondary effects of another, explosive car) ... "Are you okay?" asked the driver: "Yes, it goes well," she says, bloodshed and indignation. <br /> <br /> I watched it, though, because the introduction promised me it would be interesting ... but ultimately, the poor performance wished me something else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even that movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was comical relief, because they could suspend my unbelief, but it just made me shake the director awake and give the writer a good talk.
