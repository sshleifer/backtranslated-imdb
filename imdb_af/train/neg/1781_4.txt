Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move secretly to a small village in Indiana. They are sleepwalkers, cat-like creatures feeding on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus tips of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Other appearances are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Search for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King came as the caretaker of the cemetery.
