The video quality is terrible. The sound quality is pathetic. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is painful. The lighting is gloomy. The editing is laughing. I can go on, but it will be senseless. Snitch'd is a third-class amateur video passed as a feature film. This one is best to collect dust in the video shopping basket.
