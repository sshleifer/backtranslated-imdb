So, American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series. Though, it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies, except that some characters are related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it. (Can't the guy do better?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to compliment this movie. There are no funny jokes. The acting is painful to watch, especially the girl with the "southern" accent that looks more like a Canadian personification of a British woman, who pretends to be a hill by using the word "ya'll" . This movie makes me feel like an idiot. Why didn't I apply for a college where no-one goes to class (but everyone gets good grades), girls keep their clothes in public publicly, everybody has vicious unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs, and you Can a girl's family photos be overcome everywhere without her mind? Really, this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn. Perhaps for the next one, they will eventually break down and lead Ron Jeremy as head. I'm sure they can just tie it in the series by removing his character Stifler's 3rd uncle once or something.
