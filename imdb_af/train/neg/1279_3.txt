In this film, three stories are told, apparently shot without being known as a combined vignette film. The manufacturers relate to the three vignettes in that they are all committed to shrinking Martin Kove, although you never see the lead with Kove. <br /> <br /> The first vignette has sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman who is scared of everything under the sun (she makes Adrian Monk brave), with a paranoia tucked away alone at home. You will literally scream at Vivian to do some ridiculous things. She spends most of her time in a night showing her wonderful features. But her movie is the worst if it's not the nail bite. <br /> <br /> The second vignette is owned by Bill Paxton as he depicts the roommate from hell. His cheeky roommate enables him to take full advantage of him, and Bill does it when he can. <br /> <br /> The last vignette was funny when a man feared death would take him any moment, like his doll killed on an olive. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting, because the movie as a whole looks with very little thought involved. A must have for Bill Paxton fans.
