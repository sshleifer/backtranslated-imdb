Thanks to a notorious home video splitter that included the so-called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only terrible, but really awful. It's so terrible that I dipped it at the second-hand goods store for extra cash. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte are a married couple who have reached an agreement to have only sex on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession. Eva and Luis are a couple of couples who live from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose her job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had a relationship behind Eve and Nick. Luis deceived Eva by lying to her that he would fly to London to do something related to his artwork, but the fact is that he goes to Venice with Charlotte for an adultery holiday. Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her two children together to Venice for confrontation. The trip to Venice ends that both Nick and Eva are falling apart. <br /> <br /> Presenting the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva indicates the failure of the comedy. It doesn't just seem pointless, but also sleepy. In the film, Nick is trying to find help in several ways, but it does not end in any use. It's either the strangers around him acting like morons, or they're just stupid. <br /> <br /> The comedy also tended to add in unnecessary scenes to extend the story. While some of the common sense issues can be solved, no one in the movie uses common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It so badly fails that even the beautiful exhibitions in Venice do not attract the reputation of the film.
