If you made a genre movie in the late 80's, you actually had a 50/50 chance of being underwater or in jail (unfortunately we never got an underwater prison). Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole), tied by Mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), ends up in the death penalty, right next to the Frankie brothers (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But that's the least of Derek's problems as rogue government agent (and mob stool) Kol. Burgess (John Saxon, who also directs) uses the prison as a test ground for a new super virus. These are the only flash-saxons aimed at his solid career. For a man who worked with tons of directors, it seems the only one he picked up from the cheap-o-Italian. Sure, it's a low budget, but it can't excuse the stagnant stages, shooting forks or awkward outline in the first 15 minutes. The Saxon made it slightly avid at his disposal and he works in a hilarious nude scene (our head falls asleep during a prison riot to just fantasize about a female scientist). Cole, who looks like a more rugged Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent like the stoic lead and Franciosa - playing a very bad back - giving it all as the clich√© mobboss. The end is at Marty McKee's favorite place, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released it on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
