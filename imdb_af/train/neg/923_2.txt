For some reason, several young couples walking through the Italian Alps split up to see who can reach their campsite name first. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and is owned by the spirit of Tyranus when he puts on a helmet of the body. He then spends the rest of the movie wandering in the bush chasing his friends and hooking their limbs to join a few stews to bring the dead "Demonicus" back. This lap-to-digital Full Moon release is stupid, pointless, has terrifying scene and sound and the (Los) Angeles National Forest is a poor replacement for Italy. However, this is quite high on the unintentional lag scale, mainly thanks to the remaining main performance. Whether bug-eyed walks in cheap-looking armor that burns a sword or spitting neurotic Latin gibberish over demons and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line-up should be seen as believed. Oh, at least he's not boring like most of the rest.
