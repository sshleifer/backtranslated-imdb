What did the director think? All who read the biography of Artemisia are impressed by her bowels to undergo a renaissance public rape trial and even suffer torture to show that Tassi was guilty. That fact shows the true independence and emancipation - in her most horrible hour she stands her MAN. Why should films that depict Renaissance be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the eager side of life or have the lucky luck of Hollywood won? While I will always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie, I can't make sense to turn Artimisia's life story on his head. Very disappointing choice by the makers of this movie.
