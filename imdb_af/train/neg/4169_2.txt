I gave it a 2, just because Natassia Malthe (like the vampireess Quintana) looks so sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is very little logic for this movie, but so are most of the scientific vampire flicks. The movie probably tried to break away from the traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not only unreasonable, but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are too many gore and too many ripe-body scenes that make me feel sick. A good vampire movie should be more meaningful if you don't need a lot of blood. We all know when a vampire jumps on a man, he will do what a vampire will do. A few sounds or screams are all it takes to describe the scene (like the one at the end when Quintana tries to raise Rosa sexually, all it needs is a few moans, the rest is yours imagination). Anyway, this is just my personal taste.
