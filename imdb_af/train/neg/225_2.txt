SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is kicked by spinner Kate (Andie McDowell) because she mistakenly believes Jed has a relationship with one of her two cat friends. Kate thought she had caught them and blatant delict. Kate threw Jed's shoes out of the door. Jed reluctantly trusted and then sat in the middle of the road to put on his shoes. Then he runs through a truck ('Crushed', one of the meanings of the title). And die. <br /> <br /> "And then he gets a truck." Can you imagine that a scriptwriter actually submitted a script with this plotel element? Until then, this is a comedy that is supposed to be foam, but has no real fizz. Everyone except Jed is just irritating. And then they kill Jed, and everyone is sad to the end when the gals learn to love and support one another, instead of destructive. I give it 2 ugh's.
