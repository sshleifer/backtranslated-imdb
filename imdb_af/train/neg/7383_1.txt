I feel blessed to possess what is known as the worst Steven Seagal movie ever made. I knew I was on something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. By the middle of the film my eyes started to hurt and I fell out of my chair with uncontrollable laughs. <br /> <br /> Steven is Steven (with an ever-changing voice) and totally incredible in his role (as usual). Who in hell leaves people with bad leaves-hair-pony tail mullets anyway in the power? He also writes himself in total incredible love interests with women at least 20 years of his junior. The supporting actors all look like they were shot in the dark - VAT, did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a lamp lantern for lighting? <br /> <br /> It's really horrible in every way possible. Invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this is actually special.
