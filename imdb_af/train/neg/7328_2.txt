I see many people like this movie. For me it was a movie that was written right 101 and the person failed the class. From that time, Lindsey Price showed the videographer to the end, the film was very predictable. I continued to look to see if it was going any way. <br /> <br /> First we have the widowed young father. Cliché # 1 movies / TV always kill the mother older than the child is a girl or a hatch of boys, so that the single father can swoon over his dead wife and looks completely out of his element to look after the children. Starting from My 3 Boys to 2 1/2 Pa. These movies are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 2 If a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand, she plays a big part in the movie. And will always have solutions, or even if the person is an airplane. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If the person in danger is a stranger, they must be of Latino origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently, there are no legal Latino's and illegal Europeans unless there is an IRA element involved. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 4 The said Latino must be highly educated in his native country. In this case, he was a professor who made 200 a month. And the aforementioned high-educated Latino must now act as if he did not have his head in his head now and let the headlamp take over. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 The crime committed by the person was not a crime but an accident. But because in this case he has lost all the meaning he had when crossing the border, he now acts like a flashy idiot and has now put his own daughter in jeopardy by her on a fruitless quest for the border with take the idiot side kick. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 Never walk over a canopy running a crime, but a few poor little kids. This is because the child's parents have to play a large part of the movie, and because the person who accidentally murdered the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parents. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 7 Call me a movie in which a policeman is not the malignant vet and they come together with a newcomer. Even if they are murderers who have to be the most experienced police on a police force. Seven and Copy-Cat and Law and Order come straight to mind. And the vet, though the gravel on the outside has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 8 Let's work with some unemployed soap styles. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can't get out of a paper bag and when she is used to One Life To Live like Marty, he turns right to left every time she opens her mouth. It uses me to get sick. She can now better be anchored on the ground, but she still can't act. <br /> <br /> The movie might have been more informative if it wasn't filled with clichés. I don't think a movie should be expensive or cerebral to be good. But it was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I'm not going to spoil the end. Oh heck, I will, because I feel it will be a disorder for mankind to make someone waste, that they will never look at this movie again. It involves Cliché # 6 and # 7. Unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was there. The father even made a deadly mistake by the police and was shot by the angry veteran, who is suddenly very upset. You'd think she thought the poor man was innocent by the movie and she accidentally shot him. When she didn't. Now for the little girl the father brought with him. Guess what happens to her? Get up, she ends up with the family whose child was murdered by her father !! Come on! You all knew it was going to happen, because she is a replacement child !! That's why she didn't live with the Lindey Price character. <br /> <br /> This movie was an insult as far as I was concerned. Because there were so many possibilities, this movie could be investigated and gone, but it chose to drive the cliché. The 2 stars are for 2 of the stars, the girl I thought was very good and Lindsey Price, whose character was annoying, but she did what she could. My advice is a chassis and push your head with it instead of looking at this drink
