Impress! It's the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I didn't like the novel, but this movie made it worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (apart from SRK of course, although he can't even save the movie), and not much sense. The director makes it all confusing, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he's trying to make it all very surreal, yet credible. Well, he doesn't manage. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to lose, don't see this movie, please! (Say it to your own well-being!) Look, you'll get something to watch!
