Where to start ?! . . . I feel ... violated! That's right, violated! I spent only 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours that I could have spent doing something more useful, like looking dry, on this so-called horror flick. It's not scary, it's not funny, it's funny. It's not dramatic, it's no action, it's nothing ... <br /> <br /> It's predictable, its boring, its tragic ... <br /> <br /> I might be here be a little difficult, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, don't see it unless you want to break too.
