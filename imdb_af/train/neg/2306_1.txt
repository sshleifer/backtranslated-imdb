I find myself wondering what the people who gave it saw a 10 I didn't do. This movie has a very difficult time to follow and / or to stay on a plot. If someone tells you it is a comedy, don't be deceived, it's about 98% off a strange drama and 2% comedy. All actors make a good show, which cannot be denied, but it seems to have lost something somewhere. Don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited or whatever. It had potential, and instead it was really a flop. I would like to spend the one and a half hours that I have invested in this movie, but the video rental does not make returns in time. Save your money and see something else.
