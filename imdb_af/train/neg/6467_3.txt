I still can't believe this movie. They have so many incredible things in it that it's hard to believe someone wants to make it. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but in the sense that it is funny, but more like no story. How can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery, a prison movie, town conspiracies, sex jokes and an FBI agent? You can't. <br /> <br /> Besides the frightening direction, the actors are the most striking thing. I watched this movie and thought, 'Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it can't. (5 minutes later) Is it Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) It can't be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is too bad for everyone. (At the end). No, no, it can't quite be Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie. "It was over and I was nervous. So many good, Oscar-winning, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, stupid, horrible movie. I rarely wanted to know much about how they acted in this one. They couldn't get that much money. <br /> <br /> Just an amazing stupid idiotic movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 1/4 (1+ - 6-)
