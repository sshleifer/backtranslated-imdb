Have you ever seen a movie made up of long-range shots? No? Me neither. Well, I finally saw one in the "Spring in my hometown" and I have to admit, now I know why people don't. The technique is "arty", surely, but it is definitely NOT ripe for public use. The technique is poorly flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps it is the direct intent of the director. I don't know, I can't read thoughts, and I certainly don't know enough about the director to make a statement. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-American sentiments. As an American, I am well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am very aware that we were not always angels, but I will be damned if I have done this man's version of how things will happen. According to this blind fool, Americans were not just the root of the war, we were the cause of the war, and we almost ruined the country. Whatever, Mr Director. And I suppose you'll still make this movie in COMMUNIST KOREA if we don't interfere, right? Talk about forgetting your history. It is almost similar to making the Nazis the "good guys" as they change the allied forces into the "bad guys". This movie is so historically naive and so virtually inaccurate that it is almost embarrassing to watch. For a man who comes from a country that owes his actual existence to American interference, he surely comes down as high and mighty and judgmental.
