O man, how does Sam Mraovich think? What was anyone involved in this "movie" thinking? Mraovich is the head of almost everything from "Ben and Arthur": Director, author, producer (also executive producer!), Caster, lead star-you call it, he did it. And he (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked into every section of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with this movie? Everything. The film is about two gay lovers, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich- * groan *). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people. To make matters worse, Ben's crazy "ex-wife" (they don't really divorce), Tammy (Julie Belknap) is stupid, that Ben left her for another man and Ben claims to come back together ( say that she can be gay too!) and Arthur's Christian dedicated, excessively hypocritical, as bitter as Tammy's brother, Victor, is hell bent on straightening Arthur and then trying to kill him after he kicked out of his church is. <br /> <br /> The movie is absolutely a block with so many goofs (that is, Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married. They go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees, they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane - hoping they were comfortable in a wooden crate, plus much more) and plot holes to launch (Victor calls killing Arthur "The Final Plan", which later changed to "The Final Deed", Arthur and the private (internal) detective drives the same car, blah blah blah. The "actors" are all very bad and are over, The writing is terribly terrible (one of the examples is: "I do not make sense, you do not make sense! It makes sense!) And there is so much more wrong with the "movie" I can not write everything. <br /> <br /> But the most laughing, but amazing thing about "Ben and Arthur" is that Sam Mraovich thinks he has created something that is really great (see she fake reviews for "Ben & Arthur" and obvious comments by him on YouTube.) Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blind him to see how terribly anything with his name on it really is. <br /> <br / > So, finally, forget about every bad movie you claim to be the worst movie ever, "Ben and Arthur" will beat them right out of the title, even Paris Hilton movies look like "The Dark Knight" compared to the monstrosity that known as Ben and Arthur.
