If I write a review about a movie, it might stay with me. But I usually expect that I forgot that I saw this one just two weeks from now. So why bother? Because I found myself watching a low-rated movie that was nice to watch. I didn't expect to stay in the room while it was on. <br /> <br /> It wasn't good, but at least it wasn't unbearable ... not a comedy of errors. which always makes me shrink. It was just sweet fluff ... and if you can't take it, stay in the locker room boys. I agree with those who defend this movie, as it is certainly his targeted demographic, and will not be a complete drill for an adult. <br /> <br /> It offers some good chuckles here and there, but not a silk slit. Sure, it's stupid and just slightly entertaining, but at least it doesn't suck (as so many said). Maybe those people are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to rate on the bell curve, such a 4.5 or 6 is actually a good overall score in my book. To give it a 4 makes sense and will strengthen its rating at the time of this writing. To give it a 1 or 10, as most have done so far, the rating makes numbers meaningless. I can't believe how strong people somehow feel about this forgetful fluff (or even bothering to write about it). Do I miss something? <br /> <br /> In any case, it should be noted that Emma Roberts does her role as Clairedycat reasonably convincingly. Ariell Kebbel, who is often written in b * ch roles, does not worry if her character owes her. You can also acknowledge that Bruce Spence plays Leonard, although his role is added. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult you can miss this one. But if there is a pre-teenage girl in your life, rent this movie for her ... and be prepared not to hate it (you may even enjoy it).
