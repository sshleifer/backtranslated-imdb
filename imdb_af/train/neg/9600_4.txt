Very strange but sometimes elegant exploitation competition with no real story, but benefits from its amazingly surprising main actress and a handful of beautiful, horrific makeup effects. Daniella is a beautiful twenty-one girl who carries with her the tears of the rape at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations further lead her to believe she is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who is said to be a werewolf. She killed her brother-in-law during a nocturnal encounter and was hospitalized. However, she escapes more and more men on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It is also nice to watch and listen too (really good soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity becomes very irritating. Fortunately, the leading lady Annik Borel seldom wears clothes and she fills the boring moments by naked to dance a fire. The film is too long, too strange and too forgetful. The biggest surprise comes in the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe his movie is based on real facts. Yes, right ...
