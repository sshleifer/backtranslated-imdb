The first thing I noticed in this movie was, of course, the unnecessary amount of nudity. It's not nudity or anything, but many that were not needed. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman who believes her families' ghost stories believe her honest ancestor looks like a werewolf, and believes their fate is destined to be the same. What I found interesting. The original Wolf Man was meant to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw the real Wolf man you never had to pay for extra money or two. I find this concept of someone who is not really a werewolf interesting. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead we know it's not a werewolf from the beginning, so there's no excitement or spin. They also try to make the movie look like it really happened. scenario. They also fail to add one or two parts of the movie that refer to this reality. Initially I was excited about reading the description of the movie. But I slowly realized it was a cover just as they could uncover the main characters as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel is either a decent actor who plays a great psychotic role, or a very bad actor who plays a psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brain and only a nut that runs around and runs taps and breaks like a wolf, it is little skill to play. She had moments her show broke through for a creepy moment, but soon ruined by the poor camera work and light. The idea is wonderful, but suddenly performed throughout the film. 10/03
