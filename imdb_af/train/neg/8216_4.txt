And maybe, as Fred Sandford said earlier, "one over the lips". This to those who released this movie on an unsuspecting audience. And maybe the person in "Rue Morgue", who called it a Fender Hellbender and said it was good. <br /> <br /> Five young girls, apparently taking a short break from a high school soccer match, are getting lost and stopping at a small shop in the middle of nowhere. While the driver accidentally hits a parked SUV and beats a headlight, the girls all decide to just go and not find the driver. But the driver comes to get them, and it's not just that the headlight has tackled on her vehicle, for another reason the girls haven't yet understood. When the driver catches them first, she's (yes, it's a silk) a shooting gun and loosens them and holds them, "how much did you see?". Of course, the girls are silent and do not know what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> As the night roles on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the SUV driver, who manages to use all sorts of injuries on the girls, which is remarkably resilient to shoot where they don't want them. Eventually, they realize that something happened at the store after they left, which is the reason for the woman's psychotic anger. And finally they have a chance to take revenge and as far as they can go. <br /> <br /> There are elements of this movie that are quite disturbing and scary, but unfortunately those moments are undermined by bad acting. , bad dialogue and great decay of credibility. One girl is hit by a gunshot explosion and looks dead quietly, and she feels cold, her life is ahead of her eyes, but she gets better? And how far can a minibus run on an almost empty gas tank at a speed of 80 miles per hour? I need one of those things, it seems to be big miles. <br /> <br /> There had to be an end when the girls got revenge, but the movie goes on for a little afterwards, which is an anti-climax, but at least they learn from the woman is and the manager is still worried about the "wasting of her mother's van." Of course, this is the least of anyone's concerns. <br /> <br /> So it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's too amateur to be good and yet a little too frightening and horrible to be horrible at times. But it takes the cake for very shrewd hysteria and you want to put two over your ears if you see it. What incidentally I do not necessarily recommend. 4 out of 10.
