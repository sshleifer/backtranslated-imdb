"Everyone Famous" has everything we can expect from a straight to video movie. It's the story of a man who believes his daughter can be a star. All he needs is to get her on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he must abduct and extort. The problem with the movie is not the basic plot, but how it is made. Everything is supposed to be funny, but it is not. It's trivial and clumsy, the characters are shallow, and the end series is completely without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene you feel like laughing, but just how pathetic the whole setup is.
