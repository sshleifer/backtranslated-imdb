Usually, I am a fan of the bad eighties and early nineties movie with now bones ... but this movie is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to go through. Churches that dress as daughters were killed - but never so pathetic. Corey Haim's performance was as usual unexpected, Nicole Eggert was not much better. It has no redeeming qualities, even if you are a number one fan of an actor / actress in this piece of trash - stay away!
