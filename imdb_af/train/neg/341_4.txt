Oh man. If you want to give your internal Crow T. Robot a real workout, it's the movie that appears in the ov video recorder. The potential for cutting lines in this film is just infinite. <br /> <br /> (Minor spoilers before. Hey, do you really care if a movie of this quality is "spoiled"?). Traci is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed names for this when a child develops a sexual loved one at the opposite sex. But this girl looks one for her the same generation one, and I don't think there is a term for it. This can be because her mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose cute, remaining neo-flower child sexuality and nice figure, let me forgive a number of bad movies or impersonal characters. Here Dana is not only negligent for her daughter's actions; she seems to be competing in the gold medal in the Olympic Indulgent Mother competition. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Dana Traci's murderous stripe misses because the truth is told, Traci looks like the criminal skills of a hamster. It's just because the script dictates so that she manages to subtract any kind of body number. <br /> <br /> A particular hilarious note in this movie is the character of Carmen, a Mexican girl described by Dana. as long as she was one of the families, although she was dressed in what the director thought, "I just fell off the Guadalajara tomato truck." Carmen is so wise for Traci's twilight, she can also carry a sign, say, "Hey, I'm the next victim!" Sure enough, Traci confronts Carmen as Carmen returns her way back from Mass, and clashes with one of those slightly angular keys that car manufacturers save to you as a bad joke. I suspect rather than in real life, these things are as useless as a murder weapon as it is for changing a bond. <br /> <br /> In another order, Arquette wears a thin skirt to a vineyard, under cloudy skies, with the owner. Cut into another thin dress under sunny air, talk to the owner's brother. Then cut her the first dress, first of all, under cloudy skies - but it must be later. You get the picture. We are really talking badly. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the skin, don't expect much, though Traci does have some nice bikinis. <br /> <br /> For those looking for a trash, 8. For anyone else, 1/2.
