Navigate channel and capture it on LOGO. It was one of the "I have to watch it, because it's so badly bad" moments like Roadhouse without the joy. The writing is horrible; There is a low budget and then there is the abyss where this epic has to be thrown and never to be seen again. I mean, the main characters go into a rental house in a ski retreat and the house is welcome, it's not a big problem, but they choose to make all the homeowners shine as it was the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry, but watch 6 guys watching every 10'x10 'boring room, with a futon in it, and it's lame. I think they have learned nothing from the Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see hotel room check scene) ... wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I don't buy all of it all over, so everything goes routine. If it smells ... and it looks like ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the pest. <br /> <br /> Edit: Apparently other more meticulous judges believe that since I didn't like this movie, I'm an "obvious hater" I can only accept being phobias, of course. is not true. I decided to do this wacky, crazy thing and judge the movie based on the real content of the movie and not by its mere presence (ie its refreshing to see ...) <br /> <br /> Sure, it may be refreshing to watch, but it doesn't compare in a good movie, just give them better material to work with a stiffer direction. In fact, I applaud the effort. Frankly, I'd rather listen to my Kitchens or Distinction catalog than see it again.
