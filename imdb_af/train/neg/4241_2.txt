Yes, Madsen's character - while speaking to the woman from the TV station - is right: the LAPD is a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this movie doesn't change anything. Okay, here's the good policemen, the moral policemen, even a black man, a Christian, a martyr. But it is a fairy tale, acknowledge it. Reality is not so. And most importantly for the action fans: The shooting is boring. It's just to shoot and shoot and shoot. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, then you'll have at least something to do. The only morale of this movie is: The LAPD is good now. There is no more bad police in it. If you like uncritical, euphemistic police and military advertising, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
