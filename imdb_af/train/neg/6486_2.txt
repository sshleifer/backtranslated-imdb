If there is one thing you can rely on on Disney, it's their incredible ability to take a story and tell it again and again. Even looking at the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a horrible experience. Disney will ever destroy one of their most beautiful classic players. It even had that spaghetti meatball scene. This has been done before! And this says I'm sorry for video (the whole concept has to be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duo (I even forgot their names) is just a very poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She actually repeats almost all of her old lines. The songs are pathetic, very uncomfortable. I have never heard such songs from them before. And the dialogue is horrible. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the positive side, at least they took the time to make the animation slightly decent. All the usual characters aren't as annoying as they were before (or maybe it's a minus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is just as sickly cute as you can just vomit. I almost did. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Don't waste your money on this. True, it is not as horrible as returning from Jafar or Pocahontas II, but this is little comfort.
