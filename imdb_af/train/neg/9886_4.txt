This is Peter Falk's film. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 when this film came out; At the time, I was already a movie force. Of course, my parents and I didn't see this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the font of his ads and the aura that it was an important movie. Well, 34 years later, I finally saw the movie. I have never seen a Cassavetes-directed movie. He's a hack, overall. Zero sense of timing, editing. Gena's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's stint in "Rain Man": technically on par, but totally one-note. While Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", Falk takes the cake for this movie. <br /> <br /> I was very annoyed with Gena's performance throughout - it looks better for "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not all her fault: she's a basket case from the first scene to the last. We never find out why? But Falk's character really looks and gets executed by Falk as a seriously defective man. <br /> <br /> Shave off at least an hour (an editor needed!), and it would be an arresting portrait that was not a woman. Under the influence, but from a simple, Cro-Magnon, the man who comes to work with a woman who does not work and yet cannot work with her three children and her husband's long hours of work. <br /> <br /> I'm "I rather remember Cassavetes for" The Dirty Dozen "or" Rosemary's Baby. " He would have been a better director if he had cut his own propensity for redundancy - as he demonstrates very well with this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
