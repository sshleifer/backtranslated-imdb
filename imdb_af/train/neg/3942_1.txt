Oh my god, that's a terrible movie. The movie involved all the right people, unfortunately it's not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I paid to see it, I would be even more upset. This movie is immovable. How can Tarintino be involved in such a slow, unconscious movie. No wonder it didn't get much spread, everyone involved was ashamed. I can make a better movie with a dated camcorder and my big toe. It's boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost a few in my eyes. It must be a kind of sick joke. Don't bother with this movie. If anyone even indicates you, you should see it, kill them.
