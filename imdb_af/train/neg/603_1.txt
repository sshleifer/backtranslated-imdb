Absolutely feasible film. I live in London and the plot is so heavily investigated, it's ridiculous. Nobody can be on the London Underground terror. In the short time it is not serviced every night, there are teams of maintenance workers who check the tracks and do repairs. There are also homeless people living there, unlikely. Or it is even possible to be locked up and does not have access to a cell phone this day and age ... <br /> <br /> The worst thing that will probably happen if someone finds themselves there after the last train is that they can spray graffiti on them. Although under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the side of the story. (Remember in London as a whole, we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If it's in a city, I'm not familiar, maybe I could enjoy it by ignorance has. but it's not a high quality movie, so I couldn't just suspend my unbelief and try to enjoy it for the banal little story that it is. <br /> <br /> I would have given it 0/10 if such an attack existed! Possibly the most disappointing movie I ever thought I'd like.
