As a Hammer full-time, I was afraid of the time when I would have the courage to see this movie and the one that followed, Holiday on the Buses. I saw the one the buses, and I saw it as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was full of all the terrible comedies the British TV screens had been harassing in the early 70's. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say that there were parts of this movie I laughed at. I don't know if it was because I was familiar with the characters and enjoyed the situations, and knew how they would respond. I found Blakey particularly funny, although I can't swear at any point in the trilogy, he says catching on, "I'll get your Butler." <br /> <br /> After watching Holiday on the buses, the jokes began to wear thin and these three films can be compared to an early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, by making the second movie the best ( although this is probably the only way to compare it). <br /> <br /> The only people who want to see this movie are probably fans of the TV series, which will undoubtedly enjoy it, and Hammer completed like me. For the finalists I would say that this film is not that bad and I can definitely think of worse hammer comedies.
