Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. <br /> <br /> It also has an urgent dialogue, unconvincing characters and a preliminary, or rather non-existent, story. It pushes from bad to worse in a cynical effort to break out a kind of emotion from a sincere and unrelenting hysteria lineage! <br /> <br /> And the HEAT HIGH! How many cheap shots can a movie take? The hedgehog incidentally gave the most convincing and striking performance in this ninety-minute cringe athon. <br /> <br /> If you have considered watching this movie, don't do it. I'm sorry, but I can't get a single salvation feature for this movie. It makes a big, thick news with me. Strict for sub-Dogma knicker waters. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> Still, if you like Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
