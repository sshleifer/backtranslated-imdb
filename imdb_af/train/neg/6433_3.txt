A difficult movie that kisses Senator Joe McCarthy's ever-pervading mythology as a political demon king. Boyle (like Joe) gives a compelling but historically inaccurate representation of the Wisconsin Senator, the caricature McCarthy takes much as the right one. Meredith, like the lying leader, Mr. Joseph Welch, who was heard by McCarthy in 1954 at the army, is very good as always. <br /> <br /> In fact, McCarthy and Cohn had the right to worry about the terrible security situation in the army, and the 1954 army hearings are entangled in the smoke screen used by the army to remove the investigation disguise their security failures, which the committee investigated, by countering that McCarthy and Cohn are trying to get their favors. , David Schine, while in service. <br /> <br /> The film itself is content, agenda-driven polemics, based on the ongoing myths that have passed for many for decades for the truth - that the "red terror" was essentially Phony and McCarthy, HUAC, etc. always moving away from the wrong targets. They were no more than lying, career spoofing publicity dogs, which damaged the constitutional rights of indignant innocent liberals. people. <br /> <br /> People who know little about it still feel confident in repeating wrong information about McCarthy and the red scare to this day. Clooney's Murrow-hagiography is an example. The misrepresentation is pervasive, no wonder people swallowed it. A recent intent of Budd Schulberg in the serious left-wing British newspaper The Guardian pointed out that the Hollywood writer called "McCarthy names" - the lie that McCarthy's "Hollywood" investigated as head of HUAC continues. The truth is that McCarthy has never been a member of HUAC yet and he has little interest in Hollywood politics - his investigations were almost exclusively limited to the arms of the US government. <br /> <br /> "Red Terror" myths are inextricably exploded by recently revealed Soviet and American government documents, as well as anything that underestimates McCarthy and the US Soviet and co-traveler infiltration scale in the US but decades of public misinformation over this period will be difficult to improve. <br /> <br /> One day, some very brave Hollywood people may be telling a movie about the truth about how many American men and women the mass murderer Stalin has helped and worked to uplift his evil system of governors. lies. t in the western world, and give an accurate account of Joe McCarthy's career, but I will not hold my breath. Until then, we have known this mythical, drunk legend of popular imagination in the media .... "Tail Gunner Joe".
