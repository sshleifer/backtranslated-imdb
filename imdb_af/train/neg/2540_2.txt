I thought I saw this movie twice. Then I read all the other reviews, and they didn't quite agree. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this town to study alleged large-foot observation. I still feel confident that this is the movie I have seen, despite the differences in reviews. That's why I return my review: If you like an occasional 'B' movie, like me, then Back to Boggy Creek is the movie for you! Whether it's the sleep timer, and nod to your favorite movie boom, or just hang out with friends. Boggy Creek, the dumb button, and you have a fun night of improv. Beware! Is the legend true? I think we can only find out with a non-star cast. Will there be any equipment failures on especially important moments in the movie? Do we have a blonde, male, young hero? Will the exceptional high tech Technicolor last the whole movie? You will have to look to find out for yourself.
