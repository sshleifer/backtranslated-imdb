This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It is a strange WW2 movie, and serves as a statement on racism. It is worth looking at to understand that Movies reflects how we feel about issues when they are produced and not over the period they depict. This means it's a movie of the 70's, not a 40-year-old movie (WW2). Yet there are some good action scenes from 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to catch a dam. The story focuses on the captain who learns that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene from a Civil War movie and not a WW2 movie that reflects what the movie is about. The Black Lt gives a German woman an innocent pitch on the cheek and the white Capt is upset. I enjoyed the movie of curiosity as the stars and genre were interesting to me.
