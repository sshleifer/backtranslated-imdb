Since many horror films are based on the assumption that one or more of the central characters at some stage during the proceedings make a dumb, the girls in this movie will collect Gold, Silver and Bronze at an Olympic ceremony of the Darwin Awards. . A mentally handicapped baboon would have made better choices than they did, and would have shouted much less. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with a grainy picture, deliberately amateur camera work (my 92-year-old grandmother has a camcorder with better results), very poor sound and no observable plot / narration, then this is your ideal movie. Also note that you should enjoy the following: women who scream for no reason, women who have no doubt. In fact, the reason and logic do not appear much in this movie. For example: "We need to find Stephanie" "Yes, I can't believe I spoke to her, like last night, she called you last night?" "Yes, she wanted to talk about a date on which she asked one." "WHAT, how did she tell me?" As we are, our friend is hunted by a serial killer with a shotgun and a variety of Greek weapons, but I have a problem with the fact that she did not tell me she was going on a date. <br /> <br /> Well, so the budget is low. That doesn't mean you have to look like half the budget. The 'score' has been interesting since everything - with the exception of one - has been written and performed by the authors / directors of the film itself. In fact, it seems as if the entire budget was blown to an example of a track by The Duskfall, a death metal band from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The most worrying thing about everyone in the whole movie is the end that leaves us with the possibility of a sequel.
