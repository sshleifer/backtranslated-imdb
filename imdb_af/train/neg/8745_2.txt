Another one of extremely unprofessional movies about computer programmers. <br /> <br /> Seeing authors of that movie do not really know specifically about programmer world. <br /> <br /> 20 top programmers in the world, programs that have their own satellites (for which?), program that uses satellite freq., someone kills someone to steal the codes (why?) and more many more dumb moments at this movie. <br /> <br /> People who are not programmers will see something terrible at that movie, because not professionals about it. But people will not see real things. <br /> <br /> Programmers will find that movie strange and awful - because many moments in the movie aren't related to real life (why don't movies scifi in this case?).
