Well, I start with the good points. The movie was just 86 minutes long, and some were so bad, it was funny. Now for the low points. My first warning sign comes with a real "warning" on the movie. When it started, the following "warning" was displayed: "The movie you are about to see contains graphics and disturbing images. Unlike the general belief that is being killed, it's not fun, pretty or Romantic. " I had to save myself the 86 minutes and then turn it off. The first words of the film were: "I'm at the gum factory." It was a guy talking on his cellphone, and he referred to a nursing home as a gum factory. I do not know why. So the basis of the movie is a child is obsessive with the Zodiac Killer and begins to imitate him. The budget for this movie was at least $ 50 and they had to use the cheapest cameras they could get. The acting was worse when I read a script straight. That's what they were doing. The script was awful, and the big "twist" was that this man who wrote a biography of the Zodiac Killer was actually the Zodiac Killer. Of course, they tried to show it subtly, but it made it quite clear in the first 10 minutes. Without any more painful details of the plot, here were some terrible highlights of the movie. They are trying to make the Zodiac Killer compare itself to an "army of one" because soldiers are just killers. Then they tried to make a "Satanic Worship" by showing some guys in black hats in a meeting. The big "computer hacker" could get this kid's address when someone gave him the name and phone number of the child. For some reason he had to get in the FBI to get someone's address. I'm not sure why he didn't just watch it in the phone book, or use whitepages.com. There was also a random allotment to 9/11 with no reason. I also learned that no matter where you are shot, blood will come out of your mouth within seconds. <br /> <br /> So if you really do bad acting, sub-par scripts, bad camera and keep an obvious plot, you'll love Zodiac Killer!
