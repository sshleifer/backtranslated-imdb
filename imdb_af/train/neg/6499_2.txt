What a mess. I've seen it with a friend some time ago, and we both see ourselves on the many wonders of the theater, but this is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> While there may be good things, it might be good. ideas / concepts and there are definitely good achievements (under the circumstances), it is all buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony draws too much of the same fellow pool as Natural Born Killers, You Turn and similar movies as far as editing is concerned, or maybe he looked at Nixon as inspiration. Say what you want from David Lynch, but at least he has more than a method to use the madness. <br /> <br /> His quote of the fact that he made the movie as a joke says it all. It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
