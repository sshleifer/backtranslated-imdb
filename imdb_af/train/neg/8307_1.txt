This show is incredible. . . what it represents and what it focuses on. . . words cannot describe how dishonest ET is. They will report anything. If a celebrity is even indirectly linked remotely to the story, ET will report on it. As a dog scooter in the Tom Cruise's site, they will report on it. As a celebrity dies. . . they will talk about it for weeks to the point where the public is jealous of the famous personality. If a celebrity is put to the test. . . ET will report it for months at the end. There is no end to what this show will report and no time frame that will determine how long they will focus on a story. Is it even considered reporting legitimacy? The reports are also so annoying, with loud rattling voices and ending with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of importance. I can't watch this show without questioning human existence. ET is a big reason, because I avoid evehies in general. I regret that IMDb allows only a minimum star rating and not zero or even negative. For this show earned -10 stars.
