There are a few Stallone movies I want, but this movie didn't meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists who land in the desert are prepared to survive for at least two days. Also in this desert, Stallone and the company hold bridges and ladders that provide convenient shortcuts or plot devices. Also, the Treasury police do not seem to co-ordinate anything with local rescue personnel. Also, bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a barn, with high-tech looking for automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> I initially liked John Lithgow's villain, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't "Don't care for any of his own bad guys, or everyone is killed. Eventually I couldn't believe the character anymore. <br /> <br /> Not worth the price of a rental, not worth the time to look.
