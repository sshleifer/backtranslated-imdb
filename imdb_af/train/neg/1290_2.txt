This movie was two and a quarter disruptive hours. Someone please tell me what the point was? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historic environment. It is supposed to go over a criminal justice group, Confederate Bush Whackers, on the Missouri-Kansas border, revenge against all northern sympathizers and apostates during the American Civil War. But apart from free violence, there wasn't much of a point on this movie. Perhaps it was a political statement? The war is nothing more than free violence? If that were the point, it was pretty good, but I don't think it was the point. I think the producers really thought they were making a valuable film here, but as far as I was concerned, there was a complete lack of any plot. It looked as if I had looked at a paperback novel, with the characters looking like you would see on the deck of such novels. <br /> <br /> This movie should be burned with some of the towns. set on fire!
