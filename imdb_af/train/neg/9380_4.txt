The last few weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman are being told in flashbacks. Like the vagabond, the film wanders aimlessly and rather meaninglessly. Mona, the lazy, struggling and drug-addicted title character, is not nice and Bonnaire does little to make her interesting. Although there are some pretentious dialogues trying to explain why Mona chose this unfortunate lifestyle, her motivation is never really clear. The episodic nature of the film, which involves a few random characters, becomes tiring after a while, and it looks much longer than its running time. It's also hard to believe that a handsome young homeless woman would no longer be attracted to men.
