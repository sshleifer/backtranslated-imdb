This movie is terrible. The characters are absolutely incredible and wildly contradictory. The plot is awful and some of the classroom screens are unbeatable and make it uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The quality of the writing and characterization would probably suggest that this film was written by high school students, but the total lack of credibility in the school environment would indicate that the writers probably never went to high school. The actor was in most cases also poor, although many of these were on a poor script and plot, I'm not sure any actors could see this movie. <br /> <br /> It said the sound track was OK, and the movie was nice in places (though the editing was poor).
