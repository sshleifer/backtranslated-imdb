I doubt that Jigsaw was even hip, the whole LSD theme married to a murder mystery is a striking obvious attempt to seize a young audience of the era without at least understanding it. sixties teen culture. The dated aspect aside, Jigsaw suffers from numerous problems, including overwhelming acting, stupid and disturbed dialogue, LSD flashbacks that have long persisted, even after the point has been hammered in the first 60 seconds, failing to create any true tension though real plot is a great vehicle to do just that, and an end that's so solid and predictable (not to mention very bad television settings) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it were a better movie, we might be able to suspend unbelief in a few things that will help us enjoy, but the weaknesses are so scary that they only highlight the improvements that viewers can otherwise see. I saw a jigsaw on television and it is definitely a late night TV prize meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill someone's insomnia rather than anything that anyone should actively seek out. At best, a three out of 10.
