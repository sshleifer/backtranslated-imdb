I saw the first of the dwarf movies and sometimes I had little fun watching it. There are many well-known TV / Comedy actors appearing in the first part and presented in fantasy cost, typical small episodes of their Stand-Up Program and exactly what the second movie has to face. Everything was already there .... nothing new to get. You are familiar with most of the often boring and stupid "jokes" and you always feel their purpose is to introduce every comedy lover of the last decade who wants to come back on stage. There is nothing important about the story: typical fairy tale story of Rumpelstiltskin, without any interest. I expected such a thing, but it's nothing I can complain about. I actually complain about the lazy story writers who had a whole background story; their only business was to get in many jokes and parodies, but they didn't get it. This crap is, besides the great appearance of Helge Schneider, a total waste of time and money. (If you don't like him, then remove 2 points from my evaluation.) If you want to save your money and get bad jokes, watch the crap that is broadly released every Friday night on SAT1 or RTL. I'm sure you'll recognize some "laugthers" I've seen in the cinema last night.
