You might consider some facts in the discussion to be spoiled. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg didn't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right with it. (Other Oscars for best actor nominations and so ... which I don't know. But it will be hard to justify, given what they told you to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg does it Regulating is so confronted, so encouraging. As I watched this movie, I made a distinction during a film as an art course that screamed me: "Sentiment is honestly delivered honestly. Sentimentality is pure and unreal, a false view of life." It's over-the-top sentimentality. When in the real life of two people ever start to read aloud in sync, like Celie and Shug Avery do when they sit on the beds of Nettie, they found? There are examples of this kind of faux behavior throughout the movie: all the men fuse around Mill Millie's car and then jump in harmony like a herd of birds that ascend when she's gone; Harpo falls through the roofs of several buildings he works on (a cheap slapstick); The whole gang of insurgents comes from the Jook-joint mass to the chapel, as if it is magically fueled by the choir's singing ... on and on. Nothing rings true. I even wondered if Harpo's name was purposefully chosen because it was his wife, Sophia's real name, "Oprah," backwards. Spielberg is not above such "crap". <br /> <br /> It's not that Spielberg is unable to give honestly action and emotion. Schindler's List was wonderful, much touched for me, and I also have a lot of admiration to save Private Ryan for his realism, even though the story is a bit confronted.
