Lipstick is another shiny film failure. I'm trying to think of one good thing I could say about the movie, and I'm struggling to get up. I think the red dress Margaux Hemingway wears in the end of the movie. was the best part. The writing and writing were not the worst I have ever experienced, but it could have been much better. Lipstick was very pleasant to see the eye. The sets were very shiny and nice to look at. The throw was good. I felt that Anne Bancroft's character was the only feasible character in the whole movie. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this one.
