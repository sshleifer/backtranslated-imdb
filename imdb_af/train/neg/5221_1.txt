Hello I come from Denmark, and one day I had a movie month with my friends. One brought this movie to him "Russian terminator" and it was extremely terrible. Having watched less than half a minute, we decided to move forward with some ridiculous "highlights" or say "lowlights" in the movie. I was mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my native Denmark. It had to be the biggest mistake this country ever made.
