Debbie Reynolds taps, tangos and yes, tap-dances her way through this ordinary thriller that has a clearly crafted '30s atmosphere. Two ladies, brought together when their boys commit murder, are trying to start their lives by running a crane dance school for Hollywood stunts. Trouble is, one of them is plagued by neuroses. Can you suggest this thing 10 years ago with Robert Aldrich directing Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would never have allowed Joan so much screen time to cover her stuff, and I couldn't imagine Bette Davis in the other role, scraping her heart. This is a pure false macabre, written by a sleeping Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to have the massacre of a group of rabbits detected!). Not our honest fun in the whole clumsy package. * 1/2 of ****
