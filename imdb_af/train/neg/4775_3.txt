What a total waste of time. The movie starts out as a clone of the Saw series, but worse still. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The end is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, no surprises and just a clear bad end. I liked some of the characters and hoped that everything would be bound together. It just doesn't happen. It's a total "wrestler" that ends with nothing of the good acting. I can't believe I've spent time watching it. It's not "fun" as some people put it. A man in a mask kidnap people who are connected and force them to figure it out. The connection is a stretch and he had to shoot the main actress first.
