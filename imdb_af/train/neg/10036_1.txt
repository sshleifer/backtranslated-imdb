Sometimes I don't understand what the directors think when they make a movie ... I had a trauma after watching Welcome (2007) and thinking they wouldn't do it again. But after many wonderful promotions, Tashan eventually ended up as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Such amazing 3 songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what do you get in the movie? Zero story, predictable plot, many Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing interesting, except to watch Kareena after her big weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Music fashion yet another great disaster ... in the music album, they spent time giving pathetic little dialogues of these 4 jokers and they didn't think to give the background song of the screens when Akshay Kumar don't do stunts ...! that song is so nice, very similar to Tashan Mein and it is not taken in the music album !!! :-( If you are planning to watch this movie, I would say, watch it listen to that background song that goes something like ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> <br /> Overall very disappointed with the way Bhaiyyaji attempted to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Go away, man, I gotta puke!
