Unlike another reviewer, I think it is well written, especially how fiction is, because greater imagination would be needed; and acted well, because there were no other characters who could share the focus of these dozen minute pluses, made-up monologues. But I'm just not entertained by such solemn, pious remembrances. Everyone has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten, non-atypical stories and problems, which exemplify how someone's life (or part of it) is for film. Then I also think bad about TV's reality shows. So, if it's your bag, you might like it. These are the kinds of things that will make for a good phone and / or internet gossip; but absolutely without any other-than-verbal action. And although each of the speakers is female, I'm going to leave sex.
