Protocol is an indisputable movie whose only saving grace is that it dies Goldie Hawn, along with good supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after he accidentally saves the life of an Arab dignitarie. The story goes halfway through the movie and Goldie's charm just saves this movie. Unless you're a Goldie Hawn fan, don't go out of your way to watch this movie.
