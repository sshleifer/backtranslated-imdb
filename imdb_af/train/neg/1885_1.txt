If you are looking for a movie, it is the sensible and boring existence of middle-class life caught in a web of non-communication and false ideals, then that is the movie for you. If you're also practicing and interested in the movie, you should probably look elsewhere. There are many movies that do much better. For example, try some of the darker movies by Bergman. The Filmmaker felt he had to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class that he was subjecting the viewer to an alarmingly dull and turbulent incident, until the film finally came to its bad and pathetic end. If you appreciate your time, there are much better ways to spend two hours, for example, cleaning your home.
