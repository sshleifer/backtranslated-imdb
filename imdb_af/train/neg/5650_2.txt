William Shatner in small doses is tolerant. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a tiny irritation, and in that amusing amusement, it has been seen to increase and redo his role. Just like in the original Star Trek series. I think I will never understand American humor, which is often "over" to get the message through. I agree with my feet. I no longer look at the show, it is a pity, because the rest of the role is good. It is a pity that Shatner's exaggerated role also influenced James Spader's performance. But the majority demonstrate how society goes, I think. I don't travel the same routes. Frank
