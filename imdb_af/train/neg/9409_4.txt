I love this show! I think it was nothing wrong with that! Only that Spidey does not bump anyone, but the show doesn't suck for it! Some people just think this show is bad about it. The story was wonderful and it was nice when other heroes appeared like X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Until bad Sandman never comes, but I like it! Best Spidey Show Ever !! My favorite episodes are: 1. Pivot 2. Spiders 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> But there are a few episodes that were really bad like: Rocket Racer and The Plek which was embarrassing to look. And I don't like Morbius and Hydro Man. First of Morbius sucks plasma instead of blood and I don't like vampires. And it annoyed me that he was almost the biggest villain in Season 2. Of course I must have called Hydro Man! He was terrible! I'd rather see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I don't like Spidey as the Man spider! <br /> <br /> But I think everything is bad!
