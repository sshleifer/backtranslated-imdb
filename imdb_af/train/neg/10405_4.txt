The fourth "Tremors" function dates back to 1889. "The legend begins" in the small town of "Perfection", which was then "Rejection, Nevada". As the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the terrible "Graboids". Some of the characters in contemporary "Tremors" films have ancestors in the past, both figuratively and literally. Most obvious is Michael Gross (like Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Gross, insufficient with firearms; So, he hires runner Billy Drago (as 'Black Hand' Kelly) to shoot some "Dirty Dragons". <br /> <br /> This one is a little used to - as it does in the distant past. It's like western with miniature versions of the original movie's monster "Graboids". This Tamer "Dirt Dragons" is nowhere near as terrorists as their "Tremors" (1990) counterparts. Consequently, in this movie, the characters spend a tremendous amount of time on the ground, which would not happen in the original movie. And it was weird to give the citizens as soon as Gross temporarily decided to leave town. Why so helpless? Why didn't Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) immediately gather the people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S. S. Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
