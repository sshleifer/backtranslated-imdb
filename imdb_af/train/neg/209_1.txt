I could never stay happy after Happy Days after Chachi joined the film, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie Scott Baio (a skateboard back) had. Jodie Foster in her first "adult" role turns into her usual professional performance, but this is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours from my life that I will never return! No notable characters, incredible storyline, dubious editing and horrible cinematography, but worst of all, I couldn't care less. The story of California teenagers in the 1970s, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.
