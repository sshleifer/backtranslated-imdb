Recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: A villain who seems to have escaped from the WWF has a terrible purpose with a rifle that has conflicting effects (the first man she shoots, catches fire, But if she shoots someone else they just disappear) and take time to pet a deer. Then you have the unlikely characters, 30-year-old college students, a crippled attempt at a surprise that ends and lots, much more. Avoid at all costs.
