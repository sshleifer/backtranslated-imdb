This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone ever made. This is a typical 80's movie where you have one man who destroys the whole army by himself. "First Blood Pt.2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but here you killed Arnold with the terror while here a particular nation has a bad man. This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. It was truly the highlight of the Cold War, but I'm sick of communists or Nazis always being shown as the enemy. There are so many American movies that have this one thing in common. Why can't a movie show Americans the enemy? Who will believe that one sole soldier will destroy the entire army? Do you really think such a thing would really happen? On the lookout, an average, brainwashing US viewer would decide.
