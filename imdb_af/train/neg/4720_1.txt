When I saw this "documentary", I was disappointed to see Serbian propaganda again in action again. Although Serbia and its nationalist politics are the main reason for the Yugoslav disintegration, it is not mentioned in this "documentary", made by Bogdanovich, whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his film, which he is far from is objective. This is one in the set of lies that is being pushed by the Milosevic regime. Everyone else is guilty. Only Serbs were right and victims, although most of the War criminals in The Hague tried Serbs, although Serbia was one who committed genocide against Bosnians. They attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia by all independent nations led by the UN. The commitment of Yugoslavia was not avoidable because the Serbs did not want the grip of their nationalism on the Federal Yugoslavian government. Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia therefore had to become independent nations to protect their interests. If you are interested in an objective documentary about the breakdown of Yugoslavia, and factual documentaries are not. You should look at "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation", made by Discovery Channel and BBC.
