I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time I met. Night Listener is without a doubt one of the dull films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was nothing in this movie - I didn't care about any of the characters, didn't buy for the whole puzzle type plot, didn't care how it ended. .. nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no excitement, no tension, nothing. The highlights include (no spoilers - there is nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car moving over a rough ground and ' a truck that beeps its horn. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and hoped for a similar ominous role to Williams, but unfortunately it was badly dropped. What is more disappointing is that I'm sure there's a good movie somewhere. The idea was interesting and I had sympathy for the characters, but it just didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> I could even give it 1/10, but that score was reserved for The Producers remake
