I'm a big point for the music of Neil Young, and with that, the glowing praise the movie received in many alt-indie circles, I hit the first show of Greendale I could get. My excitement was brief, as this torturous story and poor lyrical momentum either slept or disappointed most filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Neil says the movie started out as a soundtrack, and the characters came alive so much that they just filmed the soundtrack. Not the best way to make a story. No character really has a bow, and when 'significant' events happen, the viewer is not cared for, because movie-technique annoyances are so high at that stage. The movie is all the songs, and the characters end the songs with the songs as they are sung. The technique works for the first stanza, it is done, and then it is based on the nerves. It does not feel real or false, it just feels unwelcome. <br /> <br /> Acting terribly, with characters who find one mood and play it all. Poor lighting at times. The only kudos I can give to the film is about several scenes being shot as new ones, but the technique is being used in cinema today. This movie did little to make it any more. A good soundtrack, but nothing I can buy quickly. A bad movie.
