Today, Bea Arthur died, and I drove around on the IMDb website and somehow wound up on a show called "Gloria". "All In The Family" was a brilliant performance for its first four or five years and I bet I watched each episode more than once. However, I swear I didn't know that a show called "Gloria" existed. Maybe it's a good thing. Perhaps that means having a life as a young adult rather than watching television. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that the franchise "All In The Family" has worsened so much that it is a show I have never heard - and one that the previous judges got very poor. <br /> <br /> I rated the show 1 for two reasons - the system didn't allow me to vote and authors and TV performers should be condemned for starting a show no had business on the air and kept the memory of one of the biggest programs in TV history busy. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
