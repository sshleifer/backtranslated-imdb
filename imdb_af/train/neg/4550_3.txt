My dear Lord, what a movie! Let's talk about the "special effects" first. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of the fanatic effects, but I really thought the superposition was a practice of the past past, especially the 60's. So long I thought they could have recorded this movie long ago and it took them forever to cut it and release it. But as far as I know, they didn't have cell phones in the 60's. <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in movies is mostly a good story with a very good message. Acting is secondary, effects are secondary, I don't even care for a few minor inconsistencies. But in a movie like this bad play, unbelief, etc. Make a bad movie worse - that's what happened to me with the Celestine Prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said the book was really good and although I am not in all those spiritual things, I can somehow see that it can be conveyed in a credible way. The movie couldn't. <br /> <br /> There may be one reason to look at this one though. If you really love cheesy movies, this is the right one for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality, then I should have rated this movie ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies there, like "Critical Mass" (look at the commentary on that one - hilarious). The Celestine Prophecy is at least for some entertainment.
