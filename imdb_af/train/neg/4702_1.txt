I hate this movie. I hate the show. I just hate everything about it. it is so annoying and stupid. everyone says that wet and Alex Wolff are heroes in the music world and that they will make it. What kind of drugs do you take? !!!?!?!?!?! Nat and Alex will end up as a hobo or end like Jane Hudson of "What Happened to Baby Jane?". I couldn't get 20 minutes from this one barely 30 seconds from the shoulder, and I managed to survive about half an hour of 'Battle of the Bands'. How anyone in the Kid's Choice Awards can cherish these guys in the audience, I have no idea. days before the film show on Nick, most of the teenage girl actresses on Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) appeared in a commercially influential brain-dead child about how awesome wet and Alex Wolff is. First, they didn't think; and I have the second and most of them, wet and Alex, they probably pay a lot of money to convince and convincingly, because I don't see how anyone could find this show / entertainment. the music is just terrible. Nat's singing sounds like a sick, dying moose on crack. Alex is the most annoying movie / TV show character ever. He is not funny, he is annoying, he is very weird, and he thinks he is hot and knows all about girls. this guy is happy if he ever manages to be laid. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) don't even exist !! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex's cousin, jesse Draper (they must have a budget problem). Their father is not alone, he is married to Polly Draper, but she doesn't appear on the show. It looks like the Wolff's lean is less. Rosalina does not exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell you, the naked brothers are going to be in deep depth when their "fans" find out that the whole thing is being staged. 0/10
