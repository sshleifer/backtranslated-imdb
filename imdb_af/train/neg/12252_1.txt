** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a BAD movie. Seriously. Acting in absolutely terrible, the FX is scary and the plot is right terrible. But hey, it's so bad it's fun to watch! The writing is so bad that it's nice! You just have to laugh at lines and laugh like: "I think that's what you call CROCTEASING." as the women flash their breasts on the crocodile. I mean COME ON it's funny because it's so bad! It has such terrible jokes that they are funny! But after a while it just gets too much, because the movie is in the crap. I really started to fall asleep. Trust me already, the plastic hook foot that is knocked on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crocodile tail, keep you laughing for a long time. Although I have to say, it had one fine part when the hook broke, and it hung halfway and he hung there for a while to find out what to do. Heh heh mindless movie, which must be nominated for the MST3K line!
