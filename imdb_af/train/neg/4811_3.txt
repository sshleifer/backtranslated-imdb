I watched the Canadian video tape of this movie as "The Witching" which somehow made its way to the New York state. Audio was pretty bad, I had to collect it about 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack was often overwhelming. Orson Welles was a murmur, worse than usual, and some of his dialogue and of others went through an echo chamber. A ghostly figure that appeared again distorted her voice. Some closed captions would have really helped! <br /> <br /> A group of witches or satanists (the final credits say the group was not meant to represent a real group!) A ritual in which they get naked and a miscarriage of a doll . The woman who had the miscarriage and her husband went to a town called "Lilith" where he was offered a job at a toy factory. In spite of one of the AKAs of this movie that is apparently "The Toy Factory", we never see it, and it is only occasionally referred to. <br /> <br /> On her way to Lilith, her husband becomes impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss Mr. Cato wanted to know about their religious beliefs. He drives aggressively, causing another car to run off and inflate. After the police arrived, she took a doll out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie. <br /> <br /> It seems Mr. Cato and all the townspeople are witches, and they are the one who caused her miscarriage, though she didn't realize it. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, of which she wasn't really aware. <br /> <br /> Some images in the movie have an impact, but overall the movie is not very involved. The movie is a bit of a mess, and this is undoubtedly mainly due to the review and addition of new material. The original version, according to the end credits, is called Necromancy - a life for a life. The magic of DVD can show us both versions on one disc, but it's probably not a priority.
