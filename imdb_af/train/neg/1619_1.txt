At the start of the film, the beautiful photography and the jackal's scenes were great. However, the story was so slow and boring. And then the girl starts to house the fox, leading to tragic events. We live in the woods and see dragons regularly. One thing someone needs to know is that you allow wild animals to be wild and enjoy them from afar. This movie sets a terrible example for the kids who will follow to make a wild animal in a pet. I don't know what the point of the story would be. Even after the horrific events with the main wok, the girl still wanted to play the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes that predators on the foxes just add to the trauma to children watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie was. And what a terrible story it tells. The last told dialogue was so stupid, at what time did my wife and I shout on the TV! I absolutely hated this movie and would never recommend it to anyone!
