I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I looked forward to it. I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise, its concise submarine styling and rough edge technology compared to the Treks we are accustomed to. <br /> <br /> I have nothing interesting in this pilot. I found the plot confusing and confusing. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I love the character development - the images of man as an 'adolescent' species ready to cut off their pants were entertaining. <br /> <br /> And the Vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible stretch. <br /> <br /> But I don't think I'm going to hit this series. <br /> 3/10
