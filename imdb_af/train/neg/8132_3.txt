Really, using a stock nature documentary document from swarm bats employed by THE BAT PEOPLE is one of the most effective ones ever. There are shots of bitter bats hanging from the ceilings of caves, swarm bats flying from caves or worm near the caves. This alone is enough to be disturbing: Imagine they are all flocking to you? And they actually float in what a show-stop series had to be over the 40-minute point, a straight-fitting hilarious sequence where a bitter swarm of bats attack a police vehicle splashing over the windshield like bloody broken eggs. The problem is that this sequence takes about fifty minutes to save the movie, most of which consist of one or more people running around, screaming, blowing their arms to blow excitedly over a poor goofball that has succeeded. to get a bat. during his vacation. <br /> <br /> The fears are that he is getting rabies, which indeed sucks, so their holiday is ruined as the plot synopsis on top of the BAT PEOPLE reference page does point out. So here's an effective summary of the movie: A young couple goes on a romantic getaway that is ruined when the man is bitten by a bat. They try bravely to put it out, but he starts to rage, trying to convince him that it is a bit more involved than rabies, that he can't control himself, and they must all stay away. <br /> <br /> Now, when somebody cools at the mouth, is covered, eyes over one of the cheaper Muppets screaming and yelling at you to get away from ME, you get away from him. You are not trying to give drugs, you are not trying to tell him you love him, you give the man his space, go home and try next year's beautiful selection. <br /> <br /> But no, the people in this movie all keep up like morons, insist on pushing the man to his edge, and he flips, mutates into a batsman-beast and kills a lot of non-essential secondary characters. Nothing wrong with that, but the movie forgets that it's a low budget creativity feature and is trying to be a kind of psychological study. Instead of a monster movie, we get many people around and try to get this guy to take a cold pill. And finally he walks down the hills that look much more human than he should have, and people insist on trying to pursue him and pay the expected price. <br /> <br /> The main thing wrong with the movie is that it had to happen in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty tops and the movie had to be over the man after becoming a batman. rather than traveling there. It takes a good eighty minutes to really pick up steam at the front, with some interesting character chains along the way with the ever-entertaining Michael Pataki as a small town police who lost his moral edge and the then Paul Carr as a doctor friend who doesn't get the message. <br /> <br /> The movie is terribly boring, about fifteen minutes long and missed the opportunity to be a nice, forgetful little creator of a mutant run amok like the Italian horror artist RATMAN today. watched and was sadly inspired to try to see this one. I and my shiny ideas, although the scene at the police vehicle was a villain: Bad we couldn't have had twenty minutes of it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
