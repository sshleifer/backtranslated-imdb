I rented this movie last week. I saw how Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were, so it was promising. And that was until Justin Timberlake came to the scene. He is a very bad actor and may not make a movie again. I mean, he's one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He does not place any emotion whatsoever on any of his lines. Why was he the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so boring, it looks like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It may look cool, but believe me, it's not. <br /> <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott's play is very good. It's about one of the very few good things about this movie. He's just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. He does have some very direct lines. <br /> <br /> The story, though sometimes temporary and exaggerated, was good. I expected a big turn when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was murdered, but nothing really happened.
