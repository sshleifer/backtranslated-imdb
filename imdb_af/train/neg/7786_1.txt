I never had to watch this movie. The style of filming can be considered for some, but it is considered to be migraine. I think it might have been an interesting plot, but since I couldn't see it for a long time, I missed a lot of time. The flickering pictures and stop motion filming branded my brain. I stopped looking halfway through and won't be back for a second time. I suppose if I was a dark and stormy night alone in my own lighthouse, it could just be the ticket. PS Not sure if the lighthouse / movie style thing can be considered a spoiler, but I don't want to be. blacklist on my first review;)
