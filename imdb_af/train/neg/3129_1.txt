I had time to kill before I saw football. I saw this movie on the scifi channel and it literally thought after I watched it, I found my version of the spiritual course of the Bataan mortar. movie ripped off from the Mummie series and Jurassic Park. It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the culmination of the movie and then it went so deadly that it made the recent stock market drop look like a hiccup. The acting was so bad that I hope that one and all will eventually be buried. The lead of Casper Van Dien longed for the high caliber of Steven Seagal in "On Deadly Ground" if his line reading was so wood that Woody Woodpecker was planning to put a cameo on his shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional range was so limited that I was under the impression that my kitten was more expressive when I asked for popcorn to eat. The direction was so uncomfortable. I looked back at my cousin's Grade 3 game review that had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to have merged from the effects of the aforementioned film franchise, it can't even be thought of as a tribute. The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were extremely friendly by recycling cheap special effects from last year's Grade Z horror movie. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis do in these movies is outside of me and after litigation they have to look at their agents for misrepresentation to get involved in such a dream of a movie. My warning to everyone and everyone is to watch this movie, because this movie can make your IK drop with long-lasting performance. On a lace note, I noticed at IMDb that sometimes movie salaries are being published. I wondered if they were a way to repay the salaries of actors for their poor performances in such movies. Beware and be safe at all costs.
