I rented this movie and thought it looked like a wonderful wonderful historical piece. What I got was a piece of pure garbage. This movie was confusing in most places, brackets in almost every place and terribly in all places. Mira Sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was at best depressed. Ben Kingsley had been deprived of his knights for considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw must definitely play at Petunia Dursley. At least the Harry Potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematography looks like some schoolchildren have taken a class in Cinematography 101 and failed. Almost every play in the movie is hacked for some kind of effect; Of course, the end result is the cutest piece of editing I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost as good as Agis; He had such a bad writing to work with. Rachael Stirling gives her best effort as the almost believing lady in the waiting. In the end, I really wish Blockbuster Video refunds. I'm so glad I didn't spend ten dollars on this fiasco in the theater. Performing this Marivaux play since the 18th century makes me wonder how many people have had their best void during this work over the centuries. If I were there, they wouldn't hear the play over the snoring. Thanks for the modern convenience of DVD players; You can skip past the boring or terrible scenes. Guess what means I just watched the beginning and the end!
