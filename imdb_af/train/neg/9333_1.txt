Terrible !!! I don't want to be too negative, but this movie has an IQ of stupid monkey. What a disaster. I just couldn't believe how bad this movie is. The dialogues are very strange and shabby, the camera sometimes works horribly, the music at times like a soundtrack to Lawrence of Arabia, I just watched this movie to see how much worse it can get. Some of the side kicks "actors" are total disaster. Care but all my thumbs and toes and anything hanging on my body fall to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a good actor, but who knows maybe he's in financial crisis to take part in such a fiasco movie. . . . . this film must be presented to all students in all film schools just to teach them how not to make a movie
