This is the most depressed movie I've ever seen. I first saw it as a child and it only thought to me now. I know it was in a time when life was difficult and I know these people were poor and the crops were essential. Yes, I get everything. What I find difficult to take I can't remember a single light moment in the whole movie. Maybe it was true for life, I don't know. I am absolutely sure the play was, and the direction and quality of filming, and so on, was wonderful and I know every movie can't have a happy ending, but as a family movie, I think it's scary. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a movie. I cannot stress enough how this film influenced me as a child. I recently talked about it and all the sad memories came back. I think it will achieve everything but the heartless for Prozac.
