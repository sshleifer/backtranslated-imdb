We bought this series on DVD because of all the glowing reviews we've seen here. I gave it three stars because there is little doubt that sometimes acting, directing and writing are brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that we have not seen the propaganda that has been transmitted so smoothly on the series. If one sees this with distinction, the entire litany of the radical right-wing beliefs will be announced by the Fox (Faux) News Network. To avoid giving away a spoil, I will refrain from pointing out all the dozens of specific cases. A brief overview of the plots found here on IMDb will reveal everything from torture to gun control right of a network to provide "Infomercials" and to name them news is justified by cute plot twists and passionate speeches by some best actors are given. in the world. We've watched many shows and finally raced when their torture was justified with attorney general Gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used to protect us all. The series also manages to demonstrate male and female gays in subtle ways by using them as plot devices depicting evil people. All in all, the complete litany of radical religious law. <br /> <br /> No doubt, the popularity of this program will be used by future historians to prove that America has lost its way in the early part of this century. As a self-student of history, I would feature this program as a propaganda league produced by Goebbels for Hitler and the propaganda that Hollywood made for the American audience during WWII. <br /> <br /> So if you want to use it as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be. Just be sure to buy a cheap used copy, so you can enrich the ultra-right wings at Faux Network that caused this travesty.
