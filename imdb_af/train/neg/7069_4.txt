When the movie was released, it was the biggest hit and it soon became the Blockbuster. But frankly, the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot that glorifies a loser. The film has a Tag line - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara", which means Love's Sweet, but the sacrifice is immortal. In the film, the hero of the film (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for the leading lady (Pooja Gandhi), although the two loved one another! His justification is the meaning of the tag line. This movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this Loser-like Sacrificial attitude very thoughtful and thus became the cult film when they could continue with their lives. Ganesh's play in the movie is amateurish, Crass and Childish dumb. He actually looks funny in a song, (Onde Ondu Sari ...) when he is supposed to look stylish and cool. His appearance also does not help. His hair style is badly done in most of the movie. POOJA GANDHI CANT WET. Her costumes are terrible in the movie and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The good part of the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by Mano Murthy, which is actually the real rescue of the movie. The lyrics of Jayant Kaikini are also very well written. Director Yograj Bhat should be placed the songs tastefully. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all-in-all, except for the songs, the movie is a very ordinary one !!!!!!
