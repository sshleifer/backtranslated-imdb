The only salvation was the small part by Larry Miller. It seems the movie was trying too hard to be something about Mary, but I didn't even see that movie and it still didn't live up to those standards. The actor who plays Paul was wonderful, but Selma Blair stuck in the stupidity of her cruel intent character. James Brolin was wonderful, but Paul's father seemed to be trying too hard to be the Randy Quaid character of the National Lampoon's Vacation films.
