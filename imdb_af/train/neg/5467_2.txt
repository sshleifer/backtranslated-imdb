What to say about this movie. Well, it's about a lot of good students who have bad drugs and are transformed into delinquent students who sell more of the bad drugs to people. Two of the people have detrimental effects, as one is in a poisonous avenger type and his girlfriend throws up creatures growing in the school's cellar. It's about everything there is and they stretch it out for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and must be locked away forever. Although not fair, some people like Troma's movies and they can see if they want to. Troma movies for me though the worst movies there are. I just watched this one out of morbid curiosity.
