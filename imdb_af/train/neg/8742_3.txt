Having seen the movie from the film in the film, I thought it was an original concept for excitement, which puts it in the competitive world of computer companies. The all-star cast was another message that this movie is likely to be good. But when I didn't follow it in the first week of release, it disappeared by week 2. I was afraid something was wrong. I waited patiently for the DVD release, and bought it for a pleasant evening's performance. The expectation on the way home was much better than the movie. For a start, the direction is frightening. There is nothing in the mind and the director just makes a part of himself, so he can appear in the movie. I will not be in a hurry to hire him in the future. Secondly, the lead role is totally overlooked as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe is usually the cool character as in the cruel intentions and manner of the gun, but in this he is supposed to be a cunning hero he tries to portray by slipping when he runs and has geeky friends, but he looks not right. Female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani, don't play enough, but when they don't, their performances are near their best. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could be made for him and it's his fiery mood and mysterious ways the movie is dragged along. The final point is that this movie is another one that fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the movie and instead only appears in the deleted section of the DVD. This causes even more disappointment than though some of these scenes are rough, filling in important gaps in the story.
