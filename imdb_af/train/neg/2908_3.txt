Based on one of the books by Gabriel Marquez and it can be brilliant literature, this theater adaptation really battles because it's more than fighting against sleep rather than enjoying cinematographic delices. The story is about an old couple whose son died and lives a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and in which the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings money to a future cockfight. I can no longer speak words about this useless pretentious piece, maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but just sit 90 minutes ahead of your screen? No gracias .....
