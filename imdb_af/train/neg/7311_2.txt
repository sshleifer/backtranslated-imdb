Okay, I didn't hear much about this movie, so when it came to the movie channels on TV, I wanted to see it, a horror aficionado. I think I can do a collective "huh"? for all who watched it. <br /> <br /> I decided to continue with my life, but at a party with my closest friends we saw it coming and some of us already decided to laugh. our way through it, we all proclaim "it's the stupid thing I've ever seen". It wasn't scary; I give it to Roth (which I think is a young hack); characters change through the whole movie, ala "Cube". <br /> <br /> But in spite of your typical "rats in a loft" scenario - who will turn on who and so on, it was a fairly average horror. <br /> <br /> Some points: 1.) What was with the child? I'm not even talking about being strange and biting people. I'm talking about the whole "slow motion karate kicking", what was it? 2.) Okay, I know Rider's character likes Jordan Ladd's, but as a young woman, I was terrified that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep. Uh, it's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie, just as Roth could be in the movie. Talk about how to write yourself senseless! 4.) What was with the deputy? 5.) So was she just pulled apart by the dog right away? And there was little or no blood left? Just a scrap of her jeans? Anyway, we loaded our donkeys, and I like to laugh at horror movies (Return of the Living Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I don't know if we should laugh here ...
