I'm a big Randolph Scott fan, but this movie is a dud. The whole thing has a canned, fake, soundtrack feel to it, with really horrible rear window projection. It is a good idea that the scriptwriter has buried successfully in a nitwit script, making it impossible for the audience to engulf the action and really care about any of the characters. The director is pedestrian, and emphasizes just how bad the script is, instead of improving it. I've seen many enjoyable "soundtrack" productions before, but it's not one of them. All it means is that you appreciate the keen Scott / Boetticher movies even more. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is brown, prune and shines the million dollar smile throughout. He's always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his films. Apart from Scott, the other main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of how much I enjoyed Wymore in Errol Flynn's movie, Rocky Mountian. In 'Man behind the gun' she is just as beautiful, and you can say she's a good actress, but she was forced to say a few dumb lines, and the blocker she was given by the director was real terrible. I just saw Phil Carey in the Pacific, and he plays exactly the same character here ... an arrogant pain you want to knock in unconscious. I think this proves he is a good actor ... he made me hate. There are some painful attempts at comic relief that only detracts from the movie, in my opinion. Although there are many elements to beat, I have to say that I really enjoyed myself with the two Spanish songs sung in the musical numbers. But that's not why we're going to see Randolph Scott movies, right? <br /> <br /> There are definitely worse Scott movies out there, and this one is definitely not unbearable, but it can certainly be considered nothing but mediocre.
