I can only believe that Garson Kanin had to be two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "A Double Life" and the funny "Born Yesterday" and wrote such excellent screens as Adam's Rib and Pat and Mike with his wife, Ruth Gordon, and then the one who wrote and / or such a tiring, sad bravery as "baby mother", "kind of a nut", and so on. The game tries, but the writing is so tired and clicked that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The script falls to the nearer feeling in the truly offensive sequence in which Janssen's character testas' character tests to make sure he is not gay. An ugly series, but unfortunately one that can easily play in a movie today. "Ethnic" jokes are now completely banned, but "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".
