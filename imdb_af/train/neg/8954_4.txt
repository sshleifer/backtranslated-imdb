I had high expectations for this movie because I enjoyed the book so much. However, I don't think I would understand the movie's presentation if I didn't read the book already. The film is a noble effort to show the despair of people who want to break the bonds of overwhelming government, but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly. The corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while ordinary people struggle to get the bare essentials for survival. Perhaps most people feel this way to their leaders and rulers, whether or not they are actually suppressed or suppressed. Orwell's dystopia seems to exist in many places in our modern world. It's been a few years since I read the book, but one hears references to Big Brother, The Thought Police and Newspeak, often in the media and accidental conversation. Probably many people who use these terms do not realize where the terms came from. I strongly recommend reading the book.
