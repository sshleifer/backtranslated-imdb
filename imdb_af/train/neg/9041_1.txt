I loved the movie very much, despite the unfortunate pass. BUT, I did not notice that Canada was referred to Montana North. This is definitely not Montana North and will never be. Americans wonder why they are considered arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one of the reasons why. Stop teaching the United States of America to think they own the planet. Such a central world view does not become one of the world's great nations. Even in the desert. I will never refer to the US as 'Alberta South'. Walt will never leave us, so why start now. Other than that, the movie was really goofy, better luck next time.
