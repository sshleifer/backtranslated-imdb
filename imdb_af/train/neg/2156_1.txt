I am familiar with the fantastic book of Goodnight Mister Tom for absolute centuries and it was only recently when I had the chance to see this adaptation. I heard many positive comments on this, so I had a lot of hope. Once this film was finished, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good movie at all. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was a very poor fit and almost 4.5 / 10 of the book was missed. Especially, I found that many of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not here. There wasn't much dialogue. It was too fast and fast, but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never saw the bond and love between William Beech and Tom in the movie. The deciding was also not so good. I thought it could have been really good, but it was so different from the book! Anextremely poor adaption, one of the worst things I've seen. It deserves a decent remake that would be better 1000 times better than this stack of garbage.
