"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many 50's films about hot-rodding teenagers who met the supernatural. In this case, the teens cannot pay the rent for their hangout and are put out. With nowhere else to go, they decide on an apparently haunted house. As you may have guessed, there are some strange things when they arrive. And there is a turn at the end. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies, but it's fun. My favorite character was the filthy parrot. Well, let me rewrite it: he didn't speak like a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things we didn't expect from a bird. The movie's pure hokum, but harmless.
