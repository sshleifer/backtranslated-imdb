An executive who has been very successful in his professional life, but very incompetent in his well-known life, meets a boy with a syndrome that escapes from a residence. Both characters feel very alone and the seemingly less intelligent one will show the beauty of the little things in life to the executive. With this argument I somehow expected Amelie-like atmosphere and sentimental music, but I didn't expect moralistic disgusting movie. Anyway, as there were interesting screens (the boy is sometimes quite a violent man), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to continue with the movie. The French film generally has the ability to show something that looks pretty much alive to the more stereotypical American cinema. But that is why it is much more disappointing to see the absurd end to the impossible death of the boy, the beautiful tone, the happiness of the executive family, the cheap morals, the unbearable laugh of the daughters, the old clown from heaven. like Michael Landon ... Actually nasty, in my humble opinion.
