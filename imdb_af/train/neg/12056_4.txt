This movie is a great example of how media manipulation can sell a movie that is no more than a very unique TV sitcom. In Puerto Rico, the daily newspaper with the widest circulation constantly wrote about the miracles of this movie, almost all hurting. Coincidentally, the second largest circulation newspaper belongs to the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that analyzed the form and content of the film, highlighting all its mistakes, clich√©s and poor writing. <br /> <br /> Just because a movie is part of the audience makes Lach with easy and clear jokes, and because you can recognize actors and scenery, it doesn't make an acceptable movie.
