When I read the back of the DVD cabinet, I thought it sounds very interesting ... so ... I threw my mom into the stack of movies in the "4 for 20 bucks" section at Blockbuster. When we got home and got into the movie ... twenty minutes in it, we found ourselves turning to each other. "It sucks. Let's put something else in." I will admit, some of the friends' lines at the cafe laughed a little. But come on, get some decent actors! Every time in a movie, if the play is bad and the movie doesn't go painfully and actually looks interesting, I can stick it out and get some laughs about how they're left (or down) doing their lines. But I can take as much. Screaming screens seemed as if the actors had been hysterical of the laugh, there was no delivery for their lines. Amateur doesn't even come close to the play in this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who arrived here To say that this movie was good, some had to be VERY good drugs while watching the movie. This is the most senseless thing I have ever had the displeasure to look at. DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE OR BUY !!!
