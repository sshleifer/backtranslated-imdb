WARNING! This review will reveal the end of the movie, "Scoop". If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad you'd think Annie Hall was a fly. <br /> <br /> It gets one star because you see Hugh Jackman's naked chest. That's the only thing "Scoop" goes for. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's misfortune, and his fiction on young enough women, is at this stage his granddaughter, the ability to make films <br /> <br /> The plot looks promising: A ghost, Ian McShane, leads a gentle student, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether an English gentleman, Hugh Jackman, is the notorious Tarot. Card Killer of prostitutes. A magician, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, promising plot is, but the movie has no charm, humor or atmosphere at all. It's an incredibly guided, amateur effort for someone who even made one previous movie, no matter, decades. Perhaps Allen had a stroke that became unreported in the press. <br /> <br /> Much has been made of the fact that, unlike his previous films, Woody Allen, now a septuary, FINANCE leads a younger male to get the girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot is built up so that the girl gets no one. <br /> <br /> There is an early scene where Johansson gets drunk for no reason centrally in the movie, seduced by a powerful, older director. "Seduced" is a euphemism for what happens. It's a "slam, bam, I have to go" kind of moment. It has no connection with the plot, and it cheaper Johansson in the viewer's eye. Why did Allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - sex with the female head. Allen gets his cake and eats it too. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actress. She doesn't know how to control the screen, except by wearing a tight, low cut tree. She mimics Allen in a few scenes, and it just seems strange and sad. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help her character to be written as a doll that can't function without a ghost or an elder. and less than awesome wizard, tell her what to do at every turn. <br /> <br /> She is about half of Jackman's age, and she appears as a very volatile screen presence in their screens. <br /> <br /> Public members who are not obsessed with breasts earn better in their heroines, and Jackman also deserves better - a writing that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency, and an actress who does that properties can be transmitted. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is also deceived by writing. Apparently Allen can't say Jackman is so beautiful and young, so he doesn't give Jackman anything to say or do. Like Johansson, he is only used for his good looks. It is a pity that, as Jackman showed in a number of productions, he could act from 'Oklahoma' to 'X Men'. <br /> <br /> Here's the big plotwending - Jackman, suave, beautiful English Lord, really is a killer. So, although the film says it's all about letting someone other than Allen get the girl, she doesn't get anyone. Jackman, the man she loves, is a man who killed a prostitute. Nice, Woody. Nice way to punish your heroine to be out of your grasp. <br /> <br /> In a passive aggressive touch, Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence, as well as his character, the wizard, which Scarlett Johansson leaves everyone. only at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> A final note: at my screen, no single audience member laughed at any point during the movie. Always a bad sign when a movie is advertised as a comedy.
