This must be accompanied by a special rating and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> Daneliuc's obsession with the dirtiest body functions is becoming a real nightmare here. It is also clear that the man is a misunderstanding, he hates everyone - his country, his people, his actors, his work. And this hatred makes him blind and he forgets the profession he knew long ago. <br /> <br /> This so-called "movie" is just an ominous series of disgusting images, without artistic value and no professional knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and good sense. Shame, shame, shame!
