A gave it a "2" instead of a "1" (terrible) because it is not denied that many of the visual images were amazing, had a lot of talent in the special effects and artwork. But it wasn't enough to save it. <br /> <br /> The "sepia" toned, washed out color sort of thing has been done in other movies before. Nothing new there. I can see there were some hat tips for other old, classic movies. OK. No problem with that. <br /> <br /> But a movie should be entertaining and interesting, not something that will make you sleep. <br /> <br /> The story line and the script of this movie were terrible, the characters two-dimensional. Move slowly. Some of the scenes were nice to look at, but eventually, as a whole, it was pretty boring, I couldn't recommend it.
