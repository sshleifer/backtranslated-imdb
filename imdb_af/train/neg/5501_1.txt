I thought My favorite Martian was very boring and pulled out !! It wasn't funny at all. The audience just sat throughout the movie and didn't laugh at all !!! Not even the kids laughed !! It is sad for a Disney movie !! I thought they could have found someone better to play the martian rather than Christopher Lloyd !! He was really stupid! And he wasn't funny !! I thought the talk pack was really stupid! In the original television series, the suit does not speak and move! In my opinion, they shouldn't have lost their time on this movie !! I give it two inches !! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend the movie to anyone !!! Thank you!!
