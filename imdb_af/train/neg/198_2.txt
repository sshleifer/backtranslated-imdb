Burt Kennedy was always a very good director, but you will never know this rubbish mess. Not only does this movie look cheap, it is cheap - most of the scenes are lifted from 1955 to the far superior "The Last Command". The 32-year-old play looks more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes actually shot for this movie are disorganized, confused and incompetent, and look just as slim as the rest of the picture. It has the look and feel of a bad student life (and the budget doesn't look much more). It moves like molasses, the acting for the most part is either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose - although Raul Julia gets better than most of the other role-players - and it's very full of annoying historical inaccuracies . In addition, it is too long. If you are going to make a boring movie, do it in an hour or so and get it over - don't stretch it for three hours, as this one does. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, watch John Wayne's 1960s version, or even the 1955 movie from which this movie stole his action scenes. Hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie. Skip it.
