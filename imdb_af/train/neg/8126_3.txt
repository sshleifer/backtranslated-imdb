I didn't think it was as terrible as some people believe. It's going to be one of those cheesy horror movies, you can waste time in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, although it's not better than that. It is true that the acting is not good. For example, I thought Marianne McAndrew, like Cathy Beck, got quite passionate - but the biggest problem is that several aspects of the plot don't really make sense to me. The Becks is on a journey described by John (Stewart Moss) as part-work and partly the honeymoon they never had (now it's romantic!) The work has something to do with ravines that sound strange in themselves (how share it from a tour group through a cave related to someone's job?) But it gets weird when we find out that he is a doctor who is doing preventative medicine research (huh? this connection completely lost me. ) Bitterly through a bat as he starts in the cave he turns into what I suppose it should be a human-bat hybrid (although we finally see him in makeup, he looks much more like a kind of monkey) and a deadly spree begins. Here's another problem. The first murder is a nurse in a hospital. First, everyone thinks her death was an accident. The second murder is a young girl who is described as having thrown her throat. The sheriff (Michael Pataki) then tells us that her death is similar to the nurse (which means the throat was torn? How can someone think it was an accident?) And what is the sheriff? He looks rather nonsense to the scene in Cathy's hotel room when he drinks a drink and then rapes her almost, then everything seems to be normal again. It was sown with an end that left almost everything unsolved, and also with one of the most annoying theme songs I've ever heard in a movie. Even for all this, there was something here that made me look. Sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half. Pretty bad, yes - but not as terrible as some people say.
