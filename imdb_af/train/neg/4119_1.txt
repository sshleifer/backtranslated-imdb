I thank God, I didn't go for movies for this movie. I will be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on TV and I couldn't believe my eyes. I wonder if any movie could be worse than this one. they did not spend anything for millions of dollars on this movie. terrible acting and terrible scenario. I think the other people who have commented are the man who works from that movie company;) It is a huge fiasco! in the year 2000 can they still laugh at this kind of movie? Embarassing ...
