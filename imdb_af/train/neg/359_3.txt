I saw my fair share of heavily thought-out endings and final snooping on movies, but I don't remember a movie that committed absolute suicide like this one did. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers clearly hoped the big turn would surprise us all ... and it did, but perhaps not in the way the directors hoped. I was surprised to surprise that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw did everything, whether individually or collectively, with this turkey. <br /> <br /> The movie to the last thirty minutes was quite enchanting and I like the way the story unfolded and the nature of the movie overall. But once the turn became known, the plot holes and contradictions were remarkable. The underlying motive for revenge was poor and the ways in which things worked out neatly for Bobby Earl were ridiculous. What's worse is that the rest of the film was unpredictable in the foreground. <br /> <br /> Harris did a tremendous performance, and Connery is like Morgan Freeman never giving a bad performance, though the movie is not that good! All in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer in mind. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose diving in the history of the theater.
