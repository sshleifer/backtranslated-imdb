It's a remake and the thing (1982/1951), I think that's, there are so many factors of what previous movies deny it. <br /> <br /> So the acting is bad, James Spader does a super-stargate re-enactment of himself, with his coffee coffee and his some strange thoughts / movements, but it's about it, the other actors I haven't yet not noticed. You don't get to know someone from the main characters. And the plot development is slow, boring and, yes, I know what's going to happen in 30 minutes. Score / music is ultra-boring, because there are many unimportant people out there who will make a score for a coke and a credit, but it's a big crap. Some of the special effects are nice, if made early in the 90's. If you like clever strangers, chills and excitement, don't watch this movie. It's a dull combination of thing, alien 3, outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production really went really bad. Now this combination would be cool if someone knew what they were doing and the only one of this production who knew it was no one. <br /> <br /> Although I saw much worse, I wouldn't recommend this movie. to anyone, but if you come up with one cold night and just want something shine, it will pass the time slowly.
