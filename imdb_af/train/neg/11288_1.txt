In recent times, I have been to both this movie and the King Arthur topic, on DVDs chosen by others for an evening's "entertainment" and together they achieve nothing more than to convey a growing idea. I completely lacked the modern film-viewing public for discrimination and are as long as they get 'action'. Both movies were unrest. <br /> <br /> Whatever happened to character development? What also happened to a meaningful dialogue? What Happened to VERB? And if we see something that seems to be vague, "historically", it all happened with the attempt to capture some accuracy, a realistic idea of ​​the "political map" of the time, even a little flavor of the era, especially in its social attitudes. Why should everyone display the value of the 21st century America? I read on the message boards of denials that were "little known" to the dark ages. Not so. Abundant amounts are known, with much learned scholarship on the era, but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do homework. <br /> <br /> I just wish I could vote 0/10.
