*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story sounds good and if you have read the novel, you probably expect a deep and intense film that provides some insight into interesting and inadequate exploration of human relationships. <Br /> <br /> Whenever enough, the script tries to do so, the director tries to do it, but the main thumb fails. Maria's play is so dry that she didn't feel, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes it looks like she's nervous because of the camera. Her only true scene is near the end where she is caught by her girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Ioana looks even more tense than Maria and even worse, she doesn't look natural. Maria had the attitude, even though it was artificially pushed to be obvious, but she had it and her character received credibility. And to make matters worse, we don't have insight into her: where did she come from, how did she get involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship develop? We only get a little bit of her parents and their relationship just seems to be "there": it has a content and end but no start. Just like her partner Maria, she only once had a scene that really touches, the scene where she casts Maria's character Kiki. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this movie (except the landlady) to prove a few plays. He has his character's attitude and it suits him. Only once or twice does it seem to fall (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it was not needed at all). <br /> <br /> I love the story, Tudor Chirila is OK there, the resident actually works and Puya delivers his few lines of style, but it doesn't save the movie. Too bad, the whole environment has great potential and the Romanian cinematography could have used a movie on this theme. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the turbulent relationship between brother and sister seems more credible than the non-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a good try in this direction) lesbian relationship of Mary and Ioana. I am very sorry to spend money on a ticket, but I rather looked at the comfort of my room.
