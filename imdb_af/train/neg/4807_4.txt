"Ambushed" is no ordinary action movie. It is very bad to be ordinary. One man walks to the other with a machine gun burning. The other man fires one lap and drops the man with the larger firepower without a note of the hail perpendicular to him. Guess which one the good guy is. Duh. Such is "messed up" through and through. Not a good action movie, not a good drama, not a good movie. "Ambushed" fails at all levels, with the B-movie veterans' film, they almost pretend to know they are a real loser. Not recommended for anyone. <br /> <br />
