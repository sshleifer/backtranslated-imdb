If your idea of ​​entertainment is watching, graphic footage of people being carried by cars (you see a woman moving under the front wheel as she swivels the car before she goes under the rear wheel - and they show it twice when you see it) missed it for the first time then it's the documentary for you. I no longer watched this very disturbing piece of voyeurism, but it was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it takes for television networks to start showing bad movies. Perhaps self-diminishing game shows might be nice. <br /> <br /> I already know there are disturbed people in the world and terrible things happening. I don't need to see the evidence on the TV as an entertainment.
