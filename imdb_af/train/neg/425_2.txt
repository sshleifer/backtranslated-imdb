I can't believe I'm so angry after I see it, and I write my first review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is nothing but a Rehashed Planet Earth lite. Now I knew it was being advertised as "of the people who brought your planet Earth", but I didn't think they were going to use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini-series. I only paid $ 8.75 to see something I already own on DVD. Shame on Disney not to warn people that there is absolutely nothing original here (except a James Earl Jones voice over and 90 seconds sailfish that I don't believe in planet Earth). <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime of all is that while Planet Earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence of killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney has taken the story and put it in family friendly triangle changed. After the death of the male polar bear, they show his cubs considerably a year later, and they get a little rubbish about how they are ready to remember, and that the earth is really a beautiful place. No mention of the adult cubs who have fatal deaths due to the same condition their father endured, no warning for trouble for future generations if we do not get our act together, nothing. Just a montage of things we've already seen in the movie (and many times more if you're one of the billion people already seen Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> I've never felt the theater shy and cheated in my life.
