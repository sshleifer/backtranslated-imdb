This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror movies that are simply not fully realized. There are two routes to capturing horror movies: you don't really explain what's going on (or who's the killer, like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization to explain everything (Halloween may be possible) be an example of this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Creep deteriorates in this area. I see absolutely no reason to give Craig a small piece of the back story without completely capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. No character is fully realized, although the circular nature of Kate's character in the movie is the most successful part of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the shows give it the essential life to make it tempting or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty movies breaking down the movie . <br /> <br /> This movie is going to be another example of a movie (as most are) It can be so much better, though it will never be good. The only thing that was properly used in the film was the setting: the characters, story, direction and overall writing would have benefited from a serious facial. <br /> <br /> Creeping serves a purpose as a mindless, foolish horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment, but unfortunately, it's about it ...
