Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad movie. It's a rarity, but it's definitely not worth hunting. This Italian Jaws rip-off makes little sense most of the time, and the rest is not meaningful. The "crocodile" is not convincing at all, and many of the subplots do not go anywhere. If it's at the local video store, you might want to see it if you're a fan of monster movies, but it's not worth hunting.
