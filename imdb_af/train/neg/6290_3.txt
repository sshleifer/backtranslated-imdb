Review: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deep and loving and sure they are perfect for each other, even though they only met a few months ago. Todd, Ron's son-in-law is not so happy. He is afraid that marriage is a threat to his face in the family business and decides to arrange for Ron's bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromise situation, get evidence and break Ron and Mel. <br /> <br /> Comment: Must be a sequel to a comedy classic, but it's not funny at all. It is mostly a puberty show and a young excuse to show scarcely dressed women. Actually, in a way, it's almost impressive, many have you in there because they're everywhere. Unfortunately, this is also one of the signs of a movie that cannot support him. It's simply not good enough. <br /> <br /> It has three reasoning points, or actually three actors that are better than worth it. It is chief actor Josh Cooke who actually manages to give an impression of common sense. Sara Foster, I know, has more talent than doing such movies, and Emanuelle Vaugier looks much more talented than this movie. <br /> <br /> What is suspicious is good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are scarce. It's just not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
