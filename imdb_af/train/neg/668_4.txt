So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I am a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but when I saw it, it wasn't horror or thriller either. <br /> <br /> I was basically making the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You can predict what will happen next. The young actors were good at playing their characters, but I have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not exciting or scary. There were almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars to watch it in theaters, wait until it comes to DVD.
