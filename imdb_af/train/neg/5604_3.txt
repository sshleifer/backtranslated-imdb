I've heard about this movie for many years, and finally I got the chance to see it. A massive murder of cheerleaders back in 1963 and 1969 eventually led to a cheerleading camp to close. Fast forward to 1982, and Bambi, a former student, opens it up with new recruits, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one they are murdered by the murderer until only one remains. That's when we find out who did it and why. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie, Tom Smothers is a terrible accent as Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens does his Pee-Wee Herman schtick. The plot in general is not very well developed, and rather lame, but there are some funny scenes, the House of Bad Pies and the strip poker scene. The end seems to be thrown together, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Overall, good for about ten or fifteen minutes, the rest can only penetrate forward. Maybe it'll be on TV, but it's not worth buying.
