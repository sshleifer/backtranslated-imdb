I haven't seen anyone leave this movie yet and I think I might be the first. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. I really didn't look at the end. It was like watching a boring soap or a very good one (all soap is shit). The actors were poor and the storyline was bad. The person who rated it 10/10 has no idea what he is about. The writing was terrible. 2 People were in a bad conversation with threats and you expect the good guy to say something really good and beat the shit, but no. He says, "If you do, I'll hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, look away. Please don't watch this movie, because ... It's CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: Poorly acting, bad fighting, bad writing. <br /> <br /> Don't look! Of course, this is my opinion.
