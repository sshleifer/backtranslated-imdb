I've seen fantastic stories, but the site of this one is so incredible that it's very close to ridicule. A rich and young man is undergoing a heart transplant the day after his marriage and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon that happens next, a mixture of dialogue among ... say ... souls? ... maybe and the real life where the dedicated mom will do everything to save her son's life. There is no tension or tension, just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of accidents that can never happen in life. <br /> <br /> It is not to say that the film is completely of quality - Actually, for the first time, director Joby Harold, does a good job of joining a good team of actors who Hayden Christensen at his first Includes an important role after he took off the Anakin Skywalker costume, fabulous Jessica Alba and Lena Olin, with excellent talent. Everyone would have earned a better story.
