Because some people, like me, want to know everything about a movie, even though they plan to see it, including the end. Anyway, here's the end as I remember it because I couldn't have been more than 8 years old when I first watched it on TV. But I will tell you, it scared the little child I was, and I thought about it later and it still seems to me in my mind, though some of the details are a bit vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I don't remember! I didn't even remember that Barnabus was in this movie and I loved Dark Shadows. So, in the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is lured by the Judge (Joseph Cotton), although I remember being an old family doctor or something instead of a judge, watching how memory fades? ) to the wedding party, which, as I remember, is in a cave? Maybe I'm wrong. and Shelley Winters laughs there, and the judge has a cloak and the camera angle is looking for him, and he throws the robe back and he has goats and he announces that he is actually her father, the devil. , and she's played in the hands of her (the satanic cult), because the "mortal" man she fell in love with (I think it is Robert Foxworth) also seems to be the man who will marry Satan with her after The Demon With Yellow Eyes, and yes, sure enough, they show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes glow yellow. There are many close-ups in the last few minutes of the movie. Everyone laughs and remains, except Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, crying or screaming or something, and that's the end. The bad guys win.
