A Vampire's henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar hooker in this extremely low-budget horror comedy. I can't explain all the positive comments on this movie. I will make it to large-scale hallucination, but it is dissatisfied. The one redeeming factor (and I am very generous here) can be the grandfather who is the only semi-equal character in this whole mess. Don't waste your money or time. In fact, here's a word of advice, if Troma puts it on DVD, but doesn't make it yourself, it's probably slim. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Extra's: Comment with Omar and Kirk; second comment with cast and crew deleted scenes; bloopers; troma interaction; radiation march; Clamp of "Terror Firmer"; Theater Car; Trailers for the "Rowdy Girls", "Teenage Catgirls in Heat", "Channel: The Music" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> My Grade: D
