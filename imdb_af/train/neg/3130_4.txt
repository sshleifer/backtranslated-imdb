I really wanted to arrange this in this movie. I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect Citizen Kane, I took it for the B movie. That said, it still remained short of expectations. The historical aspect of the story is glazed and the end has left me a little cold. The play in the movie was a lot of wood. All in all, I give it 4 a good idea, but the movie was much higher with a little more attention to movies. Is it worth seeing? I didn't want my two hours back, but I don't know I would recommend it to others.
