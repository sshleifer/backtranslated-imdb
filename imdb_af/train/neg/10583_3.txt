I'm sorry to say that, but the acting in this movie is terrible. The dialogue sounds as though they are reading their lines for the first time ever. Maybe I accidentally got the "dress repetition" version. The director uses slow motion during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written, and the battle order is actually better than what I've seen in many action movies. The battles look pretty real. But all this happens while the two leading actors survive miraculously surviving incredible amounts of game-free automatic firearms, grenades, morter rounds and bazookas. The enemy soldiers are definitely one of the worst shots I have ever seen, especially if they have the escaped truck in their attractions of about 30 meters. Each bazooka shot is at least 50 feet wide. That bazookas needs serious site calibration.
