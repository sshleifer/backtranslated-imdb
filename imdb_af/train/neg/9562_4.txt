I think it could have been a decent movie, and some of its parts are OK ... but overall it's a B movie. The same about the plot, parts are OK, but it has several holes and peculiarities that don't really add up. Acting is usually OK, I also experienced worse on this. :) <br /> <br /> The start sets the level, with cars driving in the desert, "cool," but totally unnecessarily jumping through some small dunes (In slow motion! Cool!), like the drivers have never seen sand before ... It gets a little better from there, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you are going to rent it, get one more and use this one as a warm up. Keep the expectations low and it can work for you.
