This movie is horrible! This means "Ishtar" in the number of embarrassingly bad moments. I would have chosen it below 3, except for some funny lines; but in general this movie was shit! They seemed to have made it to a bankruptcy resort over a weekend. Joe Roth must join Elaine May at the straight line!
