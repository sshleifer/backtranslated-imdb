do not look at this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth. http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> The death of Yugoslavia's documentary series (of five episodes) is a meticulously compiled and researched version of the extended bloodshed that ends the old Federal Yugoslavia marked and extended almost the entire first half of the 1990s. This includes a great wealth of news footage and interviews with relevant parties, both "Yugoslavian" and otherwise. The only real improvement that can be made to this great achievement is the inclusion of later developments in the Balkans since the program was made. It was indeed done in the late 1990s for a repetition that appears on BBC television, but adding some even recent events will help complete this wonderfully detailed and complete piece. Maybe another episode might be justified? The very concise title of this documentary document is made more appropriate by the ultimate abandonment of the term "Yugoslavia" by the present Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a very late and formal admission of what has happened previously. /> <br /> not fiction as in "Yugoslavia: The Avoidable War (1999)"
