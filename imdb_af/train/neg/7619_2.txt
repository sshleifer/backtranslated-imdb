As a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan, I can resist any film that can be against me, but there's absolutely no reason for that. <br /> <br /> Rated "Super Action" in the Blockbuster Video section and given the dreaded "Limited View Poster". I assume this is the only method that movie maker (HA!) Robert Napton can use to get at least 4.50 of one unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Robert Napton! Scan for the exploitation of these poor Mexican actors you probably promised to raise it in American cinema. You're a shame! <br /> <br /> There is not one moment in this movie that contains the slightest bit of action. Did you use snot on these people? Oh, look, they have a raven in a field! Like all 6 of them. And isn't it an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always day? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show something .. and more importantly why did we watch the other 1/2? <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50.
