Well first, I would like to add that I am a bit of a historian myself, so what I'm looking for in a movie based on historical events is that it is basically based on historical facts. But this is not the case here. Certainly the film is entertaining and everything but the fact that it is not entirely true facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, even before the First World War he worked for Jews. It was, however, during the world war one and then he formed his views on the Jews. His education in this movie is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not a little disturbed. He had more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that add to the puzzle that Hitler is. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a good actor, but he doesn't really fit into Hitler's role. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he stood here. In his younger years he was a charismatic person who "manipulated" his charm. His unstable behavior and anger eruptions began in the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I want to see a movie about Hitler's life based on real historical facts and not accusations. I really hate if people point out a blame finger, for example Hitler and others, and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as a pure evil. It is much better to actually tell the story exactly as it was so everyone can learn how it was! The one behind this movie had to do research before it was done. Because they don't even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot in the revolutionary march in Munch, his shoulder was torn from his sock. <br /> <br /> It gives you more to see a good documentary than to see it.
