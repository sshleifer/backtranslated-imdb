Since I hate to read long essays and hope to find a point and be disappointed, I will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible. Straight awful. And not surprising for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I could agree with him as he gave the movie the rank it deserved, but was sadly rebuked to read what he said. I'm very shy to take the same side as someone who pointed out that the movie "definitely doesn't have pretty women." Let me be the first to say, "Wow! It was definitely a serious, profound revision there. My mind can hardly understand the philosophical mockery of this movie." Seriously, however, a lack of "beautiful women" should not be considered a necessity for a movie. If you are desperate enough for "beautiful women", you really should look at other types of movies, not necessarily in the sci-fi category.
