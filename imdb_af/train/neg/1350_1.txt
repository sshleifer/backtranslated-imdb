This film deals mainly with the inspector Gadget's archbishop Dr. Claw who has returned to the now-peaceful city of Metropolis after many years. Claw's plan is to feel Gadget once and for all using a new "cooler" crime fighter to destroy Gadget's popularity. Unfortunately, the film failed, the series was wonderful, but it was revived almost 20 years later with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, it is no longer cut; Dr Claw is not only visually less frightening, but sounds more like a cold wrestler than his original intimidating self. Admittedly, this is a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully poor (heaven forbid I call the animation) that it poles compared to the original series. Someone decided to update Penny to get her two decades fast. She now has a few quasi-punk rebellious clothing styles and does not play half the role she did in the TV series. The Gadgetmobile speaks, as well as a plot angle that includes the entire ON talkers. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved the show, but I thought the live-action version was more painful than I could carry, but now we're going to complete this drainage of the quality TV show. It's more than I can take.
