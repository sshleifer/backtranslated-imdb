Final Score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Possible scene-specific spoilers (but who cares for hell) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right: zero. And I seldom give you 1's. Even for the movie of movies I look at things like music, cinematography, imagination, it's humor, even a good fit to be as objective about the score as possible. Look at it within its own genera or subgenera. But here is absolutely nothing. I can't remember again, a movie made me drive me while I was over. The only reason I made it to the end was because I couldn't change the channel - I just rested on it, and watched what evil it would be. It was like a snake consuming a rat. <br /> <br /> But we have a nice little bit and pull this baby apart, we will. First, there is nothing technical about "Whipped" that doesn't work. The footage is all sitcom style. The cuts screen all the right photos of street traffic that go over and over at night. The music and the score not only contribute to the movie - it is stupid. Not to mention, has nothing to contribute. The play is like cardboard as it comes, everywhere and it goes for Amanda Peet (obviously also the "star" who has this train wreck). These guys, supposedly good friends, no longer have chemistry or meaning for purpose as director Peter M. Cohen finished them in a bus station minutes before the shoot. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there is no original bone in his body. It has no imagination. It shows us nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before. The whole assumption, or 'twist' of this movie, is based on male bashing and the idea that an empowered woman can play men just as they are played. Anyone who thinks it's somehow a twist or is in any way original, has of course never turned on a TV. Twisted, flat women are common. Man-bashing is the norm. It doesn't steal from anything specific, it's worse: stealing clich√©s. I cannot imagine a woman making a movie depicting other women based on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt. Let me go rent "In the Company of Men" - or better still, "There is something about Maria". This movie wants to be an "edgier" version of "There's Something About Mary", so bad you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> The movie has no insights into women, men, dating, sex or really anything. Cohen is simply content to eradicate myths that he has inoculated with other sex films. On the other hand, the film does not work as a satire either, because even if it is ripe with exaggeration, one can see it as "satirical". It does not have the basis in the reality that satires need. It doesn't even know what it's satirizing. Then there is the dialogue, which is a bit more than the characters shouting at each other. Example: Character 1: "F ** k you" Character 2: "Oh yeah, good, I visit" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, the thing the other can excuse Discretions: There are many movies without plots, without good acting, with morally repulsive characters and obsession dialogue that is funny and therefore good. "Torn" is not funny. Not for a second. It has no comic skills or timing. The situations are all quite ominous, not grounded in a piece of truth, especially enough to laugh at us. The characters are drawn broadly so that they are related to the lowest of the lowest common denominator SEEM. Just look at the "marquee scene", "cult classic" her gel scene. One of our bumbling anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena (Peet's vibrator). For some reason the light seems to have found the holy grail. Why Cohen thinks people react this way to vibrators I don't know. As he rubs it on himself, he falls into the toilet and tries to fish it with his bare hands when Mena enters into him. Oh my side. <br /> <br /> But strangely, people actually like this movie. Of course, people also like "backup" and reality dating shows, so I shouldn't be surprised. All this, however, has a common thread. "Beaten" is great testimony to me that there is only one big bag of people in America who will laugh at any joke, just because it's about sex. They will like (or think they like) any show or movie just because it's about dating or relationships. It's a lack of any quality, no question of labor on these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to have whitened teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also inoculated to blindly wrap anything related to selling them cheap, empty, effortless TV, movies and any number of products. to shoot. <br /> <br /> The only concern would be that when I die because I saw this movie, I got a credit to get back 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
