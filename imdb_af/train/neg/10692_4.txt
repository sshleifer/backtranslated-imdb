Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered when she left for Italy, tired of Hollywood glamor treatment. First, it suffered the storms of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI, an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress. And now it's EUROPA 51, another boring exercise in soggy sentiment. <br /> <br /> The story also doesn't make much of Alexander KNOX, in a different gratitude than her long-suffering man trying to comfort her after the suicide death of their young son. At least this one has better production values ​​and a more coherent writing than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive here, but moves to a more matronous appearance than a wealthy community woman. She can never handle the sudden loss of her son, despite efforts by a friendly male friend. "Sometimes I think I'm going out of my mind," she tells her husband. A different statement in a movie that is completely without humor or grace, but it gives us a sense of where the story goes. <br /> <br /> Soon, Bergman is motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve her emotional health and from there, the plot is the worst. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the movie is that it's not enough to make a project like a big star like Bergman. The film loses halfway through the story, as Bergman is increasingly upset and her husband suspects that she is entering him twice. The story goes from there after nursing a street walker through her terminal illness. The final thread of plot needed her husband to place her in the spiritual asylum for observation. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers forever (overpaid for the loss of her son), but it's not used. Not one of her best movies to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Trivia note: If she wanted neo-realism with mental illness, she might have fired better to take the lead in the snake pit when offered to her by director Anatole Litvak !! This would have done more for her career than EUROPE 51. <br /> <br /> Summary: Another bitter indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman.
