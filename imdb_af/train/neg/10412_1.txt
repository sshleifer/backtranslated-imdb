This movie is in the MANDINGO & DRUM type. <br /> <br /> They were both terrible, but they are 100% better than these trips. <br /> <br /> Poorly acted and made Oliver Reed is the main name & Eartha Kitt is also in it. It's a pity. Rating is 1/2 * about as low as you can <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> jay harris
