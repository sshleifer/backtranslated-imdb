... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT RENT THIS FILY. If you want a documentary esquire, look at "hood life" you're also in the wrong place. If you're looking for a slick movie, it's a real winner! The play is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive. I can also say that he also did the voice for the 911 operator through the flat tone of his voice. If I hear a cardboard box talking, it probably looks like this man. Oh yes, and the "zombies" did their best snake impression, which is equal to their fantastic acting overall (call sarcasm ... HOW DID IT NOT HAVE AN EASTER FOR BEST NOTE) The Quiroz ...... Don't do any kind of directing. I felt like I had an improvisation period (the period is more like 1990's LA). However, the direction is set apart by the worst writing I ever think of enjoying a movie. I didn't hear such beautiful lines, such as the epic one that starts with the movie "F ** k!", Seeing Ice Grill, which was another "urban" thriller. It works naturally in combination with the epic hip hop soundtrack! All 3 or so songs from it! What did you expect from a movie entitled "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with the full intention of laughing at every scene and son who delivered it and MORE! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to come together with a lot of guys and laugh at the low budget horror (yes right ...) movie for the night. An unforgettable experience for sure!
