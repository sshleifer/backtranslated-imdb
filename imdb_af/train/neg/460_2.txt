I had to watch the movie for my work, so I didn't pay (on the contrary, I paid), but I still found the movie to suck much more than average. The jokes were lame, the two main actresses. Well, to use the "First Women" section of women's ages in Hollywood, they are no longer in their "hot chick" doctrine, but more in their "district attorney" age. What hurts me most about the movie was the main plot line, which pretty much totally plagiarizes "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(in which the boys all jazzed over some men giving them money to "do his wife", and they did not realize it was expected to kill her). All in all, a thin piece of crap.
