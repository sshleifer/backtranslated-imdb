This movie is based on the fact? I hope not! <br /> <br /> We'll see what apparently many armed police are, empty an equal number of guns at 2 guys who have just armored torso. This is a very good idea; Aim for the armor! .. Excuse me, but how about the big fat indescribable heads or their legs to cry out loud. Or were there invisible tanks protecting them? were they from Crypton? Did I miss something here? <br /> <br /> This movie started quite enough, but after 20 minutes of shooting it really took a turn to bore lanes. <br /> <br /> And that documentary style didn't work for me either, but it's just something one finds or not. <br /> <br /> Many amazing things make it difficult to see through to the end. <br /> 3/10 for fine editing.
