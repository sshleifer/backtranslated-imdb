This star-studded British / Spanish co-production looks good, what you can see. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and everyone is terribly cut, so badly that buildings seem to have conversations with each other. Few films suffer so much from pan and scan like this, as director Robert Parrish was so surprised by the widescreen process he tended to use both sides of the screen simultaneously and neglected the device. Another user says we murdered all the inhabitants of a church at the beginning; Not in any of the copies I have. There are a few sudden pieces of farmers firing their guns, one Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau four, and that's it. We never know why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we will never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas), although I suspect he was called to Kojak home, as his departure seems random. And there is a strange flagpole where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) dances in a bowler hat and a bad pack in the big old English music hall tradition to the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here, but with some lyrics I've never heard before. On the plus side, the place is big, a big old ruined fort with Escher-style stairs that don't lead anywhere, a beautiful view of Robert Shaw and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I didn't really like this movie, but I didn't see it exactly. I'll look for the widescreen version and make my decision.
