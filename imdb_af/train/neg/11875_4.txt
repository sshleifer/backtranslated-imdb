Mmm, doesn't a big pile of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and fruit preserves on top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Still '. Still '. Don't eat. Eat it, you !!! Keep it in your throat to kick it until your face turns green with nausea. You just had the Ally McBeal experience. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this show in the winter of 1998 and was immediately addicted. Like that pancake pancake, I gorged myself about it. But the pleasure soon turned away, because the Ally McBeal character (who looks cute and engaging at first sight) will soon be the most annoying, insecure companion you have ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer my female lead to get a backbone.) The gags and stinking of the show are also hacked, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which is really shifted in your face) is timed and the Ceaseless character changes and rewriting make the performance in a damn soap opera. <br /> <br /> My advice to you is to take this show in small doses and stop as soon as it gets tough (and it will). I completely soured it through 2,5 seasons before my enjoyment. It was good while it lasted, but like a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend, it just got ugly after it was welcome. <br /> <br /> And the next time you go to IHOP, the pancakes are over. Order something healthy like the fruit cup. It will be much better for you.
