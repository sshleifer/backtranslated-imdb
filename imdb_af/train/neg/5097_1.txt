Unlike most other commentators, I hate this series a lot. <br /> <br /> It starts out interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes up to the very last episode. At the end, I still didn't understand what the alien attacks were. (Maybe I missed something, who knows?), And realize that I have put 26 episodes consisting mainly of characters' own self-warming, selfishness and self-pity. It actually flips between alien / robot battles and these dark, oppressive shining screens where one or more characters can only say or shout 10-12 times in a row. "I hate me / you / it." /> <br /> I can't really see Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (I also can't see any of the other characters learning or growing for that matter.) I wanted to kick them and tell them they were getting a bloody life during the first episodes, and the feeling didn't change at last. Shinji really has the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charity, and Asuka is such a disturbing know-it-all that I wanted to smash on the TV screen every time. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything and say it often. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of anima and manga, and I've never thought so much about me. I read that the series creator / writer wrote it while suffering from a depression, and I can believe it; it made me depressed to see it. Is this the purpose of this series? I honestly ask. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and irritated? And if you're suffering from a depression, why not write a book or biography on it instead of mixing it with strangers and mechas? This strange war plot, as far as I can tell, leads to absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> Finally, since I'm really fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork of dead-end plots, I can't help but wonder how many of them really find it, and how much say they do because they said it is.
