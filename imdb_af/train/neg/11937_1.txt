Superhero movies always suck, and that's no exception. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the movie could have been even worse. I'll put 'Batman & Robin' and 'Steel' above this movie, so yes it's so bad ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a black superhero, see 'Blankman' that's not a "serious" superhero movie, but at least its entertainment.
