Much has been written about Purple Rain, the seemingly "quin-essential" musician bio-movie, but I'm here to tell you that the movie doesn't deserve its high praise. <br /> <br /> First of all, let's get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels. Even the score is fascinating, and if only shot as a concert movie, it would be a great experience. Unfortunately, this is not and as such, the film is a few problems. <br /> <br /> First, the terrible play / writing, Prince's character "The Kid" is supposed to come down like some kind of mysterious loner of few words. Unfortunately, it does not come out as stockings and badges. A good lonely character should have at least some talking moments. Unfortunately, Prince's character rarely has a few words of dialogue in the movie and it's hard to believe he'll get the girl like that. Everything just looks a little here, which is a shame because you can say it's a terribly clumsy character and lives a very complicated life, but we can never enter it. <br /> <br /> A surprising aspect of this movie is just how much it takes in concert. Prince's and Morris's lives seem to be appearing here. It is advisable to make sense from a business perspective, but it is exhausting to have a 2-hour movie, probably half of it on stage, especially when the character's back story comes. pushed aside. <br /> <br /> To sum it up: It's not a very good movie.
