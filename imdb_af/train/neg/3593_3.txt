It is a German movie of 1974 that has something to do with some women coming to a castle and beyond, I can't really tell you their purpose or even the purpose of the movie. I can tell you that there are several women who are also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip, body paint and curtains to bongos as they were at the Goth Kit Cat Club, and this is a good part of the duration of this movie . Yes, there is something about devil worship and vampires, and there is a girl on girls, etc. But the main focus seems to be the painted babies hiding in the basement. I rather like the eye-roll of one of the most important householders / devil worshipers, who borrowed a authenticity from the proceedings and even made her even more angry. Was it Wanda the Evil Lesbian (as in the credits)? Does not matter. If you are not too picky about your lesbian devil who worships movies, you may like it, otherwise it is pretty boring and I couldn't even finish it. I was so bored. 3 out of 10.
