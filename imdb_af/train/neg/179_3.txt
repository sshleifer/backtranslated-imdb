Back to the cabin at the lake just .... was missing. It had to have a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie had to be filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll have some movie quality shots and simple video camera shots. It makes for a very strange blend! I think they should have found ONE way not to do the home video type effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing if you've seen the original CBTL, because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL ... you'll never want to see it once you see this one! It will probably also look too cheesy and deter you from even caring for the original.
