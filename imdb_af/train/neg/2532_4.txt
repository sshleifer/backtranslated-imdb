The cult of personality has the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman etc. As kings raise the B's. Because the people at Crown International were so important, they were not elevated to the status they deserve. A movie like THE VAN can now look like a disposable Drive-in esoteria, but it was a big hit when it was released (not the subsequent re-issue as a dual feature with other Crown hits). <br /> <br /> The van was a perfect example of Crown's hit strategy to play a role in movie-goers' sphere at the time of the release of a movie. Here it was sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and the short "Custom Of" whim. As others have noticed, it is ironic that the hit song in the movie refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the movie itself. I had a town of Selectman where I was at the time, and even declare that these order guards are "dense on wheels!" A perfect ad for the movie! <br /> <br /> There is the usual range of "good" and "bad" girls, muscle heads and low-brow chickens (including a supporting piece by Danny DeVito). In many ways, it is not much different from the old Strand Party movies of the 60's, but now using Nudity and Drugs. It is clear that this is done on a limited budget and a limited schedule. The film joins a bizarre charm that compensates some, according to today's standards, surely un-PC views of women. <br /> <br /> The classic touch is a toaster for Bobby's pit of sin on wheels. Yes, a Toaster! Hey, you gotta have something nice for those munchies! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
