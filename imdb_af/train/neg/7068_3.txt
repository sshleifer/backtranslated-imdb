Chillers start on a cold, dark stormy night, while a bus drops three passengers outside a bus station, a young boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a college professor dr. Howard Conrow (David Wohl) and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington). Inside, they discovered that they missed their connecting bus and were stranded for the night.

Missing Boyd's writing needed for movies like Chillers to work, you can see the final turn coming down a mile and every story is really lame. The first one is completely useless and does not end and the best thing about these anthologies is the short, funny stories that are rounded off with a neat twist. The second story is predictable, ending only without any payout. So it goes on by Chillers that every story is very unsatisfactory to watch and no reward to do so. The character and dialogue are poorly written, the stories seem like they do not have original ideas of their own and overall the movie sucks completely. At least every story doesn't last long and I like the idea behind the link segments. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd obviously works with a very low budget and it shows. All I can say is if you want to see a 15-card short story that is completely in a pool, and then Chillers is for you. The stories are not clever, anything or any kind of tension or buildup of anything. To say this, it does have some nice screens and sometimes a surprising ability becomes transparent. Violence and intelligence show that there is not much happening in Chillers, a torn heart, a stripped head, and a crouched hand is as greedy as it gets. <br /> <br /> Technically Chillers are bad things that don't impress anyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and lower average production values. Chillers also feature one of the worst closing theme songs ever, period. The acting is also of a very low standard. <br /> <br /> I'm sure there's been a lot of trouble in Chillers as a low-budget movie and at least the filmmakers have tried to give it at least credit, but it still doesn't stop me think it's a crap. Similar anthology films such as Tales From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), Terror's House of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) and Tales From the Darkside: The Movie (1990) are many better than Chillers, so look one of them.
