Within the first 17 minutes of director Bradford May's Darkman III: The Darkman Die, we have already been subjected to a dull repetition and the voice of the first two films, hilarious overtime of the second movie, and slightly edited to like new footage. Look, and a long ad, watch the written and plagued title character about Universal Theme Parks-Universal, the company that has spread this movie. Yes, "Darkman III: The Darkman Die" is pretty handy when it comes to cheap money input on the success of a previous movie. <br /> <br /> This time, the awesome anti-hero Peyton Westlake (aka, "Darkman", depicted by mummy actor Arnold Vosloo) includes horns with an evil crime lord and man Peter Rooker ( played in a brilliant performance by Jeff Fahey) and in the course of the 87 minute film grows to develop a love for Rooker's wife and daughter, and learn to look after someone else. <br /> <br /> Blah. Blah. Blah. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically just a stupid way for the studio to make more money out of Sam Raimi's original movie, which I consider a good action-stress movie. <br /> <br! Oh yes, and there are also a number of silly subplots, including a villain who was supposedly one of the original doctors to save Darkman, followed by his scar, and she seduced our hero to think she was An ally before she reveals her inexorable plot to help Rooker create more super-man-driven thugs like Darkman. Apparently, she can't just do the same procedure on the boefies she did on Darkman. Why? I can't really explain it because the movie is definitely not. <br /> <br /> There is also an assassination about a district newspaper, which is threatening to bring Rooker's organization, and also some other very stupid things. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't really matter. This movie feels like two or three episodes of a television program composed more than a real movie. The direction varies between pretty and straight sloppy (a scene where Darkman drives his train-like vehicle and kills a rocket launcher is just stupid) and editing is a mixed bag. The movie just moves too fast because anyone really needs to care about it. And without spoiling it, the last 15 minutes of this movie, and indeed, the whole series is just a little ... I don't know ... Another 15 minute mixed-bag footage. <br /> <br /> In fact, Commenting on editing, one of my favorite things in this movie, looks at footage that is being reused from previous movies, and then searches for footage in this movie repeatedly repeated. Yes, it's so cheap. It's one thing to do a re-cap at the beginning of the movie, and maybe a shot or two, but in the sheer volume they do it (minutes of footage repeating from previous movies), it's not messy and amateur. <br /> Also, I have to say that Darkman's psychedelic montage freak-outs is a bit exaggerated in this movie. They are so styled and redone that they work, but only in light doses and in good context, as Raimi did in the original film. There are at least four or five here, and they suddenly feel out of place. <br /> <br /> It is said, the movie is not without good points. A few action scenes are well done. The real-life Clich√© story of Darkman works well for a direct-to-DVD feature. The play is fun, especially from Rooker's wife, portrayed by the beautiful Roxann Dawson. Also, while no one composes Danny Elfman, composer Randy Miller, which is great music that breaks down Elfman's original themes. <br /> <br /> But the movie is too fast, cheap and stupid to be taken seriously. Arnold Vosloo looks bored alternatively and exuberantly from stage to stage, and Fahey, while a joy to watch as a crook, doesn't really fit in with the series. <br /> <br /> Like "Darkman II", I would recommend it to fans of the original, who will surely get a laugh. Otherwise, you do not need to apply. A four out of ten.
