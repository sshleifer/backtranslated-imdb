I have to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had a very good story to keep going, but as if it were so bad. First of all, the cast is wrong, where did the crap actor tax and puff dad come from? It looks as if Carlito came out of the canopy and got used to some real idiots. This movie does not make "Carlitos Way" any justice. I'm so glad the sequel "Carlito's Way" came out first. Once I saw this litter, I would never have given the pacino version a chance. And anyway, pacino is supposed to read this story, thought it was a treasure and had the successor instead. Carlito's Way: Standing on Power - 1 out of 10. Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.
