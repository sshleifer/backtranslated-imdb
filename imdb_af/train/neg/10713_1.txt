Come on, let's really get it. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or the Knights Templar as they are more commonly called, do not even exist until the early 12th century. The story is so legible that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looks positively bored. And besides, if you wanted a real Templar, why not just use the Knights of Christ, who still exist in Portugal. At least they should take history into account. The only redeeming quality I could find in this movie was that the artifacts were equal to the medieval or Gothic period. The acting was bad, the storyline was horrible, the action was terrible, and the props were okay.
