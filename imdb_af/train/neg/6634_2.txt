The first look at the front page of this photo looks like a good rock n roll movie. But don't let the front page fool you or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The storyline is just awful, and so is the play. Plain and Simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about a roadie, it's just a thin love story, so terrible that you see through it. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and so I give 2 out of 10. If it wasn't for the music, it would be 0 out of 10. Meat loaf is a horrible actor (at least he was in 1980), and the girl playing the group is not even beautiful! This movie was a great disappointment to me, because it makes very good promises.
