Poorly structured, poorly written, loaded with clich√©s and flat dialogue. Not a single scene shines. The actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises, disputes or conflict. You know about the first ten minutes where it goes. <br /> <br /> For a movie in NY, it has virtually no feel for the city. There are a dozen other indie movies that make it look magical on a small budget. This one looks like it was shot in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you throw Natasha Henstridge, why is she wearing a bag? Why does Vartan look boring and murdered? Where is the attraction? I felt that I had seen a sub-par Christian movie of the week, it was so unhealthy and moralizing. <br /> <br /> Steven Feder's great success is that he has convinced people to make this mere movie.
