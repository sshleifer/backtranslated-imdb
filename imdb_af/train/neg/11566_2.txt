Maybe I couldn't find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. Obviously the default is off. When the end credits started rolling, I couldn't believe it was. Like our poor but beautiful protagonist, I felt, dirty, cheap .... <br /> <br /> The characters were drawn in very broad lines and the author's contempt for rich Thatcherites was all too clear. I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat" but would appreciate a little more subtly. <br /> <br /> Of course the problem can be with me. I see that many others find meaning or message in this picture. Oh, not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me from giving it a "1" was the beautiful landscape, man and plant.
