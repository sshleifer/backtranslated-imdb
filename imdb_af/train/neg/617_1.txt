First, let me start with a quote that a friend of mine said while watching this movie: "This whole movie should have been. You know, like:" DEATH, I BET YOU CAN'T NEVER MAKE THE WORST MOVIES NOT "". With this movie, they made a good effort to get that title. The consequences are of course poor. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of bits stolen from every B horror movie ever made. The actors I accept are supposed to be in college. However, parts of it (especially at the beginning) seem to be supposed to be in the upper or middle school. It does not make sense. The scarecrow walking around to kill people is not the least enjoyable. (SPOILER: In the end, when they sing Lester's name and he appears again, the black man and the scarecrow are both laughing, probably out of relief, they were at their last scene and at the cheesy dialogue.)
