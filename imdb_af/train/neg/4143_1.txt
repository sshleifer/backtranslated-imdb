As my other half and I are big fans, we can't resist coming out of a movie that contains both the sizes we were excited about! But for a 2004 movie with a back cover of Freddy Vs Jason, it's a shame! The worst movie I've ever seen, but worth laughing, if you can put it through! <br /> <br /> The acting is terribly the effects ... Well, I can do better on my camcorder It's so bad they just bothered to face the zombies faces and out of the neck, hands etc. . No story line, strange flashbacks that make no sense and terrible writing! <br /> <br /> "You broke my tooth!" of one vampire "you broke my cigar" was the answer of man who looked like Uncle Jessie from Dukes, crossed with Santa!
