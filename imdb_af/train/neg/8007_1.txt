I really didn't expect this kind of movie outside of America. How someone can take the subject of sexually abusive children and make it into a "thriller" is just sick. Auteuil (which I had previously admired) as a kind of child-saving Rambo, was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited in the world. <br /> <br /> What is depressed, though, is that the beautiful and thorough-breaking movie "Happiness" came out this year before this movie. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It's great to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there. They could see the cowardly and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think it is a big movie with a disgusting amount of ignorance, and you have to look "Happiness" to open your mind to the true horrors of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold in sexual slavery or being molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even family member? Hmm ... I wonder. If they are going to make a film about international childbirth of whatever nature, it is up to everyone to make it realistic and emotional, rather than this button-pressing crap. 10/01
