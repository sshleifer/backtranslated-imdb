One of Frances Farmer's earliest movies; at 22 she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in good voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably wonderful in time, is really corny today. Roy Rogers also appears in a singing role. In my opinion, it's just worth checking out if you're a Frances Farmer fan, and possibly a Bing Crosby fan.
