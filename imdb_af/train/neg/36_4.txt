This movie looks too long, even in just 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror movies is that there are always too many footage of people (through the jungle, on a rocky cliff, near a river or more) to run the running time. The movie is worth seeing for the ridiculous and naked indigenous zombie with big, bending bloody eyes that are always accompanied by the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be greatly entertained by the bad English dubbing, free female flesh and very dull makeup working on the monster and native extras. For a zombie / cannibal movie it was pretty light, but then I probably didn't see an unencrypted version.
