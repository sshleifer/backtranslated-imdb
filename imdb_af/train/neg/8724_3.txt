OK - The Disadvantages: The compulsory '70's ​​alligator' (all right, correction caiman) with non-moving limbs is made the worst for scale miniature underwater shots (with the full length of reptile compared to the size of the boat) ) using a toy alligator To turn the toy boat into largely lit water - even for night shots! <br /> <br /> Contrary to most primitive-lethal exploding Western films, superstitious natives are taken **** and holidaymakers are killed. unfair this time. No one has really abused the natives - exploited, yes, but far from abusive treatment. It was one of the natives (with a spoiled supermodel at a full moon taboo) who brought the curse of the River Demon on them, right? <br /> <br /> The holidaymakers are easily annoying (with the notable exception of the sign old soul / light blasphemy-little-girl-who-take-the-heroes you often see in the 70's Euroflicks), but far of the deserving violent death - unless it was your next through neighbors, think of you. A couple actually killed is heroic - notable because none of them fulfill the role of sidekick. There are only two straight villains in the whole movie, so the deviations feel more arbitrary than catheters. <br /> <br /> The order in which the giant kajan crashes and thirty tourists cut off in less than five minutes will probably make you unintentional. hilarious. <br /> <br /> The point at which the native decides not to wipe out the surviving Westerners and virtually say, "Hi, you're not that bad, sorry about the hassle tonight" because they inflated the monster lizard - Shake your head while the chick music kicks. You know, the local military dictatorship will erase the town to destroy the tourism industry after the credit roll. <br /> <br /> The Benefits: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You all know why YOU are interested in this movie in the first place, right? I thought so. If you're a Bach finalist, you'll get the DVD reissued by NoShame movies earlier this year (digitally remastered with no real extras to talk about, except the director emphasizing the current international film distribution). <br /> <br /> The hero is not half-bad, far from an idiot (always a plus in B-movies) and the cynical little child offers most of the comic relief. <br /> <br /> Look, but get it cheap!
