This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no storyline, the gags are just for delays and there is absolutely nothing else that will make this movie worth watching. In the whole movie Fredi (oh my god who's a funny name ha ha) he doesn't even ask him how he came from a plane to the middle earth. There are many stupid and completely unfunny characters whose names should sound funny. eg: Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I didn't even laugh at the movie once. The gags look like they're made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's dress is trapped in the door (this happens about 5 times), then this movie may be for you. Another funny scene: They are trying to guess the code word for a closed (don't ask why - never ask "why" in this movie) and the codeword is (ha ha): miss. So if you laugh at these examples, you might like this movie. For everyone else: Go to Youtube and see "Here of the Weed": it's much, much nicer.
