Man would expect a movie to be shot with about. 300,000,000 U $ D budget should at least entertain you for the time you spend in the cinema it is actively watching. "Matrix Reloaded" proves this assumption wrong. <br /> <br /> "The Matrix" worked better despite the fact that there are clear holes in the logic of the story. At least no one can explain why a bot (aka agent) within a simulation (aka martix) has compromised the responsible computer program in any way. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers have made this "agent-bashing" the most important thing in "Matrix Reloaded": it's a beat'em up o-rama. These battle scenes can be in a 5 sec. Enough (or even cool). trailer, but extended for a few minutes, apparently decayed, choreographed poorly and repeated and again it was nothing more than boring. Despite the promised spectacular stunts there is nothing more than simple low quality, relentless bashing already (or better) in eg. Seen. Van Damme 'movies'. The difference of post-production (etherything is 5 times faster, the camera drives a lot and freezes on some scenes, and it is repeated for at least 5 minutes) doesn't help here, everything has nothing to do with the very meaning of " martial arts ". Besides these 'battles', all actors refuse to do what they are paid for: acting. <br /> <br /> What's next to the fighting? Little except Hollywood routine. These o-so-multicultural many hippies sucked into "Waterworld" are reclaimed as a resident of "Zion" (the last city on earth), and in the order of Morpheus they start dancing because it is good opportunity to show a lot of hardly covered tits and stumps. The oh-so-popular clich√© of the frog, as well as Frenchmen who talk to this "du ne sais quoi" silly accent, wasting his fortune, is a good thing. Following this (and unwanted funny), the battle between Neo and the sinister followers of 'the frog', as it takes place in an Erroy Flynn like an entertainer, congratulates with a bunch of mid-breed embellishments. As Neo positions with the barbarians, add only 2 stairs and many statues (for destruction, thrown over evil guys and the like) and you get 5 more senseless, boring little. of this litter. <br /> <br /> What to expect? The ordinary merchandising hell. And "revolutions" what will happen or not - definitely without me.
