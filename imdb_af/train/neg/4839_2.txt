... and gets bigger than ever before. I won't make any direct references or anything here, but to say the least, this movie is pathetic. If you're military trained, don't worry. I put it on the DVD with 2 friends who want to watch a somewhat interesting action / war flag. Why couldn't I even read the reviews? <br /> <br /> Already in the first "bomb" scene, the movie has huge glitches, and they are still bigger and bigger. My 2 friends, who were not attached to the military, somehow noticed some of the filmmaker's mistakes, almost as fast as I did and asked me if some of the things were going on , we are realistic. Well, as you might guess, they're not at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you can overlook this totally idiotic and repeated mistake. 2/10 to catch my interest first.
