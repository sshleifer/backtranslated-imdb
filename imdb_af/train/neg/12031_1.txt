First, this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself, you can barely laugh. Second, the movie is slow and dull. The acting is not bad, but not special. There is a Lucky Luke comedy about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) that fight each other in a small town ... you'll laugh much more if you read it, instead of having your time with waste this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this film does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a similar subject '' The home teachers ''; It had some good moments. My last comment is: don't waste your time and money watching this uninspired and boring movie.
