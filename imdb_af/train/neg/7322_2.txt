I will give credit where credit is due and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard-drinking actress who does what she wants. She is brash, sassy, ​​hard-edged, and very sexy; she is much better than this movie deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's IT. This dull suspense film is a fragmented mess, which immediately tries to be a stalker thriller, a murderer, a story of loyalty and betrayal, and a steaming erotic thriller. The movie, my friends, is not exciting. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought that C. Thomas Howell would be a desirable man? He's not ugly, but to cry out loud, it seems as if Fiorentino's tough-cookie goddess is doing this with a nursery school teacher. Howell does not have the authority or screen presence to fulfill the leading role. <br /> <br /> The writing is by far the worst aspect of the movie. There is no tension, as Fiorentino's character becomes ominous calls, there is no secrecy about her guilt in the murder which is the focus of the film. There is no sense of liberation, as Fiorentino Wimpy Howell loses to lose his inhibitions. <br /> <br /> Look for interesting but poorly done cameos by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and one really, very good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. In addition, my first impetus would be to lay this pity and rent something else.
