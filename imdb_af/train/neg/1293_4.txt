I'm probably one of the few viewers who wouldn't recommend this movie. Thought visually stunning like all the work of Ang Lee (every frame seems to be worthy of pressure). I was really disappointed at the incredible pace of the movie. It was really too long. <br /> <br /> The story is in the Civil War era Missouri and is about a young man (Roedel) who joins the desert forces of the Bushwackers, sort of apostate confederate sympathizers who feed geurilla. type fighting with Jayhawkers, their Union counterparts. He and his good friend, Jack Bull Chiles, played by Skeet Ulrich, joined the group after Chile's father was shot dead and his home burned, presumably by Jayhawkers. The story follows Roedel and Chile's adventurous adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war, including the former slave fighting for the Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright) and a warrior widowed by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seems that every time the movie has developed the story at an interesting point, it will change to another subplot and leave things undeveloped. For example, the agitation under Roedel's group caused by former slave Holt who participated in the confederate case is briefly shown by some conflict over propriety and protocol and then dropped into the movie until later. A young willing / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and fears a lot of anxiety and violence, but we never know why. Some characters never seem to surface; I think it's because the movie includes too many of them, as well as taking large amounts of history. <br /> <br /> The historical detail was excellent. I loved looking after the housing, furniture, clothes, etc. To look, and I thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of renewing the characters, even though they stumbled a little with the dialogue. Unless you really enjoy history or a huge Ang Lee fan, you have to succeed one.
