It's definitely one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini. About the only one bizarre is his SATYRICON. It is a two and a half hour skirt through a strange nightmare world of decadence, abundance and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes a peculiarly unattractive Casanova and the strange performances in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail to involve the viewer. The artistic and costume design, however, is outstanding. The Academy did not even want to nominate the former, but itself had the privilege of rewarding an OSCAR for the latter. Also nominated (strangely) was the diverse, useless and almost unacceptable script. Go figure !! The video on video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes short of the original time. This viewer was grateful.
