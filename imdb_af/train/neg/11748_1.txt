This movie should be one of the worst I've ever seen, make it on DVD !!! The story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers who would cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that I caution many parents. But the story line is like a loose cannon. If there was such a thing as a ride through the movie maker, it would have created one. It reminded me of very fast films that broke out in the 1960s, with the poor writing and filming. <br /> <br /> The only wise characters in the whole movie were the bartender and beaver. The rest of the film can easily be made by middle school children. I give this movie a score of 1 because it's really awful and left my whole family with a sense of deception. My advice - don't see it !!!
