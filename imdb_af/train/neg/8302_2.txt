Funny how a studio thinks it could be a sequel to what a classic Christmas story was with a completely new role and expect it to float. Certainly, they used several actors for Batman, but in that case Batman was a classic character before any of the actors printed his cape. In this case, you had a classic character in the blonde head horn glasses that Ralphy wore that wanted a red red bb gun for Christmas. Somehow we have to forget him and accept another boy who doesn't match the original. If I didn't know it was a sequel, I wouldn't have thrown it out ... except Charles Grodin tried to imitate Darrin McGavin so hard that you were constantly reminded that the original was much better ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it might work if they threw the movie better. They had to have looked at a similar or simply ignored the original and did not try to copy his appearance. This one is just a cheap imitation. The Ralphy does not call for sympathy for not only a desire to look like his character is sticking out or dying.
