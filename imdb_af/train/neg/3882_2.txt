Why am I always doing this to myself? I mean, it's really there in the title - "The Incredible Melting Man". What else would I expect? I have to admit, I'm struggling for just about everything I get on the Monster HD channel, but the only redeeming feature of this photo is the real grand makeup work by legendary Rick Baker. As if it was creepy, I would give that old old couple struggling with sour lemons just before the lights. Now they were really scary. <br /> <br /> Something I could never find out in horror flicks was why a monster's victims would not just run away when faced with virtual extinction. Like the chick in the cabin. You know, there was a door completely visible in the kitchen that she could walk at any time. Incredible Steve-O couldn't grind much more than a quick walk, so why didn't he just blow right? I don't know, maybe I miss something. <br /> <br /> This movie had a feel of a 'Tales From The Crypt' episode, but 'Tales' usually had a cool or grotesque twist that often didn't stop you from seeing. It was a picture you couldn't really handle when you come or go. For example, in an early scene, you can tell that Smeltman's eyeball fell from his head, how did he get the rest of the story? I think we're not supposed to ask. <br /> <br /> At twenty-four minutes, this photo was about half an hour long. When it was over, I was ready to take General Perry over his earlier proposal: "I can really use a drink now."
