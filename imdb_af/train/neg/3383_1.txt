I first saw the live music game at the Denver Center For The Performing Arts and it was absolutely sensible, fantastic and had such a fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I liked much about most musicals I saw on stage has. The interesting thing is that you should never see Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was strong and led toward the whole production. I heard they made a movie out of it. I waited for the breath, but when I watched the movie version, I was so disappointed I felt I was cheating. The movie does not have the fascinating mood in lively production and it never leaves you in close contact with every character. Personally, I want to see the live version again and if ever to be revived, I would heartily recommend that you go out of your way to see it. This will be one of the most memorable experiences you'll enjoy.
