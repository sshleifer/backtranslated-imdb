If you are planning to watch this movie, please review. I don't usually comment on something I've seen on television, but this one was such a waste of my life that I had to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. Criticism of this movie will be far too long, because there are so many things wrong with it. I'll just say, please never see this movie. It was a total waste of my time and it would be a waste of yours. Anyone who has written a positive review of this movie is one of two things; totally incompetent, or working for the company that made it. Again, I guarantee you will regret seeing this movie!
