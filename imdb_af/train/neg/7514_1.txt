A low budget effort by Texas that was at least filmed, but this is little comfort. Bad acting, or should I say, bad overworking, a nice, slap story line that is nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Looks like a lot of young people put together a haunted house for Halloween, which is done every year, but this year things are different. Has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills the empty spots, many of which are. Putrid, puerile, certainly avoidable, at all costs.
