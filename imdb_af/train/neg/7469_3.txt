The writing for this TV soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins had to play as an undergraduate drama student at some stage, so he could bring some life into his essay character. I don't know if it was the director's goal, but Hopkins' Ciano did nothing but vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. The real Ciano was possibly everything, but then why did a movie make him? Mussolini was a little more convincing, and his long road was closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was plain ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the impotent writing), while being the central character of this alleged family drama. Just watch it if you enjoy a Venezuelan soap opera.
