I'm a big Michael Madsen fan, so needless to say, I bought this movie without even renting it. This movie was so terrible, I didn't even take it back to the store, I don't want anyone. Otherwise, to be subjected to this human poison, I just threw it in the trash, never thought of the money, it was worth throwing it. The acting wasn't that bad, it wasn't good or anything. The story was terrible, and the end was something I despised. He was a broken man, alcoholic. his life was a lot of junk. I thought his horse, peanuts, was a terrible device to show his childhood innocence. A dog would have been much better. I also hate religion, so this end no doubt made me angry. Jesus heals everything ... I hate knowing people like this, who are great Christians and Catholics, and will show time that God doesn't heal everything. It was a horrible movie, if you have the option to see it, pass it or buy it better, or rent it, throw it in the garbage and leave the coffee grounds there in the morning
