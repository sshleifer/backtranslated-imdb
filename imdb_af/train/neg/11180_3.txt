The only good thing about "People I Know" is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that Al Pacino should avoid. The first big switch I had was the way Pacino tried to portray a Georgia accent. Sometimes it was poor and unattractive, while it was too exaggerated in other segments. Dialogue and character interaction was terrible with a poor plot. The supporting role-player has done an extremely perfect job in keeping the movie interesting, and within an hour I still haven't seen any signs of a solid plot. The story in general is a real drill, and I had to face me several times to wake me up. <br /> <br /> This movie will surely spoil you ... at all costs.
