Ultimately too stupid and useless. Yes, there is the gilded loft metaphor, but most children will probably miss it. Forget week. Immediately. <br /> <br /> Animation is, as we expected, superreal. The plot line can best be described as thin but tough. Although the end was random to me. <br /> <br /> The sewage underworld is an appropriate disgusting reflection of the world above and somehow it also seems that wealth and money are there. Oh, and there is a romantic interest in the female who is the smarter, more skilled and go-getting of the couple. It in itself quickly becomes a tiring (anti) stereotype. Probably your children will love it already.
