I'm a big Ziyi Zhang fan and going to a movie to see her what took me to Purple Butterfly. Just as much as I wanted this movie, I have to agree with many others who commented on it. It is very confusing and also very slow. Because all the film was shot with a hand-held camera, important parts are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The movie has very little dialogue and what's in it doesn't tell you much. There are endless scenes of people just standing to smoke cigarettes or sitting in a room talking to each other without talking. The way the movie time moves is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Although I have already read a number of reviews and had a general idea about the movie, I still have a hard time understanding what is going on. <br /> <br /> I knew beforehand that the film was not remotely similar to previous Ziyi Zhang movies, but looking forward to seeing her in something else, unfortunately I was finally disappointed. She never smiled in this movie, though she had nothing to smile most of the time. I could have done without the sex scene because they were so sexless and without any clear feelings between the participants as you could hope.
