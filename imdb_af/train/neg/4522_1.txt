The most misogynistic film of all time? Not to mention '68, shouldn't they be more than white people in brown face past the "Indians"? However, my favorite parts should be when the girls giggle and blush as the cyclists drag them to rape them. Rape is fun! What did you know? Let's see, then there are the blatant rip-offs of "The Hustler" (thick bass character actually plays pool while destroying the Indians with the main belly dude), the horrible acting, the so-on-the-nose them Maybe-as-well-just-tell-you-to-think music styles, the lack of someone who is actually Indian in this movie. And for whom should we root? I have to say that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Although his movies tend to champion strong women, I have heard from at least one source that he is a misogynistic idiot in real life. Why did I watch it, you ask? Don't ask.
