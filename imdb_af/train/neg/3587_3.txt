How can they track Joe Don Baker (like Bufford Pusser in the first) to Bo Svenson (as Bufford Pusser in the second successor). Why did they do it? Just because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser, they still need to change this because the first successor it was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and that one of the things I wanted to see in the second successor. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie a 7 out of 10 and I would have given it a 1 out of 10 if the story had nothing to do with Bufford Pusser's life, but it has and therefore has I gave this movie a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that someone who plans to watch this cheese, and not look at the first successor instead.
