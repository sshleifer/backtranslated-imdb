I caught it at a screen. All I can say is: What ... the ... hell? This movie plays as smoothly as Mickey Mouse reads the script for "Scarface". It is bizarre than making the slightest sense; And even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is so bizarre that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin to "rescue" a crocodile containing a CIA probe. The CIA comes to Irwin to get their sins back, Irwin makes them poachers and sets them up to stop them. <br /> <br /> It's all about the story out there; The rest is the overall lampoon of Australian culture ("Didja sea that?" And "Crikey!") And peculiar choreographic action series. At one point, Irwin holds a speed-free RV and knife fight with a CIA agent on top. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin knife is fighting a man on top of a RV. Let it be your guide for this ridiculous movie.
