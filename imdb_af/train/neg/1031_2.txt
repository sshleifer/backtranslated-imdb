This movie is one long chiche after another. First, though they did their part, there is an unjustified dull scene where John feels like an idiot. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old Beatle cartoons. John is the nasty, jealous, closet of homosexual, slave to Yoko, portrayed as in the discredited Albert Goldman book. They even hold a song in a regular conversation, "it was always just the two of us"! John would not have been to his supporters like this either. As his death showed us, he was too much fun. The one funny scene is where a stupid Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's yesterday. An offended John says something like this: "Sure and while I crown, why don't you get on your knees, put your wife's wig and lick my body?" It made my days laugh. Really this movie is funny in how serious it is while being ridiculous. John and Paul were not pontificating the whole day, they were funny light guys who even broke down during The Beatles, where much more personal than the ones shown here. Forget about it.
