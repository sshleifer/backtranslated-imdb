There is a good movie here, but it is not. The basic idea is good: to investigate the moral issues facing a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so astounded that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid about catching the mysterious air contamination that has almost wiped out all of humanity. Yet they sometimes wear surgical masks, not others. Sometimes they are fanatic to remove any bleach affected by an infected person with bleach. At other times they seem completely unaware. <br /> <br /> Worse, after allegedly surviving a few weeks or months in this new dead-or-killed world, these people constantly behave like the latest. They do not bother the accumulation of proper equipment or food. They are in the middle of nowhere out of fuel. They do not take elementary precautions when strangers are met. And after they waved the rotting bodies of all mankind, they were as rude as sheltered debutants. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived so long ... and even if they did, why someone wanted to make a movie about them. <br /> <br /> So when these drugs stop talking about the moral dimensions of their actions, it's impossible to take their soul-searching seriously. Their actions must first make some sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, we must argue with Chris Pine's dubious acting abilities. His portrayal of an arrogant young James T Kirk seemed to be seen in isolation. But in carriers he plays on exactly the same note: arrogant and curved. It is impossible not to suspect that it constitutes its entire dramatic range. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the movie looks excellent. It has a sharp, saturated appearance that really suits the southwestern American region. But it can't save the real bad print or the paper thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you are a fan of the end-of-the-world genre, you have to worry about carriers.
