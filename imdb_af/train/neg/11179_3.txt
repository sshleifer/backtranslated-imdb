As we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. A record hack to the dirty end of what was once a leading and idealistic career. Pacino plays his role and looks like an uncovered bed and all attacks with a completely transverse and inconsistent southern accent. <br /> <br /> The plot flushes this way and it ends with so many loose ends and inconsistencies that roll the mind (and then retract). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is there and doesn't do much. Her plays with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. Hard to believe, they meant a lot to each other. There is no energy there. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Tee Leone illuminated the screen. She was electricity and her plays with Pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie, but not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
