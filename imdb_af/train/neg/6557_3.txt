Really, they spelled it BRAIN in the credits, not BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they didn't have the budget for a spell checker. All the production money went for big old cars. There are at least two Packards visible here. One is a Darin Convertible. A nice yellow Packard convertible. <br /> <br /> The plays of the film studio show that money has been spent on costumes and decorations. Old cameras, an outside of Ciro's, street signs and everything needed to make a visually pleasing picture were there. Poorly written and directed. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it's about 104 minutes, about. It was over 85 minutes. It came to an end without making a conclusion. There was a clash but no conclusion. The movie only acted against the credits. 99 cents for this. I paid 99 cents for this. I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat's face because he got more excitement. <br /> <br /> For a few seconds in the Ciro's scene after Darren McGavin received a call, it looked as though it might be. .. this movie would have a surprise turn that would make for an interesting movie. Then it just sat there. <br /> <br /> The young Latin actor, played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya), could have had a much greater role in everything that goes on here. This role made a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think if they cut Brian's part and use Steven Bauer in his place and change the writing and keep the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sound. band, then they have something. <br /> <br /> Here Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
