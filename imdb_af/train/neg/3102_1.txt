No matter how you look at this movie, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> If you consider it an abomination, it's an unsuitable movie with monsters puppets. <br /> <br /> If you consider it a comedy, you will see most of the humor become flat and just paralyzed. <br /> <br /> If it's a romance, you'll wonder why a man would stay with such a B. ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you see it as an action, you can't really get the bad hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see, it just doesn't entertain anything at all. As mentioned, the samples are clear dolls and this film was yet another attempt to make a Gremlins type film. However, it has the worst searching samples of that genre. Kritters look pretty good, so the Ghoulies, even the dolls from the Munchies, looked better than that. The characters in this movie are unnecessarily unlikely. The hero is a crazy security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp who has a push military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. At one point in the film, the hero and the military man fight with harkies. This movie is just stupid. I love the scene when they are in the dreaded club scene (which is of course not a club, but probably a dinner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 and I look younger than any of them.
