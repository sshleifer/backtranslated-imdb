My husband rented it from a video store and thought it was tense. (He never reads the synopsis). <br /> <br /> Well, it'll be funny if the thing is watched. It is simply not. The same thing over and over, no plot, and WHERE did they find the leading man? The leading man, Michael Des Barres, is not even feasible, especially for this role he is given. Also, sexual harassment at work is something, if you want to see, hire Michael Crichton's "Disclosure". In the early 90's, Michael Douglas at least performed well. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who is usually viewable, plays an embarrassment here. There are also lighting effects cheaper than your home camera. Don't even waste time renting it. 0/10.
