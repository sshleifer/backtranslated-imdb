I don't think I've ever come across the sheer absurdity of a movie, because I was out of this piece. Nothing in it makes sense. nothing of it is clever or well thought out. For lack of really exciting moments, they repeatedly use the total exchange trick where you build the music before the character does something like opening a door or setting aside a curtain and then there's nothing there. It's once, maybe, but I counted three times. things were thrown in without apparent reason, characters, half-shaped story lines .... the characters were not well developed at all. the end was .. bad. Bad, bad, bad, everything, every component, of this movie is terrible. and I'm just here to warn you about it.
