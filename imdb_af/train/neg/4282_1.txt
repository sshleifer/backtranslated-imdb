I can't understand why all these relics of the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. One can clearly see how frustrated they were during the commership, which they forfeited so many things in their movies, and they now suggest that it does not fill so much fear of artificial freedom with people who are defecating, urinating, vomiting curse, and any other kind of concealment imaginable. THIS IS NOT SINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEAR! It is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, about David Lynch, about Forman and neo-realism and other filmmakers who could work with an aesthetics of ugliness. THESE people were mastering their jobs - well, don't! Do us a favor, everything you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other outdated old timers, and leave us alone! It's a little time to watch Romanian movies on the screen, enough with your immature terribilism! You are not directors, you are illegal !!!
