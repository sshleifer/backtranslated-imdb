It must first be said that I have read the MANGA and therefore my argument is based on the differences. <br /> <br /> This anime has disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and OVA. What left it was just a sign of what it might have been. Many of the characters lack the depth seen in the manga. Alucard is not the sympathetic character that secretly desires for death. Walter's story is missing the betrayal. And the Nazi villains who are planning to devour the world in war are completely absent. Instead, the anime offers the Gary Stu villain Incognito to be defeated at what seems likely. <br /> <br /> My primary complaint is not that the anime differs from the manga, but it does such a bad job.
