This film is about a male escort engaging in a murder investigation that took place in the circle of mighty men's wives. <br /> <br /> I thought "The Walker" would be exciting and engaging, but I was so wrong. The pacing is painful and unbearably slow, that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour can be condensed in ten minutes. That's how slow it is. <br /> <br /> The fact that it has no excitement or action scenes aggravates boredom. It's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so simple and without emotion. Maybe it's because of the tight upper lip of the higher social class? <br /> <br /> It's sad that "The Walker" gets such a boring mess, despite such a strong role. Shatter it on the poor plot and even worse pacing.
