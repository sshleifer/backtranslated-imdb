OK, simple and simple, if you're a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD), stay away from LEGEND. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt the most disappointing TR game. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is completely unplayable and I gave up. I feel that I have been robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a computer game for anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games, the controls were standard. In AOD they were 'tough', but still the same general controls. In Legend, they have completely changed her movement and control measures and she is completely uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> I saw other people's comments saying, "Use the mouse." No, why should I? Others say "Use a game pad". No, why should I? Others say, "But this is the standard for the 3rd person's control for years. Well, I don't care, it's not the standard for any other TR game, so why are you wasting it. Oh, I know, because they can't care less about their original, loyal fan base, they want to cash in on the new kids who didn't even hear of the series until the movies came out and made a lot more money. Br /> My advice to any serious TR fan, stay away from this game, and if you buy it, complain it to Eidos, I have seen many other posts, especially on the Eidos forums, from people telling them how dirty that is, maybe they will listen.
