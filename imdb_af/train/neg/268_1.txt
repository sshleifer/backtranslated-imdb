1 How is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices such as universal translators or translator microbes? Did the creators of this show realize that people from different parts of the earth were in different time frames (Attilla the Hun was not a contemporary of preliterate Hellenic cultures, nor were the Vikings present to the Pyramid builders ) Speak different languages ​​and can never develop a language similar to contemporary English (except for the gang they do not use), influenced by Latin, Old Greek, Danish and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences cannot be overcome so easily, confidence must be won, but wherever the team arrives, they are welcomed without any suspicion and begin to order people as they are their appointed leaders. Of course, true followers will say they are considered gods. The people they meet must be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like. <br /> <br /> 3 Historical background: none. Visually it can remind you vaguely of the Greek or Viking culture, but each can dress a lot of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to watch the part. A theatrical theater group probably has better props. <br /> <br /> 4 Drilling! Another lame Canuck production, which has been inexplicably running for ten years. As a children's show, it can be awarded the degree, but anyone who has some knowledge of human behavior and language cannot see the first twelve episodes of season 1, as I have just done. I really wanted to believe that I found a decent sci-fi show, otherwise I would have shut the computer off this refuge after the first five minutes!
