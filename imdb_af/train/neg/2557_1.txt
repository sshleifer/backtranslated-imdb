I actually like Asylum movies. I made it a habit to see as much as possible. Even the rip-offs they did were cool as OVERVIEW AND WHEN A KILLER CALLS. This is not lame. I can't believe the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE also made this movie !!! It's not even bad, like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which is pretty bad at the time). This is NOT BAD! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive bad acting or special effects in an Asylum movie, but this movie takes him too seriously. I really hope that FAST ON A TRAIN is better. Now it's a movie I can't wait to see.
