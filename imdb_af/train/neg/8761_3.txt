My friend has the habit of going to Blockbuster and to choose movies, no one has ever heard anything. Of course, it sometimes led to some fun discoveries. Often the best that can be said is they are definitely an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> She brought home Advice From A Caterpillar. She was excited because the box said it was funny. Fortunately for us, the propaganda on the boxes never lies. <br /> <br /> This movie was an exercise in patience. It is one of those movies where, unless you are a pretentious and level person watching your movie about movies, you will hate every character in the movie. Until the launch of the one nice character. What the main annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that it will drive someone away in the real world. <br /> <br /> MILD SPOILERS FROM HERE <br /> <br /> Such a bunch of emotionally vapid, stuffy, pretentious artists curse love and find success in their careers. Then they meet a beautiful, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (an almost perfect guy). We then look at the woman, the annoying advocate artist (in her 30's?), Being provoked as she falls in love. So she tries to flee from the beautiful, intelligent, emotional mature man and stay with the married man she has big but empty sex. She is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away. In the real world she would have been quite successful. I certainly wanted to flee from her and I was not even in a relationship with her! <br /> <br /> Although it's nice that the man fought for his love, I never wanted her. (Not even my girlfriend) She didn't deserve him. And why do I wonder, did the director think that the "almost perfect guy" had to be punished with a relationship with her? When the artist asked the "almost perfect man" to go, we shouted that he also had to leave. There is a problem with a movie when the heroine of the movie is so annoying, childish and stupid that you will fail her will. <br /> <br /> In addition, let me say that Andy Dick laughed me a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance. As for the other characters, they were well behaved, morally bankrupt and annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and I can say I've laughed a few times in the movie. Unfortunately, not many believers have happened to the last 10 minutes or so. But by the time I had that laugh, I asked for the movie to end too long. I had to get these vapid characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see people, you hate fighting with a love for people they don't deserve, then it's the movie for you.
