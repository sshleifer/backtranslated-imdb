Dolph Lundgren stars as a former police spokesperson investigating Boston's kinky scene, to find out who killed his brother, who thought well in the community, but how he learned how his brother kinky had sex and that a serial killer is to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good at this movie, and because of his performance here, Lundgren's actions on role players would raise. It said the material gives Lundgren nothing to work with. Indeed, Lundgren has been completely left out to dry in a brave thriller that is both predictable and incomprehensible. The co-star Danielle Brett is also good. The film works best if it focuses on Lundgren and Brett's chemistry. Indeed, the film took the time to explore their relationship. The movie would be pretty decent. However, the movie is slim, the action doesn't exist, the plot didn't give enough exploration. (Too much boring BS around Lundgren's investigation into his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily greedy and ridiculous. Again, Lundgren is really really good (Like newcomer Danielle Brett), but the movie just ranges from one order to the next, making this movie especially disappointing. If there is anything else, it shows how Lundgren is underestimated as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Off 4- (Poor)
