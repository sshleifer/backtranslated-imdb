I don't just see how a Concorde New Horizons movie directed by Jim Wynorski and the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad. It just makes the mind angry or not? <br /> <br /> Come on, let's not make a mistake about it. "Munchie Strikes Back" is indeed a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet that has been around for centuries. For reasons not fully explained at the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The mother's problem (at least her main problem) is that she has a balloon payment on his mortgage in two weeks, with the bad $ 20,000. Ouch. She can't come up with the money because she's just been fired. OK ... JUST is the keyword in that sentence. The ...? Did she plan to pay it off with a single salary? Maybe it would be a good idea to save on it for the past few years ... Do you think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magical powers similar to those that would have a genius ... but there is no limit to the number of wishes you can make! Munchie gets the boy a lot of fancy stuff for one night, but then asks the child to send it back to the mall. Munchie "borrowed it". The annoying furball also uses its other worldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game through fraud. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Unfortunately, the stupid parents watching the game do not think it is strange. Hmm. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I want to upload it because it has already deducted enough of my life force as it is. You will be really surprised by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down, with the mother, plays a dog kicking her out. Your heart will melt at her charm as she learns of dollar bills fluttering on her backyard and wondering how it can snow during the summer. "Munchie Strikes Back" credits have promised to follow another movie that is entitled, I believe, "Munchie Hangs Ten". To date, the movie show has been robbed of what would have been a movie tour force. Heh. 10/01
