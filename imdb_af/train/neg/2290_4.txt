The ultimate goal of Big Brother, that we know what to think before we think it, is realized. Is it a kind of miracle, or sinister joke, that people want to wear spiritual straight jackets of their own, turn themselves into twisted shapes, and smile like monkeys? Movies, art, no longer make the unknown danger, but are derived from the conclusions, drained of life. <br /> <br /> "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a mere case study suitable for a female college feminism course. His lesson is schematic, rectangular and linear: "See how women are objected, exploited, abused, then thrown on the trash, by a man-dominated society." <br /> <br /> Bettie Page, presumably, was the "pin-up queen of the 1950s," the ass ejaculated millions of men. (All reviewers repeat the phrase, "Pin-up Queen of the 1950s," like a chorus of monkeys.) Her history as an American sex bomb is known: Southern, abused by her father, raped, etc. In this movie she is a naive, an innocent unaware of the prurient interests she serves and makes blatant profits. Although she believes in Jesus, she enjoys her nude in front of a camera lens - just the healthy girl-by-sex sex slaves American men assume fantasy. <br /> <br /> From the mouth of writer-director Mary Harron herself, Oxford-educated EN ex-punk (do you smell the combined rotting and "hype" like me?): "I feel it without feminism, I would don't do it ... I don't make feminist movies in the sense that I don't make anything ideological, but I find women get my movies better. "What a snug click. <br /> <br /> The movie just goes through the moves to tell the story of a human life. It's the subject and purpose that was compared and started before the movie. Mrs. Page has a boyfriend, but we are barely showing their relationship. In fact, there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the movie. <br /> <br /> One cannot ignore his smug simplicity. In New York, where is Mrs. Page its best trying to fit in and surprise a man's world, tied herself in the ropes of slavery and tightened firmly in the black leather boots and bodysuits of S & M, the movie is black and white. But in Miami, where she gets away completely, she takes off her clothes and is photographed by a "liberated" woman. The movie is in color. <br /> <br /> Like hell, Harron didn't make "feminist movies," doesn't make anything ideological. "Ideology has become so internalized, so accepted, so programmed that it is almost invisible. Big Brother must smile.
