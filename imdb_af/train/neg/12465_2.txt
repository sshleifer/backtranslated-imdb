Overwhelmingly complicated and murdered. I'm a shiny man, but it was just too much for a tired brain. It will really benefit from some early clues about who these people are and what they do. Probably better for the US market. GC itself pointed out that it alone did not provide his Oscar and you can see why. <br /> <br /> Still, the sand dunes are beautiful. The nail pull is nasty. The lawyers drunk father is a mystery. The cricket is good to see. <br /> <br /> Very difficult to write the required ten rules on this, though it is longer than 2 hours. Thanks, they shortened it. Granted, we're not much, but the last movie we saw, Walk the Line, was 10 times better and I don't like Johnny Cash. My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds, so there it is ..... am I still almost there? <br /> <br /> What about me?
