The only saving part of this movie was the price I paid. At least everything I lost was $ 3.00 and the time passed by this bomb. The crew member in charge of continuity missed the boat. When the female chief and the FBI man went to the alleged murderer site, FBI handing the woman a revolver. When the alleged killer came out, the turret had magic in an automatic conversion. One should consider giving an FBP agent a weapon to a citizen? I do not think so. Miss. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It's too bad that the R rating doesn't allow much of her to be seen. It seems that a movie editor cut what was the best part of the movie.
