Oh God, I should've seen it when I was only 11 or twelve, (don't ask). Maybe I was young, but I wasn't stupid. Anyone can see that it is a bad movie, nasty, rough, unsuitable and very stupid. I saw more impressive effects at Disneyland, I saw better performances at a school game. And I saw more convincing crocodiles at the zoo where they did nothing but sat in the water and ignored the kids on the glass <br /> <br /> The story is in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious youngsters, trying a new water sport, surfing in shark-filled waters. It soon becomes clear that something more dangerous is in the water. After learning, they get help from a grizzly middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family. <br /> <br /> I think I saw every crocodile film made in the last place. fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and its worse is its successor. Blood Surf will be the second worst crocodile I think, with Primeval and Crocodile sitting slowly back. <br /> <br /> The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, covering more than a hundred injuries or deaths each year. However, movies like Blood Surf not only destroy the fiery image of such a creature, but half an hour of the viewer's life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
