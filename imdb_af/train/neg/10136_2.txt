No one can keep this movie for his merit, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy movie clips for their MST3 quality then it's for you. It stands alongside 'Road House' for its distinguished characters, sets and story line. The bad writing really cracked me: "I want you to kick off the guys" instead of "... dust the guys." F-14s take off from the carrier, but when they are formed, they are F-16s! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal goes back to work for the general who, just a few minutes earlier, was a secret "mind-wipe" on Seagal. Segal runs out of bullets and falls over to a knife to kill the guards. So, of course, the guards drop their guns and fight with knives too! The hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway. The small stealth warrior can fly from California to Afghanistan completely without refilling. Then Segal flies back to California - the long way, that is, through Europe - although there is a carrier that gives him 20 minutes of air support in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat screen TVs and photos of meters and maps on the walls. What a hoot!
