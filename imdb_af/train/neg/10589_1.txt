Universal Soldier: The return is not the worst movie ever made. No, the honor will go to a movie trying to make some kind of statement or some artistic facts, but fail in a pathetic or offensive manner. Perhaps no movie I have ever seen tried so little and so completely succeeded as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This movie is a sci-fi / action transvesty that doesn't recommend anything. The acting is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. The special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone who is even remotely connected to this movie should be ashamed of themselves. USA: The return makes the previous Van Damme prize look like groundbreaking films. Some movies are so bad they are good. Believe me when I tell you it's not one of them. I'm not really sure what to say here. I doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they weren't already, but just in case: don't.
