Not sure why this movie is being advertised as a wild, cute, laugh-filled comedy. There is not much in this movie that will entertain or entertain the film. Annette Bening (whose play is considered worthy of Oscar) comes out so often, with her performance seemingly routine. Brian Cox's character is confusing and annoying, and starring Augusten ?? Joseph Cross ?? Looks like he doesn't have the personality to carry his role. The best thing about the movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but she's not enough to endorse this boring, indifferent movie. <br /> <br /> The movie disappears quickly and looks good reason. I found some of the screens unpleasant (the scene with Brian Cox and his only use of toilet competitors from the worst scenes in "You and Me and Everyone we know" and "The squid and the whale"), a little embarrassing, and most of them disturbing. I found the whole experience a waste of time. Don't waste your time?
