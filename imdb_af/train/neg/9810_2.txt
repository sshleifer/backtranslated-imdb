It's hard to criticize this movie because I don't like the story itself, and no amount of good acting would have saved it. Think 'Raising Arizona' with an average stroke. The play is acceptable, but Jennifer Tilly is a bit like the top of the rope (not enough to make it a nice movie), between misery and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the film is constantly disturbed, either from the tension of their parts or the tension of the whole futile exercise. An actual humiliating few hours of movie. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying too hard to understand. I wish I could tell you how it ended, but I ran out, sorry.
