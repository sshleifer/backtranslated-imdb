This movie is not worth the movie it was photographed on. The dialogue is flat, filled with clich√© overused lines and rendered by amateur actors who, like them, read a script for the first time. The shaky, shaky, film style is a cheap imitation of the "The Ring" style visual effects. The characters don't even work like a normal person. For example, the character looking for her twin sister at her home forces her through the front door, screams around the house and is frightening and she doesn't even call her sister's name out to see if she's home. What? You'd think she just buried her sister instead of looking for her. Too many flashbacks for her childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks are a typical sign of an amateur director. It's really funny to look at the many shots of the woman driving her car in the street, on the driveway, around this corner, here, oh there, o a side view, now a front view. That's enough. You'll think you're watching a TV commercial for the Solaris! Terrible movie. 0 out of 100. I'm really sorry anyone who spent money watching or watching this movie.
