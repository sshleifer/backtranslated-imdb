What a fantastic starting point: A movie about the Berlin airlift. It must have everything. Tragedy. Stress. Companionship. Opponents. Berliner Frauleins and tough American pilots. love and tears. What we have is a movie with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to personalize John Wayne or so, but he fails to fail. He acts like wood, so that he must crack at any given moment. He's trying to play the tough man instead of being a tough guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Because they threw stones into a lake? Because he brings her coal stones? The SFX is very, very well done. Too many already. The hundreds or so planes over Berlin look like an attack-warrior-forming squadron rather than an organized airliner? as it actually was. Interestingly, the White House, Kremlin and General Lucius D. Clays office all seem to have the same dark and dusty set. Note the same curtains, hang deep in the windows, as if a protective shield against nuclear waste. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY comes across as a small time, uncertain, more looser general, who in his own noble idea trusts the airlift. He was quite the opposite. So you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a movie that builds to no passion, no tension and no historical accuracy. Sad, it started so promising?
