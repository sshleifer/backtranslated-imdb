Think "stage play". It is worth seeing once for Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye performances. COmpare the Melvyn Douglas in "Ghost Story" with the Melvyn Douglas of this movie. Are vampires loose in this 'Bavarian' town, or is there a more natural, although equally sinister, explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, which is cast as a very moronic character. It's nice to look at his various facial expressions in what is really a stock character. Nothing much happens for a long time, but then we discover that Atwill's pipe is smoking doctor's right killer. There is too much 'comic relief', but it is par for the course for this era. Fay Wray looks really good.
