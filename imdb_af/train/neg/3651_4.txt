I expected a very funny movie. Instead, I have a movie with some funny jokes, and many that just haven't worked. I didn't have the idea of ​​bringing in Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty's descendants. It was confusing. It would have been more funny if they just had someone new, instead of Moriarty. Some of the things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was funny. The McGarrett of Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett-like. Connie Booth is of course very good with accents. She's from Indiana, but played pretty well English and a New Yorker. Unfortunately, she wasn't much in the writing. I expected a more funny movie. Instead, I got a rather confusing movie with a poor writing. Rather ironically, since both Booth and Cleese were together on this one. Perhaps they were about to break into 77.
