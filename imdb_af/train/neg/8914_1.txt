I had to stop watching this film (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious movie viewers) twenty minutes in it, because it was mediocre and boring enough to inspire scents, not to mention I was near tears over $ 3, 99 I wasted at Blockbuster. . Joanna Pacula's acting and her terribly rendered Slavic accent is sufficiently terrible to set one to grind your teeth. I knew two hours of her two hours would be too much. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unbeatable actors of strikingly few talents. While on the subject of talent, Breuer's superior assistant appears to have pulled out of a local acting squad. She clearly did not learn her craft. In fact, she's really awful. All the public plays have watched and the extras are mechanically moving in their best Sunday. To eliminate this movie was far more satisfying than turning it on. Don't rent this horrible movie. You will be sorry to have spent your money.
