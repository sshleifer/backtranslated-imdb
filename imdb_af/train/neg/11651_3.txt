Given that this movie is compiled in less than a year, it can explain its shortness (81 minutes - including end credits, about 76 minutes of actual film). But what can't explain is the lack of humor that the previous movie possesses. <br /> <br /> The gags are fast and sometimes not even funny. The only real funny parts are the quick spoofs on Nike basketball spots, James Woods' portrayal of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist, and bits scattered across the film. Very unique was the farewell to Charlie's Angels, which, like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin-scene, basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it. <br /> <br /> Today's youth may not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror movies of the 70s such as the Exorcist and perhaps the 80s Poltergeist, et. al. <br /> <br /> Hopefully Scary Movie 3 will take time to join, so the spoofs can be more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing, however, is that the film is more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit was extremely hot in the sequel). Just for her decisive and acting ability, I give this movie a "3" from "10".
