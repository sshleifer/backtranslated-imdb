one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Pathetic action scene and very bad acting also doesn't help. The only good point is Gary Busey's parts, but it doesn't really highlight the movie. it lives up to its B film rankings and succeeds in flying colors. A waste of my money, though I found entertainment to begin with was getting annoying after some watches. I recommend this movie unless you watch it for free or a gift. (a gift that you can ask for the receipt and send it back for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
