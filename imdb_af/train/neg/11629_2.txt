** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is completely unrealistic, lacks a plot and is basically just made to see stars depicting themselves. The most exciting scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi was in the shower and then we watched her TV the shower scene of PSYCHO. This movie actually expected users to believe that Naseeruddin Shah's character has a great memory to remember where some shots were fired and how much! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER START *** <br /> <br /> In the end, the killer wastes his gut to Shabana Azmi long enough to make Naseeruddin Shah's character run shoot! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ENDS *** <br /> <br /> In the beginning it is a bit humorous (just a little) to hear the director and members throw insults on each other and hear Shabana Azmi exclaim: "Oh, sh-t!" Overall, a baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** from ********** (2 out of 10)
