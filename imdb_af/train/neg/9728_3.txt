Tobe Hooper made good movies, so I was sure it couldn't be BAD. I read no reviews and tried to watch this unintentional humorous movie. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes I almost made CRY to Hooper. <br /> <br /> I chose this 3/10 because his 1990 horror video and very interesting or funny things happened there. During the movie I thought something like "they simply can't add things to this movie anymore ..." but they have. <br /> <br /> Some say it's a kind of Firestarter clone but really. It's based on the idea, but that's all. It's a combination of horror, comedy, strange religion / god stuff, funny gore, simple effects, drama, horrible acting, incredible writing .. and more. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * Story is: Government is trying to create ultimate weapon that uses nuclear power or something and fails, during process child is born for 2 test persons. When mother after her child sings to her child, both husband and wife burn and this is spontaneous multiplication. Government buries the whole thing and lets this child stay with other people and ... then after x years this child is raised and realizes he was born for a reason and who can burn it with his brain. Then everything goes incredibly messy, nothing is really explained. Well, when the government realizes: "Well, now he can do this fire thing to work." They take him to the normal hospital where is a nuclear toxic they will use on this man. they can kill him, no they can't shoot him! .. and argh, I think it's enough to tell, I promise there are 100 more strange things in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well if you want, this one laughs. Wow.
