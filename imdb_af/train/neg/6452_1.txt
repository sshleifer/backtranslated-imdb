You know the story. Beautiful kids alone in the forest, when BAM! Something started cutting. <br /> <br /> Well, this crap is no different. A lot of kids go back to a cabin where the man leads twins. brother has disappeared for years. About a "UNKOWN CREATURE" star cuts it and their only help is a doctor / biker. <br /> <br /> To say this movie is bad is an understatement, it's smut! The acting was terrible. <br /> <br /> The creature looks very vigorous. And like all movies nowadays try to get you with a spinning end, what they don't! <br /> <br /> There is one bright spot for this movie - Lost Star Maggie Grace as the Female Head.
