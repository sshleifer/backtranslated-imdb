Hello, can anyone hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you are a co-viewer of this movie, join the fan club! This movie was so incredibly bad that I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's bad in a nice way. Every click ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very difficult to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 worst movies ever made.
