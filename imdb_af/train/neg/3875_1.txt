In my time I saw many stupid plotlines, but this one is one of the worst. After an illness has been captured in space, an astronaut returns to earth and begins to melt. He then goes on a disaster, killing people (how is it outside me, I just look at them, I can't explain them.) This is the kind of movie that shouldn't be made in the first place.
