There are many movies with Bigfoot, most of which are not good, but most have at least a solid charm for them. Sasquatch Hunters don't even do it. It's just a collision. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters is about a group of palaeontologists, primatologists and foresters raging in a remote Pacific Northwest. Bones that belong to a kind of abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region and since monkeys are not of course in North America, they start a scientific expedition. Sure enough, they soon discover a whole cemetery full of the skeletal remains of these enormous monkey-like creatures. I think we all know what happens to people who disturb ancient cemetery in the movies. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie consists of uninteresting, interchangeable characters who collect their equipment, walk through the forest, rest quietly, walk through the forest for a few hours, and wait long enough to explore and discuss some findings along the way, even more through the forest, looking for a group member who has disappeared, walked even more through the forest, digging up the theories, and firing a campfire meet to discuss what little they did that day. When Sasquatch finally pops up, it just stumbles into the dark while choosing one at a time (in a wink and you've missed it and the real murder comes out of camera). All these things are ominously boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is going to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to build up tension, but there is no one to be found, so we are wandering with dull, drawn scenes of people just around the corner. to come and stroll around the bush at night to try to scare. I would lie if I said I didn't use the fast forward button to speed up these scenes. <br /> <br /> As far as Sasquatch itself is concerned, much like any other character, otherwise in the movie. doesn't have much to do and has a clear personality. It looks like a jerky version of King Kong, which is not that bad, except in the screens where they used CGI instead of a man in a Bigfoot costume that is painfully obvious during the samples of the daylight. Part of me can't help but feel that even using computer effects to bring Bigfoot to life is a bit sacred. If there is a single movie sample that I believe should only be brought to life by the situation, it is Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that doesn't have as much plot as it's a point of departure. . This is all it really is, a point of departure that people concerned to make a movie, without adding all the ingredients to make a valuable movie.
