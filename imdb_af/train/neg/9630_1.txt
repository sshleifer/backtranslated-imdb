I realize several Ben Stiller movies are out or will be out this year, but maybe he should insist on quality, not quantity. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at what the filmmakers thought of the comedy in "Along Came Polly." <br /> <br /> Stiller's Reuben is grating, charmless and ranks among the worst shows that year. Stiller's sktick becomes annoying. He certainly has a comic talent, but he must either find another sktick or take a break, find some material that is actually funny. Because his movies go from painfully humorous to worse. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, it is a pity that she is a good, smart actress with a promising career. As long as she makes more movies like "The Good Girl" (in which she is wonderful) and less like "Along Came Polly," she has a career of which she can be proud. <br /> <br /> Aniston tries desperately to overcome the slack material she works with, but it is a frightening task for any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin, like Reuben's boss Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Reuben's best friend Sandy, there's nothing funny about this horrible movie. Other supportive characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria's accent is not just stupid, it's terribly indecent. <br /> <br /> The premise of "Along Came Polly" has definitely shown promise. Unfortunately, it needs a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy, instead of this lame, boring, boring excuse for a comedy.
