Minimal writing, minimal character development, minimal durable camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache caused by rough zoom, maximum characters walking around in the forest, do nothing. Until the time flashes at 12:01 on the screen, you can miss fast and nothing, as there are three hunters we know nothing about. To be honest, the movie does have some string music that was interesting, so maybe a music video would have been the way to go with it. Unfortunately it was not, and what had to be a twenty minute short was out of faith. Forget about "Trigger Man", I know I'm trying. - NOTE
