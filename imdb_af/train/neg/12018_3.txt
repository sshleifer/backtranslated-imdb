- A little while tricks pull the local mob out of money. Of course, the gangster wants his money back and doesn't care who to kill to get it. The punk appeals to his friend and an old killer to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If it is ridiculous, it is. The whole idea that this Izod wear, dune buggy-driving punk can hold one of the most powerful people in Rome, is simply stupid. His friend could be well with a gun, but he was against a group of trained killers. The old gangster is a little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face with the gang. There is also a subplot about how the friend's father was killed by the mob boss years ago, but little of it was made and it didn't help the movie at all. <br /> <br /> - The Bobboss, Mr. Scarface, is played by Jack Palance. I think he got the name because he has what looks like a sharp nick on his cheek. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the role, and does what he needs to get a salary. <br /> <br /> - I recently saw some good Italian crime / cop flicks, but Mr. Scarface is not one. of them. Rather look at Syndicate Sadists or Revolver.
