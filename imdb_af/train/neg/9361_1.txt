When I watched the preview for this on TV, I thought, "Well it's going to be a good werewolf film," but it wasn't. it was not scary at all! acting was good, plot was terrible, the military bid was just stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel can be done better than this piece of crap. The film made it sound like Arron would change in a werewolf, but instead he became a psycho and bit a doctor's throat. Reading some of my other reviews on other movies is all positive, but this one is not just because the story was terrible. One out of 10 maximum. I'm sure you've all expected a werewolf, but I'm sure you didn't expect it. Beyond Loch Nes was much better than this movie. Quite any movie on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie.
