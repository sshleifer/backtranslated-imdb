Hard to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best, it surprised me for a few moments of surprise. <br /> <br /> If you forget the (failed) frightening dimension and look at other sides of the movie, he is disappointed again. The acting is OK, but not good. The story may be somewhat interesting at first, while trying to get what happens. But by the end you understand there's not much to understand. "Scary" elements sometimes appear to have been added to the script for no reason. <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) See this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do, like cutting the roots or looking at the clouds.
