Question: How does a civilian director treat a topic such as immigration? Answer: to change it into an existential alienation quarter. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are back in the early nineties, just after the disintegration of the Eastern bloc and the subsequent flood of immigrants in the European Union, and what better way to deal with the issue than to " a film about an existentially estranged middle class journalist, an existentially estranged high-class politician, his existentially estranged rich woman, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the background, immigrants are asking for political asylum in an unnamed Greek village near the borders. I think Angelopoulos can show some social awareness while dealing with the existential upset higher classes. I mean frankly, the scene where a top-army officer curses his intention because he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you blow. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it can't be that bad. , Angelopoulos is a master of cinema, right? Wrong. It is at this point when its ways start to artificially, like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks appear: there are vague windows, faint lights, a strange wedding, a walk along the river coast and people with yellow water dresses. Mastroianni is also breaking new ground for most sleeping matches ever. Really avoid. Go for his early movies.
