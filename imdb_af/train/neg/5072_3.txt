And a self-allowed one to start. At one point, the doctor's assistant refers to himself as Igor. <br /> <br /> Working with the increasingly credible idea that computers can be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions. This movie does not spend enough time exploring the premise. Most of the screen time is divided between girl-in-a-coma domestic strife and chases the donor's killer. It strives to be a sci-fi / drama / thriller, but fails to deliver on any of the three. <br /> <br /> As a Frankenstein remake, this one misses everything that made the original good. Nobody calls the doctor mad or even threatens to kick him out of hospital. The transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening one eye and the wonderful computer that makes it happen is not even shown. When the experiment works, there is no praise, and when it goes wrong, there is little reaction. <br /> <br /> Anyone suspected of being the killer has been broken by gradually showing him in the same room with all the possible suspects. Finding the killer is as easy as opening one file and interrogating one person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco as an institution is both overplayed and underutilized. The opening sequence puts the point that it happens in SF, a cable car plays an important role, the lead remains in a hill Victorian, Pier 39 emerges, and the final detention happens at Golden Gate Park. More specifically, ten feet from the stone side at the park - just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times. Once the obvious landscape base is completed, no other attempt is made to explore the city. <br /> <br /> The play is the only saving grace here. Keir Dullea shows a good series and pulls off some real emotional scenes. Suzanna Love represents recovery from a coma well. Tony Curtis only gets a handful of lines and twice as many malignant men face most of the Franconian sciences that his assistant puts. The blonde blonde child also beats pretty well. <br /> <br /> I also gave it an extra star for the scene where the man drives south from the bridge, it cuts to a U-turn in an unrelated parking lot, and then back on the north-facing bridge. It takes a lot of things - courage, ignorance, deadlines - to try to slip one through the viewer during one single car hunt.
