Every time in a long time, a movie will come together that will be so terrible that I am forced to warn people. If I work all my days and I can save but one soul to watch this movie, how great will be my joy. <br /> <br /> Where to start my pain talk. For starters there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was a stereotype. We have a tough guy, an old guy who eats donuts, a goofy strange guy, and so on. The writing felt as if it was written when the movie was shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was looking at a junior high video presentation. Have the directors, producers, etc. Ever seen a movie? Throat storm gets worse and worse with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounds so funny. How can you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legal actors. But trust me when I say, things went wrong, VERY WRONG.
