I loved watching the original Azumi with his mix of live action manga, compelling story, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), Editing, and not calling the beautiful Aya Ueto the part perfectly filled. So I really looked forward to Azumi 2, but when I finally saw it, I felt I had won the lottery and lost the ticket. (Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi ran away, but it is quite 2 different movies. Much slower, the action is not that exciting and also choreographed and there is not much character development. It is apparently directed by the same man responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if possible!) I agree with some other reviewers who say this is a lost opportunity, but if only Ryuhei Kitamura continues with this installment, there is a beautiful Japanese forest food to watch while the slow action unfolds and we are shortly suggested to kill some characters who are quickly killed, even the real bad guys are being killed without too much of a fight. from an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the unforgettable battle scene Wheras in Azumi 1 We had a climatic battle scene with camera effects, Azumi 2 we have the Azumi cape cam! umi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya is still doing a good job. She looks good in the cape ... but where did she get it from? I don't think I'll see this one over and over again! ... what a pity.
