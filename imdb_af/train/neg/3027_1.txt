If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it must be garbage. It's by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Tony Scott's poor live style puts shame on an already uninteresting and slightly untrustworthy story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all the action scenes are loosely tied together by poor plot points and horrible acting. Keira Knightley, however, becomes completely naked in this one. This is the only side of this movie. If you want to see her naked, just get ahead of the movie for about half an hour and you'll catch a lot of nipples. I strongly suggest that no one ever sees this movie! <3
