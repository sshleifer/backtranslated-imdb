Ridiculous. This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who the * bleep * Ramtha is, "Ramtha is a 35,000-year-old writer who appeared in Tacoma, Washington, Washington in 1977. Ridder claims she is Ramtha's channel. She also has copyright on Ramtha and perform sessions in which she pretends to be in a trance and speak Hollywood's version of Elisabeth English, she has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars as Ramtha at seminars ($ 1,000 a crack) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment , and from the sale of tires, books and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). She must have hypnotic powers. Looking for self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people will obey her commission for hours of blindfolding in a cold, muddy, deadly Maze. "John Wheeler, one of America's best theoretical physicists, will roll his eyes on this movie. He recently criticized parapsychologists for their abuse and misinterpretation of quantum theory. This movie does the same thing as the fool. <br /> <br /> There is a good review of this movie at Skeptico. I recommend that anyone who is considering reading this movie first read it before contributing to a cult's suitcases. <br /> <br /> http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I told one reviewer here at IMDb to take this movie with a salt grain. It will take enough salt to kill a horse by blowing the rubbish bin of this movie.
