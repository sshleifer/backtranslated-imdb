This is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression. Story writing IS what filmmaking is about. <br /> <br /> Incredible visual effects. Very good acting, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect. Except. The story is just poor and so everything fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you have the power to be invisible. What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) can think of nothing but courage and rape women. It's all his thoughtful "brilliant" thoughts can think. Does he try to get extra power? No. He didn't even bother researching a way to be visible again. The man is basically a sex-mad maniac. <br /> <br /> In addition, the lab atmosphere, you have all these young guys. Throw jokes as they were in a bar. If it wasn't for all the white coats and equipment, you think it's a bad imitation of "Cheers." Very level and poor personalities and very little care is being taken to make you think these guys are nothing but lambs for the Hollow Man's wolf. <br /> <br /> Even as an excitement, the movie falls short, because most of the "exciting" scenes are so poorly written and full of illogical behavior by the actors who just scream. "It's just a stupid thing I must do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me. "<br /> <br /> When you read the real book while Scientist (Cane) goes to women, there is a lot of spiritual manipulation and disturbing thoughts that fall into his character. In the movie, Cane is just the sick man going to a busy market to rub his body in and out of women. Just sad.
