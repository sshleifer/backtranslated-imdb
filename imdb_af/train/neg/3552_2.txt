I finally saw THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 strange years to see it, and it certainly wasn't worth waiting all the time to see it. The INCUBUS is strictly at the number horror movie: Invisible killer / monster rapes and kills women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The movie goes as follows: the film opens with murder; dan blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another murder; even more blah blah blah; continue with blah blah blah; another murder (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah, etc. ... <br /> <br /> The movie is completely predictable from start to finish. Even the stupid "big" red hair used throughout the movie won't convince a 5-year-old. And I found out the secret identity of the incubator when I saw the character. When the shocking surprise loss arrived, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept the day after I saw the movie. It's so stupid! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is so near-the-number that the "rock band" series is one of the few outstanding moments in this brave movie. It's a striking scene, not necessarily because it's good, but because it's so funny and useless: the big screen movie shows a rock-video-like moment with a man in red leather trousers making his obvious false long hair cut. It is made up of scenes from a girl attacked by the incubator in the washroom of the film room. The best thing I can say about this movie is cinematography, which I actually liked. But besides, there is almost nothing to call the INCUBUS, except that it is inadvertently hilarious.
