It played a big role with big stars such as Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a lot of lesser-known names with shorter roles. It also made Technicolor, one of the few movies made in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ... Unfortunately, I can't say very positively to the story. This depicted the James boys in a completely positive light .... and Hollywood has been doing it ever since. Why these criminals are always shown to be the "good guys" is outside me. This film glamorizes them and makes their enemies - the railway people - into evil people. The latter was exaggerated so much that it was ominous. Well, that's the movie world for you: evil is good; good is bad. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: Here's a News Flash - The James boys were criminals! Really - look it up!
