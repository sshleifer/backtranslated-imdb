Funny that I forced myself to review this movie, but here I am. <br /> <br /> I reviewed it because I recently had the chance to revive R.C. Sheriff's play "Journey's End" on stage in New York, at Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as Mr. David Grindley's masterful guidance. <br /> <br /> I broke the theater. I'm not exaggerating, I was flabbergasted. After nearly two and a half hours of a revived and very claustrophobic depiction of the soldier's life in the trenches of the Somme (I speculate), during the First World War, life was alive, by all involved, I came out of the theater with the shake. <br /> <br /> Do you think I'm not easily shocked, and I'm not too sensitive. I'm a stage actor and a director myself, so I know the buttons are pushed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally and psychologically. <br /> <br /> But what I just saw came to life so much that I had chills in my spine. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions came to life while 'Aces High' was watched, the movie based on this play and even adapted to the screen, in conjunction with RC Sheriff himself, shortly before he is dead. <br /> <br /> The screen adjustment takes place in the air over France. So, away is the claustrophobic ambience to start with. <br /> <br /> The only plus of the movie is the airline scenes dated in their special effects, compared to today's standards, but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on the screen. <br /> <br /> There were a few screen adjustments of "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which is in the trenches, and not in the air, but that was the "German" vision on things, if one were to choose such things. <br /> <br /> "Journey's End" is just the other side of the medal and would make it into a big movie if they left it alone and intact. <br /> <br /> The transfer on DVD is poor, even though it is in Widescreen and adapted for 16: 9 TV screens, the quality of the movie itself is that of a movie theater. Nothing more, nothing less. It sports various deviations, such as smaller scratches and dots, although the copy is clean for the rest. <br /> <br /> If you want another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who love and enjoy watching. air balloons under old timers, then this is a picture for you. But I'd rather suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although it's also a movie that is inaccurate. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who likes good acting and drama, I'll leave. this one out. Buy the play. Check out the play if you get the chance to get a decent revival near you, but keep this adjustment away. <br /> <br /> This is an anti-war film granted but the worst I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud is just a bluff, as they are only seen in very poor and very much. McDowell, talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, perform very poorly, not because of their lack of skills, but rather because of a lack of truth. and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many gaps in it, and as said before, it dragged it to the dubious end. Dubious because in the original play none of the men we know and sympathize with remains alive. They are all killed in a fatal and useless mission. In the movie, everyone except Malcolm McDowell, who somehow lives alive, dies the wing commander of the unlucky cluster, just to receive three more pilots to fly and die for another " a lost cause. <br /> <br /> The end of the play leaves a mere stage in total darkness. You only hear the cannons roar, the machine guns rattle, and grenade impact throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, total peace and silence. The curtain comes up. Lights. And here they are all. Lined up, standing straight and stiff. Odd bodies ... <br /> <br /> Very interesting and much more shocking than "Aces High" final, which is also dragged by the hair. <br /> <br /> It is up to you to judge. <br /> <br /> For me, if I had the money and the contacts to do so, I would take and develop the play as intended. To add an action scene here and there in the field, just to visualize the "outer" horror and massacre in the "vast fields of France", to the men concerned, but then just concentrate on what's going on in that little "shack" on the edge of common sense and the world ... <br /> <br /> Want such a movie? <br /> <br /> Ask this. <br /> <br /> It's not so.
