First of all, I'm not a big fan of contemporary Turkish theater, because that's the usual pattern of creating a box office success by hitting under the waist. This movie is nothing of an artistic taboo masterpiece, as the director and marketing advertising implies. In my opinion, the only purpose of this movie is to earn money by touching a sensitive morale (in fact, it is mostly regarded as taboo in the country). Cheap populism may give a short definition of what I meant. <br /> <br /> However, the acting is almost perfect. In fact, most of the role players have theater backgrounds and have tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacks; talent! All the role players were perfect in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced. (Like Janset) Altioklar earns at least a small word of appreciation just because he knows well how to choose the cast. Other than that, he is just a media monkey, who assumes himself as a director with an artistic talent. Come on, art is not something solely made up of dealing with naked / half-naked women. And just because the media boasts, no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish theater. Just keep your ears and o something realistic, I'm eagerly awaiting your next job. Hope, this time you can reach an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> In brief; For> Good acting, hot women (just joking!) :) Disadvantages> Every single thing except the throw
