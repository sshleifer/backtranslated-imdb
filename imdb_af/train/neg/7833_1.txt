I only saw the third week of Stephen Kings' Nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series; meaning, I have seen 6 episodes so far. I have to say the stories are very poor. I read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, a collection of his short stories that have come back. I remember most of the stories being average to poor, but there was one that was really great if it wasn't outstanding. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say is just because this mini-series from a collection of Stephen King stories doesn't mean it'll be good. In fact, if his previous collection of short stories is of any indication, most of these mini-series will average to poor. <br /> <br /> In Stephen King's defense, I didn't read these new short stories. Perhaps they are good like stories in a book and not easily adaptable on television, or maybe it was the fault of the screenwriters trying to write an interesting writing. Who knows. These short stories can also be made exclusively for this mini-series and not for printing purposes. Maybe it's the problem. If Stephen King submitted these crap stories to an editor, I'm sure the editor will tell him immediately to make it more interesting, as it's just boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear from all this is the story / essay problem and not the actors and actresses, as this mini-series has some excellent people on it. <br /> <br /> If you see this mini-series, I really make it the old "Twilight Zone" series. Each series was just half an hour, but it was compelling and sound. I don't understand why this mini series could not achieve the same performance, i'm sure this mini-series had a lot of money to make a good mini-series but unfortunately something should not be clicked. <br /> <br /> For example "This week there were two episodes. The first was a horror story writer who bought a picture signed by an artist who committed suicide. The author began to see changes in the picture while he was driving home. painting away, but it still appears close to him. Also, the portrait of an individual in the photo killed people and died to kill him. (I won't even mention the second episode for this week that criminals and their booty including, because it was even more boring than this episode!) <br /> <br /> This point of departure is inter essant and so the story should be good, but after seeing it I was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story, as well as strange material that did nothing to help the story. After the last scene I left more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried 3 weeks in this mini-series, but it was just too aggravating because of bad stories / writing. If it were a movie, I would recommend that people wait for the movie to come on cable or so. I won't even recommend renting it in your video store. But since it's on TNT, a cable channel, I'd say if you haven't seen it yet, try it for one week. If you don't like it this week, you won't like the previous series or the future one, as they all share the same boring feature.
