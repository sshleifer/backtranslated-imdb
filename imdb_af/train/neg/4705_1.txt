My favorite reminder of this show and the band was when I was with a lot of my friends who were NBB haters and had a great bonfire, and we took a CD of their songs and the DVD of the movie and a bunch of photos of the band members and throw them into the fire and dance a happy gig to the burning stuff as they sing "Ding Dong The Hitch Is Dead". This was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a capital God sucking this show. I hate it so much. Get rid of the car. You really suck! You really destroyed the entire channel! No offense or anything, but you have to get a life, I mean really, who makes a stupid show with a stupid leader who can't even sing! You really look terrible and have a life like hobos or something, except Roselina. She's really beautiful. But still, you guys!
