Posted with fine actors, I expected much more from "cheat" than was delivered. The plot is extremely confronted and manipulative. The many flashbacks just add to the confusion. Credibility flies out of the window and with the end becomes unbearable and straightforward ridiculous. I would strongly recommend that anyone who holds their movie stands based on something that is at least possible to avoid "cheating" because you will be very frustrated. Perhaps I am just not hip enough to get it, but my suspicion is that a lot of others are completely confused by the story line and especially by the end. The blurring of the line between reality and lies simply doesn't work because the whole movie didn't make sense. - NOTE
