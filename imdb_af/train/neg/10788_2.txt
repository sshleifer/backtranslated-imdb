And I mean ultra light. This film contains four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing out there. There is really not too much to say about this stinker, except that it has some very good things. bits, most of them are not very funny. It also doesn't work as a romance. What about a romantic comedy? Not on your life. Most of the dialogue is too flat to be sophisticated, much less amusing. <br /> <br /> What is really ashame is the point of departure is not bad at all. This movie could have been so much more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the fake ways in which movies are promoted, complete with fake quotes from critics. The film uncovers the unmoved territory of the press-junket - those who pay expenses for journalists who are almost always writing good reviews. But instead of exploring what was a womb of jokes, it has been spending about three minutes in this area and moving forward in pursuit of the film's lame romance. <br /> <br /> Same with Catherine Zeta-Jones' character - the whinny, self-centered movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she has given, but she has been given virtually nothing. It's all homogenized litter that looks very pale compared to some of the things we've heard about stars over the years. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's difficult to understand what Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship, sinking like a revival of "The Love Boat. " In fact, as the old joke goes, they had forgotten the script and filmed the deal. This will probably make a better story. So, go ahead and tell us, filmmakers, what do you have on these stars they have to appear in this?
