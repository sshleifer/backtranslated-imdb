Definitely a strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life crumbles around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks at the name of a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the minister's house and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the Word of God and to have Jesus in his heart. It makes everything better. Agh ... if everything in life was just as easy. The fact that this "movie" seems to have been made around $ 500 certainly doesn't help. 10/01
