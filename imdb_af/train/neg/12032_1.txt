This movie was terrible. I had a very difficult time looking through it completely. I didn't get the point of the movie. What was the point of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, the acting was bad and the story was uninspiring. The two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialogue was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among any of the role players. I don't know for a fact, but I suspect most of the actors were first. The movie could easily be cut to about an hour and a half without losing the plot. It shows how many useless scenes were in the movie. I'd rather have a root canal during the two hours of the movie. I want those two hours back! If you want to see a good, funny movie that is family-friendly and made by a lot of Mormons, Napoleon Dynamite looks rather.
