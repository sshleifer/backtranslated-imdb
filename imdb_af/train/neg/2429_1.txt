Scary .. Yes Scary !! I saw this movie for the first time, two years ago. It's safe to say it made a bizarre subject. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie two years ago. It's safe to say it's made a bizarre subject. from discussion at school the next day. This movie was horrible! Barely a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! This movie hit its low point with one of the latest characters staring at a girl's legs. <br /> <br /> Girl: You're not gonna find God there! Guy: Nah, but I think I got heaven. <br /> <br /> Make sure you don't want to hear the amateur actors, discuss topics like transmission, adultery, and the process of spoiling your peers. AVOID!
