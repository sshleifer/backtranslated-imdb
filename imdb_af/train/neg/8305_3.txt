Like most people, I like a Christmas story. I've never heard of this movie and maybe for good reason - it's terrible. The same country, the same narrator, the same director, but the hot falsity of the original was missing. Charles Grodin was a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can't imagine anyone replacing him. The story seems forced and does not have the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors, the Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In a Christmas story, Ralphie's obsession with the BB gun looks cute, but his obsession with this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the original neighborhood bull, is replaced in this movie by another child with socks and a strange hat, but with little of the Scud Farkus threatening appeal. It would be pretty difficult to look the original, even if this movie was made with the original crew.
