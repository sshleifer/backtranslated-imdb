Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive, beautiful woman, overwhelmed by a clever little daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a small, two-time man, Sean (Rick Roberts), both boring and self-centered. <br /> <br /> It was advertised as a troubled family knocked by a mad killer during a ruthless storm. <br /> <br /> The storm doesn't even happen until the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then it's not something to send someone to the storm cellar. <br /> <br /> The stalking also doesn't get intense until almost the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie we spent listening to Jill and her irreconcilable daughter, Liv, wanted to flee the next week. <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Liv is that she acted with Zack, a son of dubious character, and they are constantly out - indeed, Jill comes home to find the two of them on Liv's bed . <br /> <br /> The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband Sean or either crawling on Jill or criticizing her. <br /> <br /> Sean was not at all attractive - as his face was so firm you could tie the dots. <br /> <The story begins with Jill being notified of an outstanding account on their credit card for a hotel she was never used to, and that she thought Sean was never. <br /> <br /> Jill goes to the hotel where she meets owner and manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very cute, older, divorced man who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when he returns to her husband, he dials Jill and shows her. <br /> <br /> Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She's upset, let's see without Sean, and do absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn't even tell Sean when he gets home. It didn't make me sense. <br /> <br /> Jill gave her business card to Richard, and so he calls her and she in real estate. She showed him an apartment. Then they have a drink, and things get cozy between them. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill get it up, hot and heavy. In fact, when Jill suddenly decides to cut out, he looks a bit more aggressive than necessary. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his fraud. Sean waved about how Jill had dropped himself since her father died. Apparently his lack of morality is all her fault. Eventually, Jill acknowledges her own lack of morality and adultery to Sean - and of course it's also her fault as far as Sean is concerned. <br /> <br /> The small family decides to go on a camping trip, which means more and more of them, especially the spoiled daughter. <br /> <br /> I was so furious with the stalker to get everyone, but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
