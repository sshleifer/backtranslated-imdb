I just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A lot of kids, 14 to 22, went on the DVD of "Titanic" on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type agreement. Only two of them have seen it before. But everyone has seen so many times the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion that most of them have seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic began, they began to rest, some left the others - "call us when the iceberg appears." More than one and a half in the movie, just the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They started screaming: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, they all returned to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouth and pushed Os and far out. So, just as I thought when the movie burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink, but what about the rest of it. Dr. For example, Zivagho had a similar running time, but think how much will happen in that movie within that time. In "Titanic" Leo Kate learns how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the so-called Creme de la Creme in the first-class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to put guns and shootings in a ship that is sinking. The real sinking here is of film standards. All efforts are focused on special effects and opening week ends. The movie has still become the highest gross movie, so what do I know?
