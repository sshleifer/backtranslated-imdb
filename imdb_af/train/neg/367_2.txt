A young boy comes in a lot of money and starts delivering it right away. Unfortunately, the man whose money it is really happens very badly. He wants his booty back. When he discovers who has the money, he starts trying to get it back. He remains spoiled by this little child, who is just happy not to fall from the evil man's hands. Sounds familiar, I'll bet. Very predictable, not interesting at all. Come on something else, okay guys?
