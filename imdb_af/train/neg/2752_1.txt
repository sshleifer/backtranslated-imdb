Whatever his name is (the author and director) must be concluded in the hope of rubbish, as never again. This one is in battle with some of the most horrible movies of all time. Sometimes movies are bad in a way that they are actually good. Not this one. It was so bad I got angry. Seriously. A drunk 10-year-old could have gained a better writing. What a waste. All the actors were completely uninspired not to work at all, the CGI was barely acceptable, the pursuit of scenes was completely delayed and the small piece of story there was hurt, that is, as he just decided: "I want this has to happen and it will happen, but I don't care how we got there, just shoot it and put it in. Whatever, I go back to my trailer to pick my nose, if someone calls me, I is not here. "Sorry for whatever your name is. Shame on you.
