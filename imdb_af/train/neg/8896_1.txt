I watched Brigadoon on TV last night (September 12, 2009). I'm 61 years old and watch movies as long as I can remember. I can honestly say that Brigadoon stands alone as by far the worst movie I've ever seen. The accents were shameful. The local kids club would have created better sets. The characters were so timid that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the customers who had the accident to see it. It should be hoped that the stars of this film are thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment they had had to see this movie. The owners of these trips should provide a good service to humanity and destroy all copies of this film.
