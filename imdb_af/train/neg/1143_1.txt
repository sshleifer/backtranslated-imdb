Even 20+ years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I've ever managed to go through. Scandinavian Ninjas enter silence into a scene, burning their silly noisy sub-machine guns with wild desolation, and then quietly go out. Wow, how will we find the silent invisible killers? Just follow the shell walls and smoke! Painfully bad dialogue (or was it brilliant and only poorly translated?), Not an Asian in sight, and a treasure total of 3 Asians among the stunt staff. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is not much - then ninja can't act again! Save yourself - avoid watching at all costs!
