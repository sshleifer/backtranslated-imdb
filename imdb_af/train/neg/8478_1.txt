This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever. The acting was pathetic. Jordan Hinson couldn't show any upset emotions. At the beginning of the movie she had to be discouraged. Instead, she knocked out her head with her lower lip. She zealously sighed without tears for the crying scene. I was almost angry that from all the girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to pick her out. Everyone else also suffers from overworking. It was flat, irritating. It was also an insult to skaters. Jordan took a month to practice, and they cast her as a person making the Olympic team. It is practically haunting the attempt to put real figure skaters into their work. An avid excuse for a movie, and a keen attempt to associate hockey and skating. Don't waste your life. It doesn't even earn one star.
