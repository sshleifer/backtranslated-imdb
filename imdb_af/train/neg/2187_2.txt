I bought this movie on DVD so I could get an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Thanks, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are viewable, because the movie itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story you can follow, and some actors who can act, there is nothing else. The movie was so boring, I firmly confirmed that I would never see it again without Tom, Crow and Mike. However, as summarized above, it was better than the movie that occurred in the MST3K episode that preceded it; Mitchell.
