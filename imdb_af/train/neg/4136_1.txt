I read the reviews before I watched this movie, and I didn't believe them. I love crap movies and I expected this to be one average. It wasn't. This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 like greats. The movie contains bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing story, bad makeup and it made me so bored that I turned it off. even the nakedness was rubbish! Did they even have a budget for this movie? I don't think they did it. You can know if you are going to this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. If you want a good, cute movie, look at poisonous avenger 4 or even camp blood. Avoid this trash - I've watched it and watched it on TV, so don't spend it. The best part is probably the end.
