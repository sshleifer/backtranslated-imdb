The main complaint to this movie is the fact that I can't tell who is who. No racism is meant, but these Asians all look the same! I can tell a little about the story, but it's as far as it goes. The people's identities are not a mystery, if they were a mystery, I would care for them. Instead, I wasn't so far off the screen. <br /> <br /> Tones of wide shots and quiet, emotional faces cover this movie. Heck, it's boring, I don't just know these people, but just sit there. <br /> <br /> The production is typical Chinese John Woo, a horrible video with explosive scenes. It just looks slightly better than Andy Lau's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a good movie.) You'd think with a decent budget they could at least look like 90s Hollywood. I didn't know the Chinese had this art house beatniks.
