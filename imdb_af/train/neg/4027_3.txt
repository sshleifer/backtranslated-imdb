It must be one of the most overlooked Spanish films in history. Its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it very childish, with only good / bad characters. The world is not like this, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, and so on. But what I hate most about this movie is Bola's friend's dad. The director is trying to teach us a good lesson: Tattoo artists with scooters are not always bad guys. They may be better than the average father (wow, it's like ... philosophy, or something). Thanks, Achero. I will introduce you to the Nobel Prize of Literature.
