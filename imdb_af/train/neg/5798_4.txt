This movie is a strange mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a sniff of film noir. It is basically a messy heap of different genres, none of which really works as it was supposed to. <br /> <br /> This movie is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to become more serious than an actor. He is a former child star who, at the beginning of his career, always had luck with happy comic and music productions. In this movie he chooses a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the movie). But his role is actually pretty laughable in the movie. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He is a very small, boyish looking man. He was actually in his 30s at the time of this movie, but he looks more like a 16-year-old. Hear him say babe for women and hear talking loudly to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he just looks and do not feel right. He is simply not convincing in his role. <br /> <br /> Because the movie mixes so many different genres, the story really feels like a messy one. Somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot line and one on how to live your dream, but nothing really works because of the rough approach and handling of everything. It's just not an interesting or compelling movie to watch. László Kardos is also a director who did only 10 movies in his lifetime, despite his career ranging from 1935 to 1957. He had to have been a struggling director who was difficult to find work in the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with. His movies are all unknown and usually not of high quality. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget it's a 50-movie, yet it feels more than a 40's or maybe even one of the 30's. This is, of course, mostly due to the fact that this movie is shot in black and white. Generally speaking, black and white films from the 1950s are often cheap to feel about and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> It's a weird face, as Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band act together in a row. It was not the only film that Armstrong appeared and he would often appear in these movies, often like himself. I think jazz enthusiasts can still enjoy watching this movie a bit because of its music, as there is quite a lot of it in this movie. The movie actually received an Oscar for Best Original Song. <br /> <br /> An uncomfortable little movie and trip from Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
