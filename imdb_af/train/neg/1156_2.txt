Looking at the tenants is an interesting experience for me. This is the first movie I have ever seen where I hurried through parts of the (not) action - and I can usually see anything from turgid action movies to Serbo Croatian indie and find them fascinating. <br /> <br /> The tenants are frustratingly slow and over-orchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is that there is a small realistic character dialogue, apart from the pieces where characters clash in a very structured environment. (To make this work, the film had to feel more conceptual, which it didn't do). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; everyone looks two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The worse of this is the character of Bill Spear, also known as Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very impractical. At one stage I even stopped the movie because I was so annoyed by the aggressive, violent and monotonous delivery of the character, the lack of any other personality layer, apart from the reactionary "on" switch (which after a while really predictable) ) and I wanted him desperately to have some redeeming qualities. However, one reason for this pot may be the sober time frame of the film (presumably 70s, it feels and looks more early noughties). If it was safer in the 70's, his character could be more understandable. <br /> <br /> Lighting the movie was also uncomfortable. All the way through, the soundtrack aims to provide a certain greasy, jazz-infused atmosphere that just didn't come down, mainly because the set was too well lit. <br /> <br /> The tenants, for me, are an amazing movie. It does not represent real people or suggest interesting ideas to think of race, identity or the life of a writer, whether white or black. <br /> <br /> Oddly, I got the feeling that this project needs David Lynch; His ominous, clastrophobic and obsessive appearance picked up both the actors and the writer in something remarkable.
