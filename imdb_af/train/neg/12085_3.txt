There really isn't much need to start this little review with a plot synopsis. I mean it's Shakespeare's Hamlet for goodness? probably one of the best-known plays ever written. I'm not ashamed to admit that I've come to this version of Hamlet as most people have on IMDb? by Mystery Science Theater 3000. Though the show might not be the best place to use to judge a movie, I can't imagine watching it without the comic quips. In a word, this German, made-to-TV version of Hamlet is sad. 152 minutes? Not at all! It's too dark and depressing to be something I want to spend almost three hours. I've said it a few times, but entertainment is the thing for me. And this wrist-slitter is far from entertaining. However, I'll give it a few points for what I felt was pretty good. A 3/10 sounds right over me. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoy from MST3K, their comments do not help to make Hamlet more enjoyable. There are some good riffs here and there, but generally Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is far too talky to give the comedy any rhythm or flow. As much as it hurts me, I need to give Hamlet 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
