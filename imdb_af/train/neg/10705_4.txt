Maverick cop with family problems and love to use his gun? Cheque! Isolated place with valuable object begging to be stolen ?? Cheque! Nice looking love interest ?? Cheque! Assorted band of silly cardboard gun perform villains with dodgy European accents ?? Cheque! German sounding bad guy played by an English actor with a bit of curly dialogue for every occasion? Cheque! Corny a liners ?? Look! <br /> <br /> Dear me, does this movie take the woe or what? The clich√©s come as thick and fast as an avalanche, and most of the role-players are just trying to get rid of just how bad the writing is! <br /> <br /> In a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to the video, just leave Die Hard. We have progressively denied all the usual action movements made on a mountain. We go along with some good old-fashioned violence and nudity being thrown in to stir up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is the policeman on the John McClane off, who even controlled the time for the old bad guy with gun, gag all his dots at one point. <br /> <In the midst of this mess, there are a few familiar recognizable faces of which I just need the cash and / or simply played it for the laugh, of the pointless opening scene that has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever no. The final indisputable conclusion is full of vicious dialogue and even rupee effec tions. <br /> <br /> Looking for these three quid from the Supermarket bargain effort at IMDb I'm surprised to find that this dud didn't create one but two successors, I need to find these jewels on DVD! The first successor seems to be a rip off of Under Siege 2 and the second successor, well know! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor who plays Jack changes with each movie and even changes the character's name to the third installment. <br /> <br /> However, blind buying of cheap DVDs just won't be. The same as studios do not dry up the material of this terrible quality !!
