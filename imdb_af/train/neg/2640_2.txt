Trying to think something as careless as THE CENTER will be pretty difficult. The problems are a lot. The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas dies as Pete Garrison, a secret service agent who took Reagan one during the attempted life. Years later, we find Pete dedicated to the Whitehouse family, mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady and a sudden threat to the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete completes a polygraphic test, he is identified as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). <br /> <br /> As the Presidential attempt unfolds, Pete finds himself in the running of his own people. His only confidant is the First Lady, and she is reluctant to tell anyone about their feelings for one another (therefore, Pete failed the polygraph in the first place). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he just trying to buy time until he can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the murder while walking out of the Secret Service? <br /> <br /> The one, big, overwhelming problem with this movie is that there is no reason for the reason for the presidential threat. Isn't that what the movie is going to talk about? One would think so! But the audience is never informed about why the killer wants to kill the Prez. Hmm. Somebody forgets to put it in writing somewhere? <br /> <br /> And what's with David Breckinridge's (Kiefer's) new partner, Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? Seems like she's been stuck in the movie as a piece of a $$ candy. What was her purpose again? Did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a low-blue blouse? <br /> <br /> There is so much trouble with The Sentinel's basic premise than laughing. The action is too easily stimulated by the "What the ...?" answers that are surely spoken by those who are unhappy enough to watch the movie.
