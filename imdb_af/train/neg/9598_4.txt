Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He is world-renowned as a beloved TV reporter. Less well-known, but equally trying, is his exploitation as a full-time filander. <br /> <br /> I saw Vivre pour Vivre in English titled 'Live for Life'. Some live! Robert always seems to have at least three women in his life: one on the way out, one on her way and the deceived woman at home. It helps that Robert is a liar. Among his most useful lies is, "I'll call you tomorrow," and "My work has been longer than planned." He spends a lot of time and money on aircraft, trains and hotel rooms for his follow-up of liaison. You wonder when this guy gets caught up with his pants. <br /> <br /> Some people may find his life exciting, but I thought it was boring. His companions, including his wife Catherine, are all attractive and popular women. But his lifestyle is so rushed and he is so deceptive, you wonder if he enjoys it all. <br /> <br /> Adding to the tide is considerable imagery that does not go beyond the plot. There are extensive sections without dialogue or dialogue in French and English. We see documentaries of wars, torture and troop training between the living action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is the leading exporter in this movie. She was the most interesting character and she played it perfectly. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can't fault Yves Montand's performance of what was basically an amoral bum. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Claude Lelouch's new techniques. In a hotel room scene, the camera pans around the room like Robert and his mistress remorse. We briefly see them during each pass around the room. In another scene sitting on a train's trailer, Robert is lying on the top floor while his wife is lying down. Robert gives his wife some important but disturbing news, but we only hear parts of it because of the stone of the train. I felt that his wife could not take every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The scenes of these scenes and those in Amsterdam were wonderful. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I call the project FIFTY: 50 Notable Films Forgotten Within 50 Years. As I can best determine, this movie, like the other forty-nine I have identified, is not on video, broadcasting or distributing in the US since its original release. It is, in my opinion, worthy of being made available again. <br /> <br />
