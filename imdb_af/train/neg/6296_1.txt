This movie looks interesting; I read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline fairly tightly. <br /> <br /> Starting to look at it and almost from the start it didn't meet expectations. In fact, I didn't bother to watch the whole thing ... quite drunk - bad performances, bad actors and instantly untouchable characters - that was the point of the movie, I think. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie left a bad taste in the mouth and put me down for the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Don't bother this feature.
