To revenge a film about a crippled ghost from outside the grave, cripple and lifeless, but here is an unmistakably incomprehensible combination of GASLIGHT (1939 & 1944) via LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); While still vigilant in itself, it is so clich√©-driven to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills. But thanks to the fierce penalties that the British film industry found in the late 1970s, even a mediocre manuscript such as this one of 10 stars could attract names - Cliff Robertson (as the nodding man), Jean Simmons (in the Jenny Agutter (as Robertson's artist half sister, Simon Ward (as the enigmatic driver), Ron Moody (as a poor doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (as Simmons best friend and Jayston's wife), Flora Robson ( as the housekeeper), David Tomlinson (as the notary Simmons want to read) and, especially surprisingly, Jack Warner (as tombstone sculptor) - although most of them have nothing, I'm sorry to say!
