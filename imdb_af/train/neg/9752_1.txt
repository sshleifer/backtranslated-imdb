I honestly can't believe what entertainment is now. Death (and fun of death), violence, sexual innuendo, adult threatening children, cruelty, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and fat people and kids sneaking off the house in the middle of the night - sounds like a children's movie to me - NOT !!! Add to that the dark and scary elements - a dead woman who is in possession of a home and in a house and her loving husband holds a prisoner for more than twenty years and also terrorizes an entire area - how nice for children. PARENTS - is it really what you want your children to look at - is that what you want to teach them about life? <br /> <br /> This movie is too scary for young kids, and I'm afraid teenagers can live some of this movie situation today - so why waste it in their faces? As for an adult audience - you won't find it scary or amusing - just boring, confronted and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - clueless parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters, and beer drinking / female boyfriends. What wonderful material for kids - does it really sound like a children's movie to anyone? Even the computer animation and good voice is not enough to leave this horrible movie. Save your money, save your time, and save your children's minds. Go Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - any of them is much better than this horrible movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - disgrace both of you to make such a disaster and then pay it as a child / family movie!
