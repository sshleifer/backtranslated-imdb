While the idea is more original than most Sci-Fi movies, performance is, as usual, lacking. While the practical mummy effects are not bad, and the "Gun Nut" character is over the giggle induction, the only true draw is to reunite Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin on the small screen. I suspect it was all the idea. They do the best they can with what they have, but the "must see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so, when Morena's character had some Tomb Raider styles shorts. I don't know the high-tech movie theater, but you can't deny the right beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin turns it up again as the man you love to hate. If you just want to watch some of your favorite Firefly characters, you have a good time with a few sub par materials, then it might be for you. If you want good acting and character development, it is advisable to look elsewhere.
