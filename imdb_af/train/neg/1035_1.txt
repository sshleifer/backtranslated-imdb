Horrible acting, horrible throws and cheap props. Would have been much better than this as an action parody style movie. What a waste. Start from the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The enemy" who called it "Action Movie" would have made it better. (which contributes to the parody effect). The policeman looks like a 60-year-old player, the blonde girl always has the same nice boring look on her face at all times. By the end of the film, he and her work together to pick up the bad guys. Every time they swap words, it feels like the cheap lines that are given in a porn movie before a sex scene. Horrible. Don't waste your time.
