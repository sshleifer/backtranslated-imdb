1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over-the-top rehash of 70's suspected horror flicks like Friday 13th (versions 1 through?). I can't think much of the salvation here, except (or can I think of something?)? The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were killed as a "tribute" to this, presumably. But look, one of the stupid people has connections with the real event, because her sister was one of those killed. (Again, how silly is that she would even be part of this). Guess what? The killer is back on it and we are cut off from the beginning who is (so there is some secret). And above all, where are the "policemen" and why does anyone call them. I can't believe this movie was financed and made by anyone. You would think that the American people will be a little higher now, at least in their movie experience, but not by this filmmaker.
