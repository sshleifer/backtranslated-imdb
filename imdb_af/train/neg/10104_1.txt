I only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a total piece of crap. The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever, but that's not true; The idiot that addressed this litter is the WORST director ever. <br /> <br /> The American policeman has a German accent! The "police station" was a desk in a warehouse with a police station hanging on the wall. There is a fist fight where the bumps are almost TEN FOOT. <br /> <br /> This police trains women, bends them and leads them to a warehouse. He tells his cop partner to wait in the car. Then he comes out of the warehouse with a duffel bag. The police spokesman may think that something is not right, that his partner may be a bad policeman who kills these women, but he is not sure if this is happening because he is a moron! The dialogue is completely stupid, the acting is terrible, and the characters work in the dumbest way I've ever seen on the screen. It is quite obvious to the police spokesman that he is kidnapping these women illegally and he is hitting them and packing them in a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffle bag with a body in it, and yet the measure is not everyone knows what happens! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a total hack. I stopped the movie for 30 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore. It must be one of the WORST movies I have ever started watching and I won't waste time writing it. <br /> <br /> Absolutely WATTERLESS.
