Sky Captain is probably the best horrible movie I've ever seen. Rife with incredible CG and special effects, littered with an A-list cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and the infinitely equal Giovanni Ribisi) and racing with an overused but Indiana Jones esquire story, it had to ' a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> "Must" be the key term here, of course. <br /> <br /> Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with a sharp accent and a lot over the shoulder, heart-melting smirks, but you can't make anything out of it, and even its flippant deliveries and boys' good looks can movie's stone dialogue does not save. (If he hit Giovanni Ribisi on the back and said, "Good boy, Dex," I just had another one. I crawled the whole man in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow, like Polly Perkins, is nothing short of as a nervous grid. Her nasal gnashes and non-sarcastic comments become old in the first ten minutes of the movie. Perhaps she has taken too much trouble playing the stereotypical 30-series heroic heroine - who knows? I expected more from her. An example of how a similar character was played (and played well) is in the late 90's movie "The Phantom", with Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent the movie and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the saving grace in the movie. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in the eye patch. I will admit it.) In a few short plays, both actors somehow rose above the tired material and produced a more resounding performance than their dry two-dimensional castmates. br /> <br /> The plot and steady story progress was old, boring and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from a action movie over the past thirty years. The pace is fast in the first half of the movie, and a snake speed in the second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess the ultimate conclusion of the movie, but to find out who the key person is. The couple are rather clicked, and Polly Perkins and Sky Captain believe again after a few years of separation from a bitter end-romance. Their story is not so much charming and eclectic, as it is annoying and mismatched. When they finally get their mutual feelings to the end of the movie, no one is surprised and nobody really cares. <br /> <br /> Props to the director to appreciate Bai Ling wearing her skintight vinyl for her. the whole movie, and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served throughout the color. But Sky Captain, despite all the essential elements to be a good movie, falls flat on his face. Not even worth the $ 2.75, I paid to come to the theater.
