I'd like to say that curiosity was the best of me. If I only see a trailer, I can tell the whole plot of the movie. I could have saved the most useless one and forty minutes in my whole life and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it's an embarrassment to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The movie shows a lively ignorance of reality. For example, this kid's remote control car goes around the area, and even enters this home. It's even covered with clothes. Isn't it rational to believe that remote control can no longer transmit a signal under these circumstances? Of course, Hollywood didn't believe it. General logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt if the race car could even reach the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. Why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they experience an eight-year-old? The child is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there's more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts his real gun down and "accidentally" picks up a plastic gun; He could not tell the difference. Even with a glove you have to do it. Just because they look the same doesn't mean anything; There are other senses than sight. The fall is also unrealistic; If one of them really worked, the criminals would be dead. But, Hollywood is planning to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the fall. I didn't laugh; I sigh and roll my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they've seen a very bad movie. The movie they saw looks like Citizen Kane compared to this one. Otherwise, save this one for your pride. Home Alone 3 also asks a question. We all know Alex D. Linz stars in the movie, but did he also write it?
