It's probably the worst excuse for television programming since, oh, I don't know, what's happening now? Nothing ever happened on this ridiculous "series". Although mostly shot by Britney and Kevin, you don't get good details in their personal lives. It is usually only those who make stupid, jokey talks and act like white trash. Look, I like Britney's music as much as the next babe, but this show is just a pure filler for a nation so addicted to Britney that they will see her clothes her scenes (yes, it can be a real episode be). Thank you, God, these two came up because they were FULLY sowing together. This show is TOXIC!
