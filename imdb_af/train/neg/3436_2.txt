A Meisie is realizing that a series rapist is staring at her. Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone are warm on his trail, but not hot enough because they get him after killing, rapes and eating a nipple from the girl. He was shot dead. One would hope it would be the end of the movie. Not because it's scary, but because the level of acting is frightening. Unfortunately, it is not the end and months later the rapist is raised as a zombie by a covenant of satanists. So he goes further where he is gone, with the detectives on the case again, this time a flying baby is also to him (don't ask). There are many good, very low-budget films (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty spring in mind), but this one scratches the bottom of the barrel. Frightening plays, crooks, special effects, lame attempt at comedy and oh yes, and the end also suck. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Cookie: Theresa Order is fully nude; Anne R.
