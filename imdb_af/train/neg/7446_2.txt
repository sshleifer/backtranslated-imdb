I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. He is the only valuable presence in this movie. But still, don't see this movie. Although he is good as the main villain, you don't want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I didn't care about the characters (except the boy) and in fact I didn't really care if the star came together or died. The movie didn't care for me, or believe that these people didn't care about each other at all. I read many "classic" novels after I saw the movies and this movie didn't even read me the book. The story looks so boring. But I can go on and read it to try and leave the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress that played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and she was much better at it. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E have fantastic movies of novels such as Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries like the Forsyte Saga. Go out, don't save Lorna Doone.
