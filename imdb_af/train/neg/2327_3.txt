This film comes straight from the dark moon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and happiness in the first half of the 90's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror films. The most famous disasters in their old age are "Subspecies", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". Neither of these is recommended and Dr. Mordrid is not. Hyperactive director Charles Band came to the right company for his film. Doctor Mordrid is incredibly stupid and cheesy and almost completely humorous. I just saw it because it's Jeffrey Combs stars. I learned that if you are a fan of him, it can have several disadvantages. For every good movie it looks like he has made 5 inferior children. Anyway, the story is about the battle between 2 ancient wizards. One good one that's been here for 150 years to protect the people (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and one evil one called Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I've already forgotten. Combinations get his mentor instructions. That "old" only consists of a few eyes in space. Very cheesy, that's it! Each time a blinding flash is displayed on the screen, but it's about the only form of special effects this movie has. The whole thing is just a bite and grab and when the two wizards finally face each other, it is over before you know it. I would have expected the wicked wizard to fight at least a little, but no. .. In some scenes, you can really find originality and creativity (such as Jeffrey's lecture on the influence of the moon on criminals) and if you really pay attention, you can even find very small but beautiful aspects (like the crow called Edgar Allen) But overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he shouldn't put on a stupid ass for that.
