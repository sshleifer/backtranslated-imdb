I recently discovered that Madeleine L'Engle's novel became a Disney movie and ordered the DVD. The book was my favorite when I was a kid and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> In spite of some of the children's actors who do not match the characters described in the novel, the Murry family is well thrown, With a nice (as well as) Meg in the middle and A Charles Wallace convincing as a kid's gorge without being annoying. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is promising enough, do a good job of determining the relationships between the main characters and setting the scene. Unfortunately, once the non-human characters appear, the adjustment begins to unravel and as soon as the children leave the earth, the whole thing falls apart. Alfre Woodward is too youthful and much to justify as the eccentric Mrs. Whatsit (think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead) and kate nelligan face are so masked and unspeakable, she must have visited the faye dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason, they make her wife. What looks like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz, when she was a good-looking Wicked Hitch of the West. <br /> <br /> In the end, what makes it worse is the terrible special effects and art direction. I understand it's a TV movie, but the CGI looks like something that could be done 15 years earlier. Mrs. Whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster, such as the Chewbacca suit for Aunt Beast, which is a velvety, elegant creature in the novel, rather than the ominous Big Foot shown here. I can go on, and almost every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there was not a big enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work has imagination and good judgment. <br /> <br /> It really needed the sense of wonder that Spielberg brought to his early films. What a shame that no one with the current popularity of children's literary fantasy series thought to adapt a Wrinkle in Time, and it follows up on the big screen, giving it the magnitude it deserves.
