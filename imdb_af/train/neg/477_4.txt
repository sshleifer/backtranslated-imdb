I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to pay, Warner Bros returned by throwing her into inferior projects for the rest of her contract. <br /> <br /> She decided to take the money. But her career has suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> It can explain what she does in "Comet Over Broadway." (Although it doesn't explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in it too.) "Ludicrous" is the word that others used for the plot of this movie, and it's right on the target. The murder trial. Her seedy vaudeville career. Her success in London. Her final scene with her daughter. No part logically leads to the next part. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes also look like B-movies. And her hair! Turner shows many and many of her movies this month. Look any other one and you will do yourself a favor.
