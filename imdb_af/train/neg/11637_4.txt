Your Boll has done the impossible: create a game fit that is at least true for the game; he changed a game of anti-social and offensive content into a movie full of anti-social and offensive content. So, as an adjustment, it's a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's still yours Boll we handle here, so don't expect the movie to be a good thing. while it does have the moment, "Postal" wears its welcome very quickly and it becomes painful to go through. <br /> <br /> In its core, Postal is a satire on the United States, as done by twelve. year old child. Boll seems to think that offense is linearly proportional to comic value: the more offensive, the more funny, and the more exaggerated the more funny. This leads to a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes, some gags work but they seem to be pure luck. High points include directing the satirist himself, and people are being hit hard by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include. Well, anything else. <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise, Post is simply a drill to watch. Yes, there is a good joke every good ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters who shoot and chase each other because it seems to be forever. <br /> <br /> It will probably work as a short movie, but it's just not enough content for anything that lasts longer than 90 minutes (though it feels twice as long). There are good ideas and good tries, but they are hopelessly lost in endless and useless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it's 4/10
