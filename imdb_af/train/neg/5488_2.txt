Why on earth is Colin Firth in this senseless movie? Is he really so trapped for cash? <br /> <br /> The movie isn't clear about what it's going to be, sad ?, exotic places? ghosts? A vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It's a confused, muddy mess. <br /> <br /> There is some idea that Italy should be good in itself, and that Italian offers something like language - but eventually the girls just want to go back to yankland. <br /> <br /> There are senseless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads - but what it's about, or why anyone just needs to care about, isn't clear. /> <br /> There was also a yank woman in the movie. It wasn't clear what was working here, but she was just there to make foolish, inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl. Was it supposed to be about pedophilia? <br /> <br /> A little awful mess, everything. I gave it 2 rather than 1 because it didn't have the charm of a completely horrible movie.
