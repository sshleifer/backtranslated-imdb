I am very unpolitically correct guy, so when I say sexistically, I really mean that it has reduced the female gas, Dr Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. in spite of all her supposed brilliance and self-control, nothing more, but a great, jealous unreasonable baby. You've already got the plot now. After her technical sidekick Marvik, also a stray lover, flip when he tried to kill the Medusan. , Ambassador Kollos, from a jealous rage, but first shone. (You think he could just fly into the room, shut his eyes and make the box too easy). He takes the business into a safe space outside the galaxy before the boys can suppress him. Well, the ship is in the limbo, at that stage they could go to the good lady liaison and discuss it. "Spock must report a thought to the Medusan so that we can come home. I mean, like going, do you want to continue until we're out of stock and die?" But the lady in the real Star Trek fashion is a jealous monster that is shaking and crying when the idea is broken, even when her Medusan idol has told her to stick together and go. So the exclamation, despite the mess with the spoken Spock, which caused him to forget to put on his visor, makes Spock foolish. Of course, Kirk figured out what a total twist she was and made her shameless to solve Spock with her superior telepathic powers. Of course, in the end, the woman and medusan leave and everything is forgiven. You almost wish the president of Battle Star Galactica hit the witch from a loudspeaker for her devastating stunt. But in Star Trek country, ladies are allowed to be completely unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time there is also sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist.
