There are no words to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply damages description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls entering the mouth of the victims, killing them or turning them into zombies. The whole thing is so wobbly that it's amazing. There is also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer speaks via a puppet !!!!!!!! I'm not doing these things. The computer also controls things like cars, although nothing is connected to the computer with the vehicle. <br /> <br /> The "movie" is total rubbish. Surreal bad trash. Spectacular, one-of-a-kind bad trash. There are many sex scenes thrown here and there, which are not very hot or erotic. There is even one scene where a woman apparently makes love or wants the French to kiss a tarantula, which made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. There, with the equally miserable direct-to-home video BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of what's going on.
