With a story and screenplay apparently written by a high school, the art of seduction fails to deliver a romantic, sophisticated experience that he himself tries to rectify. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female leads are "swinging singles (or in the female chief's case, engaged)", but "The Art of Temptation" doesn't even try. Due to an honest investigation of the personalities of these two characters, 'The Art of Seduction', nothing is frightened of substance for a base of thin, lean stereotype. <br /> <br /> "The art of seduction" is insulting - offensive to his characters, insulting men and women, and insulting the expectations of his audiences. It takes the awesome people we all know and play their painful interactions while expecting them to be destroyed. Ji-wan is an immature, spoiled, manipulative bitch. The viewer is expected to forgive her mistakes because she is beautiful. Min-June, well, he is exactly the same. Not nice people either. The "humor" in this film revolves around Ji-wan and Min-Jun's foreign efforts to address each other in the honorable art of lies and manipulation. No character development takes place, and we never learn why Ji-wan and Min-jun are like that. We are simply expected to take them as they are and do not ask questions - they are cute! And that's all that matters. The abundant references to the celebrity of the lead actors in the reviews of the cinema screens of the cinema spectacle can show you to 'Art of Seduction's shallowness'. <br /> <br /> If you're still in high school, like Grease, or you're a yellow fever, you might like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the "Romance" tag, it's not a very good date movie.
