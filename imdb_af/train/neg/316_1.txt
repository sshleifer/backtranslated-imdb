This movie is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to create a movie, you have to play the man Lars plays in heavyweights as if he didn't make the damn movie. I have to say that I could see in space 6 times in Leprechaun before I could watch the trailer for this POS movie. Adam Sandler should be restricted to this shame of any movie. Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and willing to put your dick in a blender. Anyone with half a brain will realize that this movie is not worth a thumb. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I gave it to Lorraina Bobbitt's support before buying this movie.
