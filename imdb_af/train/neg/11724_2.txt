I use Wesley Snipes's name as an idea to continue and look at a new, unmarried movie in which he appears. So now, for the first time, my Snipes method of movie recommendation failed. All in all. I had to come here first to see these reviews. Snipes should be ashamed to allow their miserable efforts to be so wasted in the Contractor. <br /> <br /> One of My Worst movie fears came to bitter fruit. I was afraid that the shaky, unambiguous, pseudo-documentary, 'unproven' directing and editing style (which was first brought to the attention of the Paul Greengrass-directed Bloody Sunday) could spread to other films. Greengass's sickness style was then brought to captivating new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy films. My fear came. In my opinion, these movies are really made bad by these motion sickness-inducing methods, which blur the error vaguely for "action improvement". But the "Bourne Franchise", as Greengrass loves so much, calls his cash cow, apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessionally in the search for fast, big money. Read my lips, your Hollywood types. Action should be clearly photographed and presented, not only by poor lazy cinematographic techniques indicated. <br /> <br /> And "The Contractor" goes as far as emulating "The Bourne Ultimatum" in inaccurate repeated sound bites. , hoping that their young (seemingly evaluated) audiences can't sense them. For example, if I had a police radio once, "Yankee-Romeo", I would just scream. The chances are good. I will never hear it again. I will definitely never see the contractor again. <br /> <br /> I recommend those of you who still need to see "The Contractor": just be content with the tranquility that this lack of life offers. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I'm tempted to lower it to a 1.
