For the first forty minutes, the Empire really forms itself: it looks like it's a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster movie. When I didn't know why, I thought it was good, but now I do it. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it is pure and totally unpleasant. I don't mind movies with psychos and things, for example to prove a point - for example, take Jackie Brown - but they are so terribly level in this, but of course it is for entertainment. You literally feel a knot in your stomach. Another major problem is the key. He's smothered, arrogant, but ironically, not so bad. He doesn't seem enough enough to be a drug-trafficking woman killer. The fact is, at the end of the day, this movie is completely pretentious. Not at all, not smart, just boring and meaningless - this colossal mess must be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * from ***** (1 out of 5)
