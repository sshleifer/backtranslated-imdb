It was really a very bad movie. I'm a big fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend here, Lamberto sometimes comes with a good one. I found the first two 'Demons' movies to be highly entertaining - they were so bad they were big, but this one is just as bad that it's really really bad. It is very boring, the story never goes nowhere and I hate the characters - the woman who hits a man and a little crying baby's pain in the *** wife made me angry, there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the Ogre was probably not the best actor in the whole movie. I turned it off about three quarters of the way, because I was very, very worn! Don't bother.
