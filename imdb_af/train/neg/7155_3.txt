I'm sorry, but I didn't like much of this document. I can think of a million ways, it could have been better. The people who made it clear have little imagination. The interviews are not very interesting and no real insight is offered. The visuals are also not compiled in a very informative manner. It's too bad because it's a movie that really earns spelling special features. One thing I will say is that Isabella Rosselini gets better, how older she gets. Even considering, it only gets a "4."
