Another British movie flag. Real refuse here again. I can't understand (and I'm British) why it was over the top, patriotic nonsense ever. Eight years notice you when the second world war actually ended! Other commentaries have been noted here about the editing and seemingly seamless use of archival material. It was extremely poorly observed. The archive material is abundant. Model planes swing from wires in the 'action scenes' like so many children's kites in the wind. The usual card room series tattoo the film to let us go so far throughout the Malta event. Guinness should have its worst acting performance ever. The shocking relapse dog fights scenes are laughing. Hawkins leads us all to death in the card room area. Ealing made very good movies. This is clearly not one of them. They had to stay away from such unconvincing rotting!
