I registered for IMDb to comment on this movie only. <br /> <br /> I just finished this movie, and the only thing that impressed me was that somehow I had the will to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst battles I've ever seen in a movie. Most of the swordsmen include the swords back and fourth to swing the sword and the opponent is not the same. <br /> <br /> Now, we have a very futuristic action movie with poor action, and virtually no sign of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies don't even have an action and show the developing relationship with the Princess and the boat / terrorist and his disturbed sister. The movie has several plot lines, and none of them is really worth appreciating. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem might have been watching the dub, which was pretty bad. The whole cast mumbled all their lines so it was difficult to follow what was going on. But I have the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said, the movie would not have been saved in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you heard it was a futuristic action / ninja movie, then you were wrong. That's what I thought when I heard it, and now I lost 90 minutes of my life. Don't let that happen to you. Steer well.
