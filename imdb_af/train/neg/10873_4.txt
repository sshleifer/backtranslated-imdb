Many people thought it was a good movie, but I disagree with them. At the beginning of the movie, a spaceship broke on the ground and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship, and then some people were killed on earth but for no reason. Also, it's in a dark forest, I can't see anything on the screen, I just can't hear the sound. <br /> <br /> After a few days the predator came to earth, but no one had it. previously sent him signals, he should not know what happened on earth, so there is a contradiction. Eventually the predator found the head of the aliens and killed it for no reason. He wasn't living on earth, he had nothing of his business about the things that happened here. Lastly, the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long, the summary is too short and the judges can't tell the story clearly. <br /> <br /> Finally, I don't think it's a good movie.
