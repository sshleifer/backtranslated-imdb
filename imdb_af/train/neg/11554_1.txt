This movie is an embarrassment for making movies. I can't believe it's even listed as a comedy - not funny. Not only was the writing horrible, but the decisive people had to be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but beyond ... 99 of the rest of the cast ... ouch. Pretty much everyone else ... wow it's hard to even ... wow. Here's the number one rule about the comedy. Don't try to be fun. There are many talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy. None of them were used in this movie. Canadian nepotism and decisive directors help ensure bad movies in Canada. I realize it's technically an American movie, but watch the director, actors, place, etc. I just saw it in Bravo - they have to be ashamed to have bought the rights to show this movie. Again, there are many good movies out there that can't get airtime and they show this crap.
