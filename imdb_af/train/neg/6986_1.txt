I can't portray Al Pacino. I watch him in Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I'm watching one of the best actors of the past thirty years. Then I see him in Two for the Money, Any Given Sunday and Revolution, and I wonder what the man thinks. <br /> <br /> A few days ago, I stumbled upon the Revolution and thought I'd invest the next two hours on it. Here's a News Flash: Want to get prisoners to talk? Forcing them to look over and over ... they will confess for anything. <br /> <br /> I won't repel the plot as there is no coherent plot, but it happens during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an untrained farmer who doesn't want to get involved, but eventually. While he has no money, no training and dresses like a caveman, a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him, without a clear reason, as they only have two minutes of conversation. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if "Al Smith" played in this movie, instead of "Al Pacino," it would have ruined their career. The screenplay was terrible, but Pacino's demotional performance and obvious false accent made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was laughable. I can't really describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character, but likes 5 lines in the movie. In fact, no one speaks much in this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most laughing points in the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this incredible talent to keep running on each other on the battlefield. It's like the whole of the Northeast, a Starbucks. "Hey, funny to see you here again, on another battlefield 100 miles away ... you see in a few months." <br /> <br /> I need to give this one star to IMDb as there is nothing. here for a negative score.
