This movie is easily the worst of the series. Although New Line might just look at sales, they all know the only reason why this one made more money than the one that was ahead because of its 3D end. It's not that the 3-D was good either, as it was 50's 3D with the red and blue lenses (anaglyph.) It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it looked like. In addition, this movie was done so badly! Bad writing, bad characters, bad acting, worse direction. This movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a "Looney Tunes" episode. <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for horror hearing, because it is stubborn and not scary, and not funny or not. amusing for comedy crowd. Just a total mess with a few very bad cameos still trying to play this whole thing as a camp and drop it, they have no more than they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember most of us who were fans of this series just prayed that it would end at this point because of how bad it got. This is one of the movies that helped to make horror popular and give a fool of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with a silly comedy than to see a good and scary scary movie.
