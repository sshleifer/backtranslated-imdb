Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please, never leave <br /> <br /> straight again. Timing, pacing, editing: all hopelessly wrong. <br /> <br /> Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, running the <br /> <br /> set) can't do anything to save this movie from amateurs like Alice <br /> < br /> Evans, and the kind of production standards you expect from <br /> <br /> teenage producers' shows on British TV. <br /> <br /> Biggest puzzle: the music. A point so inappropriate, inappropriate and <br /> <br /> unlike the tone of the movie one is seriously wondering if it is a case of sabotage. Add an acoustic that is apparently not marked from a single microphone <br /> <br />, and a director who only remembers repeatedly to screen out auditory action, and we <br /> <br / > has what has to be the biggest ratio of money to <br /> <br /> recent years.
