More of a mystery movie thrown in with some free horror elements; Moderate overall. <br /> <br /> It starts with a woman who has a nightmare in which her partner goes out of bed, goes into her crying child's room and kills it. She wakes up. Then the man dies in a hospital and spits up blood. His estranged daughter comes and he controls her by contacting her dreams, and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body dissolves completely in his grave. <br /> <br /> There is not too much mystery about who did this or even how; most viewers have long since invented it. I'm not sure the way he killed was really working. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the horror elements come through: a greedy autopsy, the repetitive dream of the man who kills the boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs gets in the eyes which then clips and several shots of the dissolving man, both in nightmares and actually in his grave. <br /> <br /> I was a bit surprised to see a commitment to the end by Fulci after Clive Barker! Interesting.
