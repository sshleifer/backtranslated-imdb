Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of the guys from the past who seems to be forgotten. I never thought his performance was so great. This is her one dimensional characterization of a crime boss, with many predictable results. If you drive the car and the general disappears, there is not much plot development or action. I find mafia movies dull because I have no respect or interest in ordinary criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, the Italian theater, treat these guys as heroes. I saw the movie and in a few days I won't remember much of it. Many shootings, innocent bystanders die, betrayal, and that sick loyalty. The film is fairly well-photographed and the acting is decent. But the dubbing is so bad (because of voices that just couldn't get out of those bodies), I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay.
