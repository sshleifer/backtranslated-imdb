This is the only movie I've seen made by Uwe Boll. I knew he was probably the worst director ever making movies based on video games. Also that "House of the Dead" is one of the IMDb bottom 100. I still wanted to see it because I'm a big fan of the game and I wanted to see what the movie is that makes it so bad. After watching it, I agreed that it was treasure, the movie had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brain running. For a moment I wondered if the zombies were brain dead. Or the girls are?) Then the zombies came out at night to the zombies and began to attack people began to shoot a woman. I mean it takes you one place and the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy? Or horror? or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up during the end credits so I couldn't see it, that's a good thing! The movie is a real insult to the classic game. Your Boll doesn't make movies anymore. Thank you!
