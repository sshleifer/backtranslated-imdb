The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horror movies of all time. This is the crappiest. When I sat down to see it, I actually thought how bad the fourth and fifth were, it would be good after the previous terrible. Boy, I was wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I watched the first ten minutes, I was really really asking to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it will improve. It didn't. <br /> <br /> Not only is it just a hidden movie in itself, it doesn't need a further sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) were already awful enough! Also, how often can you bring Freddy back! The action in it was TERRIBLE, the story line was predictable and crap and it also had errors. The way they made Springwood was just wrong. Pay no respect for the first one. To add to this, the whole thing really looked at the top of the top. <br /> <br /> Some people say this movie is "funny". This movie is not funny at all. Since then, Freddy Krueger has been supposed to be "funny"? I call it funny crap. This movie is supposed to be a horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, that information wouldn't follow as in the first one ?? The end was just stupid and cute, just like the rest. This one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. Just show yourself. <br /> <br /> Such a shame that Wes Craven created something so well in the beginning, but it must be towed because of the trash in the bin. They didn't even bother to make this movie. Neither of the others prosecuted, except the third. The third is the only decent one in all the successors. <br /> <br /> If it was a DVD on its own and was not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set I got, I would have eliminated it when I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A pathetic and poor attempt at a successor. <br /> <br /> - A complete MOCKERY of the first movie <br /> <br /> So please, don't waste your time on this worthless junk.
