My comment has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film. In fact, they are completely congruent with mine. What gets me is the fact that it is stupid in terms of a movie and without any confusion of story, motive or dialogue. Perhaps someone should tell Neal that lyrics of songs are being replaced that do not inspire anyone outside a stray audience. It is not the same as creating characters that are motivated to speak because of events created by the author or director. A stupid story remains as such despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way to a bar, throws a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way on the dance floor to mouth the words to Young's song to the heroine, what not aware of what happened. Somehow, these two dream a scheme where they will go on the West Coast in search of ????? Sorry Neal, loves music and leaves movie show to Steven Stills.
