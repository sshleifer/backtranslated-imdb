Ira Levin's Broadway smash comes to the screen with almost no meat on his legs, a mystery with just a few tricks and twists, but no one is caring. Frustrated writer Michael Caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and give it as his own; his devastating plan could include the murder of the talented child, who has Caine's brief husband in arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is ominously dead, with Caine doing all that an actor can do to stop the pacing. Dyan Cannon is mistaken for his wife (she is too clever and smart to be self-explanatory) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the film) looks extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer. These three characters, and Irene Worth's tough neighbor, are so undefined that what happens after the setup almost even records until the second action begins. Sidney Lumet's direction is solid and vague, the set design is unconvincing and poorly lit, and the final is a total disaster. The actors struggle to give the screenplay something, but with such thin material everything we see is their hard work. * 1/2 of ****
