There are no sprinklers here ... because there is no plot to spoil. Madchen Amick is living proof a face can make a living acting scene - no talent needed. The only light spot is some very good one-liners that Alice Krige delivered very well, but then she is Alice Krige. Her gentle dream-like voice gives the only hint of just how seductively dangerous these strange creatures can be. She is credibly creepy in this otherwise incredible plot. How they got her to accept this project remains a mystery. The scriptwriters had to have been medicated when submitting this script. It has great continuity problems, superficial stereotypical characters, leap formula writing, and is simple without making any sense what-ever. The creatures, while having neat skills, such as "dim", the question of where they come from and what they are, are never so much investigated. <br /> <br /> Don't waste any time on this one.
