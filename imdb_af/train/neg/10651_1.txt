Do you want to know the secret to making a slasher film done at a fitness job? Just push the movie out with beautiful ladies in a fast-paced workout and let them hit the floor and grind as they are at a gentleman's club. That's what the makers of this horrible slasher movie did and that little stink left me to the bitter end. This is the worst slasher movie I have ever seen, but every time I was ready to call the channel, they would add another scene to the workout girls and I would stay there. As a slasher movie, Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. As a showcase for beautiful girls working out, it's a success. Strong recommendation to avoid, unless the idea that half of the film is a great T&A show, appeals to you.
