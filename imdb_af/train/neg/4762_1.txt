I didn't know this movie before. The plot was terrible with huge gaps of missing information. The movie didn't feel the "fight of white" for me. The actors only flushed mockingly, and sometimes I caused my teeth to be pinched while drinking up and down. The plot was predictable, except for the stomach-addicted homo-erotic scene at the end (I'm not homophobic but physically sick to my stomach), even the end was predictable. And you can say the detective was Jude Law in a costume, everything from the false accent, terrible dental work, costume shop, hair color, everything pointed out that it is a disguise. The whole movie just felt like a mess of my life. This movie had the feeling of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as dolls and the house as the window to see the show.
