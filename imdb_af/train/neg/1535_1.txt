I don't think you can get much worse than that. Put together bad actors, fake limbs and three stupid stories and what do you get? This B-point pointless excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the play is just pathetic, especially if you have the 25-year-old grandmother with the usually grandma bun over the ears. Plus, the man is OK, but the woman is pretty ugly. "You look good!" NOT! The werewolf in this one was the best one in all three I want to say, but it's still not impressive because it was all the bad costume. The face on the woman later became decent enough for Halloween, but not for a werewolf effect. <br /> <br /> The more stories you go through the worse it gets. There are two lesbians in the next one who are completely delayed. The whole "I also want to be a werewolf." "How can you do this for me?!" Was stupid to say. You asked to get it now! The werewolf won't even be spoken ... it's a mess! <br /> <br /> The third one has no sense. Nearly forty-five minutes of running and boring narrative make this story out and the whole switch thing hasn't made it interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... who couldn't even hear parts, it was stupid. Animal effects were rotten or piggy, which was stupid. They couldn't use lion sounds? Don't think, good movies use it. Well, I = f you enjoy B prices, it's good for you. I have this movie since I was a hardcore werewolf fan and I will buy ANY werewolf and watch it once, but it's just me. If you're good, don't waste your money. I beg you!
