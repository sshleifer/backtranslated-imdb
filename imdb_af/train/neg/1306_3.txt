(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian TV, though shot in English and never intended to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS movies. It was supposed to be simply, THE OGRE, how director Lamberto Bava released it. <br /> <br /> An American family is renting an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has repeated dreams of herself as a girl going to the old wine cellar of this villa, experiencing a coconut-like structure hanging from the ceiling. It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect bones hanging from it. It drops which looks like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course, the man doesn't believe this. The villa is just old and cracked and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she just has to ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like a kind of 16th-century costume with what looks like a wolf head attached to it and it's attracted to the smell of orchids. <br /> <br /> The movies aren't really that bad and the dialogue is halfway intelligent, without the ridiculous awkward phrases that will bring dubbing. There are no real gores other than some skeletal rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern pool. The OGRE itself simply disappears after being transferred by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was flawed, with the picture black-and-white in half an hour in the movie, a mistake I hope Shriek has since rectified. Extras include a brief interview with Lamberto Bava, explaining how it wasn't a prosecution, etc. And so on with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases. It's pretty standard stuff. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
