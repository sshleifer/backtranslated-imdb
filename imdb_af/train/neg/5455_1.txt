See this piece of work at a film festival in CA. My God, how does the director think? Movie professors should use this film as a case study on what NOT to do if a short film is made. First, this project makes absolutely no sense. The movie takes place partly in "The Way Station", a blunt deadly bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> The play is bad. So bad in the fact that I almost thought it was a comedy. The main actress Julia Reading is a step below the stage in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner, but it's as if the director had no idea how to work or use his thespians. The only thing worse than the acting was the absurd dialogue. The author (which I also accept is also the director) writes every character as their audition for a comic book villain. <br /> <br /> Overall production value is pretty good, but being honest with a movie is bad. It's easy to think about. The production design is pretty good, although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar. The costumes and make-up are good, and I understand the production has worked with a low budget. It's just when the characters talk, or they are trying to push the plot forward, and the movie is scratched. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is terrible. It is as if the director / writer had watched many sci-fi movies and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and got through it. My only hope is that he used other people's money for it, because if he used his own, he was a total sucker.
