One of the people, "Why was it made?" movies. The romance is very difficult to swallow. It's one of those novels that suddenly "click" - they are in love. The film is filled with long breaks and awkward moments - the drive-in restaurant is the most striking. Charles Grodin does a credible job, but for most of the movie it is only he and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself, do you want to see Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with her neurosis for an hour and a half?
