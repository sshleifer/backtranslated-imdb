Back in my days as a usher "Private Lessons" played at the 4-plex I work. It was a sleeping place that sold out for a few weeks on Friday and Saturday night. I never came to see it, but saw that it was on cable last weekend, so I decided to give it a shot. What I saw for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable watching. <br /> <br /> The basic story is a teenage boy after his sexy girl (Sylvia Kristel). She also looks like an attraction to the boy, but for more sinister reasons. So we get screens from the boy who looks at her robe and invites her to look at him. And it goes from there. <br /> <br /> As a teenager, Eric Brown must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Its "scared" reactions every time Sylvia takes out a piece of clothing or when she touches him is terrible. I didn't laugh at this piece of junk a single time. <br /> <br /> And let's not start with the subplot of the maid and driver planning to print child money. Let's just say it involves the death of a death, burying a body .... I can go on and off, but it becomes more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The sex scene is the worst I've ever seen. Although Eric Brown was older, he looked, the fact was that he looked like a baby. He didn't seem to have a clue how to kiss a woman (if it does, I have to reconsider my criticism of Brown) and it just came too close to getting child pornography to be erotic. I've never been shut down by a sex scene, though. Crystal is very beautiful with and without clothes. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER WARNING ** I must mention the last scene. For me it is just sick, but I can remember that the audience is cheered when the film freeze frames and solved in credits. Our hero returns to school and starts a flirt with one of the female teachers. He asked her for dinner and she gave him a look as if Tom Cruise had just asked her. She nodded affirmatively and he walked away and smiled at the camera in triumph. GIVE ME A CHANCE! Yeah, I'm sure teachers all over the place will dare just for a striking teenage child. <br /> <br /> I will never understand the appeal this movie had in 1982. It was definitely more than the nudity, because there were lots of teen sex comedies with nudity bombarded at the box office. And to think that the same teenagers who cheered the movie 22 years ago are now working on corporate learning and possibly helping to manage this country. It's a terrible thought.
