This third Darkman was definitely better than the second one, but still worse than the original movie. What made this one better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy was changed and Durant was not brought back. Furthermore, there was actually an indication of character development when it came to the bad man's family and Darkman himself. This made my heart soft and I gave this movie as much as 4/10, that is, ** / *****.
