I have to admit that I did not complete this movie because it was so incredibly stupid and not worth watching. I watched it with a room full of children, who also didn't laugh at the stupid and rough humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitals that it dominates the real story I grew up. THIS IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE FOR CHILDREN! Apart from the fact that the content is so rough, the movie is just stupid, it has a bad flow and there is no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read the book when you were younger and loved, don't waste your time, look at a movie that makes it so bad it hurts you. Buy your kids the book earlier.
