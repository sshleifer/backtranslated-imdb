Now I love Bela Lugosi, don't get me wrong, he is one of the most interesting people to ever make a movie, but he definitely did his part in clunkers. It's just one of those. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays Dr.Lorenz, a doctor who has drawn his medical license for inexplicable reasons. However, he does experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful. It turns out she is 70-80 years old, but Lugosi looks in his mid-50's so why he is married to this old woman, it is never really explained. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these treatments or experiments involved, brides married on the altar married a kind of sweet smelling substance through which they went out, but it is thought to be dead. When Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on the way to the mortuary and bring it back to his lab where it is kept in some suspended animation or catatonic state. Then the stolen brides stepped a needle somewhere in their bodies, perhaps the neck, and then the needle in the body of Lugosi's wife brought her back to the youth and beauty. We never really see where Lugosi stuck the needle or what it is that he pulls out of the brides, but somehow restores his wife. Many ages scream with pain because Lugosi's wife screams a lot until his return to her younger state. Help Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie ... a weird old hag and her two malformed boys ... one boy is a big bunch, slow-acting fellow who likes to love the snoozing brides and the other boy is a common little dwarf .... small person, to be politically correct in today's world. At night, these three are just such a pile and sleep in Lugosi's dreary downstairs lab. Who these 3 are and how they came to be Lugosi's scared assistants, is like a lot of things in this movie, never explained. <br /> <br /> In any case, a female reporter is instructed by her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides go. She quickly retired. One common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid found on them. So she asks and is said to be a world-renowned orchid expert who is close, who is just the one who developed this particular orchid. This expert seems to be bad DrLorenz. She quickly discovers him and abandons his small house of horror. I'm not sure where the police were at this time, but they came to mop after the reporter had all the dirty work. <br /> <br /> It seems that Lugosi's movies always had a kind of unnecessary fool line that just stank the whole thing in heaven. I think a world-renowned orchid expert kidnapped brides through a baptized orchid that he himself is known to develop? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And then later it was revealed that the young ladies should not even be brides for the procedure to work, why would Lugosi abduct brides from heavy-duty churches for his experiments and already create the attention and newspaper headlines? Why not just grab a prostitute from the street like a normal weirdo pervert? This clunker reminds me of another Lugosi stinker, The Devil Bat ... The same dull plot lines and bad acting and the same stupid 'reporter gets a bad man' deal. <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he's creepy and sinister enough to keep you at least watching him. The woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor. She had no emotions at all. She delivered her lines just like a machine gun. , spray them out as fast as they can. Everybody else also blew a lot when it was good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing is vigilant, if only Bela Lugosi fans were. Hoposi was always so intense even when the photo was a dog. He had known he had done great pictures, but perhaps he also knew that if he had given it all, he could shine a bit of that intensity through all the bad plots and bad plays surrounding him. . <br /> <br /> And he was right - our horror fans will always love Bela Lugosi. He gave it to her every hour. He was in front of the camera. We give you two f ** k's for you, Bela.
