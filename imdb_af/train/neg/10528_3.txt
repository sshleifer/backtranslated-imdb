I chose this one because the music was done by Hans Zimmer, a client of Metasonix modular synths (made by someone dear to me). The fox art says "the 2003 version". <br /> <br /> I give it one point for a strong woman, one point for cheezy dialogue and one last point for me's light blue eyes, many of which are shots of. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see David MacCullum swimming (the pool has a plexiglass viewing window!) while his lady's love is being chased by a psycho in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were marginally impressive - they are rich people's homes in L.A. and Mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was. I wondered how they could stop cleaning with all the dust blowing around. The wind was not hard enough to be credible to me. I thought the animals' fur should be nasty on the furniture ... etc. and realize that the picture should be pretty boring if I wonder these things when the supposed plot unfolds. I stumble over things like why she lit a fire, blew the game, then threw the game into the fire?! Dumb things like that. It was at its best. Oh good. Robert Morely has some fun with his crazy character and a nice holiday from there.
