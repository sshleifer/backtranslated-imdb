Some people may consider this movie a piece of art - to express your imagination on film to make a movie filled with antagonistic pain and death. Personally, I think this movie is a disgrace, which never had to be released. . This movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a total waste of time, but it makes you sick for days to come. The terrifying images shown in the movie not only air you, but they keep you in mind and it takes days to forget them. Such a shame that people destroy their imagination on such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution.
