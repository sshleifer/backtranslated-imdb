When I was younger, I thought the first movie was really good in childhood, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some movies should not be prosecuted, because the first movie is usually the best, and that is. Actually, now that Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed outside the house, because they are worried about Ursula's sister (the octopus villain out of film), Morgana comes to her. When the child comes out, she asks Ursula's sister to change her into a mermaid, like her mother. That left Ariel back to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists, it's just the story that could have a little more thought. Sufficient!
