Paul Naschy made a large number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from pretty good to unwatchable trash; and unfortunately, horror rises from the grave are closer to the latter. The plot is just your average story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who was killed - but not before the curse on those who did it, etc. Etc. We then get a look and One thing leads to another, and soon the execution of the safe is not good again. The plot is slow, painfully boring and the film constantly feels useless. The characters cut out rules of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me, he must keep acting, because the dialogue is in the extreme, and only serve to make the film even more boring than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and the curse of the devil, offers a dull direction here. It likes the dialogue, does nothing to help the movie. Sometimes crap movies like this are a particular charm about them; but horror surges from the grave don't even have it. It's a painfully boring movie that has little or nothing in the way of interest.
