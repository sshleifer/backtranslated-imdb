I saw many, many movies from China and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst was 'Unknown Pleasures'. I watched 'Platform' last night and thought that Jia Zhang Ke's other two films should be better. Tonight I was disappointed again. I won't watch 'Xiao Wu' tonight, because I've put all three movies in the bin! Who needs this movie, 'Platform', ten out of ten, needs more cinema! Photography was very poor: it was very difficult to distinguish between characters due to lack of work. The storyline was so unfounded that I sent it quickly to the end of pure frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage any day. It's true masters of Chinese cinema, not pretentious men!
