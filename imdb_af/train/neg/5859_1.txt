Turkish movie has a big problem. Directors are not interested in global theater. They are local and folklore, but want to be international. This brings kitsch results like this movie. <br /> <br /> Film translated jokes into Spanish from Turkish and they have no meaning for non-Turkish audiences. Even for Turkish audiences after 10 years. <br /> <br /> Players, even Ferhan SENSOY, have a worse performance than average. They act like dolls. <br /> <br /> Film has been shot in Cuba, but nothing includes Cuba. Thus Cuba is considered a banana republic. <br /> <br /> Save money, waste of time.
