I may not have been the biggest Blair Hitch fan, but was well appreciated, so I'm looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown into several IMDb comments. "Unique", "intelligent", "a future cult classic" and so on ... you have to wonder where people get up to describe such a bad attempt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Altered is a poor, poor film that doesn't respect in any way. The folly is not funny. The horror and gore are not scary. And what a "thought" aspect that poor people in this movie saw was because of serious errors, because there is definitely nothing deep or clever about this mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so we know nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worth anyway? Unfortunately no. For starters, very poorly acting. It's not a piece to say that most B-movies nowadays function better. The storyline? Drilling and messing. Windows? Many amateurs actually do better. <br /> <br /> It's really the direction of puzzles. I didn't expect major improvements over Blair Witch, but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to be getting worse over time, totally unaware of past experiences. <br /> <br /> If there's a big mistake in Altered, it's the headset. A large part of the plot takes place in a single place, where the main characters are limited, but Sánchez did not give the place any personality. As the bush plays a major role in Blair Witch, it's so much a character (an opponent, if you like) than the three students, you think the director will realize that the same thing is needed. But no ... this place has no personality at all, due to messy direction and no attention to detail. <br /> <br /> There's nothing recyclable here. The hard fans of "Blair Witch" are better off with Daniel Myrick. Although its output is far from gold, it shows better structure than Sánchez and some of Blair Witch's lessons are applied (unfortunately, in poor stories but still).
