I went into this movie with expectations, of the hype, that it would be informative and uplifting. Definitely something more than a cheap promotion for the group "Wilco." <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a little joke and about the process, a dishonest and undoubtedly one-sided portrayal of one band member kicked out by the prime Donna lead singer / songwriter, a gut-wrenching confession by the fallen member's friend - like 18 years - and said the "friendship she walked", and this shiny, inexorable story of how one posters "hurt their feelings" by dumping them, just so that the group immediately 50 offers of other labels (oh, the tension ... not!) They tried their best to make it look like a strain, but I suspect it was all smokes and mirrors to create a tragedy that didn't existed. It does not even take the long rays into consideration, as we completely shift many of their latest songs without any storyline, insight or even a decent work on cinematography. The tense attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable view of life made me sick to look. <br /> <br /> This movie sounds like a bunch of nice babies crawling around to find a voice they don't have and think they're a kind of guardian of the art of music they definitely not. And I thought the music sucked, and I couldn't even understand the lyrics due to the mumble style of the lead singer. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10.
