Maybe I'm getting really old, but this one completely missed me and the old Funny Bone. Certainly something might be wrong with this Irishman (that's me, Schultz!). Lord, thank you for giving me the light! First, Phil Silvers manic energies, whites and rides were a great part of comic education and overall education in life, if desired. Although it is possible that the series, titled "JY MUST NOU RICH" for the first time (1955-59 *), got on the CBS TV network with someone else in the title role of Sgt. Bilko, it's very difficult to wear any other actor / comedian in the business wearing the sergeant's stripes. <br /> <br /> Such a strong identification is inevitable, but not the same kind of career wrecking typing of a nightmare that seems to be for other guys like Clayton More, George Reeves ("THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK"). <br /> <br /> A major hurdle to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950's TV screen to the 1990's Film audience is our collective memory. Without being sure about what percentage of the crowds remembered the Bilko character of the original and early syndication revivals, their numbers were surely significant; even a lot of the boys have seen Bilko reruns in recent times. It was clear that the new movie and the source were miles; or even light years apart. <br /> <br /> Not to look at a completely square old grouch, let's look at other points. <br /> <br /> Here today, the 14th day of November in the year of our Lord 2007, let me swear under oath and confirm that I have been a Steve Martin fan for almost 30 years. Furthermore, I enjoyed the welfare and talents of Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and that late Phil Hartman. After all, it was the talents of guys like this and so many others, Alumni of NBC; s Saturday Night and SECOND CITY TV laughing the last quarter of the 20th century. But an BILKO makes up again; Maybe it didn't click. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the movie was made as a Service Comedy (always liked them!), but without the Bilko Show names and it gave itself an identity, it would be more highly regarded by scary old guys like me. <br /> <br /> So, we've become so many sitcom and cartoon movies in movies lately, what's next? Howse about someone doing Hal Roach's Second World War series of sergeant DOUBLEDAY & AMES and TV's 1st Cartoon Series "CRUSADER RABBIT"? Remember where you first heard it! POODLE SCHNITZ!
