If it wasn't an immature believer idiot, I know I'm watching this documentary. I would never have seen this comedy! This movie is full of bad essay and ridiculous moments. One of the specials is where Afghan police / soldiers Don Larson arrest for filming in the streets while allowing the cameraman to film his arrest and then drive away, still filming, presumably to his beautiful hotel. Then there is the scene where a car gets stuck in another car that is turned upside down and parked on the side of the road without proof that it is in an accident or explosion. <br /> <br /> This is my surprise currently rating (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users had more sense.
