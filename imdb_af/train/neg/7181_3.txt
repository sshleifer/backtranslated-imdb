Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Christmas movies. I love her a wonderful life and I really enjoy the versions of a Santa Claus with George c. scott and alistair sim. but this particular movie is terrible. I think I love the live song the ghost of the Christmas present is especially painful. Albert Finney sings pretty well in Annie. I don't know what's wrong with him in this movie, but it sounds like someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils. The only thing that saved this movie for us was to quit the sound and see the dance numbers, accompanied by the South Park Christmas CD.
