I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think "The Wild Women of Wongo" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like cleaning your teeth with a bad dental hygienist. There is no plot. There is no logic. There is definitely no acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We don't wonder about anything. We don't know how people got where they got. It is always wonderful for me how things like this are even released. I agree with the previous author that it is not even funny. I know. It is about 90 minutes long and it will fill as much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paper weight. Or a bad painting you bought at a hungry artist's sale. It covers the crack in the wall.
