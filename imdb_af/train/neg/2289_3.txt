Unfortunately, Marry Harron decided to do a fictional version of Bettie Page's life with her own problems with men. If typical in all her work, every great male character is portrayed as weak, bumbling or twisted. To add to her fiction, she develops ideas and issues that aren't true, according to Bettie Page itself. Bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious problems (although she was born later in life, by the influence of her 3rd husband - a minister). She left it because she was in her late 30's, her acting career went nowhere and she felt she had lost her body. The tips of molestation and rape are invalid and are denied in Bettie's own words and are the director's efforts to claim that any woman who did what Bettie did was victimized by men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all of her shoots (not handed over to her by a sick fetish). Harron also doesn't make a point that Bunny Yeager, who did many well-known pictures of Bettie, also did very "naughty" shootings with Bettie and was not portraying the morally upright professional photographer in the movie. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie. Otherwise there are other movies and documentaries that are more accurate and honest for her life and the people in it.
