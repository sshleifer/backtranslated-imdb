This film relates to a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who moves her family and heads down to become colleagues. Cassie and her friends decided to go with a wild party one night with lots of drinking and dancing, and Cassie was traveling with her boyfriend she loved, but never told him she loved him. As Cassie managed, a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she couldn't avoid an accident and consequently there was a bloody loss of life with her boyfriend. Cassie gets very emotionally upset and has nightmares that cause her hallucinations over her boyfriend who comes back to life and meets men trying to kill her and she struggles to find out who her real friends are, who wants to kill her and will she survived the whole horror ordeal. Cassie dreams that she is made love by her boyfriend after he died and found another man in her bed and said she had asked him to love. It's a way out movie, and not at all good.
