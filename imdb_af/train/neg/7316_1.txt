When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn't expect much to start - for a second funny teenage horror movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely horrible. And it's generous. <br /> <br /> First, the decisive movie was terrible. You feel no sympathy for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was just waiting and hoping that the God-fearing thing would end. <br /> <br /> Second, there are points in the movie that have absolutely no connection with the plot. Can someone please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming "Pancakes !!!" on top of his lungs, while moving in Jackie Chan, I have never seen, and even more so with the man who has the virus? Why does the child's father continue to get angry with the virus-infected man, and go on a redneck hunting tree to get him? I had a feeling of so much confusion and total disbelief that I literally said aloud, "Where did hell come from?" <br /> <br /> I simply couldn't believe what I saw. I really thought I saw some bad movies, but I have to say Cabin Fever tops them all. This movie made me wake up and then puk again. Then my brain blows out. <br /> <br /> Please, save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Looking at grass might be a good alternative.
