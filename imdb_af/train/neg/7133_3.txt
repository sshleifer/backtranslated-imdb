I felt like I was watching the Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and some other plot. I'll say the cars in the movie are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, you'll probably find this movie generously entertaining. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from Days of our Life. She is a very good singer, but too bad they give her loads of songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would want on the radio here. Since it's a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a bit of a go, but in real life, I don't think any average Joe will overtake such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a car a car repair engine, and be a lead singer. It's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Another side note, one that is willing to win 25 million on a car race, is a note. But it was a bit cool at the end when Natasha stopped right in front of the finish line and screwed Michael. Priceless. <br /> <br /> FINAL DICTION: This movie is for the motorcycle freaks. So, if you like fast cars, I would recommend it.
