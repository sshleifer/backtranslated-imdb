This movie is what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The film apparently caused a reassurance among the critics in Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt to see a newbie director. Hardly a voice in discussing the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue). <br /> <br /> The main character's metamorphosis of good, but angry son after the evil rapist is virtually inconsistent, while the rape scene (an exaggerated, over-exaggerated rape scene of "A clockwork orange") is unbearable and I refuses to comment on his aesthetic values. There are a few things an artist should not do to achieve his / her goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To awaken it: shockingly brutal, rebellious and not your time. See instead of a clockwork orange or Le pianists.
