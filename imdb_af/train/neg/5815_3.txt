I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and printing it, but after watching it, I was very disappointed. Slums is a completely unfunny movie mixed with a Todd Solondz-type disturbing family reality, Todd's brand humor. The story coincides and every scene is worse than the last. Maybe I missed the point, but if this movie is an example of every girl's great experience, I'm happy to be a man.
