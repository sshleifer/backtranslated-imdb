It's almost the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've seen. I say a lot, because I also saw Soldier, in which he plays the villain ... but from what I heard, it is not considered a Jason Scott Lee movie. However, this is. And if it's an indication of the quality of such movies, I don't see any of the others. Lee is basically acceptable as a martial artist ... as the head, he's terrible. Every few minutes he gets a fight with random names, probably because the writer can't figure out how to extend the movie to the minimum required running time for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and apart from the fact that he is cynical, he hardly looks like a villain. The majority of the movie is Lee chasing the villain. Or maybe it's the other way around. I can't be sure ... and I definitely won't see it again to make sure. The consequences aren't quite terrible ... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill Hitler. Somehow, the movie also cuts the interesting idea. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The pacing is poor. I can't think of one of the positive things about this movie ... I really can't. It is simple to formulate and useless. If I just had a time machine, I could go back and prevent this movie from ever being made ... no, never to be. I hope so little fragile thoughts are exposed to this. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend it to Lee's fans and no one else. If you're looking for a quality movie ... well, that's not it. That's for sure. 10/01
