I was forced to watch this whole series of movies as a young child and I said they were real! Talk about child abuse. I would have been less of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this ridicule and who want to indoctrinate their children to believe the same. Besides the obvious problems associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there are also the bad plays, bad writing and BAD "special effects". They're just about terrible, horrible movies. Yes, credible (and frightening) to a child, but I can't imagine buying an adult in this cage. Although I have to say, I would be interested to see them today as an adult. They may feel a certain midnight / cult film.
