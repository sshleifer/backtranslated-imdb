I couldn't give this movie a bad review or bad review, for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller and there are a few disturbing elements that lean on the psychologist, which was something that could focus the film a little. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a story-telling night-time deejay who goes through personal issues: his lover moves out and Gabriel has a storyteller's block. One day he received and read a story written by a 14-year-old boy, Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered in the hands of his parents. He lives with his adopted mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and starts with a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland may not even exist. I won't go into detail, because I don't want to spoil the movie, but I'll tell you, it's pretty predictable. Fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances by Robin Williams and Toni Collette, which I thought was the movie's main character. Collette is without a doubt one of the most talented and lovable actresses. Her ability in the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very unpleasant and I hope to win her Oscar (hell, I think she can go to get a best supporting actress for this one as the script " a little better). The film starts out as a psychological thriller, but a predictable one. If you are curious to know the movie's end and turn, watch the movie otherwise I will rent another predictable thriller, "Hide and Seek".
