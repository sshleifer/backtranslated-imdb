I usually try to build reasonably well-criticized films, but I can't believe it has gone beyond the scripting stage. The dialogue is frightening, the acting is very dodgy, the accent is just awful, and the direction and pacing is at its best. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the last time I saw a movie, it's very bad. Joseph Fiennes, as he is, may have started his career as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> The island doctor Moreau wasn't worse than this garbage.
