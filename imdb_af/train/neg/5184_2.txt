I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but was disappointed at many levels. First of all, the story was reclaimed so badly as to make it almost unbearable. Secondly, the institution, acting and story are not very authentic or credible. Thirdly, there are many more good black actors to choose from than those standard recordings. How about some originality? Thirdly, there were very few Hip Hop songs played in full - if any. No secret really central. Overall film was a big disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and made the movie worthwhile.
