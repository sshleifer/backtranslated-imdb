Apart from recognizing some good cinematography, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The only real problem is the dilemma of the protagonist whether he should stay with his or her childhood in the world of misery or leave them and take up his own life. Abundant "emotionally powerful" scenes don't go along with this plot and because of bad acting, they also fail the intended atmosphere. The director only manages Anthony's dilemma and ultimately brings an easy solution. The characters don't seem to develop, although it's difficult to speak of characters ... maybe except Sonny. Except for him, the actors do not play much and when some of them come, they come down as self-sufficient amateurs. I wonder what the movie has ruined: the superficial writing, throwing away all the potential of the plot, or the bad play, which disturbs any appeal that may remain.
