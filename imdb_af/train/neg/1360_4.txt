A reasonable attempt is summarizing this movie. A good sixty movie but has no sense of achievement. Maggie Smith delivered a decent performance that was credible, but not as good as she could have, other actors were just scary! A horrible portrayal. It wasn't very funny and it didn't really reach its genres, because it wasn't very funny and it wasn't dramatic. The only genre that was achieved at a satisfactory level was romance. Target audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages. A very basic plot and a very basic storyline have not been drawn or executed and people are confused about why the movie was not so good and who the target audiences were. However, Maggie was very good and the storyline was Good with moments of ability. <br /> <br /> 4.
