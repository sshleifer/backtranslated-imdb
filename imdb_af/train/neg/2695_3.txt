When I go out to the video store to rent a movie, I usually trust IMDb's views on a movie and so far I've never rated a movie 7.0 or higher on the site I didn't enjoy. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really outraged here by making one of the biggest mistakes a movie maker can make: fill a movie with definite non-customizable characters with no actual redeeming features. <Br /> <br /> I like movies with flawed characters, but no matter how dark someone's personality is, we all have a little light in it, we're all shades of gray, with a little darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with completely unpathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke's Hank is a 30-something shiny, immature, irresponsible male child separated from a marriage to a woman who hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser, what he is a lot. His unashamedness and willingness to make others do dirty work for him because he is too lazy to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother being killed. By the time he is standing at the end of the film on his older brother, it is more pathetic than lifting. Ethan Hawke plays well with his character, but is not given much to work with, as he is portrayed as someone with a boot that is always stamped on their face. He is not particularly careful that it is there. <br /> <br /> To speak of whose character's wife is equally bad. About every single shot of the film she's in, she is verbally hired to hire him and the child supports money and continues to hone in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults. Seriously, it's just about all the character doing. Her resilient behavior borders on malicious. Albert Finney plays their father Charles, and while Mr. Finney has been a good actor for many decades, spending about 90% of this film with the same mouth. open midriffs on his face as he suffers from the world's worst bit constipation. For someone as long as Mr. Finney, an actor, thinks he would be more inclined to feel. Although he doesn't show much, his character is presumably sad and sad. And if he kills Andy at the movie's conclusion, it's similar to dr. Frankenstein to create the monster that he helped to create from his own misery. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei doesn't have much to do with her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and has a relationship with his brother for an incomprehensible reason. When Andy's world starts out of control, she jumps logically, but it doesn't make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the movie, but probably the one with the most common sense. br /> And finally we come to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, the only reason I rated this movie is a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of the heroin-addicted, black-out financial executive whose "perfect crime" of the robbery of his parents' insured jewelry shop is wrong is fascinating. His descent of calm master planner from a defective scheme to unstable, strangled murderousness is credible and tragic. Hoffman's character eventually becomes the main cork of the film, but it's hard to root against him, as the alternatives are an emotionally castrated petty cat and a father who was allowed to have poor early parenting led to his son his ultimate psychosis and indirect unintentional murder of his mother. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie is just worth watching for PSH's great performance and it's the family railroad nature. Don't just expect there will be characters to cheer about, because there really isn't.
