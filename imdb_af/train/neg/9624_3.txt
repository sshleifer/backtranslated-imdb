In light of the potential of this move, reality was disappointing. While it's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even that can't turn it around. Most of the action was predictable. The jokes were flat to be almost amusing. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to keep this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was hilarious in "There is something about Maria". Here it looks as if he is just going through the movements. If they had to lift plots of "Friends," they should know that something was wrong. The toilet noise had to remain in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> See "50 First Dates".
