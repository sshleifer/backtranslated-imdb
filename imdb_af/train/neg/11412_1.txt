This movie is so bad you can't imagine it. The acting is terrible, even worse than in the third class soap opera. It is a pity that this movie has been the most successful in Switzerland for the past 20 years. The interaction between the soldiers did not make sense at all. The story could be taken from a bravo photo story, the dialogues were like wood like Treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But nowadays it doesn't take much to satisfy the audience. The actors were beautiful, such as the former Miss. Switzerland and the main character were even hung (woah !!) and there was certainly a lot of abuse of drugs. It's really cool man! Especially for 12 and 13 year old teenagers. But the media has created an atmosphere that you have not allowed to reject the movie because they have manipulated peer group dynamics by implicitly saying that you are a nerd if you do not come with the other "sheep". exactly how it was when I was in the army / that's exactly what I'm going to do when I go to the army. For every huge action that had to be taken with drugs and coolness. And don't think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than cleaning the tough toilet with a toothbrush (which I had to force because I insulted a lieutenant). It is not necessary for each movie to be sophisticated. Sometimes you just want to spend a few hours and forget about problems and I think it's not bad. But these kinds of movies too much influence teens by showing them a cool lifestyle that is just stupid and changing them into mindless ignorance and egocentric idiots. But since I am not very popular now, I will now be silent and advise you to avoid this terrible movie at any cost and to save your mind! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
