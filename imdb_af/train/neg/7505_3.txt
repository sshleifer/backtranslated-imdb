This long wind movie seems to be less about Berkowitz and its impact on NYC, but more about the caricature of a certain group of Italian Americans, known locally as Guidos. The problem is that "Guidos" is uninteresting, no matter what kind of story or institution they are immersing. They are already lively caricatures, so Lee just reinforces them, rather than just portraying them. <br /> <br /> When someone did a caricature of themselves, they didn't go home and say, "Hey, let's make the ears and nose even bigger!" This is what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters in the film are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape the "Guido" style. Top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters, especially John Leguizamo's, and get a nice movie to fall asleep. Especially considering how long it lasts. <br /> <br /> Another strike against it: For someone who claims to be a Yankees fan and grew up in New York, Spike Lee needs to know how to spell Phil Rizzuto, which is spelled wrong in the closing credits.
