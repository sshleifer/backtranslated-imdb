A wonderful television mini-series completely destroyed by a 45-year-old woman who desperately tries to leave herself as a 16-year-old grace! No exaggeration - it's the ACTUAL age of the character Ali MacGraw played when the film opened just before the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. This TV mini series is really the most classic example of the title of this post and one that I refer to when the subject comes up. <br /> <br /> This alone makes it quite uncompromising, despite being one of the best filmed WWII 'global' dramas ever produced by TV. If you have the stomach - or a decent fast forward ability, you can enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed at some of the comments that refer to the love story (pun intended). Did they close the movie with their eyes? Or are they aging farmers who never cease to surprise me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision". I'm a Boomer myself, so don't think for a moment. I'm a hubris young punk. 45 ALWAYS ALWAYS IS 45. Get used to it. Handle it. Age gracefully damned. <br /> <br /> The Winds Of War could have been ... so good. How much more would we have talked about this mini-series about 25 years later, was a REAL grace cast in such an important and critical role? Right now, most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds of War are being eliminated.
