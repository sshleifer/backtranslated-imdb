Well ... scared, the original started in 1990 and I liked the movie quite a bit. However, they continued to make tremors II and III. Trust me, those movies started descending when they finished the first one, I mean, donkeys ??? Now, just God himself is able to answer the question "Why would they dive into another movie of this movie in God's name?" Tremors IV cannot be considered a bad movie. In fact, it cannot even be considered a feature of a bad movie, because it lives more than that. As I tried to put it, I noticed that my eyes were bleeding, and I was hoping the girl would crawl the ring through the TV and kill me. did they really think that the people who stared in the other movies dressed as coming from the Wild West would make the movie (with exactly the same events) better? Honestly, I would never suggest buying this movie, I mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
