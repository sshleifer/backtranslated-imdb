These 1919 to 1933 Germany hardly look like a Czech capital of World War II. Oh sorry, this is the Czech capital and that's 2003, how funny. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most horrible history movies in the past. Röhm is a head higher than Adolf and looks so well damned, Göring looks like 40 if he is only 23 and the "Führer" always looks like 56. And the buildings, people, even buildings are sometimes young. Especially in 1919 many homes in Germany were almost new (the WWI does not reach German cities!). No crumbling plaster! Then the Reichstags building. There have never been urban canyons around this building. And it may seem like a miracle to you: in the year 1933, the Great Berlin fire department owned many vehicles with engines, some even with rotatable ladders, but no one with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> One last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was it on the final row? For me, this was kind of "Adolf's Adventures in Wonderland"
