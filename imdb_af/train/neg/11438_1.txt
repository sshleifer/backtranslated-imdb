If there's ever a worse comedy than 'Gray Matters', I don't know. The New York Jewish Comedy's 'funny' premise is that brothers and sisters Sam & Gray are confused for a couple and so decide to settle with Sam with a girl, just to find that Gray is equally attracted to their target - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is gay is apparently just a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deep embarrassment by Moynahan and Graham, and a show that leaves bushes in the lurch because of Tom Cavanagh's forest. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will cut it off from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the domestic friend with lumpy insouciance. Only Alan Cumming comes with any credit, but is seriously employed and gives nothing to work. The entire disaster is killed by Graham's bizarre eyelashes that culminate in the penultimate scene where she wears a comedian hat and an overcoat, despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar. It is surprising that this film has ever been released and that it is not at all redeeming and should be avoided at all costs.
