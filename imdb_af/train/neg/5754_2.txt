I watched a mask in the 80's and it is currently on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember remembering that it was a little back in the day and also had some of the toys, but watch it make me tear. I never realized how boring and dirty this cartoon show really was. It's just awful! It is not as close to the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats, and is soon forgotten by almost everyone as soon as it ceases to be made. I just look at Fox Kids, because Ulysses 31 is coming straight ahead (that's when mask doesn't even let me sleep). One of the smaller 80's cartoons I hope to completely forget once it's finished with Fox Kids!
