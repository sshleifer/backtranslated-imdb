I'm very tolerant of very bad sci / fi and horror movies. I watched them as I was 4 or 5, so I saw some very bad things, but I'm talking about it. I even watched many SciFi Channel movies, so I don't know much to expect. A usually promising movie that has no end to talking. Hope goes on forever, I think - or the victory of hope of experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a dog from the start, and I knew it, but like a moth on the flame I thought something, anything interesting. That doesn't mean that. All the actors give a decent performance - given the script, I don't know how they all kept straight faces. It has something to do with collagen-enhanced worm parasite creatures that slowly take over the human race, one body at a time. There is an evil plastic surgeon working with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of people ... don't worry, he'll get what comes to him. The snail people themselves do not really know where they came from, they think they could have plunged a trip on a meteor landing on the earth, but ... they somehow know the mysterious kingdom among them - the snail princess has managed to breed with a person who knows she is the worm queen and loves her for herself. Oh, should I continue? Please, I beg you, don't waste 2 hours of your life. It would be better. Think of the worst, least pleasant way you can spend two hours. It would be better than that.
