Carlo Verdone has managed to combine fantastic comedy with clever and subtle social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened and he just became a dull "holier-as-you" director. <br /> <Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be summed up more or less in one line. "Worker class = sweet and hot, while upper class = snob and loose. But love wins in the end." <br /> <br /> Such a striking clich√® for such a clever director. <br /> <br /> There's not really much to talk about in the movie. Every character is a running stereotype: the self-made man who forgets his roots, but who will be good again, the weakened woman, the rebellious rich girl who falls to the honest but poor man. scarce average. <br /> <br /> Seriously disappointing under every aspect.
