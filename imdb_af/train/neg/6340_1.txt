This is the kind of movie I fear most. Arrogant and irresponsible, it offers a sketch of the Colombian conflict so divided and silly, it represents an insult to all Colombian people. The performances are godly, from Grisales (her mere scene is absolutely miserable), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (who looks straight from a Tim Burton nightmare), to Díaz, who made a significant effort to make life so give a character. -Dimensional, so clicked and so badly written is all he left to work with is a mustache. Not to mention the free end, a gore party is so cute that it will make Ed Wood cringe. It failed in all ways, cinematography, art, costumes, makeup, editing, and mostly directing, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a bad movie maker, but his previous films had at least some dignity. I can't say anything good about this waste of money, except that I hope Colombian filmmakers learn a lesson on honesty, integrity, and responsibility for this mean-planned fiasco.
