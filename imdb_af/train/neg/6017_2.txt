The only pleasant thing about this highly ridiculous movie is to guess that place. What Toronto landmark will hold for any American / international location. <br /> <br /> Who knew that the anti-christ would be Russian? of course he can't be Americans, as we need the yanks to save the day - o Buck ... you'll tell us the truth ... you'll show us the light ... and the way out of the building must those nasty anti-Christians get their way. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope they don't make one of these things! We should not have prayer.
