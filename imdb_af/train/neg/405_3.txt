This movie is worth watching if you enjoy miracle effects on special effects. There are some interesting footage. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is the typical nineties / aughties Hollywood show of blind without dust. True to the title. <br /> <br /> It's not worth dividing the story. It's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. There is not much to start with. It is nothing original and not very special. So don't go into the story at all. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, it eventually became a bit flashy, and the purity of the great FX treatment of an invisible (and sometimes semi-invisible) person diluted. But if you ignore the "standard" technology, it's a view to see (or not see). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a decent FX movie worth seeing and alone.
