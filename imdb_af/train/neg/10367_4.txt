This movie was poorly written, poorly performed and very predictable. It was very low budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to the video. It wasn't even campy fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1 / 2 hour back! The colors were horrible with the plot that has holes so big that you can drive a Mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> The plot itself has done the young bride what she couldn't do physically - what a stretch! Skip this movie and look something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie that is better than that. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
