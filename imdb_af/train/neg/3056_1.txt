Before I saw it, I saw some bad Christmas movies. But once I saw it, "Jingle All the Way" looks better than "The Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a nice movie about Santa helping some kids, but it almost feels demonic to see it. Santa's cute ho-ho-ho is being replaced by an evil, devilish laugh I have made, leaving many children from Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which suits all the performances and dialogue. Santa lives high above the Earth in the North Pole where he and children from around the world prepare for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch, or Satan. Pitch tries to destroy Santa's Christmas by making three boys naughty, and by creating distractions, such as moving the chimney and warming the doorknob. When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog, Santa's helper Pedro and Merlin are the wizard to get Santa out of this pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie, along with the fact that it's really bad, is so bizarre. Satan is dancing a lot and he looks much happier than Santa. Christmas talks about delivering gifts to all the boys and girls, but he only seems to deliver to 5 homes of children in Mexico. The reindeer is exciting toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm surprised it doesn't bring tears to the child's eyes. It's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are just Santa playing the organ while the kids are singing. Probably one of the strangest scenes is the Santa shooting range in the butt with a mini cannon and suddenly laughing while Pitch is in pain. I think parents are better off telling their little ones about where babies come from, than to show them. The only positive is that you will laugh hysterically if you can appreciate bad theater. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 min.
