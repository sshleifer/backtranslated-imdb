There are a lot of obvious hype related to this movie. Let's just look at it, but the main reasons anyone will see it are for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this movie. I am not saying they are not good actors, I say they bumped into this movie. The special effects were decent (and I would say the filmmakers did a good job making the ship eye-catching), but it even has several major flaws. For example, just before the ship goes down, you can see an unfinished blueprint behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love the story of the real Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was horrific - there is no reason any movie will be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of a biographical movie), and the writing and script were terribly quiet. <br /> <br /> I'd say the music might be better than I predicted (and not just the song My Heart). There is one scene that stands out for me when the ship sinks and barking bass music. It may well be the highlight of the movie. As for the mood, it was extremely boring. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, what I know could not be what the director planned. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I find it horrible that they flick the beautiful story of the Titanic in an over-hip chick.
