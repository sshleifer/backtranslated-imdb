I didn't know Willem Dafoe was so hard for money that he would scandalize him with such a shocking hustle and bustle in this monstrosity. Hell: I'll give that money I would send to Ethiopia if he was so desperate. I haven't seen such a pathetic and disgusting movie for a long time ... who paid for this? They either pull a little tax scam or insane. A 5-year-old will be ashamed of the plot, and I'd rather get cancer than sitting more than the hour I suffered. Everyone involved must be locked up in the sodomy wing of a third world prison for a year. Avoid at all costs. I give it minus 10 if possible ... incredible.
