(spoilers) Wow, this is a bad one. I did a double job when I watched the old Star Trek episode these days - it was the one where everyone got infected with that blemish and then some nuts - and Stewart Moss, also the unlikely 'hero' of It Lives at Night! He played the first crew member infected, who died of terminal depression. All I could think of was that he watched his own movie too much, that is what caused the depression. This movie is full of really unlikely people. There is no redeeming character in the movie, not one. It is very difficult to feel bad about dr. Beck's turn into a bat (or what he actually changed), because you just don't like him. And you don't like his shrill, bony woman, or the nasty, messy Sgt. Ward, or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest any time or energy in this movie? Where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no need to care for them. Not to mention the horrific filmography, which makes it seem like they have filmed the movie through urine, and the five cent-bat special effects, many of which were paper that was thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats. Not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but in the bottom ranks.
