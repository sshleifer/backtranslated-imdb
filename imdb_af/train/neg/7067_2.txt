Five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their terrible dreams while waiting to be picked up. But is there more to these nightmares than to the eye? <br /> <br /> Lucky me, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment has the worst in acting, special effects, makeup and music. And it was supposed to be scary? Hmm .. I think I was more freaked out during an episode of Teletubbies. I swear, you will be sitting there like me, bored that tears are waiting in vain for something interesting to happen. Don't bother. It never does. In fact, I even stopped sending the advertising quickly, as it was much better than the main feature. AND the end is the ultimate cop-out. Yes, nothing of this has ever happened. If only the same can be said for the day I set up my video recorder to record these cobblers. 2/10
