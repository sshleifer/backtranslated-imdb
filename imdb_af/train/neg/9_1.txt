This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It almost always rides a kind of excitement and drives a mess of them all. <br /> <br /> There is no single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was a memory and as far as it goes, there is nothing good to say, so I say nothing. I can honestly understand how this kind of nonsense is produced and actually released, someone thinks somewhere at some point: "Oh my God, it's really a little bit of cloth" and call it a day. The crap like this that people downloaded illegally looks like a completely different movie, at least if you downloaded it, you didn't waste your time or money. Don't waste your time, it's painful.
