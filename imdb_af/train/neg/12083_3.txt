Yay! ... I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion. This movie is as sterile as a surgeon's surgeon. For an environment, it has a few pillars, a few stone seats, a few stone crosses and a few stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a great piece of literature. The dubbing wasn't really that bad. The voices held on to the dull, gloomy, brave, life-sucking atmosphere that gave the movie. I saw this version of Hamlet at the amazing Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times I was about to turn off the TV, despite being MST 3K. <br /> <br /> Not an uplifting production of a drama so much better.
