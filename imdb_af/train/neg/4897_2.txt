This movie comes to me as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang. It harvested laziness from its frame. So I'm not going to analyze it properly either. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the premise is drought, why are we seeing landscapes with flower green trees? I wonder if it is supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the movie (in which thirst announces the urge for intimacy, and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex). Or it's just a matter of bad filmmaking, which doesn't make a damn coherent one. <br /> <br /> 2. We are not aware of what happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or suspected. It does not seem to be important, as long as the message of supreme alienation (= bombast) is delivered, but in retrospect her inactive body proves a cheap dramaturgical smile, an excuse ?? just as crazy and exploitation as the activity in which it is employed. <br /> <br /> 3. Nothing is expressed in this movie that Antonioni did not express better 40 years ago ?? and without unduly humiliating his actors. <br /> <br /> 4. The music numbers (reclaimed from 'The Hole') felt like a secondary school's idea of ​​artistic counter-contraption, performed on the skill level of secondary school. If that was the point, the point sucked.
