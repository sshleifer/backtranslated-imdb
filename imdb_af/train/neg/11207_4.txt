As a keen fan of the Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser, I was looking forward to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this movie was released for the first time. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment - so I left it alone for 20 years before I watch it again, but it wasn't the second time better. Mr. Fraser is a very talented writer, but I'm not a fan of his movie work with Richard Lester. The love for slapstick spoils 'The Three Musketeers' for me and the same money here. For me, the whole tone and feel of the movie is wrong. The Flashman books are incredibly funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has - he is involved in dangerous situations. It is transmitted in the novels, but not transmitted to film at all due to the comic style. This is a great shame because it could be a good movie if it was a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I first read that the book would be filmed, the report said the movie was to die for Oliver Reed. I was glad, because Reed was the hallmark of Flashman for me. How I would like to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit in with the visual image of Flashman created by the books (scraping it! Flashman is a great strap). Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the movie is that it is made as a comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills the Gautet (Tom Bell). A great shame, such as the production values, costumes, sets, etc., is excellent and the casting is generally excellent. Likewise, everyone in the movie is throwing good off Malcolm McDowell. Perhaps Richard Lester's directorship was responsible for the way the film was, as a recent radio adaptation of Flash For Freedom, adapted by Mr. Fraser, worked very well. Maybe one day we'll see Flashman doing right on the screen.
