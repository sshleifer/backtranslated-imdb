Eric Rohmer's "The Lady and the Duke" is based on the journals of an English aristocrat who lived by the French Revolution. But it is a stilted affair, with its odd, painted background and fashioned conversation. Usually, this portrait of terrorist age is almost entirely at one of the actual actions; One sees very few ordinary people in this movie, and little of the chaos, poverty and terror that unfolded from the drawing rooms of the persecuted, but spoiled, aristocratic classes. The result is often boring, and ultimately unexplainable about the forces that sometimes lead societies to the brink of destruction; It's a disappointing movie by a well-known director.
