I've seen this movie many times (and recently the book on which the movie is based) and every time I see it, I just want to slap all four of them. The fact that they don't give the impression that Tom Hank's character is flashing in his D&D (oops M & M) :) persona ("Oh, he only works in character.") Outside the gambling session. That and the fact that after three months of therapy we are destroying everything and feeding his delusions! These kinds of people are giving RPGs a bad name. <br /> <br /> Also the quirky 'love ball' and the music done by 'cat on a piano' and 'stop us from getting annoyed' are almost enough to put your teeth on the edge!
