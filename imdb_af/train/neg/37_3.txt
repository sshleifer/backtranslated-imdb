Devil Hunter became known to be on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it didn't really need it. Many movies on the list where there are only reasons for God (and DPP), and while it's not the bushes; There is not much here to write a ban ... it is a pity because I have never put it where it is not for the shopping list. The plot actually gives the movie a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal movies - and it follows an actress being kidnapped and pulled down into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but on the way he has to lead the native bravely by a man who calls himself "The Devil" (hence the title). The movie basically runs only eighty five minutes and there aren't really many scenes of interest. It is a real shame that Jess Franco has finally made films because the man clearly has talent; as seen through films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Fur, Faceless and His Death in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good movies are just jewels under heaps of shit and Devil Hunter is a lot of the shit. I just saw this movie because I can see everything on the DPP list (just two more to go!), And I guess that's why most other people saw it. But if you are not looking for Nasties; there really is no need to bother with this one.
