Something that doesn't really do with Al Gore's (and his supporters) theory is the whole thing about "consensus". <br /> <br /> If there is such a consensus, why is it that the "believers" in almighty global warming feel the indispensable need to bully someone they ask. <br /> <br /> Why is it that anyone who does not line up on global warming is accused of being stupid or on the payroll of oil companies (apparently a professional global warming researcher does not mean that you are on someone's payroll in that wonderful world.) Why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is completed, when it is the nature of science to honestly assume assumptions? For some ideas on the answer to the questions, read Prey through the well-known Oil Stooge Michael Crichton. Oh, he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies. He only had a great career risk not to enter the line of the Greens and other Kyoto worshipers and told the truth when he investigated it. By the way, did you know that compliance with the Kyoto Protocol would bring about virtually no temperature reduction, according to its own supporters? Just a few questions that Al Gore made sure to stay away so he doesn't get every cent of the environmental lobby, if he decides to run again. <br /> <br /> So who's a stooge ..?
