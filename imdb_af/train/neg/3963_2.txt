How many fricken times should we see a ghost walking in the background and boasting through the mirror's reflection? This was done in two dozen movies in recent memory and four dozen times in this shrewd, bad movie. There were only two freaky moments to appreciate .... when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of characters, the acting was as flat as the diet in the 64 oz. cup I pull it out. The side characters could be drawn from several Scooby Doo cartoons. There was the friendly elderly sheriff. There was the boiling weirdo who lived in the backwoods with the Alabama trek. Many characters without development. The most disturbing image was the beginning of a murdered child. But rather than investigating the child's murder, which would have been interesting, they just let us know that she was dead and her parents had a hard time reconciling her death to the community and to each other. When they came to the cabin, the screens rarely flowed ... with flashy images of the dead daughter injected here and there. Oh yes ... and the ominous sounds were too exaggerated. You know what I mean .... creaking doors that open themselves, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. Haven't seen it yet. Again, you will see the incredible self-opening door in the movie over and over again. NOTE TO DIRECTOR: A scary scene is just scary if it is not repeated every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think these things out before you exclaim "it's a wrap!"
