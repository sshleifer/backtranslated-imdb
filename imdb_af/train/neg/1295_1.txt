It's seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think another movie by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. I wanted to keep this movie - asano is a great actor and the storyline was extremely attractive. but I couldn't entertain anything about it. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts forever because nothing happens. and the effects the director used - such as the constant percussion and the excessive use of slow motion - only accompanied my increasing annoyance with the fact that the plot was so overloaded and the actors persuaded. much of the boredom was the result of extraordinarily unnecessary additions - like an hour we spent on Asano, Buddha's statues cut and declared nothing to worship. it did not contribute to the plot. a fellow Japanese movie buff and I both checked the time constantly. We couldn't believe this movie was as horrible as it was. and the final was terrible. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for the management to sit down, but unfortunately I was wrong.
