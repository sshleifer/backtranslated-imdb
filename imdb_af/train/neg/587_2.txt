This film distinguishes itself from the raging "wonder of the human body" documentary documents by brave, if it is bizarre, to provoke the disgust in the viewer. In one scene, the camera sits on a gigantic 50-foot sit-down as a teenager pussy and fluid squeezes out. In another, the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half consumed food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop from the esophagus and plop into the goo. In a final tour de force, the camera takes the viewer on a sad ride through a bunch of ... teenage armpit hair. Unfortunately I don't make it up. See this movie if you need to, but: bring your vomit bag and don't have pre-pasta salad.
