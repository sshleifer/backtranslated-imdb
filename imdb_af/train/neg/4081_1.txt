It's not the worst movie I've seen of Peter Greenaway, but it's close. The dishonesty goes to the worse pillow book. These three directors' films I saw were all miserable. Like The Cook ..., which also shows all the positive movie leaves, is completely indifferent to the aversion of its material and overall presentation.
