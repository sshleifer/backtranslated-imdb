A mediocre Sci-Fi channel's original picture. A little resentment, but not much. The nuclear powered submarine U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep under thick, icy ice near the North Pole, when attacked by giant super-charged electric eel. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) believes she has a way of communicating with the monsters, but is not given much chance. Also under the crew are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could have been a little better if the donkeys / monsters were not so cartoony.
