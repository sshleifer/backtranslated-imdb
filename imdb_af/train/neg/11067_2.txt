I'm a big fan of the real crime genre, but I couldn't sit through this turbulent piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was meant to be erotic, up to the porn soundtrack. There was no look at what Dahmer tick did, no exploration of who his victims were. Nothing but "See how creepy this man is." And I have to give the filmmakers so much - their Dahmer is the most beautiful thing to ever be ashamed of.
