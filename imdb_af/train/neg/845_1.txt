It's a pity that you can't vote zero stars on IMDb because I won't hesitate! In fact, I would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this movie and thought that because it has Michael Madsen in it, it might be fine ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine a movie length 'The Bold and the Beautiful'. Well, Primal Instinct didn't even come close to that stuff, and I previously thought there would be nothing worse than a movie length 'The Bold and the Beautiful'. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how can you do this for us? The worst part is, I didn't go a little forward. I was hoping it would end up being a kind of sick joke, thinking it would be funny to see such a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Where do I start ...? Direction - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Acting - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Makeup - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Editing - Zero Stars, Trailer - half a star, graphic design - half a star, DVD menu - half a star. <br /> <br /> But I think it's very important to see bad movies just so you know what a very bad movie is, so I'm happy to have seen this movie just so that I'm a bad movie. movie to put at the bottom of my list.
