And it falls entirely into the category of "awesomely bad" - ie a movie drunk student will hire to kick out. I was on the sci fi film festival and all I remember is a wave after the hilarious laughing wave, as this film is being portrayed. Other criticisms will describe the film's faecal nature better, and I felt so bad at the poor man of the production company that emerged, of course, to measure the audience's response. What he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student group, and after a "serious" anime movie, I think it was "sky blue", the audience was in a bleak mood, and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the islands. I'll show bullet on the worst parts; <br /> <br /> Script: The funniest and worst part of this movie, it sounds along a linear and predictable path with occasional ill-considered side. Rubbish, but extremely laughing. <br /> <br /> Animation: Poorly done, and compiled, if you can put backgrounds backgrounds and gradually skimpy costumes for the heroine (I know I can!), Dan watches for the montage where she's from a Swedish farmer girl in LADY DEATH !!! !!! Characters: One-dimensional she is painful, there is a short story (with pavements of dialogue) and some light is shining on the real motivation behind some main characters. <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, if you've heard a prisoner and lying around a few drinks (make sure they're alcoholic to relieve the pain), then this movie hits the DVD and get a "mystery science theater 3000" mindset. There is no other motivation to watch this movie, except to laugh at it and it is not meant to be a comedy. DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE. It may be even more boring to watch solo than 'New World' with Colin Farrell, as you don't have a laugh or a laugh in the mess.
