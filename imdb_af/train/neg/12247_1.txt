This movie is really awful. Terrible as it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life. Special effects are so terrible. The acting was not convincing. <br /> <br /> It's about a crocodile that attacks tourists, as they are filming a "blood-navigating" documentary. Blood is surfing when they are sharking, but it gets terribly wrong when a 31-foot crocodile breaks the holiday. The sharks don't really look like that. The crocodile is even worse, and it gets even more pathetic when they run away from the creature, but the crocodile gets stuck and two women flash it. The deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in on time. <br /> <br /> An inexorable, horrible movie, it's not worth seeing !!
