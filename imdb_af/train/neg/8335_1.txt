The package implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are taking a big bank robbery, but that's not what I got from it! I got nothing! In the first half there is a new character (without introduction) in every other scene. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just one long, annoying, subordinate background. There is always an annoying sound in the background whether it's a hard watch, a leaf siren, a train whistle or even the terrible score by Quincy Jones. There are many areas that are also bad. Like, the bad guys are chasing Beatty on thin ice with a car! Or the police arrive about fifteen times on the scene. I hated this movie!
