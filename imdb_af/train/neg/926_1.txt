This movie is about Tyrannus, a gladiator brought back from the dead to call Tyrannus, a gladiator to be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus, who teaches us about an hour, is also called Demonicus. It adds much needed depth to the screenplay and doubts our identity, psychology and ourselves assumptions. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Tyrannus achieves his small task list (which kills some people and says repetitive phrases in Latin delivery) by possessing the body of a college man. He uses a magical secret helmet to do this, which puts the fellow boy on his head and then on several points in the movie, takes off and puts on again. <br /> <br /> Maria performs oral sex On a poor man's Sean Willian Scott, and Tyrannus wears the Rollerball glove. Tyrannus has his own green background for no reason and apparently sat along CG fire in an old concrete tunnel for centuries. Full accident. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hurt you. See it.
