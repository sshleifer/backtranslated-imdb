Unlike most other comments on "Syriana" on the IMDb website, my family and I found that this movie on DVD was a total waste of time and space at home. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a movie based on a script whose author was far too clever. Rather than telling an intricate story in an intelligent and clear way, it is believed that it is mostly vague and difficult to connect 30-second vignettes of different story lines to a dozen or a story. The audience made a good and clear look. No, sir, don't. What this means for a good performance is total brightness, precision, plot and story lines - and characterizations - that have a beginning, middle and end. <br /> <br /> Similar to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant, this kind of movie performance is pretentious and inexorable. <br /> <br /> Thanks, then, for the TV and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British filmmakers of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director and actors knew the value of clear storytelling, dictation and acting mean something. <br /> <br /> This is one DVD that this family won't see again.
