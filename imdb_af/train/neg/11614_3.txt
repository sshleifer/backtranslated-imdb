The Lady in Cement is a true course on social anthropology of the late 60's. The writing, not the acting, is at the middle stage. Did I say - pure camp! Prepare to be offended if you are female or gay. Wide and lady are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day (camp-oriented). Most of the lines are thrown off, but there are some amazing performances by some outstanding characters. The action scenes are commonplace, but it's nice to see that Dan Blocker plays a tough man who likes bashing hard. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the perfect highlight of their careers. Surprising to note that they were both 28 years old and mr. Sinatra 53 was. The musical score waits. . . was there a score? Well, you get the point. Watch it with friends who want a good laugh. it is full of them.
