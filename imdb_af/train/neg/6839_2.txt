Twin brothers divorced at birth (Due to the death of their parents) reunited twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million dollar tunnel. Double Impact runs for two hours and basically does not add any real approach to the Corsican Brothers plot and Jean-Claude Van Damme, while sufficient if the evil twin brother is just embarrassing than the good twin brother. The action sequences are not that exciting this time either, and Jean-Claude relies more on firearms than on his martial arts. The support roll is also wasted and after two hours the movie is not boring. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (Bad)
