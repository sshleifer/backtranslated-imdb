Wow. I saw some very bad movies in my time, but this one really takes the cake. It's the worst movie I've seen in the past decade - no exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As an American military veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I almost found it impossible to even watch this ridiculous movie, because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely There was no attempt to get "authenticity" in the movie. Not as much as the smallest small piece. It seemed to be written by an 8-year-old child who has all his war (and soldier) concepts straight from comic books. The film was made in Honduras, which had to be an idea, but even that can't explain the horrible production values ​​of this cliché checkered piece of trash. <br /> <br /> I can try all the endless technical mistakes, but it will take almost forever. Of the ancient unit-shoulder patches not seen or worn since World War II, and the character's name tags, such as "ColCollins" (worn by the character "Colonel Collins"), which are actually spelled with the reverse mirror image "N" of the Russian alphabet (not the American alphabet) just goes on and off the list. The uniforms, the equipment, the plot, and especially the behavior of the characters themselves - each scene was just full of ridiculous bugs, inaccuracies, and totally bad records. <br /> <br /> Not the storyline itself And the characters were not least credible or credible. It was nice childish, in the extreme. It was, of course, a movie meant to have a strict appeal to pre-pubescent boys, and I have little doubt that even this film will be absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> In short, this film has absolutely no redeeming features at all. It's a total waste of time. I would strongly recommend that someone read it to pass this garbage; It's really not worth wasting a moment of your time.
