After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel inside, you're pretty convinced it will be a wonderful romantic comedy. Then the movie takes the worst. <br /> <br /> The warm feeling can still be there, but as others have said: The plot becomes so incredible and artificial that it is almost unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> The movie is accelerating and you get the impression that you are either moving forward fast or the producers have decided to fit it within 1h40m and cut out many scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not an end in itself, but as a viewer, I am quite convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic. It just doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, this movie has some nice interiors, and despite the bad writing, I think the actors are mostly good performances. If I could upgrade the first 25 minutes, I probably give it eight. As it is now, it gets a four. ... And that's nice! <br /> <br /> If you're a struggle for romantic comedies, you'll probably have a good time. If not, I recommend that you look at something else.
