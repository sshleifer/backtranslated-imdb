Where to start? How to describe best how terrible this movie is ??? <br /> <br /> Let's start with the campick humor. It's not very funny. Add a bunch of musicians due to actors - Bread is terrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Sorry poor Art Carney, who knew better than doing this movie. <br /> <br /> Then there's the plot. A roadie whose life purpose is to work on an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life's purpose is to be a Alice Cooper group. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, just when the movie has to end, they can't come with a more plausible last scene than a - well, I won't destroy it It's for you if you really want to see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who let you know that it will be a B movie or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them - and he has a more prominent role. This is a sure sign that the movie is unlikely to be very good. If nothing else, the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeding it by worse than poor ones. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it. This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. And no one is worse than Roadie.
