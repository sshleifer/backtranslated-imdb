Judy Holliday hit gold in 1950 with George Cukor's film version of "Born Yesterday" and since then her career has been trying to find material that is good enough to re-apply her. <br /> <br /> never happened. In "It should happen to you" (Holliday can't be a flapper yet), Holliday has another variation on the stupid blonde who may not be so stupid, but everything about this movie feels hot and half-hearted. Even Jack Lemmon, who I believe was his first film role, can't get enough energy to ease this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning, so mostly just sitting around waiting for the movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're interested in Holliday, you'll enjoy it. otherwise I will not bother. <br /> <br /> Degree: C
