I wouldn't recommend it unless you're interested in David Copperfield and want to complete the set. There are some good performances (eg Uriah Heep) and well-directed moments (for example, the beat), but overall it really does compare to the BBC version of 1999 as well as previous versions. <br /> <br /> There are inexplicable changes to the story that really do not serve any purpose except to be able to dip it down (the stolen jewelry is a matter of the point). The American role was poorly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she's wrong with Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is just slightly better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen for Mr. To play Micawber; However, he pours it too much, and becomes irritating. He also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond eccentric and becomes merely ominous. Anthony Andrews is threatening as Mr. Murdstone, but one almost expects him to wear a black cap and connects David's mother on a railway line (although perhaps partly due to Dickens). <br /> <br /> I got it for free at a newspaper. It helped to pass a Sunday afternoon, but I was more disappointed than I liked
