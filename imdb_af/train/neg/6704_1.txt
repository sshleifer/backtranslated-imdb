It's just a terrible "comedy" - it's really a bad movie. There are no funny elements. no jokes that are funny. I don't know how some people can claim this dull short film to "smartest" or "quality". Perhaps as the only movie you saw, can make the demands of the brothers. but I saw thousands of better movies: leonard part six (now it's funny)! I don't know how the brothers are even considered to be listed on the internet movie database: it's more like a home video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Aside from jokes, just keep this movie over. A root canal is more pleasing to these cliche rides unfunny material.
