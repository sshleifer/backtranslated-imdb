2 stars, and I'm generous. (Minor spoilers) Look, it's a low-budget zombie movie located in the Oakland Islands. As the plot goes, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie: what zombies? All the "zombies" do is growl (which doesn't even sound so scary) and drop fake red blood from their mouths! No scary eyes, no dilapidated flesh, just a lot of people who are pathetically growing and running around like idiots. <br /> <br /> The coverage is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the whole movie, so it's not as if the whole "hood" is being bothered with zombies or something, it's just a few, and it's in no time. <br /> <br /> The play is actually so bad it is hilarious. No one can perform in this movie (except perhaps one of the gang members) and it seems as if a lot of friends have come together, decide to throw their family and make a movie one weekend. <br /> <br /> Final note: since when doctors wear sweatshirts? Save this one, please!
