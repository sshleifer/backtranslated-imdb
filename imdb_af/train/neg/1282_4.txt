Here is one of those movies that is spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending. Conflicts that have stretched for years are settled in a few minutes. It would have been much more important to inject a tone of ambiguity. Talented Barbara Stanwyck is dissatisfied with a sudden metamorphosis of independent and assertive woman to an expectant woman of the kind she's been living throughout her life. Brent, as usual, is good about his head and then there is the ridiculous situation of Gig Young who plays a character called Gig Young. Someone calls "Gig Young" and then what appears but Gig Young, the actor! Worth to see, but far below what it could have been.
