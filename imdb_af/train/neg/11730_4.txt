Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (like Carl Kolchak) is back; This time he is "The Night Strangler". Again, the police and fellow journalists or the supernatural do not believe. Producer director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his previous "Night" with understandably less success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis plays a fun supporting role, including alumni George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis, "Dark Shadows". Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) heads up a sexy collection of belly dancers. And although I have never seen it before, it must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGavin's dinner party in an early scene, with unbelief in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** The Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
