Just a regular Jason Lee movie, there were parts of the movie that was funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I think. These are the types of movies I think 14-year-old girls watch at slumber parties. It was a real movie. It's kind of one of those movies you have in the background, and occasionally look for something to catch. I think Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and they would like to watch a movie with a good story and plot. His only kind of boy meets girl movie. This is the perfect movie they will show on comedy Central. I'm glad I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have been angry. But I think that's why I didn't see it in the theater.
