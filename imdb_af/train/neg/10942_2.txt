Lorenzo Lama's stars as Jack `Solider` Kelly is a former US veteran and an apostate policeman seeking and destroying mission to save his sister from backwoods to rednecks. Horrible movie is made so cheap and so bad that Ron Palillo is billed the third, but still has 3 minutes of screen time, and even that is not good. Altogether a horrible movie, but the screens with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell that are fired and thrown from a tree are worth a few (unintentional) rods. Followed by an improved successor.
