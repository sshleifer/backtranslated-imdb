I remember back when I was little when I was away at the camp and we would camp under the stars. There was always someone there who would have a good story to tell about what the forests that surround us, and they will always crawl me. Well, when I found Wendigo at the library, I checked it out and hoped to be one of those movies that had a supernatural being haunting people in the bush, like the stories told at the camp. Well, to my dismay, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when a family of three drives to their winter cabin, which looks like your usual suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and they walk in a deer. Well, it looks like the local rednecks are actually hunting this particular deer and are very upset about our city staff. The film spends far too much time on family activities in everyday activities, rather than getting to the point of filming. It was only over the last 15 minutes that we actually had an action with the "wendigo." My suggestion is that you stay this film very far away. It will leave you your hour and a half back.
