When it was released, I thought it was one of the most ominous movies ever made. But thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there were headlines worse, linguistically, than that .... but this is a very brutal attack on your ears. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but it has become ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I hear half a dozen uses of the Lord's name in vain, plus a myriad of f-words. I wonder how many people walked out of the theater to see it in 1990? I couldn't be the only one. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, some feature actors Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake included. Since this film, Stephen Lang has improved his image, at least playing the Divine "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and Generals". Long's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the movie and a character falling in love with a transvestite by the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Depression, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just a few of the adjectives people have used - even some liberal critics - in describing this story, which is even worse in novel painted. Of course, some of the well-known critics, all extreme Libs, praised the movie. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusting as well as virtually all paying people. It's amazing that someone can afford to get so dirty and dirty. <br /> <br /> Trust me: there are no good, good characters in this whole movie. It's an average, sick movie: one of the worst of the "modern era." This is, unless you like to see child abuse, drug abuse, teenage prostitutes, over and over - two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and only evil people. No thank you.
