Don't waste your time watching it! Unless you want to study it for all the wrong things, don't make a good movie. I'm not one who usually reviews a movie, but this one is personal. I wasted precious time that they could not return. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this shit. If it was a student project, I would not have to say badly, but only for the first 15 minutes ... then it becomes annoying. the scream, the bad sound, the bad video (a good camera man could have made it much better). and yes, what is the Blair Witch effect? no budget? I was hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Now how did hell deserve it 4? 2 is more fair but 1 to waste my time! I said my peace.
