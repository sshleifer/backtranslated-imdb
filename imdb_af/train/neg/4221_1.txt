Quite possibly. How Francis Veber, one of the best comedy directors in the world (at least when standing at his native France) succeeded in incorporating a movie so that it is completely incompatible, is beyond the reach of a mere mortal man to distinguish. It's not just that the characters are so unattractive or that the movie is so completely without the lowest form of white: it's really physically painful to watch, such an endless parade of inactive writing, acting and movie recording you can't believe not the work of experienced and talented filmmakers. For once, the perpetuity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before winking - and you'll miss - the theater release tells the whole story. What do they think?
