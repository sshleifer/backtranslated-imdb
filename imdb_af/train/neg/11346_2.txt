Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" in THIS ISLAND EARTH) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very thin, and once the Air Force friends return to the states with a Cobra curse on them, the action is just a watch game. See Faith the Serpent Woman and try to pretend that the rest doesn't happen.
