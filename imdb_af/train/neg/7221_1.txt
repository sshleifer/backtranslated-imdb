.... CAUSE IT IS POWER! The kind of movie that makes you want to go and make the movie maker and say "WHY?" Horrible camera work ... count the times the camera is trying to stay stable on one person and can't. The dialogue is ridiculous. The acting is comical. They seem to have taken over a ghost town in the west to see if they can make a movie at the least possible money. I want to bet $ 10 that they used home video cameras to make it. Either this, or most cameras were drunk. Truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie. If you ever want a "Worst Movie Party", bring this one. Want more fun ... staring at a wall.
