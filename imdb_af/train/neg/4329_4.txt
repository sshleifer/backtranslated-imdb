I will never forget the white and big comedy of the ORIGINAL Vacation movie! The lines, pacing and timing of events in that movie are outstanding! However, this European holiday successor is a major departure. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the Griswalds win a European holiday on a game. The problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than a soft, "ha-ha" layer. For example, a Flight Attendant on a plane asks Clark, "Do you want your Coke in the can?" Clark replied, "No, I'll have it here." It's really about the only line that is funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> The European holiday's humor is tense. As if the authors had borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, they tried to repeat a script previously done, and relied on a ridiculous hit-chase scene after the end of the picture just to kill time . /> <br /> Worse, the natural comics like Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie and the original kids who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie are nowhere to be found. Their substitutes aren't funny, can't act, and just look like they're going through most of the time. There are also some rough sex jokes and comments that aren't just funny, they are in a bad taste. <br /> <br /> The Griswald's had to stay in Wally World. The place they made legends! Don't join them in this European terrible adventure. Viewers need to look at the original holiday movie instead! You'll be glad you did.
