What is it? is a mish-mash of bizarre repetitive motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas, and openly racist music, among others) indifferent to any kind of story or plot or character development. The whole thing struck me as a "freak show", and I don't just mean the unusual decision making. It has the feeling of a bad acid journey, far beyond any level of drug use, one can ascribe to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I can compare to is Eraserhead (my second favorite movie of all time), which was deliberately much more depressed, but I still found What is it? a total waste of my time. It's one thing to give me a glimpse of the inner workings of somebody else's minds - even somebody else's chemically altered consciousness - but another to just throw strange visuals to me for the sake of strangeness.
