This movie is traditionally Bollywood fare as far as the strength, sentimentality and love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this movie was the makers' absurd idea of ​​surrogate mother. A whore that increases a child with someone after having sex with the man (of the family who desires a child) is not a surrogate mother. She is also not a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I watched Indian movies and television shows made 10-15 years ago, which treated this problem more intelligently. The whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely indescribable. I realize that most Bollywood movies aren't supposed to be, but they don't pretend to be. This movie wants us to emulate with the characters, but it can't be done with such a ridiculous, confronted conflict. I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan.
