I'm afraid I don't like much of this movie. Apart from a few savings, it's nothing to write home about. <br /> <br /> J-horror has risen over the past five or six years, but the films themselves have had recurring and carbon copies of a previous success on more than one account. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a supernatural slasher movie. The start is promising with cold scenes from a mortuary where a dead girl fucks her eyes graphically, but shortly afterwards they open. But after that it is fast down for this movie. <br /> <br /> To be good, I'll start with the things I like about "Gawi". On the positive side, the footage is gaudy and the movie looks good for its kind. For those who love their horror movies, there are some well-proven murder scenes. We also get some good tension features / pieces. <br /> <br /> However, there are quite a few drawbacks ... <br /> <br /> First of all, and my big complaint about This movie is that the plot jumps and jumps forward and backwards with a disturbing intensity. Usually it's not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same, no matter how old they are, I confused more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> The shows are good, I think a little hard to tell when you don't know the language), but look a little tight. And for a horror movie, I don't think it's scary enough. For a while I was really bored. <br /> <br /> As a fan of giallo movies, I expected a lot of the "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was disappointed.
