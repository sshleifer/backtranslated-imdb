This movie begins with a certain promise; but in my opinion it starts to lose if the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car is broken down. The fact that this well-meaning stranger fixes his car while he's gone is unreasonable enough, but being one of the few people in the country who can help him track his family's life is the type accidental start writers are warned against using their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this movie average at its best. Art education could have been much better, such as cinematography. The acting was good, and so was Eva van der Gucht's song.
