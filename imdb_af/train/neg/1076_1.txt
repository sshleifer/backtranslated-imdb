It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Branaugh had so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn't deliver his lines. The plot was definitely not worthy of John Grisham's name. No wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters. I didn't even look at the whole thing. I decided I didn't mind who did it, then I realized there was no "whodunit" to care about!
