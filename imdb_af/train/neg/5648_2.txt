Boston Legal turned its tail and headed for the barn door and the pig's tail! When this show took off for the first time in four seasons, it was a humorous blow to the legal system that all actors seem to be proud of. It was funny, diversified, and to some extent factual. The characters portrayed were acceptable and to some extent in their portrayals. The sexual commentary and activity was limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated in, but has now been dragged to the bottom depths of media programming of sex and violence. July is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois Is an excellent actor who, from the days of "Benson" to this production, kept his own in the field of entertainment, always showing the humor and respectful performance of the production. Captain Kirk "is". Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and is admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt in his acting ability, but he must return to his XXX origin like "Crash", as it seems that he has a lot of talent and inclination in that direction. We ask that this series be deleted as it is and it really starts to smell !!!
