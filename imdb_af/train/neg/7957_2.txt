Whoa. In the Twin Cities we have a station that shows a "Big Bad Movie" from Monday to Friday. Tonight's nugget was a movie with Carrie Fisher called "She's Back" about a very annoying woman who is eventually murdered when burglars break into her house. Bea (Beatrice) comes back to haunt her husband. She wants him to take revenge on her killers, so "she is back". And she won't let him rest until he does. She irritated him infinitely ... and the viewers too! This movie is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hey, I like bad movies, though (my favorite movie is Xanadu). I shook my head throughout the film and wondered who thought it would be a good idea for a movie. Bea is just as annoying. The plot is stupid; the acting is bad; the story ... well, you get my drift. Anyway, if you want to see a very bad movie - really very bad movie, look at this one. You won't be disappointed. Heh.
