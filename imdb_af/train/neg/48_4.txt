There are some nice shots in this movie, it captures the landscapes with such beautiful light. In fact, cinematography is probably the best asset. <br /> <br /> But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has lots of twists and turns in the plot, which look very interesting, there are no captions and key explosions are in Spanish revealed. Non-Spanish speakers will be a bit lost. <br /> <I had it as an Xmas gift as it is a family property to work through an actor's films, we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just fantastic at a time and the "The Newton Boys" I expressed that I wanted to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> But while it's on the DVD box, it's a Matthew Mconaughey movie and uses it as a marketing pack, it has a few lines and is on the screen Not for many minutes At the end of the movie, he is basically an extra and he does not lift the screen while he is on. ally, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Movie star Patrick McGaw, however, is very good and easy to see, and his character is just as nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he would be good at a ROM com written. <br /> <br /> So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance from those I've seen, I would recommend a time to kill, The Newton Boys "Frailty", "How To Get A Guy In 10 Days lost, "" Edtv "and" Amistad "and also avoid" Greater than life "and" Angels abroad ", unless you feel like a kid or have children around, since none of these points to his talent , but these are quite amusing movies for kids. MM is really nothing more than a supporting artist with just a few than any lines. <br /> <br /> As for Scorpion Springit's Not a bad movie, but it's not a screen stealing.
