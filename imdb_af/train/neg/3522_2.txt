If you like the standard Sly movie that involves the top action, amazing stunts (incredibly not meant to be complementary here) and a delayed dialogue. You will love this steaming heap of goat's milk. I have high expectations based on the trailer. I thought Stalone would be forced to make smarter people in his "has-bone" days and make an action movie that would put a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, institution and (credible) action will dominate. . I long for action that is at least close to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement of such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its consequences has made at least one scene ridiculous ridiculous. Judge Dredd is just better because you know that you are going to watch the theater, that you are going to make a comic book made in a movie. The character, setting and everything else is out of proportion to anything we can meet ourselves. Cliffhanger, on the other hand, turns a mountaineering guide into Rambo before you can say "Yo, Adrian!"
