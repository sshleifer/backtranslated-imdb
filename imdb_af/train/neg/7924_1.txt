Ted V. Mikels's film, Corpse Grinders 2, is 103 minutes of ominous film. The plot is almost a mix of relentless business mansions among people who feed corpses in cat food, while cat strangers, who lose a war with dog strangers, get some of this cat food. When I watched this movie, I started looking for any kind of distraction, anything to make myself do something else, except to lose my mind from within. <br /> <br /> Several scenes have long been turned on, if characters take forever to do simple things. I heard Mr. Don't use too many jumping cuts, afraid they'll confuse his audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid". Try as I please, I can't throw over the characters in the unnecessary giants, with the possible exception of the old men who are the caretakers of the factory. The majority of the role-players are a lot of non-talented amateurs who do not even learn the lyrics to Amazing Grace before they have to sing on the camera. Although perhaps the blame should go down to the poor sound quality, as I actually only heard 80% of the dialogue while watching the DVD. <br /> <br /> It's probably the worst movie ever to be shot. I listened to the comments of the comment, and Mr. Bigger comes down as a surprisingly nice old man, what hell did he make this kind of garbage? I would like to hear the statements of the old men who have to lay on a metal tape laid on a metal tape. Movies I've hated long ago suddenly look much better. I long for the intermittedly appropriate music of Excalibur, and the consistent lighting of Dawn of the Dead. I have to do something, anything. Don't see this movie.
