Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. What else can I say? Kate Jackson had to be desperate to direct. Perhaps she should go back to acting ... on the second thought that she was a bad actress. Who will bring in money to make something so bad. I like anti-Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the weird, but this one is just Bad Bad Bad. The acting by the stars was worse than finding a soap opera. The special effects, if you can call them, where ridiculous. I will not be surprised if you have played the plays slowly, you will see the tubes coming out of the shots. We only had to turn off the disk after 30 minutes. These so-called movie-movies must be destroyed, all chips and tapes destroyed and all the people involved in making the movie must repay money to the people who rented the movie. Then those people should never be allowed to do anything, either directly or film, but their own home movies.
