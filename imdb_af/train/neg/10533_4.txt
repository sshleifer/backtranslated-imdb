This version has moved a little slow for my taste and I think I have problems with this play to start with. But first the movie, it's a typical TV version of a play that doesn't have the flair of the original movie version with William Holden. What they couldn't afford to rent more than twelve people as extras? Why does the movie move until 1966? So can you give the little sister a line about the Vietnam war protest? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> As far as the casting is concerned, some hits hit some fog. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character, especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin, on the other hand, misses a lot of notes. He is credible as a former BMOC jock, but he does not have the raw sensuality of William Holden. I always thought Brolin looked a bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town a monkey over him (forgive the pun). Gretchen Moll was beautiful, but she was a little showy for the character she played. She did not project the innocence or ignorance that the character needed. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters. But then Holden was ten years old again. Bonnie Bedelia was quite forgetful because the mother and Mary Steenburgen didn't seem to play Blanche duBois or Katharine from "The Taming of The Shrew". <br /> <br /> Inge's play, I always felt that stories like this from a young woman who chose passion for practical skills always needed an epilogue. The Twilight Zone, which I believe, offers a probable epilogue to the episode Spur of the Moment, where a young Princess Hyland was chased by a bitter older Princess Hyland, because the younger Princess Hyland chose to go down with " a guy similar to Hal Carter.
