Yes, this can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleared the rubbish of their minds and turned up the worst comic, scary, Sc-Fi music game. If there is any acting, it's terrible or over the top. Special effects; choose you ... very low budget or nursery school. Every cheap clich√© idea is used. It is undoubtedly a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a trailer and start attacking humanity. San Diego is a great place to start. Scientists and an absent military must find the way to stop this red role. This cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
