- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something - <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie because it is about non-WWF wrestling and so I thought it could be funny. It wasn't. It is stupid to look. Embarrassing. Any and every opportunity for comedy is ruthlessly wasted. <br /> <br /> I admit I don't like Jack Black anyway. Then I hung my brain to think of a good role he did. The only thing I can come to where he or she was a required foil for the John Cusack character in High Fidelity. Jack Black is one of those terribly relentless flat-out ham-it-up knockout guys (like the little fat in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who have to say it is overwhelmingly idiotic, is not the same as funny. <br /> <br /> It's not even slapstick. It's just irritating. It's not even dumb, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I've also heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite, but if it's something to do, I won't be able to find it on DVD soon.
