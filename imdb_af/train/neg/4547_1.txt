The movie was TERRIBLE !!! Easily the worst movie I've seen in the past few years. One of those movies, I will be able to tell people for the next three years that this is the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for giving me the answer to the burning question. "What's the worst movie you've seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Trust me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie, but then they treated the audience as we received it. There is no story and the story that is there is mutilated by too much magic and coincidence. It is too bad for them to spell out the nine prophecies and not only weave them into a story that is entertaining. They didn't spend time on character development and it was easy not to care if any character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few who nailed up to the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is also very boring, but I enjoy the parallels that can be seen in everyday life while reading the book. The movie does not offer the same opportunity and I suggest you not see it if you want to keep the words of the book near your heart. Don't see this movie. Trust me.
