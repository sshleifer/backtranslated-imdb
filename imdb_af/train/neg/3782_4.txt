Here's the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visually amazing animated film in current home performance. The artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you take a look at this movie based on visual art. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad news. I really mean it when I say that the animation is the only thing this movie is about. You can remember that "Spirit" was badly hit by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person to argue that it was because Disney was more established and received better advertising could write me a four-page letter, "Why" Lilo and Stitch's Script Stink. <br /> <br /> For all the amazing new animation technology displayed in "Spirit", the story is almost * amazing * boring. There is a lesson here, and (unnecessary to say) it doesn't just apply to animated movies. You can have the most sensible visual effects ever to understand the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring, and more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's bad movie recording. As simple as that. The animation is still blowing; I just can't wait to see what someone with more imagination is doing with it.
