It doesn't really matter that Superman comic books are incredibly naive and their target is ten years old. Importantly, "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, a question for Your Dear Readers, how much of You actually believe that Superman will be defeated by bare Kevin Spacey? Anyone? Just as I thought. No spoilers here. Let's look at some important issues. <br /> <br /> First, this movie looks like commercial (scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is just a scene that seems to be). Imagine the commercial of Superman, two and a half hours long. Let's be serious, it's not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You actually feel that this movie is too long. And special effects aren't that special. <br /> <br /> Second, the scenario is stupid. Sometimes, even if something in comics is acceptable, in the movie it just looks silly. And this is so in this case. Of course, dialogues are disgraceful. I can't believe anyone took money to write it. How many times will we be fed with a villain who makes speeches? How many times will laws of physics be raped? (Jesus is not just the matter of Superman's power, but also a resistance of material with which he deals.) How many times will Lois Lane be seduced by Kent? How many times will Hollywood producers find a story in a trashy comic book? Since it's hard to make a good story, why do you have a bad story for a starter? It just doesn't work. Boys, get a grip. Try harder, please. Or always stay for this strike, who cares. I have the feeling that WGA stops permanently. No offense. I do not question the money the people pay, but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case there is no quality at all. (At this stage you can ask yourself: is it so bad? Yes, it is.) Thirdly, the play is poor, which is quite a surprise, as Bryan Singer (Ordinary Suspect) directs. Kevin Spacey has fun, but he's the only one. Rather, the public is not in the mood for jokes. Thing is that the comic book hero can be developed into true personality, with clear motivation, but also with doubt, fears, a degree of depth. In this case no one did that job, and characters aren't really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole effort of creators parody this movie. The second unit is so bad that attention is given, since nothing interesting is happening on the screen anyway. The harder they try (if they try), how funny it gets (but it's not laughing you can expect). <br /> <br /> Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular movie, ladies and gentlemen, is camp. Don't waste your time and don't waste your money either. Stay at home, read a book.
