This is the worst imaginable crap. The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very entertaining and dramatic. The makers of this worthless movie do not follow it now. Well, old novels are not sacred and making free versions of them is good to me if you have ideas of your own. If all you can do is change things and replace them with uninteresting and watered-down clich√©s, keep the original one. If they did, this movie would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed in a studio, with cardboard huts. Outside there is no imagination, just fatigue. It should only be bought or watched by collectors of Victorian novels made in movies. <br /> <br /> Just a hint, not a trainer, I think, to understand those of you who have read the novel. and what to expect if you decide to watch it on TV or - God forbid - wasting money to buy it. Gagool an old bath witch in the book and a predecessor of Gollum has changed into a nice gall!
