I give this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. this movie was terrible. It was very hard acting, the story was badly written, the action was incredible. I even doubt that the Salvation Army can fight as badly as the troops did in this movie. I won't even write plots because the movie is just not good enough for plots. Writing comments on the plot would be senseless. If I were to compare this movie, I would have to compare it with the King of Fire, although I didn't like the King of Fire, that movie was at least better than this. <br /> <br /> Some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even half finished. The only reason I didn't do it was because I simply didn't think to do it. I was hoping for a festival of CGI and fighting masterfully, but that's not what happened. The martial arts have been running for 30 seconds and it was very disappointing from a practice routine that was done during the playback scene. The CGI was also not well done. One scene occurs. During one of the earlier tank fights, the troops waved away at ... nothing. Someone forgot to visit the animation guys on the little movie so the street was completely without bad guys. I also think the bad man's voice was mentioned by Imotep's voice-over from The Mummy movies. Got that same thing going on. (Someone owes a few royalties, here?) Since I mentioned the battle scene, I will say what can be considered a spoiler, but only for the purists I suppose. <br /> <br /> Don't see it, don't buy the DVD if it doesn't. You're warned.
