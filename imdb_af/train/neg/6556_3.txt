I bought it on DVD for my brother who is a great Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to look it myself earlier this week. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty entertaining piece that contains two completely separate story lines. The division with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who had very short unfinished relationships. She literally bumps Brian Kerwin (a regular married guy with Kids) after driving her car in the back of his car. After being hostile to each other, he offered her home to run, as she no longer felt comfortable driving. Romance eventually develops into a tragedy when its wife finds out. What was happening at the end was not prepared, but the slow pace and routine TV direction took a plunge from the plot. <br /> <br /> The other section includes an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better role with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss, but in the end when asked to resign, they all realize that their careers are nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> It's over time, but it's not that interesting and I'm glad it wasn't bought for me. I'm not a Michelle Pffeifer fan, but she was probably the only actor worth watching in this movie and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. Although unless you are a fan of her, avoid it if it is very routine.
