The movie stays too long. Very little is explained as the film progresses, with consequently many strange series that have a deeper meaning, but due to the way of narration it just becomes strange and not understandable to look at. It forces you to see the movie again, but I'm not going to do it. I watched this movie this morning. I'm sure I would sleep that night at night. For me, the movie was like a poor man's "Blade Runner". <br /> <br /> The movie leaves far too many questions and unlikely. This makes the movie a useless and unceasing impression. <br /> <br /> Also, the strange appearance of the movie doesn't help much. The movie is half CGI / halving real life, but it's not made halfway as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative, as in later movies like Sin City and 300. They even have half the characters of the movie created a computer that looked like a very senseless and strange choice, considering that the character animation didn't look too impressive. The futuristic environment is still beautiful and the movie was of course not cheap to make its style over dust and in this case it is not really a positive thing to say. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines are also absolutely terrible and uninteresting. The chief God of the movie constantly says lines like; "I'm going to do it, but it's not your concern why I want to do it." Don't say anything, Mr. Horus! It's annoying and very easy to put in a movie, if you don't mind explaining anything about the plot. The deepest questions and meanings of the movie are also stunned by the movie and its screenplay. <br /> <br /> The actors still did their best. They seemed to have believed in the project and were convinced that what they had made would be something special. That's why I can't say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> The story and movie are far from the original. It rip-offs a lot of classic and semi-classic, mostly modern, science-fiction movies. Perhaps this is also the reason why the movie made a lot of excess impression on me. <br /> <br /> A failed and uninteresting movie experiment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
