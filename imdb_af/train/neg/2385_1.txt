I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd try their sister, Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry to test it out. She was embarrasing and the movie just had this strange plot as it is what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet that both sleep with this old man in the mountains, what's up? I have never been so dissatisfied with my life. It was just total refuse. I can't believe the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. Sissy became "pretty", didn't find me. I thought she was all but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHAT IS THE POINT ??? 0 out of 10, shame that the poll doesn't have a 0, doesn't even earn a 1. Hopefully, Rain is better in other movies, I forgive her for this one performance, I mean I wouldn't be much better with that movie do not.
