The film confuses religious ethics and ideas so much that it cannot create coherent arguments against the death penalty at any level. By presenting the legal execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity, the film elevates an older killer to the status of martyr to Christ. Somehow, according to the plot, God is furious that society has chosen to make it himself from a fanatic who killed his own parents by burning them while they slept in their beds relentlessly. Yet this same god has no indignation for the actions of the murderer. The main character, a non-religious pregnant suicide woman, eventually gives up her own life in a challenging but unbeatable effort to save this convicted killer without success. In other threads of the underdeveloped plot Jesus returns as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of God. The modern shining incarnation of Christ not only influences him, but also the Messianic ideal of all religions. He is incapable of influencing humanity for good and unmotivated skateboarding of life and waiting for man to destroy it himself. Meanwhile, the mentally unstable pregnant woman, with little help from Jesus, finds the ability to remind herself in her newborn, jealous child who somehow saves all mankind from the wrath of the almighty. I also interpreted it as a statement to support abortion at certain levels. This movie, which attempts to excite many religious themes, fails to make any religious point that I can clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs. This raises many questions that never even try to answer them. It ignores the religious values ​​of his audience while trying to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment. stupid
