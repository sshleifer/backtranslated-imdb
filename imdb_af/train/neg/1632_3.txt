An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), As a hottie Charles Bronson, walks around and weakens the 'scum' that her parents, grandparents or grandmother overcome, and impress young men with her karate skills. In a central scene she enters into a rape and a moron police throws her in jail. After a few cool showers and a few abortive prison robbery she has to blow the law in her own hands blah blah blah. I think there were many movies like this? The writing is thinner than usual if you can believe it. Mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that will work her own Death Wish starring, and I find that kind of sporadic, but the movie is an ominous device. Competent actors will have been at stake here and will actively undermine the fantastic, incompetent DA and a judge who is the producer's uncle.
