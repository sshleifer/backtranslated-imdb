See a picture of a man attacked by zombies, and I hope Lucio "Zombi" Fulci can be his old tricks. Unfortunately, in addition to the close ups of a rotting body, little in this story of the murder of a rich man and his daughter's quest to find out who killed him. None of the characters are tempting and by the time you find out how they did it (at least it was cool), you stop taking care. The only good thing I can say is that it makes more sense than Nightmare Concert!
