The throw is OK. The script is sometimes uncomfortable and it takes a while to figure out the point of the movie. I looked at the dishes myself. The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement about the war. I think we shouldn't see it ... we did it. It's a house, you killed nothing more than forty-five minutes. The dump ... huh? What was it about? Literally, I have a client, "Ok you can use our shower." To yawn. The corners are trying very hard. There was a set of bushes, suddenly it was gone because you could see through it, then it was deep and animals died. In the end, it's a terrible movie of boring relationships.
