Slow and beautiful images change each other, with sometimes annoying music (you know Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the movie. If you have not had enough sleep, this is a good time. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20% of the film director decided to have an idea of ​​rebirth, herinkarnasie or otherwise through S & M to bring images "spiritual lovers" cutting each other's bodies with knives. For me it was very upsetting and really change the general impression of the blend of abstract art and images of modern Japanese secret. <br /> <br /> Operator and director is wonderful but strange. <br /> <br /> Did not enjoy at all.
