The movie starts with a few campers, a man and a woman presumably together, walking alone in the wilderness. Sure enough, the man hears something and it makes him so bad, he's going to investigate. Our killer greets him with a sting on the stomach. He then chases the girl and cuts her throat. The camera during the opening scene is from the point of view of the killer. <br /> <br /> We meet our next four main characters, two couples, one of which is on the rocks. The men joke about how the woman can never camp on a double date alone, and the token blonde's ambition will start early to leave a week. Unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car breaks down. They finally arrive at night. When the men arrive, they are warned that people in the forest are disappearing through a crazy Ralph plunger. They ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and play an eight-hour song in the background with lyrics to be killed in the dark forest. The men are lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize it's not just another. The burning clone, but a ghost story! The women, frightened and lonely, are fused by the fire. Two children appear in the shade and decide to play Tom. Well, of course they are haunted by the way their voices echo! Their mother appeared with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asking the two ladies when they saw her children before they disappeared. <br /> <br /> The children walk home to dad and tell him about the two beautiful ladies along the river. It caused a bit of stirring and he got up and grabbed his knife on top of the fireplace. "Dad goes hunting," said the girl, with bad acting. It is clear here that the father is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> From the bushes freaked out, the token blonde splits, blindly at night, with a knife. She met the father who explained that he was hungry and it would be quick. It doesn't make sense because of the panthers we heard earlier (maybe he's allergic! Is panthers honest, even in California?) She wounds him a little before being stabbed in the head. A thunderstorm erupted and the men looked for shelter, which seems to be where Dad lives. It seems clear that someone lives here because there is a fire and something strange about it. The children appear and warn them of Dad, who later emerges. They disappear as soon as he arrives. <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason, our killer goes just to women. He invites the men to eat something and tells us the story about his ex-wife. We get a look back from his wife to be caught. The old man, however, does not tell them that he is killing her and her lover, but daydreaming about it. We do not get the reason for the children's downfall. The men go to bed and are left unharmed. The next morning, the men discovered the empty campsite of their wives. After a short conversation they split. One is to stay at the camp while the other goes and gets help. The one who goes back to his car breaks his leg. We are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving wife that they are ghosts who have murdered themselves of grief over their mother. They agree to help the woman reunite with her friends. <br /> <br /> The next scene ignores the logic of the movie when Daddy kills the man at the campsite. He also married or married the blonde. Somehow the children realize that he was murdered and told the woman about it. She decides to see it for herself and, of course, walks in the murderer. Fortunately, the children stop him by threatening him to leave him forever. You know where it's going. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie earns four stars out of ten, and it's generous. For all his doubts, the musical score was well done. It is still visible. There are some camera angles that look professional, and some of the sets are well done. The plot is incredible. There is such a thing as willing suspension of unbelief, but by the way 6 miles away; I can't imagine that the token blonde would fall off in the middle of the night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
