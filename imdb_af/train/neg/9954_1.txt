From start to finish, this is the most emotionally crowded movie about nothing I've ever seen. The characteristics and interactions between the title character and Marthe Kller's character are pure torture. The race track as a metaphor is so overplayed that it borders on the rock, but director Pollack treats every hairpin as if it's very important. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is some value for an MSFT3000 repetition of some of The Screens, such as Pacino to get in touch with his inner wife, for goof value. But even such casual humor is hard to find in this total turkey.
