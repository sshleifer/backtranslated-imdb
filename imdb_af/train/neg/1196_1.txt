How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel have nothing in it? Believe it or not, 'House Bunny' made it better and harder. Hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got money - this movie is an embarrassment to everyone. This is a cliché from beginning to end. Clichés can work well with a script, or at least an idea. This movie does nothing but cliché to cliché, rather than ideas or writing. Rather, it uses the front personas of the actresses rather than developing characters. Bad, sad and junk. Now I have to have ten lines of text for comment. Really? Why? As an IT ops manager, it's another example of messy coding.
