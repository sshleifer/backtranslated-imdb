Sorry, but I will spoil the plot line and end for you in the hope of avoiding a holiday like the one I am now facing. The father dies and the mother asks Christmas in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas ... and Santa does. Dad is peachy, happily healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he is dead. Both end up being syrupy sweet. <br /> <br /> But as a parent who recently watched my five-year-old lose his best dog friend, it was an abomination. Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his mate back is to ask Santa! Don't underestimate the willpower of a young heart - no conviction will convince him it's just a movie and his dog will NOT return for Christmas. It is heartbreaking to just see his joy knowing that Christmas night will again experience his loss. <br /> <br /> Shame on behalf of all believers who recently lost a loved one. It is difficult to handle the loss once for a child, but there are a few wishes that should not be portrayed as a possibility.
