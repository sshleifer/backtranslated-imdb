Anemic comedy drama, an unfortunate, seemingly rushed affair with Cher as a dwarf housewife who slowly makes friends with the hired hit to kill her by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as a conversation rifle, adapted the script from his own play, with solid set-up and a back-and-forth dialogue that keeps the eye and ear busy. An air of gloom hangs over the whole project, and director Paul Mazursky can't get Cher out of her eternal funk (she is listless). Despite all the top talent (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Believer" is deceptive, without any substance to the story and characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 of ****
