Arg. The shocking dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our common sense in this all-terrifying third movie. This time, European terrorists (Irish I want to say) High Jack supposedly an army convoy to transport uranium. They pull in a yard, open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs. Pandemonium then visits when the rubber dinos clash with the terrorists, the police and some marines. The whole movie (again) appears to be largely inspired by Alien (as was Carnosaur 2) with the pathetic marines going through the "claustrophobic" yard? rifles ready. This third opus is probably the driest and most haughty film of fate, with only one spit of blood when a rubber dinosaur shoots a sore head. The dinos are, as usual, stiff, shocking creatures and the T-Rex sounds like a raging elephant when roaring (it also looks like there are no eyes). One of the goofiest scenes of the movie is when the heads arrive at the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is held and hear some strange noises coming from another truck. If you open it, surprise! The Rubber Reptile Gang bursts out and devours them. Why was the dinos locked in the second truck after escaping from the first? How did they lock up because the truck door can be locked from outside? What was the point to film this scene ???? Oh, bother, who cares? Both thumbs off for the Excessive Rubber Iguanas.
