This movie is pretty poor. The acting is abysmal and completely forced. Moreover, shooting the movie as a docudrama doesn't necessarily make it more credible, you can't get it that easy, Mr. Dir. However, do not let my comments deceive you, as I would recommend watching this movie, as it embodies the psychology or non-existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However, the climax of the movie is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to put it! It's pure and simply fails to catch any sense of atmosphere! What does happen does not translate any feelings of despair, panic, fear, or fear that one would experience in such frightening circumstances. No, it drops you with jaws. Was this it? Rinse out your tongue, and in no way are you being followed by these boys' actions. Rather, you just feel embarrassed by another movie that started with potential, but eventually fell flat on its face at the most important point. Zero Day indeed .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
