Jack Black can usually make me breathe, but in this movie ... <br /> <br /> In addition to the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant cup (support and support by constant straight-to-camera shots) , and a .050 joke batting average, it was still a total waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but the potential there is being wasted with a total lack of comedy and the worst direction I've seen on this side of your tube. <br /> <br /> I heard this movie is being portrayed. Mexicans very negative. While this is undoubtedly true, I really don't think this movie is racist. I think it's more of a "creative" team that desperately tries to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them crying from the back of the camera: "Hey, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, stubbornly, for the love of all things, LOW!" <br /> <br /> But put the racism set aside. When you get there, it is anyone who bought good money and time to watch this pile of remaining beans offending, IMO.
