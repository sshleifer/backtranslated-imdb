Shintar√¥ Katsu has won numerous fame with the amazing character, Zatoichi. The Zatoichi films had a weird and incredible concept - a blind man is the biggest sword fighter in Japan and spends just about every single film a fair injustice and urgent retribution on evil doers. He is a good guy and the movies are exciting and addictive (I actually saw every movie). For this reason I saw this last installment of the Hanzo the Razor series, as I accepted it would be very similar .... and boy was I wrong! It appears that the Hanzo films are extremely sexual and they also promote the rape of "women who deserve it". You see, Hanzo is a policeman of the Meiji era and he regularly detaines bad women and interrogates them by raping them violently with his "penis of steel". How he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe, but it's definitely NOT for the pain. <br /> Overall, I just can't recommend anyone watching these violent and misoginistic films. But if I look at the other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular ... and it's pretty scary. In spite of some decent acting and incredible fights, the movies are like brain pollution - and I hate to think how the movies could have contributed to violence against women.
