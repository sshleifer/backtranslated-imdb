I just saw this movie on Flix after the timer. I grew up to watch F Troop and had a great deal of trouble for Wrangler Jane, so I was shocked, shockedly shocked, to find out after watching the movie that the degenerate murder nurse Melody Patterson was looking good but also look completely different and unhappy. poorly photographed. I would never have guessed it was her in a million years. What is hell in such a picture? I agree with the guys here that the movie is missing what it says. No sex, no gore, no teasing. It is also a remake of the Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or beyond). Most of the action is boring; The main character spends huge amounts of time around the home and cellar of the mad doctor, and the environment in general, or being pulled up by the police, all boring and time consuming. Now that the Italians would have made it, the movie would have been the Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam-henchman the unconscious naked girls. But you only get it for 20 seconds.
