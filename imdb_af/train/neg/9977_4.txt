This child is rather bad, but by no means do they make him the kind of adult apart and can be followed by the experienced thieves every time. No, he is not so much brat as he is a child with serious emotional problems. A beautiful couple who adopt are rather encouraged to take him and while the man is a little more willing to give this child a chance, the mother is not. Through in a bizarre Michael Richards character and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have yourself a pretty bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there. I actually prefer the follow-up to this movie, because I like the fact that they have brought back Amy Yasbeck as a similar character, as there are one or many characters in this movie that are unlikely to be. Even the child is initially annoying in this one, and they also divide him into the successor. The plot is simple enough, although the prospective parents will adopt this child, which they think is great as the orphanage throws a party while they leave, they soon realize that they have a little hellion. Add to that this little hellion comes in contact with a culprit of some kind. Not sure about this character, I first thought it was supposed to be his real dad or something. Not so good, but I will choose it for that Culkin child every day of the week.
