I accidentally saw it one lazy summer afternoon. It was on the HBO family programming channel. Initially I moved in, through what I thought was a Disney animation. But after a few minutes I found myself looking for the remote control so I could find the "INFO BUTTON" to find out what was on my TV in the world. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy him in many of his films, but one thing he is not, is a voice-over artist. He probably has one of the more unique voices in Hollywood, but it only works as part of a larger visual package. She tied to a cute duck, which looked a little difficult. As for the rest of the role, uninspired. I suppose work on this movie didn't appeal to the very good voice about talent out there. <br /> <br /> So, poor voice talent, strong animation ... who was this movie aimed at? Gay Adolescents? I don't get it. Is there such a lack of role models for young people who meet gay people, that we have to transfer organized ducks? Nice story, and like the title, this movie I found hard to love, just like an ugly duckling.
