A friend once asked me to read a script from her that was chosen by a film studio. To say it was one of the most unobtrusive and unceasing scripts I ever read would be a brave understatement. Yet I never told him. Why? Because in a world where movies such as "While She Was Out" can be relieved and an Oscar-winning star such as Kim Basinger dress, a script with a lack of character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it doesn't sell. will not be. As many other judges pointed out, "While she was out" was a terribly underwritten Wife-in-Peril movie that mistress Basinger abused, hunted by four unlikely caps on Christmas Eve. Every grip is legal, from the poor dialogue and the bad behavior of the jaw of logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the point of departure is not without promise. Here are some things that hit me: <br /> <br /> 1) I don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a yoke, the house is a mess with toys. Since then has it been child abuse to bring children to themselves? <br /> <br /> 2) Fast-paced gangs are barely anywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially-balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Surely the movie is stupid. But so are the many "thrillers" I have put where the women are portrayed as stroke, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman get the best of her malicious people. <br /> <br /> 4) I loved the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although an earlier adjudicator created this phrase, I really think this movie should be 'The Red Toolbox of Doom'.
