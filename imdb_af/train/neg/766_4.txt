When a Columbo story deviates from the familiar plot (colorful killer commits crime, Columbo killer smokes, Columbo becomes a plague in the process), the authors can never match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates in the extreme and the result is an important flop. <br /> <br /> Do you want to believe: Columbo never stands before the villain before the end? <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was asked to turn it around two-thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifices we make self-appointed reviewers !!!
