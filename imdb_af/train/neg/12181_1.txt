Unfortunately there was no 0 for a score or else I would have chosen it. This movie does not have the strength that the original movie had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of newcomer Aileen Quinn, and expert of seasoned lawyer John Huston (father of actress Angelica Huston) made it so charming. Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth has more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel. Prior to doing this film, Ashley Johnson was known for her role as small Chrissie Seaver at the forefront of Growing Pains. She had a few pieces in movies, but I don't know who thought she had enough talent to wear a movie on her own. And add Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! They couldn't get enough actors to get the big roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss. Playing Hannigan and Annie, but will they sign Joan Collins to play a British woman? It doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was. The critics had the right not to vote for this movie, even though it was only made for TV, it was a poor pursuit of another lovely movie.
