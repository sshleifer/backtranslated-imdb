Flame in, flame out. It seems to be Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric being that can take it and distribute it with equal abandonment. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but are dedicated to watching all the fights on the fifty movie DVD sci-fi collection of Mill Creek / Treeline Films. It's a great value at around twenty-five dollars, so at fifty cents per movie, it's really an investment in time to watch the goofy offers. <br /> <br /> Gammera has been sleeping for centuries. by a nuclear explosion, and he is not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes it out on Tokyo and moves the United Nations to set up a plan to save the planet. They come to 'Plan Z', the hope of the world, and if you don't want to know, there's a scene where a big barn is shown called the 'Z Plan' building; It was a good touch. <br /> <br /> By the mid-1960s, this country was not yet completely politically correct. One of the US military scenes at the Alaskan Air Defense sector asked General Arnold to make a female sergeant coffee. I suspect there was no private. <br /> <br /> Good old Gammera was quite the face, but walked on two legs and went to the flame throw routine when challenged. That's why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to catch a tortoise in the nostril of a hidden spacecraft, which was hitting him from Mars to save the world. High fives everywhere for the American and Russian team that made the salvation now let us return to the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla, Gammera has grown at least a good dozen movies, but seeing how this one was pretty much satisfies my interest in flying, flaming tortoises. Especially since the DVD pack I mentioned earlier, 'Attack of the Monsters' has a blessed guest appearance from the Big G. It took everything I had to make at the end of both movies; It was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said, "Gammera, Sayonara!"
