This movie is simple and simple to suck. Okay, so it's basically about a girl being raped and getting revenge, she gets another man to rape the rapist. The rapist is a bump, but the girl victim is partly to blame. I mean they both start kissing and kissing and start things, but if the rapist tries to make her sex with her, she won't let it go, so the rapist rapes her. And the thing is the rape scene, because the girl is very short and it doesn't really matter, but when it comes to the rapist being raped, it's a very long rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story that is worth looking at. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
