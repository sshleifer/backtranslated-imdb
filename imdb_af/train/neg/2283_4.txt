And the Oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name should be set with the same awe as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this movie proves it. His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I could give to watch this movie. Dwight gave it a little more than slightly disturbed misfit, a lovely but terrible attitude that led you to a bigger role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. To be myself in the medical profession, I must give kudos to the expert performance of a self-pitying hypochondria. Although other medical flaws gave a brief overview, especially when the good doctor phoned his medical doctors samples ... "Well, keep it to her." Unfortunately, these 2 outstanding performances can't keep me awake through three attempts to put it unbearably through slow movie. The plot is predictable with only a few small turns. The filming while pulling a legitimate, ghostly atmosphere was more productive to yawn me. Yes, you can use too much shadow. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - check once to see Frye and Eburne - but only when awake and with many caffeine.
