"Power Play" is starting to get interesting, but it's going down quickly. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no value or interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in a few days than California has in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so confronted and totally unbelievable. And all the action scenes look like a bunch of third-graders playing on a play. It's terrible, just awful. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, if "Power Play" was made in the 60's or 70's, is considered a poor B-class movie. The fact that "Power Play" was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there such a thing as a D-class movie? If so, "Power Play" throws the form.
