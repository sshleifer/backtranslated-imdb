The plot of 'Edison' was decent, but one actor especially destroyed the whole movie. Justin Timberlake destroyed the movie with every line he made during the movie. He is by far one of the worst actors I've ever seen, and needs the same fate as the whole of F.R.A.T. group. <br /> <br /> Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene or even a quiet scene, Justin Timberlake managed to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching this movie. Don't bother loading it first. Midgetporno will be a much better choice. <br /> <br /> And if you read Justin, stick to music. Although you are not good at it, you have done a wonderful job of deceiving people into thinking you can actually sing.
