I went to watch this movie and knowing it wasn't going to be good. but what I saw was to be terrible for words. I don't mean to be hard, it's just the movie is terrible. Overall, it was bad, I mean AWFUL special effects, the acting wasn't bad, but wasn't good either, and sasquatch itself was like .... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion, the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons. It's not violent or abominable, but it has the best portrayal of sasquatch. at least she doesn't have a suit and not half a donkey. just watch this movie if you are desperate, or someone really appreciates in the movie. Or look at Boondock saints, it is much better.
