After looking at it, I lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (over time). This movie was completely rubbish. First, they tried to repair the end of the first "Howling" with incredibly bad makeup. Then they try to make it a sad excuse for a werewolf porn movie! The plot sucks and the whole movie is just AWFUL !!!! A brother of a werewolf victim of the first film (From its appearance, it was SUPERED to be Dee Wallace Stone) teams with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of wolves, led by Sybil Danning, appears to be naked. all the time. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth renting (Unless you waste your time and money looking at the nudity.). Rather, try to catch it on the cable. It would have been so choppy, it could actually make sense.
