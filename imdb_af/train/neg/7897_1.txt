This movie was made for people who found Gremlins too serious and found Critters to hardcore. Like many of the 80's critters / trolls / gremlins films, this movie is bad. The sad part is that there is no punchline on the comment. It's just bad and not in a funny way. <br /> <br /> The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it is actually trying to be funny and eventually being as successful as Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A. man. What made the other 80's horror movies in the classics was that they were really anxious, but were hilarious because they unfortunately failed. Someone should have told Bettina Hirsch (yes THE Bettina Hirsch) she had a talent for comedy before she started directing this movie. Unfortunately, they went wrong. <br /> <br /> Certainly seeing a strange little mutated cross between a ferret and a crop with a brown demolition scrap and throwing pool balls on an outcast of the Lost Boys is amusing, but not enough around the movie. <br /> <br /> The most annoying part of the movie is the Paul character. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you move quickly from the time of his first scene until the end credits just stop once to see a scene where a munchie pool ball throws at a man ... not that I It didn't. br /> <br /> So, the bottom line is running, don't walk to your nearest Blockbuster and shake hands with the driver, and thank you for not having the grapes to hit this stack of rubbish on the shelves.
