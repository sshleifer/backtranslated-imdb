I would list this movie under the horror movie genre. I did this because I am not aware of a genre that is terribly mentioned. Since the genre horror comes closest to horrible, I decided to put it in this category. The acting was amateurish. You know who will be the villains on the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. Film production students should take this movie as an example for the lesson that should not be in a movie. It's so bad. Man the word bad is an understatement. The villains are hitting an ocean vehicle and want $ 10 million. They want the money to be delivered on an inhabited Roos Island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. They will sit ducks after they get the money. There is no getaway plan. How stupid. The female cruise director is a former policeman, naval seal, kung fu, I'm afraid. The hilarious part is the way the time bomb is destroyed. He says he knows what he is doing and he keeps all the threads one by one. He then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place. Is he angry? Like our madman who watched this RIDICULOUS. If you have an M-i-L that you don't like. Renting her rent this movie and pretend to enjoy it. I assure you that she will definitely tell your spouse that you have such a bad taste and that her son / daughter has married a person under her family standard.
