Sergio Leone turns into his grave. If there is any movie trampling on a man's life, this is this one. The main character's "lone wolf" bravado is uninspiring and lame, and the writing is apparently written by a monkey with an eight-degree education. Whose idea is to be a horse. The only reason I spend wasting time is because there is a 10-line minimum. Sergio Leone's family must sue, not because she crap, but because it is now being murdered as a crap by MST 3000. Shame. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey makes a shit that will not offend anyone but cocaine users and weapons experts. This film is pure blasphemy.
