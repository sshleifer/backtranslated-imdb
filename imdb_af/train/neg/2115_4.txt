Only the gland secretions - and please do not ask any more details - of young virgins can keep the rapidly weakening body and spirit of the mad old amateur horticulturist's wife fresh and youthful. Since, like most people except those participating in medical trials, virgins seldom give up their arbitrariness, dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) arranges for them to be kidnapped and kept. He will withdraw himself. <br /> <br /> What a great cheese ball a premise for a low budget horror movie. If the corps disappears, it seems that it is not the Havarti of horror, leaving it as an ordinary limburger an interesting aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Sure, the play is almost horrible except for the actors who are happy to play the crazy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played the Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazy brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who has many grunts and fetishes for the virgin's hair; the mad mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the beloved woman (Elizabeth Russell), sleeping in a soft coffin and of course the mad doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) traces the doctor for a strange orchid with a strange sweet smell worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife Pat invite to stay the night, a raging storm breaks out immediately. That indication tells us that some violent violence will soon erupt. As it is well known that all unmarried young women in Virginia at this time were virgins, Pat may have unpleasant surprises to deal with. These include dark areas, a crust laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored, a cellar mausoleum and later a direct threat to Patricia's own gland secretions. If she survives, what story should she give her editor. <br /> <br /> If you taste this moist cut of soft Velveeta (and why not? Don't be better), Bela Lugosi shouldn't be judged by the company he holds here. He had a huge impact in Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie from The Black Cat (1934). As dr. Vitas Werdegast is a sad, ironic man who protects his two young friends. When he finally took a scallop to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and began to flutter the man alive, ah, well, that's a wonderful scene.
