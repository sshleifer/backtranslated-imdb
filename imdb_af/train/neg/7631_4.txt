I'm not going to come across TLPS's obvious peterbogdanovichic defects. Instead, I will look at the positive aspects of this movie's overlooked celluloid pygmy. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be tolerated in its entirety. This fact alone puts the film high above and above the road to the top of its lame filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich showed how wonderful generous some happy boyfriends can be, by sharing Cybill Shepherd's (then) fabulous body and breasts with his masculine audience - and not just one but two. Brava! The indisputable highlights of this film release del siesta. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS barely has a scene without stereotypical country music doodle in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the film was set in America's deep south (as if it wasn't clear) so he hammered the point and over and over ...) How is it advantage, you might ask? Well, when the movie ends and the monotonous music finally stops massaging your tired drums, you start to experience a strange excitement: "The movie is over!" This is pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The movie gives hope to all women who look like Cloris Leachman. Hope they can one day get a lot younger and maybe even nice boyfriend. <br /> <br /> 5. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I realize is not technically part of TLPS) gives hope to all the women who look like that, one day they can also win a Miss Chicago beauty competition. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury.) <br /> <br /> (You think I guess Cloris after winning a beauty contest, huh? Well, check her bio and then we'll see last laugh ...) <br /> <br /> 6. The movie was shot in black and white, which saved us the face of Cloris Leachman's face in his original natural non-glory.
