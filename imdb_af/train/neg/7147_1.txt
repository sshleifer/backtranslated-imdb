My favorite part was when the credits started rolling. I wish I could give it a .000000001 out of 10. I really wish I had returned that hour and thirty minutes. Don't waste your money or time on it. I could really have watched grass and felt better after wards. Nadia was really nice and I hope the movie didn't destroy her career. But she chose to be in it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it sucked more than any other movie sucked. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. It says something. <br /> <br /> Do <br /> <br /> it !!
