It's one of those movies that appeared on the cable like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they were iron. The acting is second-rate. Poor Mathew Modine seems to be sleeping throughout the movie. And God help Gina Gershon. Her accent is too high. It doesn't sound like a real English woman. It sounds forced and fake, much like her acting. She has to stick to what she does best, a lesbian showgirl artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are no better. They are two-dimensional. empty, foolish and stupid. How to care for these people. At one point, Christy Scott Cashman gets lost in Central Park. Really? It's not that hard to navigate Central Park. Just follow a road. I didn't just care about any of the characters, I just hated them. The only reason I even stayed at this train wreck of a movie was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor couldn't save this dying Fish. Each scene is a typical romantic comedy card and nothing is left to surprise us. The writing was terrible like the acting. If you catch, throw fish back!
