Terrible, just terrible. It proves my theory of "star power." It's supposed to be big TV, because the guy who directs (battlestar) Titanica is the same man who has appointed this shlop schtock schtick over a chick. B G N G G. <br /> <br /> Find something thousand times more interesting to do - like watching your TV, without a picture and no sound. 1/10 (I rated it so high, there are no negative scores in the IMDb.com rating system.) <br /> <br /> -Saphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My Theory About "star power" is: the more "star power" is used in a show, the weaker the show is. (It calls an indirect proportion: quality 1 / "strength", less "sp" makes for better quality, etc. Another way to look at is: "more is less.") <br /> <br /> - Z
