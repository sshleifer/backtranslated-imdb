OK - the helicopter shots are fantastic, and the director made good use of some of Barcelona's top issues. Otherwise, the production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the movie felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was beautiful and fun to watch, Abel Folk had the depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He had to use his martial arts training well and be a running action figure. The rest of the cast was best wood, but mostly paper. So - if you are nostalgic about Spain, it is a postcard with an action turn and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
