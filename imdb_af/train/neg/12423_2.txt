Cage (1989) was one of the low budget "buddy" action flashes produced during the 80's, thanks to the 48hrs movies. and deadly weapon. This one star Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno like former Vietnam veterinarians running a local dive bar. Reb cares for Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam'. But Lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft. Although he is big, Lou has the brain of a child. One day, some ruffians throw themselves in the bar and Lou and Rebb knock the tar from them. But repayment is a mother. They crash the bar, leaving Lou and Reb with nothing. This is until these two thugs arrive in the picture (one of them is a good old man) who has a plan in mind. <br /> <br /> The movie is a waste of time. Perhaps if they all went and made a hard core action movie instead of trying to force the gruesomeness of the situation, maybe it could have worked. Unfortunately, it does not and the audience is left over. Oh good. It's too bad because you have all the elements for a big B movie. Congratulations next time, I think. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
