A clear b-degree attempt to pay cash on the Hostel / Saw buzz, my expectations for this movie was low (very low!) And yet it still disappointed at every level. The acting is so bad, it's not even funny, the plot line doesn't exist and the only scare was realizing that I wasted 1 hour 21 minutes! I'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10-star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. The 34th is possibly the director's mother? - Although I am sure, she will find it difficult to go above 2! DVD extras include an hour-long "make" feature. What the question is, "Why?" (although it may serve to demonstrate what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
