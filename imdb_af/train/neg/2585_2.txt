It was the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only is it almost nothing to do with the other American Pie movies, but the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny. <br /> <br /> The girls are nice, but spending your time watching a cheap soft porn may be bigger than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like it's a very bad ad, made for an audience older than 12. <br /> <br /> I never visited an American college, but I would seriously doubt anyone who did, could really laugh about any of the screens. <br /> <br /> Save your time, do something else.
