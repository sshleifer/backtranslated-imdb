The saddest thing about this "tribute" is that almost all the singers (including the otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave) missed the whole point where Cohen's intensity lies: by delivering his lines into an almost tonless pussy, Cohen sends full extent of his poetry, his irony, his everyday humanity, laughter and tears in one. <br /> <br /> To see some of this singer, make bad suffering faces, start their pathetic squeals in the patent attempt to scream "I'm a singer!", is a real pain. It's the same feeling, many of you probably listened to some horrible operational versions of simple songs like Lennon's "Imagine." Nothing, nothing just gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original. If there's a form of art that doesn't need decorations, it's Cohen's art. Decorations throw it in the street and look like the tasteless composition of sex for sale. <br /> <br /> In this Cohen's tribute, I received suffering and suffering through miserable tributes and terrible reinterpretations, all of them lacking the original completely irony of the master and, if truth is told, some of these singers sounded like they were recruited at an asylum talent show. It's Cohen's tribute to them by letting them sing his material, really not the other way around. They might be friends or his daughter, he could have become very sad and in the mood for a gift. Bad, it didn't stay in the family. Fortunately, but only at the end, Cohen himself performed his majestic "Tower of Song", but even the flower was spoiled by the completely unpleasant backdrop. from the U2, everyone carries the expression that has bored children when they visit their poor grandfather at the nursing home. <br /> <br /> A sad show, really and sad if you really love Cohen like me.
