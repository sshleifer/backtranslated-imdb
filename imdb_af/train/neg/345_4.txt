It can't be Mandy Schaffer's last movie. Someone, do something! :-) <br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> What a small life this one had, directing ended. Don't roll the roll, they've done well. Even the winemaker's younger brother was doing pretty well, and he didn't even come into the movie halfway through. And if you put Mandy in more movies, she's too good to bury her career at such a young age. , hey .... <br /> <br /> Two specific criticisms, in case someone cares (apparently no one loves this movie very much). First, the way Traci appeared at just the right melodramatic moment to see everything she was supposed to see and was never seen was very annoying. Hollywood: Please stop making villains perfect timing exactly when the climax comes. This is stupid. Write better scripts so you don't have to use the lame plot device any more. If your writing is not good enough to stand up, don't produce it. <br /> <br /> Second, Carmen won't fall And for Traci's false injury streak. She has already found Traci. More bad writing / directing there. <br /> <br /> I could make this movie dirty, but grace forbids it. Actually, I didn't hate it as much as the other one seems to have. It just didn't have much reason to be made, unless it was just a vehicle to show the beautiful Mandy. Oh, and for anyone who didn't think she was sexy ... the character wasn't very well written, but how can you say she's not sexy?!? Some of us need glasses, and I don't think it's me. <br /> <br /> MORE MANDY. (Don't be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I'd love to see her again. ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did I mention I make Mandy more movies for me? <: - D
