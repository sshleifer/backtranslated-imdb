The easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire. The target of the satire is quite large, from the US government to corporate America. It is also not a stinging satire, but rather a stupid. <br /> <br /> Think of this movie as a mix between the Kentucky Fried movie, the plane and the police team series, with a much smaller budget and not funny. I can see this movie being a satire of many sci-fi disasters from the 50's and 60's. I see this movie as a major influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple enough. Genetically engineered giant tomatoes go crazy and start attacking people and cities. Initially there is a lid on and then it blows into the full war. <br /> <br /> The film plays characters and character characters: Lois Fairchild (a Lois Lane clone), a very ambitious presidential press secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent not since the Bay) have worked for Pigs), a useless president (who can only find his name and attack New York), an even unknown congress, a sloppy marketing chief executive, and Mason's team of obese East German "female" swimmer, a scuba diver, a crazy parachutist and an African American disguise expert (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally as a tomato). Did I forget to mention many and many tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, giant plastic tomatoes, tomatoes, tomato juice and finally to people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> You also have some musical numbers as well. They are not so good and seem to be baptized. The best voice is by far the theme of the movie ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It's too tough and you can finally humming or singing in public. Be warned. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of different real-life situations as well as different entertainment genres. I don't believe I laughed, but mostly smiled and scratched my head. I definitely recommend this movie for fans of B and C grade movies, but only for rent. <br /> <br /> Celluloid Rehab
