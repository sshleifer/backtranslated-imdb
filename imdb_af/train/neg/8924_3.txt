It was a disappointment to see this DVD after so many years. For me, the main problem is the unequal writing. <br /> <br /> While some of it is greasy and hip, it's a little dull, unfriendly and lifeless. Many of the gags are just sitting there, without spark and energy. <br /> <br /> The film comes with Mae West and Rachel Welch. Roger Lord in the role of Rusty shines (too bad he didn't make any more films). But for my money there is just too much of John Huston, and poor Rex Reed hardly gets a chance. His character seems in vain to skimp on the sidelines, wondering what he's doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The low user rating should give an idea of ​​the public's opinion on this piece. Vidal's original field had a lot of potential, which was almost wasted. Not even the 'classic' films have done much. Overall a little subpar effort, and it probably won't get any better over time.
