Disappointing, predictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can't maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre, "Anywhere, but Here," Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman provided a much better insight into the relationship between mother and daughter. With Better also act.
