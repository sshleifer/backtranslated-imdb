This movie has beautiful scenery. Unfortunately, it has no plot. To have a plot there must be a conflict. This movie had nothing. It painted a wonderful scene for two hours and failed to put any activity into it. The picture is trying to be artistic, but fails to pay attention to the basics of storytelling. <br /> <br /> If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing, you'll find value in this movie, don't expect a story. There is none.
