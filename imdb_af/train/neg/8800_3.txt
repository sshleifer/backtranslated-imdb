A collection of deleted scenes and alternatives take along, edited together and with additional voice over to make it look like the first. Pretty cool idea, but scrapped scenes are left on the cutroom floor for a reason and this is further proof. Since it's just not as funny as "Anchorman", and really, let's face it. THIS movie was not exactly comedy gold, so you get a 'movie' worse than one that is moderate. In my eyes, STILL puts it one or two nuclei above "Kicking and Screaming", or "Bewitched". Cross your fingers that "The Wedding Crashers" is a return to old school form (no pun intended) <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
