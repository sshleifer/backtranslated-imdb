I'm amazed at the positive reviews for this thorough, uninspiring movie. <br /> <br /> Often with foreign films, I skip reviews that complain of slow pace and apparent "absence of action", as many of the best international movies don't live up to the West Hollywood movie storytelling model. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the regular art and lack of clich√©s in the foreign film arena. I enjoy the fact that many foreign films do not fit in a neat, tasty bow. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie offers no redeeming value for the time I missed it. No meaningful character development, no interesting story bow, no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Summary: A lot of emotionally immature, sincere, biased colonies murder their slaves, and a little girl is hurt by her only friend when the "home-boy" eventually gets tired and takes her abusive . <br /> <br /> While the above paragraph is substantial and dramatic, this movie will carry you while spelling out the scenario. I was so disconnected that it took three sittings to complete it, and I wouldn't even have done it if it wasn't for the positive ratings. <br /> <br /> Unless you have an academic interest in the period, I strongly suggest that you manage this one.
