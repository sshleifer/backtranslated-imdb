The movie is very dreadful and is thought to rape victims. On the surface it may be a daring film about rape, but if you're digging beneath the surface, what lies is a not-so-positive rape message. Aishwarya, the victim of rape, is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot handle everything because she is a WOMAN. She needs a man to help her. When society speaks about her and comments on her, she doesn't stand up for herself. It's all up to Anil Kapoor to do all the talk while Aishwarya does all the tears. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Kaushik) went the wrong way by portraying a rape victim as poor and submissive. What would be more effective is the portrayal of a strong woman who rebels courageously against her enemies. The director is known to be chauvinistic. His films are usually full of weak women, but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He must teach it just because the role is controversial. This does not mean that the character itself is strong. <br /> <br /> The most humiliating scene in the movie is when Aishwarya cleans herself after being raped. She does it to thank her dad who thinks she's dirty now. Although it is commendable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a bright light, what he doesn't show us is whether Ash's father was wrong to do his daughter. So we have a confusing message about rape. <br /> <br /> Also, the comedy is not needed in a strong film like this one. Even more, the comedy is simply not funny. As is wood in her role, while Anil Kapoor screams nothing else. The music is mediocre, except for the title frame, which is beautifully depicted (the only clear point of this movie). Sonali Bendre's role is disappointing and useless. Overall, a great movie to remember is finally coming out as a terrible mish-mash that causes some viewers to experience severe digestion.
