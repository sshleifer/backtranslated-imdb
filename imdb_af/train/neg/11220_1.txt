For a movie with so much promise, it was disappointing, thin plot and the acting ranged from horrible and incredible. The plot had more holes in it than Swiss cheese and this is the worst clich√© end I've seen in a movie for some time. The final scene would have pulled my heart out if the whole movie wasn't so painful to start with. I was numb! From the very first scene there was a wonder that the sister was trying to reach out to her twins for help or just killing her, which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting I. I've seen so far. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.
