It's funny, if you stop and think about it: scare movie friends are prone to a deep and lasting love for those who frighten their daylight. The Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE can give us nightmares, but whoever among us (the Faithful) did not feel a lot of true love of Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE or for Ken Foree, forever the decisive hero of the original DAWN OR THE DEAD? She came in the remake that left me up and running (like Tom Savini's cameo); I don't kid you. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you get my drift (if not, just stand downhill ...). These are some of the heroes of horror. To see this, many of those who came together in a single movie are almost unheard of (at least to this extent, to my knowledge). If only the author (s) were to such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again. As long as it's not a half-hearted attempt (like BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD, for example).
