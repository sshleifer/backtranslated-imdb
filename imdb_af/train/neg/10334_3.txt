A story of incredible uninteresting murder "The Psychic" over and over. The characters and plot are completely uninteresting (as Fulci's crazy camera works, which is usually a redeeming factor in his films), and no understanding of tension can be found anywhere. It is emitted to an insatiable degree - eventually you will not get excited but get bored (and like me, an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves occupation in a better movie. Fulci Gorehounds beware - there's just not much going on in "The Psychic." <br /> <br /> 3/10
