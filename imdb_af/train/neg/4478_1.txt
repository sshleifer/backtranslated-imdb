I didn't expect much from this movie - a fun seduction. Wuthering Heights can be transformed into a likely modern story - beautiful and soap operas, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film decided to throw off the talents of the people involved in a simmering version of the source material. It's amazing that they had the trouble of calling it Wuthering Heights. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are essentially unsustainable, mostly unsympathetic, and often cruel to one another. It changes the nature of certain characters. Isabelle, for example in the novel, did not have a pelvis in her body - they stripped her blind idealism and changed her into a crook. Heathcliff is a terrible person who tortures most people in his way, but in this version Catherine ends her daughter in his care. The dialogue is thin and one wonder how the actors managed to deliver it straight-forward. In place of depth or real emotions, we know they mean something when they scream it in someone's face. I criticized the early 90's, Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, which owned Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, and said it became an intensely dark, gothic story in a sudsy bodice ripper. Some valid comments, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bombs that offer very bad music.
