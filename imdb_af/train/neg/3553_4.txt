The Incubus is a blend of good (an interesting murder mystery), the bad (a disconnected script, a messy resolution, bad screens) and the strange (strong turbulent overtones, a strange sleeping and tight performance by John Cassavetes - was that character really meant to be "wacko"?). Not nearly as offensive as it is claimed, but not particularly successful. (* 1/2)
