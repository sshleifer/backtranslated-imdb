First, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and she's just awful. This movie imagines every horror in clich√©, and it is badly played. The over-slaughtered teenage couple. The comic (not) horny jock. The snotty cool chick. The creepy local color man. The parent-type couple. The virgin chick who never dies in these movies. That dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool. It's almost like you wish they'd all die earlier. Some time ago I saw the rough cut of this movie, but somehow it just got worse. Certainly, the funniest thing in this is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but it barely gives another dog's rent. Avoid at all costs.
