In the Strip, Modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesty Blaise, looks more like an anorectic fashion model. She also does not have the moral or personality Modesty has in the comics. Modesty will never advise a woman to show more skin to earn more money. I can't see any similarities with my comic books with Modesty and this movie. It's like a Mission Impossible movie that deals with Ethan Hunt who was locked in high school accusation room and talked to the lawyer about going to high school and Hunt would be played by DJ Qualls (in Road Trip) . If you're a Modesty fan, you don't see the movie, you'll just get angry. If you don't know much about the Modesty cartoons, hire another movie, don't spend your time with this one. I can't understand how Quentin Tarantino could put his name on it. I will request a refund from my DVD rental shop tomorrow.
