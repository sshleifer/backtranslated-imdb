I didn't think this movie was worth a bad script except Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, stupid man and unfair divorce institutions. If you've never seen this movie, don't even bother it. It's not worth it at all. All that was good was that Janine Turner did good work. Terry's husband is a determined defense attorney who has won many cases and even received murderers. He thinks he's so smart, but he's really just a nut. Her best friend has a relationship with her husband and betrays her. Pretty girl, huh. Yeah, she's a real peach. She's not a day on the beach either.
