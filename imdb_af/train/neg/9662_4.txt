I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess what, I didn't do it before I watched the TLB, and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above average rating at IMDb. I found it had a complete lack of story. You just fell in with it (and unfortunately not in the way Private Ryan saved us in the movie), and it has a sudden end, which was very unsatisfactory to me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, the wounded soldiers looked at me fairly realistically, especially with the low budget in mind. But prepare yourself to laugh ... Some guys are thrown into the air after an explosion as if they were Olympic gymnasts. A mid-air corkscrew or somersault during WW I is a bit too much for me, especially if it is run countless times during the movie. <br /> <br /> However, the parts that really make me laugh until I almost cry were the screens meticulous. The shouting and screaming German voices ... incredibly funny. They seem to be spoken by a single actor / vocalist, as they sound exactly the same, and it sounds like a 'typical' German voice. <br /> <br /> I would NOT recommend this movie absolutely. to anyone except for people who just want to laugh a bit because they are sad and stubborn.
