Dire. Not terrible. The writing is confronted, the acting painful, and the story just pulls together. This is undoubtedly a celebration of Sally Potter and a little different. It wouldn't be that bad, but she is the director, writer and star of the movie, and so it is just self-glorification. I didn't find myself on the developing romance between the two main characters, and the end didn't come too soon. It has two redeeming features. First of all, many of the shots are really nice, especially in Paris, and look pretty good in black and white. Secondly, whether you're a fan of tango or not, the music is great, excellent (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk, or if you need an inadvertent laugh. I'm sure it calls on someone. Statistically it should.
