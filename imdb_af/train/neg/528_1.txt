I never expect a movie adaptation to follow the novel (especially a loved one like an evening), but when I saw that the book's author Susan Minot was a screenwriter and executive producer on the film, I thought the evening was a good fit. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the book, don't wrestle with this movie. It's so far from the book that the two hardly ever look like each other. <br /> <br /> Here our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the housekeeper's son. Buddy is drunk, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I don't think a single character made it from the book to the screen; Oh, it just gets worst with every passing moment. <br /> <br /> And, really, we didn't learn from Bridges or Madison County who cut the story we should be surprised at, after scenes of our heroes' Adult children with obnoxious and youthful battles, work simply not on film? This movie is a disaster. Skip it.
