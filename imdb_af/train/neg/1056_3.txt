Princess Guzman is an angry young woman. If she survives a careless series of disappointments and traumas, she takes out her anger at the nearest targets. <br /> <br /> If she sees violence change and focuses on discipline in an extremely boxing club, she knows she has found her home. <br /> <br /> The movie progresses from there, as Diana teaches the lessons lessons along with the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good at the role, especially when the focussed anger of a young woman is built on all sides and not just personal circumstances but hedged sexism. <br /> <br /> The picture can be fine in the direction of all the young actors, which is pale compared to the older, more experienced role. There are too many breaks in the writing, which detracts from the dramatic tension. The overall silence of the film drains it of intensity. <br /> <br /> It is a good idea to see once, rather than just the power of a fully-realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. The restrictions prevent it from being placed in the "see it again and again" category.
