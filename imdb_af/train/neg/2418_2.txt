The first mistake you make in the title of a movie is to use some of the living dead without really having a budget for the real zombie FX. Sure, it was a low budget zombie flick - very low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It wasn't really bad, considering the above, and it offered an interesting twist on the zombie genre. If you want to get a "R" for violence, you can just as well give shots of the babies being attacked. The women were so little used in this movie that it could almost be classified as "gay interest". <br /> <br /> And I'm from Oakland. There was a lot of shooting going on and no police in sight!
