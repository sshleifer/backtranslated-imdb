I don't like to use the word "horrible" to describe any work of the cinema that spends a lot of time, effort, talent and money in creation, but Zefferelli's attempt at Charlotte BrontÃ«'s novel "Jane Eyre" is a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> The writing is lacking in finesse and power, everything the viewer explains in no uncertainty and leaves little imagination. The protagonists are badly mistaken, clearly nominated for their recording, and the musical score is dull and dull. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with each other. She is like a wet noodle, worse than Joan Fontaine, who was at least able to engage in some emotional involvement that is a story of frustrated passion. And William Hurt plays the whole movie on one tone and the tone is flat and without energy. Of course, the slack and vapid writing doesn't help any of these other fine actors in their efforts to bring this movie to life. <br /> <br /> Joan Plowright's Mrs Fairfax is like a Disney creation that pops up to reconcile scenes in which she would be best. <br /> <br /> There is no riddle about the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the second woman, played as a Barbie doll by Elle MacPhearson, is an empty tag. <br /> <br /> A very big actress, Fiona Shaw is totally wasted as Jane's Aunt, Mrs Reed. She would have been better than Mrs Fairfax. Just Amanda Root, like Jane's beloved school teacher, calls any authentic sympathy or credibility. <br /> <br /> I watched this version of Jane Eyre after watching Robert Young's for British television, made in 1997, with Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. Young's vital, romantic and immersive version is like an explosive nova compared to Zefferelli's wet squib. <br /> <br /> I'll be interested to see the 1970s version with Timothy Dalton, of which I've read some very good readings. things on this site. I'm surprised at how many people of Zefferelli's Yorkshire photo book kept. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography is bright, furthermore it is a complete dud.
