* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. But this statement ignores the real content of the movie. Oliver Stone has shown his serial killers as unholy, inhuman murderers of innocent people and has violated a morbid media fascination. Instead, he gives them justification. The film represents just about every victim than someone who deserved to be hurt. Supporting the brutal stereotyping, Stone offers the victims as unpleasant caricatures - stupid rednecks, broken English-speaking immigrants, lazy people. The one person who is the murderous love bird is also a stereotype. Of course, they are friends with the old, hallucinogenic-American-Indian - because they are trendy, dude? Let's make him an admirable character. Fat, Chinese clerks and hicks are uncool, so let's look like it's worth dying. Instead of being twisted, hatefully corrupted by their iniquities, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surrealistic visuals attract more impressive people. Justice is mocked. Police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and mocker compared to GQ killers. Again, it is not in the media reports within the film, but in the "reality" of the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just remaining performances and footage. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film failed in his message lies in the real response to it. Some impressive young people who have seen this movie have inspired it for murders they have committed. The movie's message is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrible real results. The clever message is nowhere to be seen.
