It's not just that it's a bad movie; It's not just that four of the "best" Mexican movie makers are in this movie; and it is not just that the writing is terrible. It's just that ... this movie sucks ... great time. These people waste money in terrible scriptures. It's supposed to criticize Mexican society, but we love these kind of movies. Is bad language supposed to be funny? I don't get it. Mexican theater is in serious trouble as these movies will continue to play (and are written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please do not think these movies are well received in Mexico: We hate them and they do not reflect us.
