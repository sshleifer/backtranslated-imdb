After a long time in space, looking for the remains of planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who is married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is planning an evil plan, using crystals that he stole from the loneliness fortress, to create a new country and suppress the US. <br /> <br /> After so many wonderful movies from Superman with the memorable Christopher Reeve, or TV shows like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", a great expectation has been created for the return of Superman in this Bryan Singer version. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, a lack of emotion and overestimated in IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something shameful ridiculous. Twenty-two-year-old actress Kate Bosworth is mistreated and plays the role of an adult reporter and experienced mother of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenager Clark Kent in "Smallville". The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a stupid caricature. Last but not least, and despite a terrific Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, so older and older than the rest of the lead. The winding conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
