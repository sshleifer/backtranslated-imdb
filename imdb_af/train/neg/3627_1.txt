I'm never much into classic movies. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, How Green was My Valley, Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Burger Kane bore me. However, I would rather watch one of those films 3,469 times as they are tied to a chair than to watch an American in Paris once in the luxury suite. If I did the latter, I'd probably sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> The color art and music didn't interest me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. The dance and singing can help sleep. The dialogue does not correspond to Singin 'in the Rain. This movie is basically boring. The only other movie I fell asleep was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can't blame me. I slept just 5 minutes the previous night. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (too bad we can't give zero.)
