Why, why can't anyone make a decent movie from a legendary story? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf" over which I was disappointed in a year. But I have to say, the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel", starring Gerald Butler) was much better than that. The one was just a little disappointing. This one is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What made me the most? Were they the useless plotting elements they didn't add for any particular reason? (Human sacrifices? Wordless love interests?), Or the bad CGI, or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting? Even worse was the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis, look so awful !!! And can't we even talk about that ridiculous crossbow? <br /> <br /> And why they constantly reminded us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men, and yet he never showed the slightest sign of so much power throughout the film. He was beaten by both monsters he fought and went on his stockings to save his bacon. Even when he hit the arrogant prince, he didn't beat him. He was too much dependent on weapons. Beo-wimp is more like that. It was definitely not the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I'd like to end it on a positive note, but I can't really think of one hand. All I can say is, if you've ever read "Beowulf", you'll be infinitely disappointed by this dishonest, inaccurate apology for an adjustment!
