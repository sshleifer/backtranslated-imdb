I was always curious about this movie because it's so hard to find, so when I stumbled on Ebay, I got over $ 10 and bought it. Now I understand why it's so rare! This movie is so bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the end credits, which show all the cuts where they have stunned their lines, are literally the movie's highlight. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her topless scene) using her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects of a different dimension into this reality. When she pulls into a box like object, the army throws it in the open back of a truck with one soldier to protect it and give it, what do you know? SURPRISES! A child in a foam-rubber monster costume appears, immediately killing the soldier with a scratch on his face, then escaping to a nearby city. But rather than deploying half of the armed forces of the country to find it and to protect the public, those in charge just have to give it to Pettyjohn and Ray to find it on their own, but No matter, this film breathes all its credibility LANG before. This barely escaped one by me because of unintentional laughter, someone has to wake up the producers of Mystery Science Theater 3000 if they don't know it! 2 out of 10, really, VERY bad!
