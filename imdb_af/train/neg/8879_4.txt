I think Cliff Robertson was definitely one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics to his credit. He does well here than the heavy, but the direction is so bad and the pacing so exhausting, it never gets off the mark. The story starts well, though it makes me wonder how he can count on his wife who hangs herself. Yet he does well and carries things together. The deadlock is twofold. First, if we have to spend the amount of time characters spend going from one room to another or part of the house to another, it will eat about a third of the movie. Add to that, Robertson's character, sitting in the blue light in the bed, looking confused, which could add another piece. I agree with those who said half an hour shorter it would have made a fairly decent but insignificant movie. The biggest weakness is just a complicated plot that, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questions. I'm not in spoilers, but when it ends, don't think too much. I can get ten things without sweating. It would have been better if it remained a ghost story.
