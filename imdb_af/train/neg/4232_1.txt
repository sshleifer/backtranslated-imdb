Karl Jr and his father now run an army on a remote island. They catch a trio of guys stumbling on the island. Who fights after a while. (well the survivors). This one has incessant blood, gore and massacre, which would have been good if any of them looked remotely at all or if the production didn't look like it was made with a week's saved lunch. money (i may overxxagerating there. It was probably worth just a few days). The terrible dubbing didn't bother me so much and I suspect I was very drunk, some of which might have been slightly humorous .... maybe. But as it is, the movie has been feeling too long for almost 78 minutes. Oh, I don't know ... 78 minutes. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Bonus Movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama released movies
