I've never read the book a ripple in time. To be honest, do I really want to, after I have seen the movie? Well, I don't have to review this movie, I start with it. Next I will say that the TV movie is pretty forgotten. Do you know why I say this? Because I forgot what is happening in it. I told you it was forgotten. To be honest, no TV movie will ever be better than "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How do I describe a TV movie? I've never written a review for one before. Well, I'll just say they usually have celebrities. A wrinkle in time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), the Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The movie features cheesy special effects, a rather interesting plot, scenes that let you go "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and it lets you go "WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They are usually not good. As it is. A ripple in time is a waste of time and a great time waster. To download it, you'll probably forget it, the second is over. Well, maybe not the second is over. But within minutes. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle in time: * / ****
