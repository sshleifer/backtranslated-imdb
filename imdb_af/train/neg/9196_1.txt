This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad it looked comical. First, there is no plot. The actors seem to read off cue cards and do the stupid things. Like being pursued by dead people, but still wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, not as nearly as fun as any of Romero's work, which gets it in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was that they showed flashes of the video game in action sequences. As we don't get the video game, it's about shooting zombies. Also, all 20 somethings, some know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming for the gun. And the way people die is so stupid. It's as if they are running out of ammunition, so wait to jump up. And when they are in front of the house, they run out of ammunition instead of opening the door, so stupid. <br /> <br /> FINAL THINKING: If any of these actors appear in another movie, then they are blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst movie I've seen for years. A B movie on cinemax is better.
