Dissapointing action movie with an interesting foreground: A young mafia killer (Chandler) has to prove to his boss that he is a good man for the service, so he goes to California to teach with a well-known professional killer Beluschi ). First and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee) who is strange to them all. But is she an easy target? The movie continues and further based on this main idea, but the result is only bad routine; even the strange twist to the end does not save the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I give it a 4 (four).
