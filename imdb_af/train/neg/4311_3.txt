I watched this movie when I was a young boy who was full of raging hormones and it was about as sexy a movie as I have ever seen. It might not be a good movie. My guess is it wasn't. I don't really remember it, telling you the truth. I just remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any movie ever did it to me like the amazing sexy Cathy in this movie did. I haven't seen it since the first time I've caught it on TV in the 70's and I don't think I want to see it again, because I'm sure it will be a disappointment. My hormones are not so furious. and I have become more naked over the years. Still, when I think back on the landfill, I still remember how well it came back. <br /> <br /> Last Added: After watching the movie again, I discovered it was dangerous to go home again. What is erotic once is pretty easy now. The older woman-younger man still works for me, not as much as it ever did, probably because I'm no longer a 12-year-old. The older woman is now younger than me. The amateurity of the whole thing was not considered by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> Morals: Sometimes it's better not to reconsider the past.
