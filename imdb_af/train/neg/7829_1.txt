The beginning of the nineties brought many independent films, a specific subgenre whose semi-spiritual desert crime movie is. Other notes include "Wild by Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn," and to some extent "Natural Born Killers". Good movies such as the "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns on the Radio" and this unreal surreal masterpiece "Under The Hula Moon". This is a comedy aimed at achieving a certain emotional tone, but it remains to the point of irritation. While the quest for the spirit world of the desert and the farewell to Chris Penn are good ideas, the movie is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie and it is not enough focused to laugh at really a comedy not to be. I won't blow the end, but let's say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of genre cancer. These are the dregs of indie mania.
