I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on recycling bad movies and leave the classic alone. We can only hope. While this remake wasn't a total waste, I still wish I had returned the six dollars to go to a DVD of the original. Much violence and one of the worst endings I have ever seen. This version does not add anything new. It just repeats why Hollywood has to leave the good things alone.
