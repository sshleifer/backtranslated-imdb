You can pass JMS and boys to this one, because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still subpar. Don't get me wrong, B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever, but if I was a exec who watched this movie, I wouldn't have ordered the series. I don't like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are stupid, and there are tons of cliches. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately put a fire in the series and it was a wonderful spectacle. If you're a B5 fan and haven't seen this movie, see it. If you're not a B5 fan, don't ... you don't want to watch the series.
