I must say I was disappointed by this horror movie. I didn't even get scared while watching it. It's not very exciting either. I could guess the end half way through the movie ... So ... what's left? <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a proud and scary movie. I wish other movies would stop copying (eg, the trademark: long hair). Please give me some originality. <br /> <br /> Not recommending this movie.
