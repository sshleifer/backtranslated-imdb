This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Not only is the dialogue terrible, it never ends. You will think it ends, but it is not. How long is it, 140, 160 minutes? I don't even know. I know I will never see it again. It was as if someone had taken a romantic comedy, exhausted the comedy and then decided to drop the romance and hit us with the pile of shit that could take the road to the screen. But don't take my word for it, find out how awful this movie is.
