What? You were not aware that Scooby-Doo struggled? Well, you can also not be aware of this little movie directed by Victor Halperin, who also directed White Zombie four years earlier. It will probably make the second zombie movie. <br /> <br /> No, don't look for Dorothy Stone to uncover her breasts as you would expect in most zombie movies, and don't even look at any brain. It's 1936, you know. <br /> <br /> So, what you will see is typical of the period - lots of talk. <br /> <br /> You see Dean Jagger (Twelve O 'Clock High) and Bela Lugosi's eyes, but it's about it. Zombies in Cambodia, indeed!
