Where do they get the money to make such movies? I mean, there's nothing about this movie. Not one of the actors is known, the writing is terrible, photography is vague, the story varies between a bad version of Repo Man and a Nicklodeon Western and the play is incredible. For someone who watches all sorts of movies, good and bad, I have to admit that this movie is about the worst I have seen since the 50-year-old's attack. I don't really like the effort of people trying to create entertainment, or forbid heaven, art, but this movie doesn't seem to call anyone. The story contravenes a mystical infection of a person who is a bad version of the Celtic Soul ether, although it functions more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones. The bad guys have to go with the good guys in a village where they can't escape. Take it from there as this is the best part. My advice is that unless you are in bad mythology, amateur writing, unconvincing plays and boring settings, you will be best served by letting this one on the shelf when you rent videos.
