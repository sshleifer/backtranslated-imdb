The movie started well enough. It has been a co-shot by a glowing green meteorite, superpowers (telekinesis, x-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, ability to talk to dogs, superspeed, heat vision, and ability to grow large and fast) and the fight against crime. From there it is already downhill. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man gets a costume from his mother, fights with resident gangs and encounters lots of gang leaders who help you end the disappointing, long-term, and stupefying end. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so remarkable if it wasn't like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience looks up while the fighters just keep dancing. <br /> <br /> Despite all this nonsense, the movie has good points. It clearly states that if you try to take a gang alone, they will come back to your home and hurt you. It states that gangs and communities must see their real enemies (the great bosses they use to glorify themselves to waste honest people in a ghetto). It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community, destroying the predators they damage. The only message missing is that voters should ensure their officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush). <br /> <br />
