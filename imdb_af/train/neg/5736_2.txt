This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years! You can randomly pick 5 people off the streets and they can perform better than anyone in this movie. Absolute waste of time to see it. I just gave it a 2 as I like gory movies, but it's just plain rubbish. The acting (and I use the term VERY lonely) is abysmal, does someone please tell me that the 5 main actors have made their first movie ever? Don't waste your time watching it. Hostel was a better movie somehow. I can't believe anyone was spending money to do it. I hope for the producers that it only costs $ 50,000. It looks like a school project made by children who have no idea. Did it even make it to the theater?
