Now, what's wrong with the actors who participated in that crap? Michael Dorn has to stick to the Star Treck merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember him in Miami Vice? Did he keep it there ... Well, whatever - what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeblood lifeguards in the lead? Nothing, and that's what we get. None of the characters are equally nice, the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic for what is going on. I had the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to have a sort of "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" similar. Especially in the scene where all the important people have discussed national security in some sort of closet. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on TV, switch channels - your TV will always be grateful.
