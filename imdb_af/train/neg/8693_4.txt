I am from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and have lived in Arlington for a few years. This movie was far away as far as Arlington looks. I saw mountains in the background of one scene! Texas doesn't have mountains. I think this happens when a movie that is supposed to be filmed in Texas is filmed in Canada. The accents are also very bad. They had to get Texas actors to play the parts. There are many aspiring actors from Texas in Hollywood. However, the film is very sad because it is a true story. I pray that the murderer will be found and found guilty. The one good thing is that of her death, we now have the Amber Alert to quickly find missing children after they have been kidnapped.
