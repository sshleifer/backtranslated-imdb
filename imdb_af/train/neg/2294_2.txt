Poor Paul Mercurio. After landing Scott Hastings' role in Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to find a lot of rubbish. None of the characters in this movie are very unlikely, or even hateful, but Mercurio's head is the kind of person you prefer to ignore - completely inseparable and he wears GENERAL. Big mistake in costume design, that one.
