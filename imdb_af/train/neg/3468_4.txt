A student filmmaker writes a B-grade actress (a wonderful diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror movie her mother (a terribly dull Kylie Minogue!) Tried 12 years ago. It's a funny plot choice to say the least, since any Aussie horror fans know that the genre is unfortunately missing from women's directors. The film had a curse on it, because Molly had to kill a soul killer on the original set. But she's back because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people are dying on the "set". Cutting is an Aussie effort at the modern "slasher", but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, it's half of Wes Craven's 90-year filmography. Many of the movie-world names that drop a low "Scream" (except that it is Aussie's namesake - Jane Campion ... watch it not so funny) and lots of "is it really or is it a movie "? La "New Nightmare." The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughing, almost everything is bad about it. Fortunately, the movie can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the film crew tells the owner of the house who filmed them: "Don't worry, we'll treat your home as if it were us. own, "with which he responds," it doesn't matter to me, you look like you're living in a dump! "Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough not to regret renting this one. "You have a diet here?" (as she drives in the film professor's car) and "Does anyone know where to buy any tofu?" (the first thing she mumbles on the set) and "Where's hell my agent?" (Wait, that's what I think of her.)
