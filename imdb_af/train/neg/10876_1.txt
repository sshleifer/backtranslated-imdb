What the hell of a D-Movie was that? Bad acting, bad special effects and the worst dialogues / storyline I've ever experienced. The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop. However, the rest of the movie is terrible and boring. It's not even that bad, you can laugh about it. Just plain crap. And anyone who compares it to the Evil Dead Series can also compare Tomb Raider with Indiana Jones (well, ok, anyway, there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
