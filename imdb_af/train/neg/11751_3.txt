When HEY ARNOLD! The first time I came up in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite programs. Then the same episodes got over and over again, so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching. I was kind of surprised when I heard from HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE, as it's not nearly as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. Nevertheless, with nothing better to do, I watched the movie anyway. Going into the theater, I didn't expect much. I just expected it to be a silly movie version of a children's cartoon like the RECESS movie. I think I have what I expected. It was a stupid kiddie movie and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part the movie was a stinker. Simple for kids.
