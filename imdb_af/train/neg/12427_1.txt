I hated this movie. It was absolutely horrible, poor, poor, PITIFUL acting, REAL REAL REAL, stupid criminals who were not even LAST BIT funny (as opposed to the first 2 home movies that were very good). all the boobie falls are poor, pathetic excuses for poorly copied ideas from the first two that just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their salary did not exceed $ 20 a week. This movie is absolutely common, it's not worth even renting. Don't even worry! See your eyes more usefully by seeing the first two! I DO NOT give this 1 star (out of 10). Just trust me when I say, if you like the first two and you are not a complete stupid person, you won't like this movie, don't watch this movie !!!
