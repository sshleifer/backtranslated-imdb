It's your typical Priyadarshan movie - a bunch of nice characters on a silly mission. His signature climax gathered the whole movie from the movie and fought each other in a little swamp over the hidden money. Whether it's a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., Etc., the director is ridiculously predictable. Do not misunderstand me; As clich√©d and turbulent as she can be movies, I usually end up with the comedy. But in most of his previous films, there is actually good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri are remarkable). Now the hilarity of his films fades because he uses the same formula over and over. <br /> <br /> Songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks great. Rajpal Yadav is annoying, and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is OK, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
