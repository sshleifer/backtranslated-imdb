The first question that emerged was who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the Omen name on this movie? It is a shambolic, embarrassing, pathetic attempt to enter the Omen franchise. When the movie starts playing, music sounds as if it is taken straight from a Bugs Bunny Cartoon and from then on the movie gets worse! I don't know who wrote the script, but I said they had an E - when they took it back to show their teacher! It is difficult after a while to tell if it is a comedy, because what happens is so funny and so untrue to the original Omen, it believes faith. The acting is laughing, especially from the leading lady Faye Grant. she keeps silly faces or is it hard to laugh? It's hard to tell. The worst chase I've ever had the accident to testify. 1 out of 10.
