It has a good name, but it is and you don't get any money for it. In fact, the first 30-40 minutes of the movie may be a bit funny, but then the story goes from one side to the other. no specific reason and you just can't understand what happened until the action is gone. <br /> <br /> But producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I don't think the way he does it can be. call nothing but overworking !! .... period. The little child playing as his son has no sense of acting at all and I believe it was just a favor he did or something, because he had no idea what he did. <br /> <br /> For some reason, while deciding what they thought was that they could make it through comedians, but they didn't! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor is so bad, I don't buy it. <br /> <br /> But hopefully it's as bad as it gets. Accepting the DVDs to the good taste public will have to offer them food. Maka can work it out. <br /> <br /> Spouse
