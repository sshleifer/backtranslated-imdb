Oh man, this movie is bad. It flows terribly. The story is about a racing car driver who falls in love with himself and then promotes a chicken fast food chain and, while he does, doesn't love himself. He tries to get out of the contract and follows horrible, painfully uncomfortable gags. Jim Nabors seems to be sleeping, not acting. You will miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker. Loni Anderson's hair is just scary and proves that tons of hair spray didn't go out in the sixties. Or maybe it was a wig. In the film, Burt's wig wasn't bad. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and the Bandit 2". Anyway, this movie is the worst Reynolds motorbike, ever, ever, with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which unfortunately had no prosecution) are great, funny movies. This one is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a good actor, stinks. You will long for a Jackie Gleason-type villain who is fun to hate. And remember, it's not one of those fun movies to bag. It is mean, pure and simple. Even the outings at the end were tiring and boring, and worst of all, unfunny. And at least I forgot, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before his somewhat revival years later in "Boogie Nights", another movie that like "Redding" years ago shows the man can act very well if he has a decent platform to do so.
