Saving Grace is certainly one of the leading contenders for awarding an adequate film in the final few minutes of award. Of course, if you mix a spicy Cornish village - largely populated by retired cheerful ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain degree of ugliness will emerge. The last seven minutes of the film, however, are totally ridiculous and are not even redeemed by being particularly funny. This is a real shame, as this comedy has the potential to be as good as the 1998 Devaking Wake-up, which also depicted a picturesque little town, and its oddball residents are trying to get out of a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> Savings Grace's main character is the middle-aged, recent widow, Grace Trevethyn, whose husband's legacy of bad debt forced her to make money in an unconventional way. With her gardener, Matthew, she helps her horticultural expertise for profitable cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, it leads her into confrontation with local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . arriving at her greenhouse at the same time. The relationship and report between Grace and Matthew is well portrayed, and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved in her similar character - you can really feel what she's going through. <br /> <br /> The decisive role of the small roles is excellent, even though some of them are rather exorbitant. However, the transformation of Jacques, the drug master in Grace's romantic interest, is highly unreliable and does not fit in with the tone of the movie. And certainly hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growth? Unfortunately, the film exchanges soft humor for slapstick and ends up as fake as the dagga plants.
