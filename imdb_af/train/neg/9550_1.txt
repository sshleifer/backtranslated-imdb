After Highlander 2 (which I still deny), I thought it was impossible to make a successor who could make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, but this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames have at least some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this role knew nothing about computers except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she even watched the original movie. The acting is not even convincing. Save yourself, under no circumstances watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't switch off the TV. THIS FILM WILL FIND YOUR LIFE.
