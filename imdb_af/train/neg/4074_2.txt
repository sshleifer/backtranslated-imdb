I expect the same excitement as I played on your grave, but I just wondered how you can even call it a movie (it's a mini-porn). It made me sick when the man was made to eat his own business. There is no story line at all, it jumps quickly from every murder. If you like to see a woman's naked or even human parts, then there are spots in the movie, and there is even a masturbation spot in the movie making it a porn and not a movie at all. I saw some silly movies in my time, but it's number 1. I don't want to look again. The actors even look bored during the movie to me, so they probably needed money to make this movie.
