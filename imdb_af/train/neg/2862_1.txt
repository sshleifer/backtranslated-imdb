Someone should send this Uli Lommel man back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him he knew how to make a movie? Can only anyone make movies these days? In the past, it always needed TALENT before anyone could make a movie. After I watched this crazy BTK movie and the others he made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor man has so many business films like me. Actually, I even think I can make better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the BTK Killer, except the names of the victims and the killer. IT'S THIS. Where did this man get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other deadly shit in the movie? It's a classic example of someone trying to attract people to see their movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely sorry. The only series of killer movies I will consider is WORSE is the lame "DAHMER" movie. That kid smoked so many cigarettes that made me uncomfortable. Whoever made the one must be shot.
