I absolutely love all the Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and wanted to make a movie made for one of his books. I knew there was no way to catch the movie even half of Robbins' magic, but after I saw the movie, I never read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does not include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love affair between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think better actors could definitely be chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie I thought their roles suited for Robbins' book descriptions were Julian's friends, in their five-minute clip at the beginning of the movie. Those who did not read the book can enjoy the movie, but as a great Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment.
