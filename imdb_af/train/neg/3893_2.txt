I thought the main character, the astronaut with the bad case of the runs (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.) could always get more movie work after being reduced to a puddle. All he has to do is get a job like the Blob. The premise of this movie is pretty lame. An astronaut is exposed to solar collector radiation (I think) and starts on a hot day like an ice cream cone. Not only is it a mystery, but he must kill people and consume their flesh so that he can maintain a kind of cell integrity. Huh? Have you ever noticed that when any kind of radiation accident or experiment occurs, the person immediately gets into a killing machine? Why is it? <br /> <br /> At night, the astronaut rumbles out of the 'secret facility' (which has no security whatsoever), and shares parts of himself as he goes. Apparently he just keeps enough memory to make him head for the opening screen, perhaps because he wanted to return to space. <br /> <br /> So start the part of the movie that is almost filler, with a doctor turning around with a Geiger counter, and trying to find the smoker by the buzz he gives. He killed a stupid Bill Gates fisherman, scared a little girl on the Frankenstein monster movie, and finished off an old older couple (punishing them for stealing some lemons). Then there is a short scene where he beats his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pot head and pursues his girlfriend. You might think that after she cut off his arm and he ran away, the scene would move. But no ... we are treated after about ten minutes after the woman hung in a corner and picked up in terror, although the monster was gone. All I could think was .. director's friend, anyone? <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is even louder than the rest. The smoker ends up in a heap of goo, and then ... nothing. That's it. It's the end of the movie. Well, that means at least there was no place for a successor.
