Short Version: Seed is not worthless. It's just distracted and inferior. And helpless. <br /> <br /> Long Version: If you've never seen one of the movies containing the vaguely defined "psychological horror" genre, this movie will surely melt your face apart. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The opening of the real animal abuse will be enough to open your eyes to the possibilities of brutality-on-video, and the (only) memorable gore scene that will be later in the movie may be more than you can handle . The climax will play with your emotions in a way that may have no other movie. <br /> <br /> But if you don't have much experience with the genre. For example, if you saw the right thing ... "August Underground's Penance," like me, you'll find it very difficult to stay awake until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have compared it to the video nasties of ancient times. I understand this equation. Like the video nasties, "Seed" is more violent than a mainstream horror movie and less subtle. But the reason why the video is still known to us is not just for the above reasons - those who are still popular have something special. Allow me to be ambiguous. I think you will understand: those who have trapped have "soul". <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "Cemetery," at an interview on the new DVD: "... we will never have more movies like this because today technology has exceeded imagination And the technology is cold, so many things will disappear because small movies like this will no longer be produced, today we have great, exceptional tricks that are very expensive but they are cold, today is a horror, a terror movie of this kind more than a million dollars. These films were not so expensive ... they are real effects, made with our hands ". <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison with old schoolgirls so seriously. But Crisanti hit the nail on the head. Even at their most seemingly exploitative, the best of the video nasties was a primitive "truth". And that's where Boll falls short. It's like he's seen the movies and doesn't understand it. Everything on the checklist is there ... BS about a statement about humanity, an obscene torture scene, etc. But it is, like Crisanti puts it, 'cold'. The gore is all CGI. The whole thing feels like scenes cut from other movies of different genres. And the pacing is so slow. Man, so slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting note: the one gore scene really reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough BS. Poor movie.
