After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece for my whole life, I'm now 37, but I never read the book. I'm totally confused about what I've just seen. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts discussed in the novel, as I am probably the most, but only by hearsay and quotes. Without this limited knowledge, this movie would be a complete secret, and even so, I was no longer educated about the 1984 story as I was before I watched it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side. .. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is wonderful, Hurt & Burton performs fine and the overall feeling of the movie is terribly grim and deserted. The prostitution scene was a fantastic dark film production. <br /> <br /> Now for the bottom, and there are many ... <br /> <br /> There is a war going on, at least as far as propaganda is concerned, but why and with whom ? Nothing is explained. There are some names related to (Eurasia, etc.), but they mean nothing without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what does he do? where does he come from? where does he work? Why does he change news reports? Why isn't he in front? Why doesn't he eat the food in the canteen? What does he drink through the whole movie? Why is he so weak and sick? Why isn't he being burned like the rest of the brain? What is the matter with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little story back would have been nice, no scrub necessary for those like me who didn't read the book. Without it, it's just a confusing and difficult art house movie that always keeps guessing about what's actually going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is unsuitable and poorly edited and the constant chat of The Big Brother screens blends the dialogue into places that make it even harder to determine what's going on. I assume it might be an artistic choice, but it is very annoying. <br /> <br /> Also, I know it's been mentioned before, but why is all the nudity? It just looks completely free and felt it was thrown in to compensate for the lack of any plot coverage. <br /> <br /> I personally can't tell the way Hollywood feels, it should explain word lines for word these days. We're not all with brainwashing simpletons, but it's a few steps too far to the other. I can only imagine that it relies entirely on the fact that you have read the book. Because if this film is really the "literal translation" I saw many people say, I would find it very difficult to understand why 1984 is welcomed. as the classic it is. <br /> <br /> It is not denied that it was light years before its time and has so far predicted every change in our society (perhaps it was a kind of bible for the powers that are?), but many sci-fi romance players did the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline. <br /> <br /> I think I should do what I had to do from the beginning and buy a copy of the book if I make sense of it. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed with something I've been waiting for years to look.
