I'm sorry, but it's such a bad movie it's hilarious. Soccer hooligans that slow down in a travel home? Apply? Shades?! Alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made it, it is as far from the truth as you can get. <br /> <br /> The foundry was atrocious ... Gary Oldman as a soccer fan? He doesn't look frightening, frightening, or even emerging as someone who wants football. And what about Yeti? What the hell? Success, shades and sits in a travelodge childish to deceive each other with "it's about time you've been lazy." Please. <br /> <br /> And the Yeti's gang spray the ICC's underwear? <br /> <br /> I don't see how anyone can even take this movie seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. It is perhaps the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties hooliganism I have ever seen.
