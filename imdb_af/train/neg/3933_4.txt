A great pressure on release with Australian audiences can still be funny today, but his political injustice and blunt, impeccable humor can make it a bit scary. It's far too long; some of the <br /> <br /> content could be saved for the successor, Barry McKenzie holds his own, desperately needed new things. Admittedly, his worse Aussie attitude is funny, but also gets annoying as the movie draws. Some say Crocker's songs are the best pieces, and they are definitely original but "hilarious"? The adventures of Barry McKenzie go down as a landmark in the Australian cinema, but we must do everything in our power to make sure overseas audiences don't see the majority of Australians as Barry McKenzies (or, perhaps, Mick Dundees!) . Rating: 5/10
