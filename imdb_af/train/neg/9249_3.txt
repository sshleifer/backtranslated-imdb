Looking at the movie, I'm not sure what direstion it would be. There's a reason why a writer doesn't have to regulate his work and even have to do it, you can't do it all. I really suffered the story in this movie, as the director wears so many hats. Mrs. McTeer is the movie. To add to her incredible talents, her portrayal of this woman was why I was involved. Here is a British actress who can do anything. According to me, conflict is a drama and a wonderful story. I felt this movie didn't have it. Everything was a bit easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles that the chahracters couldn't find what they wanted. Watch the movie for sweetness, but especially for Mrs. McTeer's brilliant show.
