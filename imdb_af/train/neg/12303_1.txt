This movie is so bad, it's good - in an unintentional funny way. I couldn't stop looking, I laughed so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, a suppressed minister's wife who runs for Luke (Corey Sevier), a brave and mysterious drifter who eventually taught us in prison; However, the only thing Sevier is guilty of is badly acting! Note, he is no worse than the other actors. You get the feeling that the actors have no idea that they are in a very horrible movie; they play it straight. Everything about the movie is bad: the acting, the script, the love stories, the pacing, the plot twists, the choice of music. The climaxes are just as ridiculous - first the shooting in the church, then Luke's last words to Emily - I cried with laughter. <br /> <br /> Luke apparently has a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison, and we get a lot of his naked body. It's probably the highlight of the movie.
