The film is based on a true 1950's novel. <br /> <br /> Journalist Colin McInnes wrote a set of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "City of Spades" and "Mr Love and Justice". I've read three. The first two are excellent. Last, maybe an experiment that didn't come down. But McInnes's work is highly regarded; and rightly so. This musical is the author's ultimate nightmare - to see that the fruits of your mind are turned into a glittering, badly-active, soporific one-dimensional excuse of a movie that says it captures the spirit of the 1950s in London and nothing do not. <br /> <br /> Thank you Colin McInnes wasn't alive to see it.
