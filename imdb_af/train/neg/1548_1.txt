Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has no business at all to produce movies. <br /> <br /> You would think that after such ominous "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads" he started to get the idea that he might not know what he does when it comes to movies (and many will say he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to television). I try to make feature films from sketches that welcome them the third time it's been done on SNL, not sense. <br /> <br /> I personally like Tim Meadows, and think he'll be good in the right movie. . It is a pity that a talented man is being wasted in a film that is indecent in the indecent situation, and it all falls with a terrible bad song and dance scene. Any laugh here will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny. <br /> <br /> At least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never do movies about them. . It's just bad that this one made on the big screen.
