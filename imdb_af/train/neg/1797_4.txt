This movie has a very difficult to swallow premise, even according to these genre's standards. We are asked not only to assume that a record being played back can bring a dead man alive again, but that the record also contains hidden messages, specifically aimed at one child, when the singer had no connection with the boy when he was alive. Of course, no way to know on whose hands the record would end. Anyway, the movie is fun for a while, but ultimately the smartness and the futility are the highest. If they really are trying to create a new Freddy-like horror icon, they were far away: the villain here has no personality, no motivation, and no variety. (* 1/2)
