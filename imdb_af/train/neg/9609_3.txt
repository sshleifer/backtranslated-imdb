I started looking at this movie, expecting a barely tolerable Hammer horror movie wannabe ... and I wasn't far off. There are a few brand new gores, and they threw a lot of nudity, but the last half of the movie has some ironic twists. Holy cow, they actually put a little thought into the story, and did not fall completely into the predictable things one expected from the beginning. And dare I say, some of the "free" nudity was not so free, because it fits in with the story and the environment. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, it's still generally a bad movie, but like bad movies, it's a shadow that is more intelligent than the VERY horrible tries like Mesa or Lost Women and Robot Monster.
