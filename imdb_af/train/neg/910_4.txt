The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contains a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring. Some of the audience was nice to find it funny, but I like more intelligent humor. <br /> <br /> There were several well-known Swedish actors in the movie and their performance was decent in light of the writing. Lena Endre was good as always. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the original movie, so I can't tell if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie might be worth watching.
