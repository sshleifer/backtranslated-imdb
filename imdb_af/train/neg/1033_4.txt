I grew up on Scooby Doo, where are you, and I still love it. It's one of my favorite cartoons with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This show is good for kids, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect like Scooby and Shaggy), the theme is tolerant and it has fine animation. However, this is disappointing. I don't usually give Scrappy, but if he looks like the main character, it quickly becomes annoying. Complete with the catchphrase Puppy Power, Scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual. Also, half of the gang is missing after the first year, somehow it didn't feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and story lines were generally lame and inexplicable, very few monsters chasing or unmasking the bad things. Overall, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get an idea, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voices, theme and the fact that it's fun for kids. Bethany Cox
