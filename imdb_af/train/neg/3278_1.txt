I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get along with the times because the new "Dukes" movie is a modernized version. PLEASE. If it is so modernized, Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN website also said (and I quote) "You have to have old fogies over and over as it is." Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24, so I'm a long way to be and OUR FOG, and I won't get over it, it was a fright to anyone who is HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing right in the movie was "HAZZARD." Wash all the curse, smoke and drink really needed. The role was terrible. Jessica is on several morning shows to discuss the movie and honestly I believe everything has gone in her head. She is by no means a Daisy Duke, a fluke, but definitely not a Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not Bo. They had included the original cast as at least cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn't approve the script. I mean people come, even today's actors and actresses give a negative opinion. So why give some of your positive remarks.
