Two houses, one street, one telephone center, one car, a girl next door, a boy next door and a zombie. This list of ingredients should suffice for a large horror movie. All you need is some blue light, surrounding music and ... done. Not in the hands of the Dutch director of Rouveroy! <br /> <br /> I like to organize "bad movie months" from time to time. The concept is really simple: get some liquor, get some movie-friendly friends, and immerse yourself in the worst movie. For such an evening, this peace of peace is one of the best. Laughs guaranteed! <br /> <br /> The bizarre thing is, of Rouveroy still defending her movie as if it was a great achievement. To be a witness of this, you need to listen to the DVD's commentary track. Again: unbelief and laughter guaranteed!
