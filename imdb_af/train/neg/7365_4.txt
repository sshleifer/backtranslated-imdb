Not a bad movie, but not so big a movie. Kirk Douglas has recently been released from the prison safe, which, after rejecting a mob offer, decides to pull out the work himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem follows. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves mafia goon Romano Puppo, as well as trapped in a very goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinite patient friend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo is moving fast and there is at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence that includes Puppo & Gemma. Although an Italian production, it seems that most of the filming was done in Germany. Douglas is good, not just in a Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a tremendous achievement. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who passed in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
