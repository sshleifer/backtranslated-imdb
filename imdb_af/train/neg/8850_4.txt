Now this movie is not going to scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons. Two big reasons and one smaller one. Well, these are three reasons, this is not. <br /> <br /> The first reason it's interesting is the special effects. I found them to be very interesting and somewhat spectacular. To see how the hair grows on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was creepy, especially if they participated in a Monday in Trois. <br /> <br /> Important is the fact that this Marsha Hunt was the famous "Brown Sugar" of the Rolling Stones song, and that she was in the notorious nude scene in the London role of rock music Hair. <br /> <br /> In addition to the special effects, there were also two other points in the film. , and they were repeatedly issued during the closing credits. I lost count, but I swear that Sybil Danning wore at least a dozen times, and perhaps more, the points for the closing credits. They were the most outstanding feature of the film.
