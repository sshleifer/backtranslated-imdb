This movie was bad. Bad acting, bad direction, bad writing. But it wasn't bad in a funny way. It was bad in a boring way. I watched "Surface to Air" because I thought it might be a laugh. It wasn't. Don't make the mistake I did. There are many more pleasant ways to spend an hour and a half, such as looking at paint or reading the dictionary. Seriously.
