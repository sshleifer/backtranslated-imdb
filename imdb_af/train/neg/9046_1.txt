Now for the truth, its very bad story - for a Walt Disney movie its total rubbish. When the robinson appeared, the movies across the place shocked, how poor it was. It looks like "Alice in Wonderland" went wrong! It feels like they were short on ideas, some have merged a little rubbish to try to get away - and they don't. Then I sat there and wished. My younger brother lost halfway through interest and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after the robbers appear, you don't care about the end, you just want the movie to be finished. It's a movie to forget, and quickly forget. If you have time, don't waste it.
