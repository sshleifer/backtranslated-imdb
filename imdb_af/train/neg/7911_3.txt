It was not striking enough to be really horrible, it was just incredibly lame. The story wasn't half bad, but the performance was just awful. <br /> <br /> To begin with, it went too fast to get emotionally involved in what's going on. It was just bad. The dialogue was so sparkling, just plain and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, quite clear, make Deadpool boring. How to sow Deadpool? He wasn't even funny. He wasn't crazy. He was just an annoying man with a few swords. He didn't even know how to use properly. <br /> <br /> The Gambit was boring. And since when did he have tele-knowledge to just let the cards float and fly, or super strength to jump hundreds of feet into the air? And what was the roof with all the stupid helicopter movements? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist within the kingdom of physics. A round top staff is not a helicopter blade, you can't fly fast. Which Gambit couldn't do anyway. And neither is Deadpool, especially if it is used as a replacement for real combat choreography. <br /> <br /> And this film proves that wiring should only be used by combat coordinators who know WTH what they do and know better than using it in each one. single. shot. as a replacement for real combat choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of the physical fighters in Marvel comics (Logan, Creed and Wilson), and some of the worst combat choruses I've ever seen in recent movie memory. It was as if the stunt coordinator had just shrugged and left it to the special effect guys. <br /> <br /> And then you had the outbreak, with all those mutants who didn't do anything. Even mutants that were shown in their cells to have powers (nice to see a Quicksilver nod), did f-all when they came out. Only Emma-really-lamb-for-this-film-Frost and Cyclops did something. <br /> <br /> And since when was Logan so beautiful? And the stupid, "The bullet will take away his memory." Don't you think Xavier and the X-Men would have seen the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they radiated X1 in X1? I felt sorry for Liev Schrieber's husband, he actually brought in a good Sabretooth in the light of the letter. He felt one of Marvel's more simple supersinks. But he couldn't save the film from his own epic lameness. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this was the "Daredevil" level of suction. Good story, good actors, absolutely terrible execution.
