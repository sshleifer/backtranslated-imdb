I've been a fan since his first album. This film is indifferent to him. The performances, except one by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, are just awful. <br /> <br /> Those by Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony, and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying. Even one of the McGarrigle sisters was devastated by the so-called harmony of Martha Wainwright. <br /> <br /> I have never seen my wife get up and get out of the room before and I found myself coming up quickly to come up with the few maintenance segments, which was also difficult to look for the poor camera work. <br /> <br /> There is much that Mr. Cohen's songs, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson can interpret, but the people chosen for this performance were just awful. <br /> <br /> Hopefully there will be another effort to capture Leonard Cohen on film that will illustrate his insight, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> So sad
