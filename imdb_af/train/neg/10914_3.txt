Isn't it hilarious as an average shot that leads a pathetic life, suddenly has something extraordinary magic to him, turns his life upside down and causes him to learn some valuable lessons along the way? The formula never gets old, does it? It's such a safe fire way to make a classic movie! Just look at big hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... It had to be Rob Schneider's mindset when he made semi-successful Deuce Bigalow: Man Gigolo and followed it with The Animal. As I have already found the plot by sarcasm, allow me to color it more: Schneider plays a loser policeman who is suddenly involved in a tragic accident, but is rescued by surgery ... through a loop vet who pick him up with animal parts, causing him to jump like a horse like a horse, such as a cheetah, and so on. This movie is slightly more fun than other Schneider flashing flashes (like another hot-chick-like plot following The Hot Chick), but it's almost as if they want audiences to hate it by a realityist as a romantic lead (Colleen Haskell from Survivor) and placing a como by Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... just doesn't exist. Sorry - nothing memorably good except the production value. I just want to end this review by saying that small references to other movies in a movie may be good, but when it comes to the lines delivered exactly the same way ("You can do it!"), There is a word for it - "milk." In fact, here is another word - "cheap."
