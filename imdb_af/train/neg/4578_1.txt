Another cult strikes again. It's not a devastator, because the END termination comes after examining the people who brought this overly long, pseudo-scientific infomercial ... Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. <br /> <br /> When any religion / philosophy needs To hide behind an OZ-like screen of fraud, I walk away. Thanks Ramtha I watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a "friend". Wasting valuable resources on this New Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they "really believe they can walk on water" enough to lead the "logical" conclusion ... in other words; walk, drown ... or stop :-) As a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" on the entertainment value, especially to create the most unspeakable character in film history (the photographer's roommate ... eeeeeek !). If you have to watch this movie, borrow it from one of the broken people who recommended it.
