How did comments like the one who was the head of high school girls even made it on this site, it was the stupid movie I have ever seen, it was ridiculous, how could any moron be there and just say it because a movie make you jump it is a good movie, it may be the most idiotic thing I've ever heard, i can sneak behind you and go boo and it'll let you jump, but that doesn't mean I'm qualified to film, not to mention, "they tied everything to the end" is not a good reason for a movie that is well received. What kind of movie would it be if they didn't connect everything together, I think would make it a half movie, not a whole movie. So basically this idiot girl complements them for finishing the movie, and I love how the youth of today's media and production companies keep such a high standard. No wonder the political system of this country can get away with what they want, we have idiots as it emerges in our country, what will happen if this girl actually leads something, it's a terrible thought. Get a life and watch a real movie once, try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront or something, and don't comment it was boring after you saw it. Use just what little brain God has given you to analyze it is a bit.
