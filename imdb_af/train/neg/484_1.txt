I was disgusting for this movie. No, it wasn't because of the graphic sex scenes, because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This movie does not hold much truth about her and her art. It shows one piece of artwork she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows that she was a witness in the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you understood the movie, probably not, Tassi wasn't a noble character. He raped Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not insist that he accept false rape charges to prevent her from suffering while she was tortured. According to the rape statements, he continued to claim that he had never had Artemisia (whoever had sex), while repeatedly saying, "This is true." <br /> <br /> I encourage everyone to go out. and find out about the real Artemisia and see what she really is about. Don't base all your knowledge on this fictional movie. I encourage you to do research, Artemisia really has an interesting story behind her and a wonderful work of art. <br /> <br /> Don't see the movie, but discover the true story of Artemisia.
