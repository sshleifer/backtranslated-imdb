Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Crossed by Sylvester Stallone and starring? It had to be enough and had too many rock climbs, vertigo, fall and scene-cold villains and a broken airboat. There are two plots, both lame. The one involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people destroying a plane for booty, and where possible killing several innocent people. The usually trusted John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the mere horror of the product, is reduced to sniffing and calling those whom he doesn't care about, "Bostid!" in a vague approach to an English accent. Unfortunately, Janine Turner, who was sharp and enigmatic when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, was wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot. Stallone is chair and muscle head. No deadlines in this one. No living lines.
