Positive Terrible George Sanders Vehicle, where he goes from a thief to the police officer. <br /> <br /> While Sanders was an excellent character, he was definitely not a leading man and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely impossible. Gene Lockhart gave a little comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his rifle with a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Sadly, George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis have committed suicide in real life. After making a movie so sad, it is not shocking. <br /> <br /> The usual attractive Signe Hasso is really nothing here.
