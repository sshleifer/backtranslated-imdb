I decided to watch this series after seeing the endless ads on the BBC in the weeks before it started. I watched it despite the fact that I regret not writing the pretentious kind of stuff Alan Hollinghurst wrote, but I think we have a case of emperor's new clothes with the writer's work. I admit that the play is excellent, it is beautifully shot and I was fairly entertained by it - but I found that the storyline was very thin and looked at all three episodes, feeling very dissatisfied with this rather empty production. The "explicit" gay sex the media has drunk has been done on TV several times before - so it wasn't shocking, I'm scared. Full points for production values, but low for storyline / content I'm scared.
