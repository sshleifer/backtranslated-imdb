A poorly written script with no characters. As if it were a comedy, I forgot to laugh. There are about 2 conceited friends who are scams to allow women to sleep in their bed (no sex scenes) and another friend (who is half-divorced) who is sometimes also scam but mostly considered the man who mastered. The 3 friends meet and fall for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow it is done without any romance. The 3 guys stopped being friends because they dated her separately. She shocked them from their friendship because they beat women. - A bad movie
