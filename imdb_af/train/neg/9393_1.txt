Really, truly, abysmally, garishly, awful. But the actor Clayton Moore (the movie Lone Ranger) makes himself skilled as an actor. He's the only one. <br /> <br /> A rare treat, for five minutes, if you want to move the depths of grotesque transparent special effects, the south of California as "the moon" (again and again) acting so wood-like that it may can be a spoof. . . except that it is clear that it is not - no humor here except inadvertently. <br /> <br /> The dialogue can be worse than any of these other aspects, and the costumes. . . Well enough. Plot? Which plot? Bad guy, and his henchmen, including his earthly agent, called Krog (listen carefully if you suspect it is a spoof on the name of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc) and his incredibly clumsy favors (which, however, have handguns that never have to as well as Commando Cody, so there are numerous firefighters). <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
