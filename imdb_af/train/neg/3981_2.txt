This movie really has no beginning or end. And it's really amazing. Mary-K and Ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing list for an Italian fashion company. But for some reason they are erected in a 5-star hotel (conveniently across the street from the Coliseum), and all the other interns they work on are just as abnormally fashionable as they are. One thing I found obvious in this movie is the way one of the twins does not end up with the guy. I think they were trying to turn their usual plot a bit. Good try.
