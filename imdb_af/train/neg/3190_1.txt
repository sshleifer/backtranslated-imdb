Jimmy Dean couldn't have been hammy or absurd. Hysterical as it is seen through the eyes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I consider a 10. I mean, the face of this obese, wheat-feeding pork around Malta should be enough to send you to the vomit, if you make it far in the movie. This ugly hysterical farce should be placed like the "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go to Bangladesh". A-gulp film like this proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc. At the back of their relationship, or stoned to the point of madness. It asks the question "who was so stupid to fund such a whale?" But then, if good judgment prevailed and "Final Justice" was never, then we wouldn't have the wonderful spoof stamp in "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
