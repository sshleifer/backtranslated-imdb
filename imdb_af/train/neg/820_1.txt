What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very enigmatic script? Were there any pieces that were deliberately left out? And how about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this hidden story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a terrible performance, accept such an ungrateful role? <br /> <br /> The Domino principle wants to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and miss the point with a very wide margin. A big freak by Stanley Kramer.
