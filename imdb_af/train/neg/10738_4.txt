It was a blind buy used DVD. It killed a nice buzz that I went when I played. <br /> <br /> It's bubble-headed comedy, but that's about. dingy. The plot is ZANY! But the characters do things that are so small and disturbed and conveniently confronted. I finally got it depressed to watch. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the box leads me to expect something more than an uneven, goofy caper movie. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box and the Oscar nomination mean nothing.)
