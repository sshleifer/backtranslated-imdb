I didn't really love the first "Cube" movie. It was a good idea, but the annoying acting and characters always liked me too much. Didn't really have the need to see his successor, but when I heard they made a third movie that would act as more of a prequel on the original. I was intrigued and thought they might solve some of the original issues and give us a memorable movie. Well, I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> Introducing "Cube Zero" well enough to introduce us to the two characters in charge to maintain the never-ending maze of skins bothering the people in the Cube. The filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men's daily routine. There are several questions about the reason why people are sent there and also the true nature of those who run the whole operation. All that is left entirely to the viewer. The acting was a bit poor, but the film's first half went relatively well. <br /> <br /> With the story moving, one of the two "watchers" begins to seriously doubt what he's doing. And later decide to go and help a group of people trapped. Here is where everything starts to dissolve quickly in dull cheese. <br /> <br /> By the people running the Cube program, we are introduced to the character "Jax". Along with his two mutuals, one major reason why this film fails. To start with "Jax" look and talk more like a third screen that was completed directly from a James Bond movie, complete with the overall "popular" glass eye, it only destroys the atmosphere created by the first half's relatively good pace. What's more, it starts to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie. With some incredible grain lines, the writer might get bored and don't mind. The acting self humbles to a further low when the former "viewer" meets the group in the Cube. The whole interaction is painful to watch as everything else follows. <br /> <br /> Again, not to impress anything other than bad characters, dialogue and acting Cube Zero, it's time for those looking for a good horror movie.
