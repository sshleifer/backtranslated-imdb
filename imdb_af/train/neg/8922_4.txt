Two old men sitting on a park bench. I didn't really have a problem with this scene. Only problem is that it's not a scene, it's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yup movies no longer have a low concept. They are no longer boring, but there is worse to come because these two old men are lime and cheese. One is Nat Moyer, who is Jewish communist, while the other Midge Carter is a former gold gloves champion who is also black. Now let me see, a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench get along well. Well, I think it's probably unlikely, but if this movie has such an unofficial scenario, why does the Jewish stereotype play? Why do they make heartfelt, tribal crochet hooks that take Hebrew oath? Something ironic that the Jews saw at the beginning of the movie is exactly the kind of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s. Stereotypes aside, moi dearz, the problem, with the fact that I am not straight is that it is written for a completely different medium than theater, it is based on a stage play and it shows. Walter Matthau sleeps through his role as Nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie
