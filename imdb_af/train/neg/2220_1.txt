What is hell in your mind? This movie sucks! Every minute I get more and more bored. I tried to watch the end, because I hope something will eventually happen! But instead I wondered how dull the end was treated. What is this story about this bloody "boeyman"? How does he not die? He is a bloody man for the sake of God! A mere boy who killed his stupid sister 15 years ago. Then what? His stay at a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This movie is a fascinating fool ... It's a necessity of folly. I'm going to sell it now to a stupid guy who will understand this silly movie.
