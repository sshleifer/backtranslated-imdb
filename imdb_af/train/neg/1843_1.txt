Wow. Simply awful. I was a fan of the original movie, and put in relentless part 2, 3 weeks and improvement. 4.5 and Freddy's Dead was pretty bad. But nothing is as bad as Freddy's Nightmares. Freddy acts as a Rod Serlingesq host of this anthology series. <br /> <br /> I can accept how Freddy has become one punch line to another, but at least in the movies Freddy's appeal was the movie, but here it was so poorly made, they looked like high school productions of a horror series. Of course, the poor actors, if you really want to call yourself, were exactly what they paid for. I'm almost sure it was a stopping point for two kinds of actors. They just started with the Hollywood teachings, brand new willing to take part in preventing them from getting the porn work they hosted last week, or seasoned actors on their way to the Hollywood-ready ladder any part that will take place I considered half Dana Plato as a guest, but she was already dead when in production. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Nancy's line in the original Elm St, "What you're trying to do not fall asleep."
