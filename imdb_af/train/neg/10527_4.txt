I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOPs. And this one is surely an OOP. One year after The Exorcist, she was back in business with this movie, but what we were all new to was that Blair's career never broke out, she never became a megastar. That's one of the reasons many of her films are OOP. She gives a good performance in this movie. It's about a rejection that is not recognized by her parents and has no friends. Played at the age of 15 to play a girl of 14, that's funny. The film is also known for the rape scene in the showers where they hold a broomstick on her virginity. In most issues it is cut out, why I don't know, there is no blood involved, ok, Blair is naked naked, but nothing is shown, no T & A is so nothing to insult people. But the movie is slow, very slow. It's not happy for me, but I almost fell asleep. It is just about the 14-year-old who becomes a rebel against society, but no blood flows, nothing does nothing. Why it's categorized in the horror is still a miracle to me. If you are a Blair fan, buy it if you find it different, leave it as it is.
