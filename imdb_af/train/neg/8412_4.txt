I saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was really underpressed. Despite all the Oscar buzz, it's nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed with this movie never bothered to see any of the real movie music classics. Apart from Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a glorious TV movie without style or flair. Just a lot of amateurs sing against each other! <br /> <br /> Now the first half hour was good, but I was annoyed by how Eddie Murphy's tremendous raveup actions were cut and interrupted by montages. It was easily the best songs and best performances in the film. And the "rise to the top" part of the movie was the only part of the movie that had a consistent view or momentum. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, turbulent mess that wasn't realistic or fantastic enough to be interesting. It was also visually dull and included too many audio songs. <br /> <br /> Condon didn't try to turn any of the songs into big shows, as I expected. Each number in the 2nd half was just one to another of the people who sang together. And the way they shot Hudson's big "love me" number was criminal! Condon just shot her around the stage - no drama! God sucked it! <br /> <br /> And knowledge to everyone involved - that 'singer-speaking dialogue' might work on stage, but it doesn't work in movies (see embarrassment of Evita and Phantom). All that "I'll help you, I want to!" Shit should be left in the room of the working room. It's not a song. <br /> <br /> Again, the movie - besides Eddie Murphy's incredible performance - was nothing more than a glorified TV movie. There had to be megabucks behind the PR work for this movie! I wonder how much money was spent giving it what the Oscar buzz premier player is ahead of? As a whole, this movie, except Eddie, was NEWS NEWS an Oscar caliber movie! (except for Eddie) I'll arrange it upright with Grease 2. GREAT disappointment, especially after all (very precious) hype!
