<br /> <br /> This movie sucks big time. It reminded me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I found very boring. And "Semana Santa" is an even poorer movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Only one in the role that something for this movie does is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the great old ladies in European film history. I loved her maniacal appearance in "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time with this movie. I'll say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
