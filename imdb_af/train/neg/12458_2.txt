The performance of this movie is so simple and clear that only a Texas millionaire who contains oil and whiskey has a problem understanding it when someone shouted it over the proverbial parking lot. In summary: the oil business is in cahoots with the government (or Gummint if you prefer), the Gummint is in cahoots with Middle Eastern despots, and the CIA is a simple fortification pool of double-acting boys-of-(add word) To show any line that comes their way. The only people passing by are the good ones, like Mr. Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is a result of the poverty that causes globalization when bad multinational companies are looking for a good takeover or three. It really fits in with the profiles of the 9/11 offenders. <br /> <br /> In Syriana, this flabby fabric of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is awakened in a deviant vermicelli of twisted, twisted and twisted story-strings of their own insignificance until the poor viewer alone left with the conclusion that: <br /> <br /> 1. the "director" (good joke) should never be left near a camera <br /> <br /> 2. people like Clooney and Hurt can know how to act, but they probably don't know how to choose a script <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to see a movie dealing with big business corruption and the state, watch and see Claude Chabrol's L'ivresse du pouvoir, who has been informative, funny and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Empty, doom-loaded centre's piffles spun to the evening-ruining length.
