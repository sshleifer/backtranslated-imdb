((NB: Spoiler Warning, as it is!) <br /> <br /> First, it's a 10-inch movie - the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs put it spicy . If you're looking for Roshambo, it's not and it's not going to. I was desperately implied by stitching his cinematography, directing or performing. <br /> <br /> Second, it wasn't Zuniga's first horror movie, it was her first screen appearance, theater, TV, whatever. For what it's worth; neither is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn. <br /> <br /> Third, you even need a lame slasher flick prop. Certainly, it follows the deeply insulting formal message of his genre: any young woman who is interested in sex is on the hoof, and harvest time is now. <br /> <br /> Besides this one, the heels of the lovely virgin protagonist too! Now there's a mediocre teenage death movie that has the courage of its beliefs! Interestingly, this is the only role of the film. Another one got the miracle, except that the term gives too much credit. <br /> <br /> (Again, this movie probably has one of the highest percentage of single-film actors in history. Of the nineteen credited actors, a little thirteen have never appeared in another movie. appeared in the same movie in another movie, just one one except Zuniga has as many as six screen credits. What was this, it was and never was a mutual aid association?) <br /> Admittedly, I did it I've seen long ago on the nightmare when I was bored and never expecting it to get bored again in my life, but I see no reason to hunt everyone involved and put them in the incinerator with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
