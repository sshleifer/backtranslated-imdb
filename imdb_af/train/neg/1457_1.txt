I watched this movie, and all I can say is that it's low budget rubbish and that it has nothing to do with true history facts. Actors' actions are very poor but this is the result of limited observation possibilities. Anyone who watched this movie is probably thinking of Hitler as a crazy, slim, lunatic who runs a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that over the years there have been much better movies about Hitler and Germany and that the rise of evil is much below average. I can recommend the German film Downfall, in which you can see the brilliant performance of Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in a role of Adolf Hitler.
