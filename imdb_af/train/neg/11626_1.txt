It could be the worst show I've ever seen. Apart from Hitler's tastelessness, it's just not funny or entertaining. It is very similar to a 1950's sitcom in its cornball humor and confronted situations, but while it is going well like Love Lucy, it's just not funny here. I think the show was based on the novelty "look, it's Hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure" but it just got flat in every way. The man who plays Hitler is so hammy that it's hard to put it alone. I wonder what the network might have made, think it was a good idea to fly. I thought America had a tasteless performance, but the British beat us this time. America will never take a seat over Hitler, although we have shown it to Lincoln's slave, The Secret Diary or Desmond Pfeiffer. Chances are, you'll probably never see this show, as it only broadcast one episode and probably won't be released on DVD.
