To challenge this virtual reality, the potential of computers, communication with the past, the constant struggle for identity in a society, and the fascinating Ada Byron Lovelace portrayed by fascinating Tilda Swinton, this film had to be good. But it's mean, terrible if you consider the potential! The acting - apart from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - is from tolerance to horror. The plot construction is uncomfortable to say the least - the modern programmer is a dull one-note character, but half of the movie is spent compiling her character. When Ada finally appeared, it was to tell the events of her life, not to present an engaging story (Swinton pulls off almost). You never know her as a real person, but just an icon of a graduate's history. <br /> <br /> The digital effects, such as a digital dog and bird, are mean and distracting as it was 1997 and not 1985. And finally, the writing is bad. Bad, often pretentious dialogue - especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend who made me shrink - cold and distant characters, and no attempt to create a sense of wonder. The programmer successfully contacted someone in the past! Amazing! But it hardly seems to surprise anyone, and her boyfriend says, "Be careful." (Although we are not later or later why it is dangerous, it is never dangerous.) <br /> <br /> Despite computers and Ada Lovelace and her love of mathematics, no one is involved in the writing had any knowledge of mathematics or computers - any references to these subjects come as a complete mumbo jumbo that convicts any suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> One scene, at the end of The movie is pretty good, a monologue by Tilda Swinton expressing her sadness about the fragility of life, but her joy in that life. I'm disappointed in this movie because it's a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult movie. If you find the topic interesting, you may want to rent it, but be warned. See Orlando for another much better exploration of gender roles in history with an excellent Tilda Swinton performance. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler / question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Ada, asks that her memories not be preserved (in what I thought was the best scene in the movie). But then it seems the modern programmer does it anyway, and transfers the memories into her little girl (hence the title of the movie). Am I right that the programmer violated Ada's wishes without struggling? Or is it another confusing plot point that I misinterpret?
