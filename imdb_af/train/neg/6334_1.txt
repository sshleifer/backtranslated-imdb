I saw this movie in 1979, I was 17 or 18 when it was released. The theater might be 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes in the movie, me and the friend who went with me to watch the movie, were the only two people in the theater. The movie was very weird and didn't have a plot or reason for his screenplay and people asked for their money back. We decided to stay for the whole movie .... why endure such torture ?? ... here's why. We wanted to be true film critics. Having a standard to base all other movies is hard to justify saying you've seen the best movie (a 10), they always get better. But it's easy to base all other movies of the worst movie ever made (and that's it ... a 1 at its best). There may be other movies that really qualify as a 1, but I don't need it yet. I now base all the movies I see on a scale based on the worst .... I AM A VALUE MOVIE CRITICAL ... he he.
