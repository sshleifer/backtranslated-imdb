Robert DeNiro plays the incredibly intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it's really disgusting. The writing is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, not a funny one. The film moves at a snail's pace, is photographed, and is unpredictable preachy. This also includes every click in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what? <br /> <br /> Just as annoying is this new IMDB rule that requires ten lines for each review. When a movie is worthless, it doesn't take ten lines of text to let other readers know it's a waste of time and band. Avoid this movie.
