This movie is still chewing on my leg and thinking about it. This movie was not only bad as in low budget, poorly behaved, etc. Although it certainly was all those things. The problem with this movie is that it deliberately tries to annoy the viewer and do it with great success. What I want to know is, is it supposed to be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely terrible, but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be. I could see that the first segment was anxiety and failure, but what is hell the second segment? It's just irritating. The third segment is like watching an artistic movie, making it incredibly the least painful segment. It's a horror that this movie is not so low on the bottom 100, so get your votes (1/10) with people !! I know some people have given these good reviews, but they are in a sadistic attempt to deceive you. Believe me, it is impossible to keep this movie. The only benefit of this movie is an incredible life extension. It feels like you've been watching this movie for years after only the first half hour passed.
