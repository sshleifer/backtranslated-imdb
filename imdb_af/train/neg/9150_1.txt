I made the big mistake of watching the whole movie a few nights ago. God, I'm still trying to recover. This movie doesn't even earn an average of 1.4. IMDb needs 0 voice ratings for movies that really deserve it like this one. A 1.4 is too high. <br /> <br /> I heard how horrible this movie was, but I really didn't think a movie could be that bad, especially at this time and time. I figured out all the nice god, horrible movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s. I was wrong with my god. Trust my people, this movie is really so bad. It's quite awful; it is past pathetic; It's beyond any kind of word I can think of. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like Best Picture of the Year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND (which until now has been the worst movie I've ever seen) seems to earn some Oscars compared to this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I can't seriously believe the creators of this movie were thinking. It was a legitimate serious attempt to produce a Hollywood movie. It is not called a movie. In the first 25 seconds of the movie, I seriously thought I had been watching some high school theater classes to make a short movie. Or better yet, I thought it was some Saturday night. Live ripoff skit of the right thing. I mean, it looks exactly like that. The acting is terrible; the whole movie looks almost like it was shot with a 20 year old VHS camcorder. the special effects ....... good liar Bewitched from back in the day has better special effects than this movie. The scene at which he is shot at the door is rather ridiculous and cheesy. I mean seriously, my Intro to Acting class 4 years ago in college, we all could have made a better movie than this. And the worst part of the whole movie, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh my god, I almost got the side of the house. I had a strong stomach, but wow it was terrible. Some people should never be naked, and he is one of them. The plot of this movie doesn't look anywhere. They are talking about legal issues that we never hear again; Ben talks about getting into music we never hear again; Arthur says he is looking for work and money for college and the next thing we see is that he runs a porn shop. Everything about the movie is just awful. <br /> <br /> It really doesn't have much to do with my criticism, but just as everyone knows, I'm not a gay man. However, I support gay rights and believe we should all be treated equally. And I would support any gay person in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this movie, who seems to be thinking about every other word. (WHERE IS THE F * (# * WHITE?) Hahaha But I didn't want anyone to think I hated this movie just because it was about two gay guys, it didn't matter: it would have been just as terrific of a movie as it was Ben & Jill instead of Ben & Arthur. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say. , it was even WORSE when I read it, be it a warning for everyone: ONLY watch this movie if you just want to look back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century can still be. watch and actually expect a good movie or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you. <br /> <br /> At a final thought: How in the world there are 7 movies in the next place IMDb is placed there is no way there are 7 movies there is worse than that!
