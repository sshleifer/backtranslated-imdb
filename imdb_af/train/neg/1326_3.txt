Irrepressible dribble about Christ's second coming in the form of a hippie and albino that Sandra Locke looks at. You have no idea what happens on the screen, with the annoying theme song "Suzanne" being played over and over by the movie until when "The Second Coming of Suzanne" is about you, you already know it hard, no matter how hard you try to forget. the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Jared Martin, this off-the-wall luminaire film maker, is making the film of the century, but is so rude and stupid that no one in the banking world is willing to fund his project. Housing goes to his own Logan and sees this couple at a cousin and is fascinated by the young woman, Suzanne, Sandra Locke, who reminds him of someone he knew in another life: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> With Logan's assistant and general gofer Clavius, Richard Dreyfuss, somehow a $ 7,000,000 loan has been funded to fund Logan's masterpiece. He started working on Suzanne by flattering her talent as an actress to interest her in his movie. This leads to the fact that Suzanne not only leaves her boyfriend artist Simon, Paul Sand, but later Simon gets so depressed and feels alone and takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brain out. <br /> <br /> The movie also has two somewhat unrelated subplots in what has to do with a young autistic girl Dorothy, Kari Avalos, who has been cured by Suzanne to everyone else, at the psychiatric hospital she dedicated was, failed. It's not really known exactly what Suzanne did at the hospital, but it was kind of orderly or voluntary there; was it supposed to show us in the audience that she, like Jesus, can miraculously heal the sick? <br /> <br /> There is also this newspaper columnist and Grandman businessman Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who is going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or has seen a biblical similar vision that changes his life forever has. Sinclair was looking for the meaning of life, as well as all that is about the whole movie and wanted to know why there is all this suffering in the world, like this movie in which he is, and he found the answer when he first found. put his eyes on Suzanne. Sinclair also beat in his head when his private driver David Mark Rasmusser, who has become sick and tired of his strange and crazy hallucinations, is almost rocking in a kamikaze like a ride along the Pacific Ocean. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Second Coming of Suzanne" continues with a number of unrelated rows, probably filled or filled in a while by the director and film editor, and then enters the final scene " A Christian crucifixion on a hill like Logan has all the cameras rolling. It seems that the mad Logan was so carried away with his masterpiece than he was trying to repeat on the helpless and tied Suzanne, the actual crucifixion of Jesus Christ, about 2,000 years ago. <br /> <br /> Hard to sit by and almost impossible to follow "The Second Coming of Suzanne" brings you through the same kind of torture that Suzanne spends through Logan and the film makers. The movie is trying to be arty, but it is just an excuse to cover the mindless and non-existent storyline and even worse the awful and amateur actors of all in it.
