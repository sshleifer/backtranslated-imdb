I grew up and looked at TNG. Recently, I watched the entire series of ST Voyager on DVD, which made my aversion to this episode worse, as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be stronger. The idea could have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, and this was probably dealt with by VOY. They could have had memories that would be "new" to the audience, rather than just repeating old performances. The in and out transitions between the "memories" and the "presence" in this episode start out as clich√©s in the beginning, and become very unbearable as the weary pattern carries over and over. Bar not worst episode ever.
