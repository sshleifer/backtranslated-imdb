The hardest thing about this movie is to say something positive about it. The characters were stereotypical white-trash, the movie's "plot" was hit from the beginning and the worst feature of this movie was that the nakedness doubled from the body, it was funny. Unfortunately, this was the only funny thing in the movie. Mrs. Jenkins will be better served if she remembers her life story in the future to "entertain" people. It was just so bad. The one positive aspect of this movie (it has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the movie) is that my brother figured out the money for this stinker.
