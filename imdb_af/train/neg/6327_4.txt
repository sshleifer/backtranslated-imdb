I thought this movie would be much better than it was. It sounded like a spoof of the spy owner, and the beginning of it reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this movie became short. <br /> <br /> The plot is just too ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia began a spy school to teach their spies how to act like Americans, but the village they set up is a bit dated so they grab two US yanks for things to spit up. I don't know, but it just seems to be out there. It really gets strange when there is no Russian accent in this whole Russian town next to anyone. Someone screwed into the casting work. <br /> <br /> It's also painfully dry for a comedy. There is one, two funny spots, and they are nothing to sing and dance. The movie will eventually sleep you. <br /> <br /> And as a twisted punch in the face, this movie is so ahead of the US it makes me sick. The movie again and again, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the Japanese in World War II. These are movies like this that make everyone think the US is full of itself. <br /> <br /> It gets a 4 out of 10, and I'm friendly. It really should get one, but the dance scene was funny, but then it took a long time to really be funny.
