Barry, a medical transcript, correlated his thoughts from his work with memories of an abuse in the hands of his stepfather, Barry (the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). He spiraled into madness and eventually a serial killer. Good (in the form of a gay man) and evil (in the form of a naked dumb man) struggle for control over his soul. This movie is undone by some bad acting and unintentional humorous scenes. Not to say it's terrible or anything, just to say it's just as well known as it is because of Bruce Campbell's heady fan base (of which I am one) who is likely to see what he's into or involved with somehow. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Comment with Michael Kallio, and Bruce Campbell; Second comment by Kallio and Sound designer Joel Newport; "Hate every minute" a 17 minute documentary; deleted and expanded screens; alternatieve neem; excerpts, footage of the world premiere; Poster and silent gallery; Talent bios; and theater trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom: Screenplay in .PDF format <br /> <br /> 2 Easter eggs: lift the eyes for a laugh (left eye) and one minute nothing but a real easter egg (right eye)
