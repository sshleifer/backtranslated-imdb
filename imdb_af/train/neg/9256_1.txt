Pointless about a lot of half-naked men who beat and punch each other. That's it. For about 5 minutes we see it. It's shot in black and white with tons of half-name men running to hit each other on the song of terrible music. It looks interesting, but there is no plot and really - the violence inherent in it is disturbing. The gay eroticism is also played here, but it is not a good idea to mix it with violence. Some people who like avant garde material can like this, but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (unappealing) disturbing. Really - what's the point in all this? I saw it as part of a gay shorts festival and the audience sat there in a silence. I really wish I could go below 1.
