I can't believe it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed a few times. (probably because of how stupid it was) If someone paid me to see that movie again, I wouldn't have wanted it. The plot was so horrible, it didn't make sense and the acting was so bad I couldn't even say if they were trying. that movie was terrible rating: F
