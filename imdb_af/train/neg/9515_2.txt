OK, I watched the original French version. But I can't imagine it being better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that this is the most boring movie I've seen in the past. There is virtually no reasoning for this movie. That's why I can't understand all the positive reviews. It can be realistic in a sense, but some real stories are best left unexplained. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow-paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow, but allows introspection and, for example, sets the scene for the film. But in this case, the movie is filed only with a senseless dialogue that tells us little about the characters. Not what I could identify with or care about. In many of the scenes I thought to myself, "When will they keep?" The acting was pretty bad. Not in a persuasive obvious way. But none of the actors seem to care about their characters and they all seemed to want to be in most scenes elsewhere. This may be due to the uninspired dialogue they were given. The whole flow of the movie also feels very mechanical. Go from one scene to the next. It looks like this movie was just written (bad) but never directed. <br /> <br /> It's one of the few movies I can say, no emotional response from any of the screens. No tension, no fear, no expectation, no sadness, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest whatsoever. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what I call an anti-movie.
