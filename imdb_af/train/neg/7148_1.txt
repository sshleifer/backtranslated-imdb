Before I watched this movie, I had very low expectations and I will only see the cars. Eventually I even regretted going for that reason. Plot is almost non-existent. Character development does not exist. There were so many clicks and so much jawbone in the movie that I could just stare and wonder how it was released. If it wasn't for the exotics, I wouldn't even have rated this movie a 1. An attempt to destroy a coherent story line is destroyed by the absolute absurdity of this elite race cult and the laughable characters that make up its members. In fact, the movie's plot is so predictable and simple that an average child can predict most of the story lines. Bad acting, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> Don't see it. Play Gran Turismo HD instead and it will satisfy your thirst for quick sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
