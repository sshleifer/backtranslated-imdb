Here is another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband. Is this the only role she knows how to play? This time it was introduced in 1969 and she cheated with her husband on her husband. I'm not so surprised because it's so predictable. Then her husband gets angry and throws the milk. I won't be surprised if she slept with the milkman too. I won't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too, as this is a very boring movie. Then, after throwing milk, she says sorry and he sees the blossom again. Duh. Then, while she was making it with him, her son was shot by wasps. My mom always told me that I shouldn't throw rocks at a wasp nest. These kids mom didn't have time to tell him, she was too busy with the blossom.
