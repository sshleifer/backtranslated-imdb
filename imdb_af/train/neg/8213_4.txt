I can't believe it, IMDb really knows every TV program to man! I haven't seen this show for more than 20 years. I just remember two episodes, and I hardly remember them. I remember that Tony may not have been from the beginning, because one of the episodes I remember is the one in which everyone tries to get Tony to help, but he rejects them, but usually he gets to the end of the show member of Power House, with all those who rejoiced. <br /> <br /> The other one I remember is the one where Lolo pretends to be dead for some reason (with funeral and mourning). I don't remember why he is dead or how the show ends. <br /> <br /> It is one of the ways I convinced myself that I had dreamed because nobody else heard it.
