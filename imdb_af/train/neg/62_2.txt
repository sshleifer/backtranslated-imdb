SWING! is an important film because it is one of the remaining 1930s produced and produced 1930s films. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that it is uncompromising, but this one is pretty good. It is also a great opportunity to see many of the talented Black performers of the period, just after the boom of the old Cotton Club - a time all forgotten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the movie is historically important. and has some beautiful performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era - including a prima donna that will ruin the show and the surprise that is unknown, which is out of place to save the day. However, the writing is just god-fearing and a bit boring at times - and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit humiliating. This is because before the plot is really going on, you are treated to a non-account bum living from his hard-working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he gets caught (who, incidentally, totally survives this role), they have a battle that looks like a scene of WWE Smackdown! And the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor - a trashy scene! Later in the movie, when the prima donna wears constantly, her husband pushes her in the face and everyone is cheering him! The movie sometimes seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience. They can't even do it well - with some of the worst acting things I've seen for a long time. <Br /> <br /> Yet, if you can look at a common production in almost every respect (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), it can be worth a peek, so you get great singing and tap dance can see. - and a look at the forgotten Black Culture. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the acting - it's really really bad!
