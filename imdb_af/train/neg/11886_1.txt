Watching Josh Kornbluth's act in this movie reminds me of my fellow TV production class, where the 'not funny' had the chance to just prove how indecent they really were! <br /> <br /> OVERVIEW is the word that comes to mind when trying to syncopate this wannabe comedy. The jokes are sophomoric and telegraph. The delivery is painfully bad. Ouch !!!!!!! The writing is simply dorkish. It is related to a Bob Saget show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as a one and a half hour Saturday Night Live skit (to Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hate this movie and want my money back !!!
