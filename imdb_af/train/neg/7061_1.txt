I'm still trying to find out if there's a point on this movie. <br /> <br /> For content that is supposed to be so "rebellious" and "controversial", the things Maddox spreads to students are terribly lame. Students easily look through vague anti-authoritative sentiments and bits of words that are scratched unfinished on leaves. Rebel, everyone. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion where a school fire alarm doesn't come up. <br /> <br /> Apparently a "big battle on soccer fields" is a two-person battle. <br /> <br /> Characters' personalities seem to be randomly changing. A soccer jock that fought Maddox (and later had a staple on the face), smiled and excused the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that it doesn't come to the real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could be specially made in half an hour after school. If they cut most of the pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
