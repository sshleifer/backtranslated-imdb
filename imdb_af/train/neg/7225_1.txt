I put through this movie and I just have to say it could just keep my attention. The movie would have been a bit more tolerant if I didn't see the terrible CGI, for future reference to the industry if you're going to use CGI, watch it so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Apparently it's supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen, but everything I saw was a bad movie that didn't match any graphic novel whatsoever. <br /> <br /> All in all, the story was not as bad as the CGI, I was quite impressed with the acting and thought the casting was good and little more character information would have been nice because it gave me a little confusing, but it's not surprising as I said it just kept my attention but I honestly wish I had given this one a miss.
