The treasure Island DVD should be viewed in any film production course! This is a textbook example of how to NOT make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the author / director's comments graphically demonstrates the enormous gap between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication is not complete if the audience does not know what the director is talking about. The director's alleged purpose is to make a movie of "Hollywood Conventions". Among the conventions, unfortunately, consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often do not understand where he intentionally avoided a "Hollywood cliché". However, he never understands the idea that clichés exist for a reason. They are briefly to convey quick and clear complex ideas. It's good to avoid them, but they have to be replaced with another way to communicate the same idea, not just eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing point of view, rich in potential. Two puppets are awarded to create a personality and background for an unidentified body used in a disinformation mission during World War II. Soon, each one begins to fill their personal fantasies with character and their invention is becoming increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood Convention" of traditional storytelling can create a wonderful movie with this idea. This movie is definitely not! The dolls do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, I am increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the vibrant body. In a number of mopet films he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
