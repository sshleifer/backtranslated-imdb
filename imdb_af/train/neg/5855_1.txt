The movie released at the beginning of 2000, with MELA, both saddened them to start such a millennium with such a nonsense. <br /> <br /> The movie looks 70's, but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000 <br /> <br /> Anywayz some classic gems from the movie: Paresh Rawal I don't understand to laugh on his roll or cry. Reason: He's looking for his mother in town. The worst part is when he realizes Anil's secret, he keeps the secret in his stomach. that grows and makes him pregnant. I remember in my childhood my teacher having the same joke Urrf !!!! As a child I laughed the time there. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a joke can't explain. We have Anil in a dual role (One older and younger) and Rekha plays the parent's wife and Raveena the youth We also rejected Harish while Shakti plays the son of Aruna Irani who both fight who has the worst wig. <br /> <br /> Direction is outdated. Music is bad. <br /> <br /> Anil tries to look hard too old in the younger role and too young in the older role, but good effort Rekha is adequate, Raveena is also good. Harish is bad. Shakti Kapoor is terrible. Aruna Irani is as usual. Rajnikant is good at a cameo.
