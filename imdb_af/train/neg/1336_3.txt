This movie was definitely not one of Mary-Kate and Ashley's best movies. I really didn't like it, and I was disappointed in that movie. For some reason it looked like it was a movie that really made them fast. In some parts it has become so boring that I have to progress. It had no bloopers or exciting parts like their other movies.
