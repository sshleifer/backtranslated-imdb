Without a doubt, it's one of the worst movies I've ever lost money! The plot is, sorry, I said there was a plot? The frightening moment was when ... can't think of one! The best special effect hiding under the bed cover was ... and I can't think of it either. You knew who the killer was right from the beginning. There was nothing scary about the whole movie. In fact, the only two vaguely interesting pieces were when you saw the child sister Misty in the shower and when you see Nurse Toppan take her up. Just watch this movie to get an idea of ​​NOT making a horror movie !!!
