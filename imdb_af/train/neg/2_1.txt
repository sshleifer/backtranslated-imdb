I saw that the capsule commentary said "great acting." In my opinion, it is two great actors who give terrible performances, and with zero chemistry to each other, for a good director in his everyday worst effort. Robert De Niro must be the most ingenious and informative illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance is uncomfortably floating on the map, as she clearly does not deal with this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like is too fast an adjective for this movie's turbulent pacing. Although the film's intention is to cure an elevated story of illiteracy, it is a true "bummer". I give it 1 out of 10, really one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level I've ever seen.
