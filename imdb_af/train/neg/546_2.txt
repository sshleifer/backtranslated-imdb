The two points are dedicated to Akshay Kumar's reasonable performance. I know that Bollywood movies aren't really trying to be realistic, but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and doing what any good parent does ... kicking his son from the boy with his PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow: 1. Priyanka a cool indoor pool in the bedroom 'and to go hungry in her in-laws? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stuntman, bitten by rabid dogs, to just walk away. This movie is an INSULT for our intelligence. I really can't believe I contributed financially to the people who made this movie by seeing my family see it. We left the cinema with a frown. Please don't subject yourself to this mess It takes my advice and doesn't waste your 'waqt'.
