"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related, and the Demons 2 is cool hip horror 1980 classic. "Demons III: The Ogre" is very stupid, bored, cheap monster. I am very confused about the author being "Demons III: The Ogre" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti is a poor quality writer and stupid who is the bored William Shakespeare ghost or demon's egg of Spider's web or who makes Huhuhuhuhu's girl dream ). I'm very sorry, I bought The special DVD box called Demons on the 3 different movies called Demons III: The Ogre, The Other Hell and Black Demons don't have closed captions and subtitles. is $ 14.99 from the Best Buy store in the city of Downey. Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a poor-quality writer who makes the silly movie almost like Halloween III does not have Michael Myer monster, but the people wear Halloween. I'm very confused. I really love "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 is better the boring stupid" D emons III: The Ogre "is not part of" The Demons ", and" The Demons 2 "is the same demons. <Br / > <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
