It is a terrible remake of a marginal but well-known, early 70's movie. I saw the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute movie that is filled in 2 hours or whatever it is expensive. Cheesy storyline, incidentally, is quite different from the original. The great government's involvement was far-fetched. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In the original you can get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up. <br /> <br /> It took just a few hours of movie time to change the oil pan on the car. It often takes longer than this in real life. Car guys are watching these things. Also, the fool or fool who chose to dirty a 1968 Charger and a 1970s Challenger must be shot in the heel with a dull bullet. The fact that they are not 'car people' is painfully obvious, and passing them will not be sad. <br /> <br /> The actors had no emotion, everything was cut and dried. One step above a monotone. A Barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, the radio DJ made the statement that the Challenger had reached the bulldozers at 180 or 185. This is total refuse. Can you say aerodynamics or lack of it? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Don't waste your time watching this one.
