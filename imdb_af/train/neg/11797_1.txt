Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 dollars for rent in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, it will be the biggest regret of my life. Who ever thought of this movie, or financed, deserves a kick between the legs, because that's where they thought when they made this movie. It's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic, and pretends to be foolishly trying to pass poetry. He joined him on a trip to the coast. Where they meet girls and so. Just the fat man doesn't get a girl. Skin spots do not irritate me, I take them for face value. But this movie is trying to be more than a skin patch. It's about Fat man, who is looking for love in a girl, but then meets another bikini silicone girl who enjoys his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball that gets money for his family and impresses the ladies, but he only has his lady. The dialogue is very terrible for even a C-movie. It supports a ton of black stereotypes, no character development, it's a glorified porn movie, without any pornography in it. Never watch this movie.
