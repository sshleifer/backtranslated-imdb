Although I am generally in favor of the well-made movie, I do not restrict myself to movies that escape those boundaries, and often I enjoy films that violate the rules. And it's true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established theater. But it is also my opinion that he does not break it successfully or at any real point. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work is visually crushing, but it is less of a question of what is actually on screen than it is filmed, and the sparkle of his films seems less of a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often prefers to use non-actors, and although many directors did so with remarkable results, Pasolini's direction is non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often contains images designed to shock, insult or otherwise disobey the audience. Such elements can often be used with frightening effects, but in Pasolini's hands, such elements rarely look like contributing to the film. This also applies to DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I'm given to understand, there are many people who like to admire Pasolini's movies. Yet I have never met one of them, and I have never read anything from Pasolini or his works that made the reason for such a taste or admiration understandable to me. To judge him only from his works, I believe he was essentially an amateur director who didn't have much choice because he didn't have the skill - and was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day. "existential boldness", thus simply confirming him in bad habits as a movie maker. I find his work boring, relentless and pretentious. And this also applies to DECAMERON. It is also unfortunately true of almost every Pasolini film, it was my accident to endure.
