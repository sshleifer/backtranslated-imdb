I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good score when I checked it on IMDb after I saw it. It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen very bad movies. It looks like a good movie in the beginning, but when he gets in the operation, I can't believe how bad it is. This voice-over destroys EVERYTHING! Just think you are cut open and then listen to what he says. I saw the movie in German, so I don't really know what he said in English, but ironic things like "Yes, it doesn't hurt". ... What is it? To tell yourself "think of something else" and then forget your pain just by thinking of your girlfriend is just ... stupid. And his mother ... how hell does she look like this? Someone told her, her son died in an operation (which had to expect his kind). Plus she found a few letters in Jessica Albas's pocket. plus she knows the hospital stuff ... and then it takes her a second to figure it out? What the hell? ^ And the end ... why do police brush them? The patient died in an operation, that's all happened. That drunk doctor also knows nothing else ... and then they all break, even the girl ??? Why ??? Despite everything I think, Christensen did a bad job, but it didn't really matter to me. The mistakes and stupid things I wrote above are the problem. I watched this movie with some friends and we were all very disappointed. As I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't just look at it;)
