I'm rarely moved to make this kind of comment, but after I have been through most of Rankin's horrible movie, I feel I really deserve the right to say what I feel about it! I couldn't really do it, and having become one of the half-dozen or more outings (about 1/3 of the audience) after the unfinished plot, outrageous dialogue and abusive characterization just became too much. This movie is all and no art. all style and no dust. It is delivered by terrifying plays, a really brave script, indifferent cinematography and student-level production values. how it funded, started and finished, is a mystery to me. I bet you a million quid it's never about general release. the right critics would tear it apart. a very bad movie. shockingly bad. a very really bad effort AND it's even without calling the free-to-be-born-kitten-in-the-fat fryer moment. completely meaningless, completely light, weak together; This movie is a terrible embarrassment to the British cinema.
