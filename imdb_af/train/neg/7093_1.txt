let me first say i watched this movie at midnight and usually there is only about a rubbish around this hour, but this movie broke the record. First of all the main character is an old, non-attractive, eager man, yet he gets all the girls coming in, for example, he goes to a store, talks to a girl and then you see them f * ck <br /> secondly, there are many sex scenes, and in many of them there is no nudity, I would not be surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say: quickly change your clothes so we can f * ck! <br /> <br /> Thirdly This movie must show what a sexual addiction to a man or a family can do. This movie just shows soft bad erotica. It makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such a trash.
