Fun and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another Gremlins clone to come out of the 80s. I'm not much of a fan of the imitations. <br /> <br /> First, it was the excellent Gremlins. <br /> <br /> Then came the very average 'Critters'. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the bad 'Ghoulies'. <br /> <br /> But the full wells will have to go to "Hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> Is there more ?? <br /> <br /> Now, 'Munchies' must fall between me and 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. Actually, I probably found it more entertaining than 'Ghoulies', but I chose the darkest tone. <br /> <br /> From the go-up, it plays its goofy nature (which is better), but because of the nature of the hammie play (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), you can rather be offensive rather you just see the munchies running amok. That's where the fun takes place. Mostly light-hearted fluff although the story is mainly on the munchies (which are hungry, horny and destructive) in a whole lot of supposed comic encounters (some moments work) in the little desert town as a few people are chasing. It's stupid, but incredibly magical thanks to the zippy pacing. The creatures themselves look rather slender and poorly detailed, as their basic dolls are beaten. Where their personalities come from is that they can actually speak ... and with attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and a fine Nadine Van der Velde (who were in 'Critters') were leading straight. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also appears. <br /> <br /> Entertainingly reduced entertainment for the tireless.
