It's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few movies. It's being portrayed as an art movie, but it's really a piece of garbage. It's a redeeming quality, it's the beautiful tango dance, but it can't make Sally Potter's disgusting obvious tribute. The plot of this movie is non-existent, and I guarantee you will start laughing at the end. Especially where she started singing. It is absolutely unreal.
