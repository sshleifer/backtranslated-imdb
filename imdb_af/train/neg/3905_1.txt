Forget Plan 9, it's the ultimate fiasco, a costume drama, improperly directed, written, performed, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's not so much better novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, are trying hard to get such a terrible script. Many mistakes (for example, when it snows in Christmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of evil name "magical realism", it looks like the worst movie of all time. It sucks completely !!!
