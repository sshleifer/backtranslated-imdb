Please do not drop the cover of this movie. And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at, it's not. Usually I'm going to be stupid if it's funny, but this stupid was so stupid that it made me (or maybe) dumb. <br /> <br /> The movie quality is better than a handheld, but not much, and it is quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard. These problems should never really be a deterrent to seeing a horror movie, but add this wonderful (whip) cast and you have a real blunder. <br /> <br /> The story is about a man who invites his friends to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He also extends the invitation to his lady in his office. On the way there they meet a woman in need, who is then invited to come with the other girls. <br /> <br /> Staying at the cabin includes sex and nudity, and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and strange objects come into the house. <br /> <br /> From there you (the audience) and the morons, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they start to mislead each other. Overall, I think I made it sound better than it is. The main battle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, confronted with the plot, acting bad and motivation clueless. Again, it can be forgiven, because it was the least funny, but unfortunately it is not. <br /> <br /> The turning end is just a breeze, because no one will guess it, because if you really thought of the movie it wouldn't make sense anyway. Please do not allow this review to prevent you from seeing the horror of this movie. (Woah, my nose just grew eight inches.)
