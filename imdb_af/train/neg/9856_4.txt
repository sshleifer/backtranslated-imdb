In the autobiographical narrative story "Romulus, My Father," Eric Bana of the "Munich" boasts, an impoverished German emigrant is playing struggling to get his son Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee) in the countryside in the 1960s. increase. The biggest stumbling block for the family's stability and happiness is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who violently violates her marriage vows by stopping shamelessly with other men. In spite of her highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to give her a divorce, which masochistically interferes in the hopeless hope that one day she will return to him. Unfortunately, this is the kind and kind-hearted Raimond who testifies to all this civil unrest - and that is his memoir that serves as the basis for the film (Raimond Gaita will later become a writer). <br /> <br /> Although I admire "Romulus, My Father" for what it is trying to do, I cannot honestly say I enjoyed it, because while the film is performing fine and serious intentions for it, it's simple not enough to counter the dour story and funeral pacing, leaving the audience as desperate and depressed as the people on the screen. A serious drama is one thing, but this unforeseen downward movement in adultery, madness, and multiple suicide (let alone suicide attempts) is another thing.
