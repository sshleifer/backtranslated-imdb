After hearing so many people about this movie, I thought I'd give it a go. Except that I'm incredibly slow, which I don't give, as long as the wait is worth it, but it's just not. As many others have said, there are so many contradictions and so much of this movie doesn't sound true. The response of the 4 men varies from shock, frightened to find the body to complete indifference while fishing. Certainly, if they were the kind of men who would happily go fishing, they would just have reported the body and said they only discovered it after their fishing trip. Why bind the body on a tree, go fishing And then tell everyone that you found the body 2 days before? Watching a movie is so difficult and knowing that the main characters' behavior is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the townspeople, you think at least one of them might show curiosity about who the woman actually killed! The body itself, naked except the knickers .... what scenario leads to it? If she was raped, why is it still the knickers? When she was dressed with the clothes, why did they remove the knickers? If she's not raped, why, take out all her clothes. Leave yourself with evidence to dispose of? I really can't think of a realistic scenario that would cause it to kill anyone to steal their clothes so you can fill your jumble hall stall! Oh yes, it's striking, but only and simply because, despite the poor writing, the acting is strong.
