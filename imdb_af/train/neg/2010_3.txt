Oh, that's the movie. I thought I waited too long to take the dog out. I can't believe I've seen the whole thing. I think I was optimistic that it would get better. Horribly divergent dialogue, pathetic acting, and totally unlikely events. As Toby's mother hung herself in time, it took Col to step up and back into a room with a 24 'ceiling and no chairs, counters, or anything around her motionless body that she could possibly use to climb into herself. The little girl who played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie, and the first couple's puppy was a close second. The basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director a serious creepy flick can be, but this version is unfortunately not. I get scared if I open my electric bill every month.
