When someone comes in a movie of this type of film, it's not without saying that an overdose of that big over-the-counter brain medicine, Suspension or Disbelief, is very powerful. <br /> <br /> Playing Jeanette MacDonald Two Roles: Anna / Brigitta, the woman who ignored Nelson Eddy since the beginning, but also an angel sent to earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction when I saw it was a blunt of "Hunh?" Where have I seen it before? It seems that I've seen it before, but made it into a movie much later than this one. DATE WITH AN ANGEL, a forgotten hope of liquor made in 1987, also wore a blonde wig in the ethereal beauty of one Emmanuelle Beart, who had no talk lines, and made life hell for soap actor Michael Knight. Much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra low 80's values, but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey. <br /> <br /> Anyway, not to expand, it's not an unforgettable movie and stumbles across information because it was the last time MacDonald and Eddy didn't good actors, but great singers, together would play the "innocence" and "clean cut" romance for which they were known. Then you need a cold shower, not because there are steamy scenes here, but to get rid of the memory.
