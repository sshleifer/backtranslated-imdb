If there is a hell, it contains a showroom in which GRAND CANYON plays over and over on an eternal loop. One would hope that the presence of so many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - will help Mary McDonnell look (whose bosom is watching her own films forever). . But no. Apparently they injected the other actors with a McDonnell's serum. The whole thing is pretentious, overflowing, insulting (if you are deaf or knowing who is willing to boil your blood on the ridiculous TDD scene). BIG CANYON is filled with unpleasant, self-confident people, but never gives us a reason to understand / understand / sympathize or tolerate. With exceptional exception, they are insatiable losers that the gene pool would be better off without. There is no plot to speak, no character development (these people will never develop), no outbreak performance and the most arguing you will ever experience in a movie. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? The title. It's a big HOLE of a movie.
