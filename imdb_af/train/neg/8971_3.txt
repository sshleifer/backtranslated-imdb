Following the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003) and the alleged success of the original Cube (1998), director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty to bring us the third installment in the trilogy, the prequel Cube Zero. <Br /> <br /> Deeper into the guts of a giant and facile institution, unfamiliar time and place, two acting operators, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) set up and monitor the behavior of people already worked. placed in a huge network of cubic rooms, some of which are tied to death. Explain that the people they observe are found guilty of criminals who have chosen this terrible and deadly trial of a deadly injection. These observers had no problems with their work until a mathematical genius, Wynn, discovered that one of the prisoners, a woman named Cassandra Stephanie Moore, had never agreed to enter the Cube. Suddenly it realizes that their work may not be what they look like, and that they can be part of something that is very sick and twisted. <br /> <br /> For those who have seen and enjoyed the original Cube, this prequel will probably not be to your liking. It's not that the story doesn't have potential; It's simply that the first Cube film never had to be expanded. Standing alone, this is a neat, psychological game with lots of interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message. It was also self-sufficient. The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystics of the original, trying to answer questions with more questions, but just really a mess of what is never needed to determine. <br /> <br /> What this new movie offers, which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil, is certainly good questions that need to be raised, but probably had to be done on their own merits rather than continuing a movie that has no such aspirations. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the other features of the movie, such as acting and direction and writing, are not terrible. There is a dark, dark look at the film such as 'The Matrix' and 'Dark City', and they certainly managed to regain the claustrophobic feel of the first Cube. Unfortunately for Barbarash it's not enough positive features to save it.
