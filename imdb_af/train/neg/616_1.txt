Let's look at it; some lame children who died and transferred his soul into a scarecrow. It won't happen! OMFG This dumb lost child who can't stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by a drunk bastard that screws his mother. As he dies, he looks at the scarecrow and he leaves his spirit in the scarecrow. The drunken man covered his death by making it suicide and thought he got away with it. We later see that he is thrown out of the trailer and later deserves another encounter with that scarecrow. They had a brief meeting in which the drunkman called him a loser and lost the scarecrow with one loser! The scarecrow flips the building, calls him "Daddy," and then holds the poor man. We can see how this wonderful movie comes from. He will then kill many people. He mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random people, just for a few laughs. No laughter here. He also adds a punchline to each victim. Every time he killed someone, he'll do karate flips and finish it off with one of his signature slips. In the case of someone who was hard of hearing, he would say, "Here is an EAR wheat!" then it shakes their ass. OR we can actually take an example of the movie! He just finished killing a policeman and was about to kill the only person who ever stood up for him. Her father, the sheriff, shouted at the crazy man to stop, and he said, "Hey, stay awhile!" and throw a dagger throw his chest and stab him on a tree. At the end of the film he killed two guys and threw them into the punchline "Gotta split!" and killed two guys by kicking a crook in their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me make my pants so worse. Maybe next time this guy makes a movie, it won't be gay.
