All the kids between the ages of 14 and 16 want to watch this movie (although you are only 18). They heard it was a very scary movie and they felt so cool when they watched it. I feel very sad children can't see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is. It was one of the worst movies I've seen in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. And the end? That's an open end ... why? Because it is impossible to compile a decent one for such a stupid story. This movie is just made to scare you, and if you are a little smart and know about music, you know exactly when you will be scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie was finished and I turned to my friend and told him (a bit too loudly) that it was a total waste of money, a blunt child looked strange to me. This day I can make an Oscar with a home video of my goldfish, if I just use the right marketing.
