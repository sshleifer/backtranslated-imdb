While this movie definitely possesses the sting of a bad movie, it is surprisingly visible on several levels. First, for old movie lovers, it is interesting to see the lead role of Dean Jagger (no relationship with Mick). While Jagger later went to a very respectful role as a supporting actor (even collecting the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), his performance is truly unique because he actually has a full head (I never saw him not so before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film. This film just shows that if an actor can't perform in his previous films, he can't finally learn to be a good actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A second reason to watch the movie is the precision of it all. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are blowing through the water, it is obvious that they are just on their way and the background is poorly projected behind them. Plus, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry !!! Horde continuity and irrepressible bad dialogue flow throughout the film - so much so that it is difficult to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to die in the movie - as they both played in many Grade Z horror movies . . In many ways it would be a perfect example for a movie class about not making a movie. <br /> <br /> So, while it's a 3, it's probably a bit overweight, it's nice to laugh and therefore short, it's worth having a look at bad movie fans.
