It wasn't the big disaster I expected, but it's about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie. I'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie, but I think it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I don't find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making them foolish on television, but then I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic talk. I didn't get bored to see it, but I never enjoyed it either. If you're in the mood to watch a bad movie, but one that isn't too painful to go through, it's a good choice.
