After reading the comments on the website, I felt compelled to subscribe for the first time. It seems like this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree, movies don't make sense to be pleasant (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to involve you with the characters. Now, while being completely absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus, I must say that I'm not Mr. Green or the other cardboard boxers who inhabited this dagglo world could not. <br /> <br /> Also, while so many people seem and try to say you didn't enjoy it, because you didn't get it, I won't have to differ. I didn't enjoy being bored. I wanted the movie to end and listen constantly to the quotes and it didn't stop. Call it smart if you want. I think it's repetitive. <br /> <br /> But my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no endpoints on the print of the movie I saw. Just music about black. Did I watch a Dud print or is this evidence of GR's pretentiousness? Or did anyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and remove their name?
