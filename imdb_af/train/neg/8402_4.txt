The three stooges in a feature length western comedy musical? Perhaps "Rockin 'was in the Rockies" aimed at combining the Stooges comedy briefly with the Western musical, in a matinee; if so, it was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is an attractive young hero; and, Mary Beth Hughes (like the blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as the brunette Betty) are beautiful women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; their songs are quite melodious; However, it's the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the movie doesn't sound exactly. There are a few laughs; but the Stooges brand of humor is more muted than usual. The talking horse is also underutilized. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
