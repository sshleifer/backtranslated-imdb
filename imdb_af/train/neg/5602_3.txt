"Pandemonium" is a horror movie spoof that comes from more stupid or funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedies. Especially comedy spoofs. "Airplane", "The Naked Gun" trilogy, "Blazing Saddles", "High Fear" and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not there with those movies. Most of the scenes in this movie put me in a dumb silence because the movie wasn't so funny. There are a few laughs in the movie, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all this movie is going to do. Geez, "Scream" has more laughter than this movie and it was more of a horror movie. How bizarre is this? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
