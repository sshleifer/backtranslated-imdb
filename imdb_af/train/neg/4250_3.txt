It's like other Dracula movies always do, the Dracula minions always on Dracula's side, which disappointed me at the end. Regardless of whether the person wants to remain a vampire or not, I'd like to see something like the first movie that the minion fights against her master. It's very interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) than just the priest or D. win the game (we need some surprising plots!).
