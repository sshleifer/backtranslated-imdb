This film rivals "Plan 9" as one of the stupidest movies ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Author 5. Stuntman, and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink has already done 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western 'stuntmen'. So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here's just ONE example of the movie: in the movie, the sheriff needs to witness another town for protection. Of course, the bad parents find out and wait for them. But what happens? The good guys ride along and a shot jumps out and hits a tree near them. When the camera shows us the bad guys, they all just sit on a log, chat. What's wrong with this photo! <br /> <br /> I can go on. Maybe this movie is meant to be a comedy. If so, it has not done so well.
