When I found this movie free from my work, along with three other similar movies. I then looked at very low expectations. Now this movie is not bad. You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood player, but for cheap tensions it's not that bad. I'll probably never see this movie again. In a nutshell, this is the kind of movie you will also see late at night on a local television station just wanting to take time, or you will see it on a Sunday television at a local television station trying to take time . Despite the bad acting, clich√© lines, and sub par camera work. I didn't have the desire to turn the movie off and pretend it had never broken into my DVD player. The story is often done in many movies. This one is no different, not better, not worse. <br /> <br /> Just your average movie.
