When I was at the movie shop the other day, I passed Blonde and Blonder, but something about it just seemed to be a nice movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people based Romy and Michelle before they saw it. Blonde and Blonder might just be another secret treasure. But when I started to see it: Executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in something scary. Not only that, but both of them considered to be the hottest warmth: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to insult them, but they did not age well and they played roles I think were more meant for women who Supposed to be in their 20s, not their 40s. The story was just bad and stupid. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are your exaggerated stereotypical blonde, they really have no idea when it comes to what is happening in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow wronged for murderers, the police are on their story and call the girls geniuses because of their ignorance. They were set up to make a hit on a guy, and they think they're just going to show him a good time, but the right killer is crossed and wants the case and kills the girls. <Br /> <br /> Denise and Pam just look very uncomfortable on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know it was the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it was stupid and just unnecessary. Would I ever recommend it? Not in a million years, the girls are just trying to keep their status as sex kittens at this point, which is more a sign of despair and Blonde and Blonder is a big blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
