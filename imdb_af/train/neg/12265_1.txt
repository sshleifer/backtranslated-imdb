The special effects of this movie are especially lazy and used in such an over-emphasized way that you cannot deny their terrible existence. <br /> <br /> The scene redefines the term "terribly persuasive" in the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff only "redefine". <br /> <br /> *** spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The charms of these films can be found in two things: First, the excellent cast of Carel "Lurch" Struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt, what can and when people will die and always be there. <br /> <br /> The second is original findings, the SF-Western combination is apparently original, but horrible, but other finds are more original, such as the armed man, Zack Stone, knowing the pain of the people he shoot. > <br /> Overnight ... see this movie, unless you love that cute Carel Struycken, like any self-respecting Dutchman.
