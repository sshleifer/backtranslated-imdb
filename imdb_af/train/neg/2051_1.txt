Since there was nothing wrong with the acting etc, the episode's script is over for this series of phantom or no ghost. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the martial hunter. You have to know that in the middle of the 6th series, no matter what happens, it's not true what is going on and really doesn't matter the story of the series except to meet the Martian man hunter again and to To waste 30 minutes to do so By far is another case of bad writing in the soap opera of Smallville. I really like the show, but mainly because of the cast and the 3 or so good episodes every year, but what ever should be done on the writing that is working or accustomed to working on the soap, must be canned. It was by far one of the worst. With the first 4 minutes you know what is happening, skelk and anything happens is a dream based on Clark's application that is naturally caused by a ghost zone character and when he wakes up, he will win and blah blah blows so the authors should not really create a villain who progresses the storyline any week. May also add a villain to die in the last episode that was the martian man hunter and let him fly or return and tell Clark he forgot to watch his sunglasses closer to this episode and call it a day .
