About Christmas break, a group of colleagues remain behind to help set up the dorms that are broken down and replaced by apartment buildings. To make the work a little harder, a murderous, Chucks-bearing psycho wanders in the halls of the dorm, acting in various violent ways on the group. <br /> <br /> Registered as one of the 74 video nasties' listed by the United Kingdom in the 1980s, the Dorm who drove Blood built a good reputation before the first viewing. The term 'video nasty' strikes some images of some great explicit gore, violence, sex, etc. In: All the things about a horror fan dream. So, after hearing all the information, I settled in Pranks (alt. Title), expecting a messy slasher experience. . . And that's what it tried, but almost failed. Visually, the movie is not good. The cinematography, gore (except a few scenes), and overall direction fail. It's just not fun to look at. The unoriginal script is missing and often throws random things without any real reason (such as the opening death). There are some cool dead scenes, including a nice, beautiful face melt (which can be seen on the poster), but it's about the positives. The play is pretty bad, the story seems unimportant, the killer is not cool or scary, and it suffers from the one big mistake that a shooting fly should always avoid: it's a bit boring. Overall, for a movie done by some UCLA film students for $ 90,000 (which is more than double today), the Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a complete mess. It has some good things, and is fairly viewable. . . But, as a slasher movie that looks like movies like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . it just can't be compared. Don't expect much, and at least you're entertained. I hate to say that, but it's one of the few movies I've seen that would actually be better with a remake. . . And yet they go to great works like Black Christmas. Oh good. . . <br /> <br /> Mandatory Horror Elements: <br /> <br /> - Subgenre: Slasher <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some brutally cool deaths and the gore are okay for the most part. . . but nothing special. They also shielded some of the best killings. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is a little unpleasant (after me) nudity, but not much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Nah. The finite monologue (s) of the killer made him / her fairly uncool. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: A jump-start or two, but nothing too effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I suppose, but I just didn't mind, and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> Final verdict: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
