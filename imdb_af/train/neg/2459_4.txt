Obviously I don't care about things that come (such as "the shape of things to come") as much as most viewers. That means there is a good chance you will enjoy it more than I did. In any case, you may find it helpful to hear the movie described from another point of view. <br /> <br /> Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who had as much experience as a production designer and even more than an art director, it is a film adaptation by HG Wells of his own novel of the same name. In my eyes, it helps to demonstrate why a great novelist will not necessarily be a good script writer. <br /> <br /> The film was opened in 1940 in a London "Everytown". War breeds and the citizens of Everytown are worried it can reach them. Do this. And it becomes a decade-long thing that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies continue to jump in time to show different scenes related to war and its aftermath. We see two pilots, one of them, ending the effects of their battles. We meet a post-apocalyptic community dominated by a will-clerk. We meet a man from an emerging futuristic society. We see how the technology changes. And finally we are taken to the full realization of the futuristic society around 2036, where the leaders discuss the merits of sending the man to the moon. <br /> <br /> It may sound very exciting, but it just doesn't work like a movie. Structurally, the film is too episodic, with little to tie it together dramatically. At the third segment, I lost a lot of interest trying to keep the characters up. I could barely sort them in the first few segments. There is a constant parade of new faces. We don't learn anything from any of them. <br /> <br /> Separate segments, with a few exceptions, do not tend to be uncomfortable and editable. They are also sometimes manipulative - it can almost start as a propaganda movie. But perhaps inconsistent, the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally. <br /> <br /> In fact, one elongated section is more like a music video / industrial promotion video. As features shots of building the futuristic city, with very large machinery, lots of welding, and so on. At one point, a guy who looks like an astronaut on the camera is through a kind of futuristic glass. The music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overwhelming horror score. I can't say that Things to Come consist of enticing material in terms of drama. <br /> <br /> But the general cry in support of Things to Come is that it is a film about ideas. It may be true, but there are some issues with it when viewed. One, it still doesn't work, it's a movie, it's as a visual and audience dramatic artwork, and two, there are too many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The principle idea is that of war and what it does with civilizations. It's a good thing to make a movie. It is also remarkably predicted by World War II, because the things that came were written and filmed in 1935 (released in 1936). Wells has some interesting things to say about the war, some of which go against the ordinary interpretation of the movie. For example, the end seems to suggest that another war will break out, or will at any moment. The overall message appears to be a small pessimistic message. Wells seems to show that war is just a part of human nature that cannot be wiped out, although it does not stand out of progress. Perhaps it may be indirectly fuel, at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> It'll probably be enough for one movie. However, there are many more ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more striking scenes of the film. It is about a complex dilemma. One pilot shot the other, but now come to help him. But the pilot shot down had a poisonous gas now moving across the field. They can't breathe both gas without damage. A girl comes along. They only have two functional gas masks between them. The pilot shot down offers his mask because he says he's going to die anyway. What to do? It's not that this scene itself can be stretched out, but the ideas - the bizarre complex of both that help hurt each other in the middle of a war - are enough to build a movie. <Br /> <br /> Another example. During the scenes with the popular warrior, in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is a nasty infectious disease, the so-called "errant disease". It turns victims into something like drunk zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot victims on the ground to prevent the disease. This material is treated as if it were an afterthought. It's a good idea and deserves its own movie. <br /> <br /> Wells also offers the future society to have controversial socialist ideas. It was also enough for his own movie. It's just impossible to handle so many things in 100 minutes so effectively, especially if it's supposed to be the core of the movie instead of dramatic attraction. <br /> <br /> However, there are reasons to do things at least one look. If you're a sci-fi buffy, it's a historically important movie. Given Menzies background, production and set designs are interesting, even though cinematography looks extremely dated. It is also interesting to see how Wells was exactly or retrospectively humorous in his predictions. I especially enjoyed the way of propulsion to the moon, which strongly reminds George Méliès' 1902 a trip to the moon (also known as Le Voyage dans la lune). Don't expect too much from things to come.
