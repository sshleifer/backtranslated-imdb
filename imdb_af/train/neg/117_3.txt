It was great to see some of my favorite stars 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They look pretty wonderful. But that was it. They are not given characters or good lines to work with. I didn't understand or care what the characters did. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were good, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite capable and confident in their small sidekick parts. They have shown talent and it is sad that they will no longer die in more and better movies. Unfortunately, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten had a chance to act in her only major role-play. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I'm a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoy his last movie, "Cat's Meow" and all his early "Target" to "Nickleodeon". So it really surprised me that I could hardly wake up to see this one. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that this film is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get involved with each other romantically. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd, had a hit series called "Moonlighting" stealing Bogdanovich's story idea. Of course, there was a big difference that the series relied on many witty dialogues while trying to do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It's not a Paper Moon and only a very light version of "What's Up, Doc".
