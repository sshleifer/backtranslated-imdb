do not struggle to rent this movie. It has nothing to do with an escape from the deadly, despite the (English) title. I can't think of a good thing to say about the movie. Poor acting, poor editing, poor direction ... legally "plot", and the sound / music was so annoying. It is a wonder that this movie does not contain a warning label. The only possible way to sit and enjoy this movie is because it is historical quality of cheesiness. They no longer make movies so badly.
