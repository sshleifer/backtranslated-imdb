It was a disappointing movie. The people seem to have nothing, the main protagonist Martin Cahil has zero redemptive values, and everyone in it, including Jon Voight, faces the sledge. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The violence is unpleasant, although it is done artificially. The filming is too black, at least the pressure I have seen in this category. A disappointment.
