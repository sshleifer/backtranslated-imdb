What I found so curious about this movie - I saw the full 4 hour roadhow version, how strange it is. For a movie about 2 very charismatic men - Castro and Che, involved in a gigantic political battle, it is almost completely without emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (which in turn is a second-level actor, with a slightly high pitch) have no drama or depth and certainly come down to Castro who tells Che: go here, go there, do this and that, without any explanation as to what effect or use this action will have. Odder is still an actress in the role that has the necessary power to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but he is in a small part in the second half. Without the excitement or passion you would expect to shoot these men and their followers, the movie becomes a dull epic-length movie about hairy, bearded men running and shooting through different jungles without any specific purpose or end. Several of the reviews I have read have read the work of director Steven Soderbergh, while I almost completely ignore the actors. (One actually spent more time on Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it is entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) It's a weird strange thing to do since a) Soderbergh is just a hired rifle was on the film and b) it is no longer a capable job, with an unexpected wink to Oliver Stone's JFK in the black and white cut camera work when Che visits New York. If you can direct Reds by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you can get an idea of ​​the dull power of this movie.
