Two sisters, their twisted brother, and their cousin have car problems. They then happen to dr. Hackenstein who needs the body parts of three naughty young women to use in an experiment to bring back his deceased lover. He tells them he will help them come home that morning, so they spend the night. Then the good doctor comes down to work in this low-budget horror comedy. <br /> <br /> I found it softly amusing, nothing to really get out of your way (I stumble across Netflix instant view and streamed it to the Xbox 360) but better then I expected be it for a Troma-filmed movie. Most of the humor does not work, but they are still some parts that make me smile. Plus the late Anne Ramsey had a small portion and she was always a surprise to watch.
