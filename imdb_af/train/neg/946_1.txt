Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /> <br /> Being so popular, I've tried more than once to see it and I can't do it through an entire episode. <br /> <br /> For one thing, the play is horrible. Everyone is exaggerated to the point where it is annoying to watch. They speak in unnatural voices, use unnatural colors, and have unnatural body language. I performed better in a nursery school game. <br /> <br /> For another thing, it is NOT FUNNES. The plots are boring. They are not creative, intelligent or FUNNY. Don't be a sitcom funny? Why don't I laugh? <br /> <br /> Finally, what is the seventies about this? In the seventies it is as authentic as 'Happy Days'. It was until the fifties. <br /> <br /> What about Ashton Kutcher? Who throws this undisputed mop? And now he makes movies? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think it's quality television, it worries me.
