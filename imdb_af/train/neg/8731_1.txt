The lowest score possible is one star? It's a shame. really, I'm going to IMDb lobby for a "zero stars" option. To give this movie even a single star, WAY gives too much. Am I the only one to see the microphones hanging over the tractor's head at the station? and the acting, or should I say the lack thereof? apparently talent was not a factor when the deciding director came to town. My little sister's basic school talent show offers greater scope and depth of emotion. and the false Irish accent was like nails on a chalkboard. the only thing that made this movie worse would have been ... oh wait, no no, it's already as bad as it can get.
