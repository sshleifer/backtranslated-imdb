As someone who both read the novel and saw the movie, I had another idea why the movie was such a flop. First, any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably meant as a satire, but it comes as a cross between tragedy and polemics instead. Any comic elements such as those that later formed the stylistic base of the film version are simply coincidental to the author's unambiguous cynical push. And so the ubiquitous white suit of the writer deceives you into thinking it's another Mark Twain, think again. A more appropriate literary precedent would be the ghost of Ambrose Bierce in a top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe is equal parts clown and hack, more famous as a writer, always looking for new pigs for his self-absorbed mill. <br /> <br /> It is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction made on film making are doomed from the beginning. Contrary to true satire, which translates very well into film, polemic is based on non-universal accessible observations in some way of human behavior, but in a single mindset to specific people - whether it is actually or fictitious scattering men - who somehow deserves the wrath of the writer. Any attempt to create a successful filmed story or narrative of such a beginning must have a clean start, free from the author's influence or interference. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I also find fault with the casting. It's not just that disqualifications like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith aren't upbeat, but real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are either completely messed up or given roles that are merely caricatures. <br /> <br /> There is enough topical material here for a really good movie satire, but it fails to even get close.
