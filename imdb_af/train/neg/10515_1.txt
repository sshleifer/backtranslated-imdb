Well, it's a typical "straight to the toilet" movie. <br /> <br /> Long story short, a lot of teenagers / young adults are stranded in the middle of the spectacular bushes and hacked by naked nymphomaniac devils. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the basics for this slasher descent: <br /> <br /> Non-women, teens, or young adults survive in some haunting, mortal death scenes, the last survivor is a well-built young woman who will always show her midriff, but never well less, a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil, lesbian coastal scene, the sex is a murderer, no plot. <br /> <br /> Even for a cheese-like slasher movie, it was very awful. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to make the male and lesbian female audience interested. To look, it feels like it's being watched with a nasty headache or a nasty head cold. <br /> <br /> Give the demonic ..... 0/10.
