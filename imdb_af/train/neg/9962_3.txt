Uta Hagen's Respect for Acting is the standard handbook in many college theater courses. In the book, Hagen offers two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the presentation approach and the representative approach. In the presentation approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible by introducing emotional elements of the actor's own life. In the Representative approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control over movement and sound. <br /> <br /> The representative approach to acting was still partially in line when this Hamlet was made. . The British theater has a long history of this acting, and Olivier can be said to be the ultimate king of the Representative School. <br /> <br /> Time was not so good for this school of acting, or for this movie. Almost every working actor today uses a presentation approach. For the modern eye, Olivier's highly dedicated, stylized delivery is sturdy, stiff and quiet. Instead of creating an internal conflicts Hamlet, Olivier made a decisive, self-serving bullhorn out of the melancholic Dane - a acting style that behaved well to the back of the larger London theaters. However, it is too starchy for a modern Hamlet. <br /> <br /> And so the movie thrives ominously today. Olivier's tendency to make e-nun-ci-ate, unintentionally makes Hamlet's lines funny: "Instead, you need to get a pace-anas that can give it ... Smoothness!" Instead of crying to meet his father's ghost (like any proper actor), shiny lights in Olivier's pupils are our impression. <br /> <br /> Eileen Herlie is the only actor of the note in this Hamlet, a good essay for the queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). The other actors in this movie have no chance of getting anything else meaningful, given Olivier's inclination to stick! the camera! on him! at all! stop! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, you feel the uncertainty of the Shakespeare stage actor who lacks the confidence to portray a fragile, defective Hamlet and prefers to portray a kind of Elizabethan bullhorn. Final Analysis: "I would have had such a co-operation for the transfer of Termagant, these are heroes Herod: Pray, avoid it."
