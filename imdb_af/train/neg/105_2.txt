There are tons of good women in this movie. But unfortunately, this movie is free of celebrity. Grrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. One story in this movie takes place in 1971. Why are the main characters a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you may know, this movie is released in stereoscopic 3D. And this is the most terrible effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if someone was working on the chest, but there was no 3D, just double vision loss. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in that one also sucked, but with them I could see a look of 3D effect. <br /> <br /> This thing is a big ball of nothing. <br /> <br /> Whatever women were who played the daughter of the devoted woman, yum! I'd like to see more of her. Also in movies. It looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
