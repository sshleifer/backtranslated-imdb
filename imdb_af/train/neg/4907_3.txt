SPOILERS DONE !! <br /> <br /> I read the book "1st to die" and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so I watched it. For the most part it did. There were some minor differences (for example, the place of the last violent scene), but not much, and the film was mostly true to the book, so much more than most movies. <br /> <br /> It might have been a mistake - even though the movie was thrown perfectly with Pollen and Bellows - I wasn't so impressed with the book. Or let me take it back. I was very impressed, gradually becoming more disillusioned and finally being completely dissatisfied and feeling almost gypped. No difference with the movie. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no "payoff" in the book or the movie. I rarely read a reader who made such an eclipse with his final resolution and I hoped the movie would change a little. <br /> <br /> The whole- (he did it, no she did it, NO they did it both) - was not interesting, not fascinating and more confusing, annoying and depressed than anything else. In addition, the love of Lindsay's life dies (after her illness is clear and she is crying at his grave). And then cut to where she's considering suicide .... then suddenly she's in a fight for her life with the REAL villain who was cleared after being arrested. But it turned out that he and the woman were together. HELLO !!! This whole thing has now become "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old-fashioned excitement. I cheated and cut down the book and watched the movie (I have to admit it kept my attention well. The scene was great for a TV movie). He hopes it won't follow the book that stops it. /> <br /> I still think the movie is viewable and for some reason doesn't go as badly in your mouth as the book (or maybe it's just that I knew what would happen). But I have to say how this story was unraveled was not done well at all.
