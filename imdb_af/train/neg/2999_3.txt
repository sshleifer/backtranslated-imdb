Another FRIDAY THE 13th ripoff, even with some of his music! A group of young adults are gathering for a small high school reunion and are starting to slaughter a low Jason Voorhees. Could it be the nerd they hurt in school? <br /> <br /> The routine slideshow is fun for fans of the genre, and contains the usual movie T&A quota if not. The end is a little more imaginative than your standard pointer. <br /> <br /> MPAA: Valued for violence / gore, language, sexuality, nudity and some drug content.
