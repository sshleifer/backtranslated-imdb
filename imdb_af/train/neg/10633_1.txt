I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I'm not wasting money to buy this one. The video cover features a play of the 1975 film Capricorn One. The movie starts with several clips of rocket sheets, mostly not related to manned flights. Sibrel's smoking weapon is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast. He points in his own voice instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say. The video ends with a show of the Zapruder movie. His claims about radiation, shielding, star photography and others lead me to believe he is extremely ignorant or has some kind of ax to grind against NASA, the astronauts or American in general. His science is bad, and so is this video.
