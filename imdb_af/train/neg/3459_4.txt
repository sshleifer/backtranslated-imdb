"Cut" is a film about some film students who make a movie. It's much in the "Scream" form, an ironic, self-referring horrorflick that at least falls to me, because for all its irony, it's just a bad horror movie, the same as the movies it refers to. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't without his charm. Well, a charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as the spoiled American American actress who hated every minute of work with amateur Australian film staff. She was so convincing that she was tempted to believe it, not an act, although everyone involved in Cut says she's nice to work with. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of her pouting, sulking or snapping was wonderful. Everyone else, however, varied between OK and terrible wood. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Cut" has a few laughs, some buckets of gore (some of the surprisingly horrific), and ultimately .. just another bad horror movie.
