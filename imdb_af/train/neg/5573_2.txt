I don't understand why so many Godzilla fans think it's great, one of the best Godzilla movies ever. This movie is terrible and one of the many Gojira movies I can't see (the other is G. vs Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is campaigning to be in the Heisei series, a series that tried to change the aging Godzilla franchise into bonafide stock movies. It was thinking of ideas that occurred in 1974 rather than 1991. It was just ridiculous, especially with some of the topic, for example, the WW2 scene, with Japanese soldiers praising a dying Godzillasaurus prize, a sad and serious tone, taking the exuberant former commander turning capitalist and his death, see seriously " a movie that somehow shows fans as played for laughter, as a goofy skirt with guilty illogical fun, if so, if it's easily one of the tasteless movies I've seen, but I think it's more probably that it was just a talent that the filmmakers lacked and that was a case of a straight-forward action movie that went bad. It's even worse because the special effects are terribly over, from the jetpacks to the Android, to the all-out hokey sound effects, it's impossible to take anything serious, yet the movie expects you to there is. No nudges at the camera. <br /> <br /> Like almost all Godzilla films, there is a senseless romance, and that is no exception, although something can be said about the fact that this one is particularly pointless and inexplicable. There is literally no reason for the romance being offered, it just happens and there are 360 ​​degrees of commitments for it. In addition, the other terrible aspect of this movie is a dialogue. The Japanese and English are terrible, clunky and possibly the inspiration for Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> The Tristar DVD connects the problems, which make everything look vague, dull and just ugly, the same for the sound. I first saw the Japanese Region 2 version and the differences are night and day, with the original vibrant colors and texture, the notable score, especially the battle scenes, being observable. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version) there is little to praise here, and Godzilla versus King Ghidorah is the case in this failure . It doesn't even come close to the reputation and supporters it deserves. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
