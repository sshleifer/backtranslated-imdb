Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that nothing about the movie has been spoiled. Even though B. Mattei never did a masterpiece, he used his work with a little humor and madness that made him a fun Eurotrash director. But for the last 10 years he has lost it. This movie is just empty, nothing to sink us out of the deep sleep you dropped after the first 10 minutes. No sex, it's supposed to go snuff?), No actors, no dialogues, just as bad as a 90'TV movie. It's even worse than its last cannibals and zombies epics. So resting in Rusto, you'll always stay in our minds, thanks to such unforgettable gems such as: Zombi 3, Robowar, Rats, I altro inferno, Virus, brutal jaws and a few others. So if you don't want to own B Mattei owned by the new movie by Franco Franco, it's over. But if you don't, "I don't know this nice craftsman's career has his old movies and has fun.
