I was sitting through this turkey because I hadn't seen it before, and because the point was that it had potential. It was slightly entertaining to the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are perfectly erect and do not move a leaf! In fact, when the characters move out of the house, the sunlight is visible, relieving the tree tops. At that time, any movie developed by the filmmakers was evaporating faster than the highly localized rainfall in their film. Sorry, all hurricanes are not like this, but it will help our homeowners insurance prices in the Sunshine State.
