This is not a comment on the real movie, but on the RUSCICO DVD edition for North America. I don't know if there were different releases and updates, but the slides we rented had a copyright on them in 2000, if that meant all. Anyway, the sound mixing on these DVDs was absolutely horrible. The levels are often rushed up and down; When the scene is cut to a battlefield panorama, the band will thunder so much that I didn't know what was going to blow out first - my drums or my speakers. If it were time for dialogue, the volume would usually be audible to something little. Sometimes the orchestra and Foley work stays loud while the dialogue is being transferred at a much lower level. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch this movie smoothly from these DVDs was if one of us held a hand on the spacer to continuously modulate the volume. And as another user has already commented, our dialogue between Russian and English has changed when we selected English audio. and sometimes when the characters in French spoke on the native track, the dubbing was in Russian, so you are SOL if you don't understand it either. Eventually we got up to the first disc. Before you delete $ 50 + for this DVD movie for your own library, I would heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see if you can really enjoy this epic movie when it's loaded so much, especially if you never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.
