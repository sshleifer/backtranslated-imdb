This movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can write and direct their own movie. See it, you can't. Because in that way there is no one to tell you when you hack big holes in your plot, meaningless transitions, urgent, unmistakable dialogue and succeed in changing a rather cool Korean legend into a steaming pole of celluloid turd. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie, I really did; I love many crappy movies. But once I forced myself to ask what the hell happened and WHY, Dear Lord, WHY? more than a few times I really can't take it anymore. <br /> <br /> Also, I'd like someone to explain how LA Mordor became the last scene.
