Amelia and Michael are a married couple cheating on each other. Amelia has a long-term lover in hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who does not satisfy him. The two smolder with their unfaithfulness, but eventually they connect with each other. <br /> <br /> There is not much on this particular short. The direction is straight forward and dramatic, which is good, the acting is sincere, but the story leaves a little to be desired. Why, exactly, do we care for these two people? It is a little difficult to see how this story emerges from another story of unbelief, except that it is much more coherent and not looking for meaning in it (a welcoming change of pace when there is something). <br /> <br /> I don't know, it's possible. I do not commit to these stories because I have never experienced them. But I noticed that the blockage in these stories is typically the same, that is, a couple talking together avoids eye contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines. The nice thing about short films is that they offer a little more space to try something else, and I would like to see other tasks. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
