The only words you need are more than Joe Don Baker, if you're thinking of watching a movie, Greydon Clark, and if they're both there, run for your life. However, this is a very funny movie because they actually take themselves seriously! It starts badly and from there, repeated screens, the Good The Bad and The Ugly like shooting, will roll you down with laughter. Yes, he is the best deputy sheriff in Texas and follows a mafia hit to Malta. just as he can. He makes his own rules, does things his own way, long wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style. Want to see a bad but funny movie? Go ahead, it's your move!
