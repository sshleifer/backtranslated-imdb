There were a few low moments in my life when I was confused and depressed. Sitting through Rancid Aluminum was one of these. <br /> <br /> The warning signs were there. No premiere (even the stars didn't want to attend) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I sat through the movie was in the hope that I could catch up with some sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was explained. The narrative was idiotic. I was cheering at some point when the appearance of the movie seemed to be, and when my growing despair was, it seemed that he was not really shot to muffle my joy. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the film will be hanged on this horror. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, mostly unintended moments of humor. For example, the scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason, has the need to manually relieve himself in a toilet bowl, while telling the person in the next box to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can't explain the rage I feel. Therefore, I will deduce it so. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: only for sadists, waste and regressives who want to torture themselves.
