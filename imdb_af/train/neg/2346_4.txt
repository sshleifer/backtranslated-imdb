I haven't seen this movie for too long on TCM's Essentials series for the first time. The eye of the awake clich√© was never again applied. This seer saw little in this one. I was amazed at the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Granted, me. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this movie her character comes more tired than attractive. I would think people like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley are likely to ignore Lucy than to fall into her with an immediate promise. In Bacall's defense, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight of his debilitating health affected her performance. Of course, part of this mousiness of Lucy, was to contrast her with sletty Marylee, played by Dorothy Malone. The scene where she is involved in a wildly sensual dance while her father is wearing the stairs to a fatal heart attack is by far the best scene in the film. Malone's performance hides the rest, although Jasper Hadley's fatigue on the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. In general, however, I have to say that I am not just a fan of melodrama. The character-like behavior of the characters just makes a story too unreliable for my taste.
