That's right. A movie written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and family. (Fred should have known better if he worked the sets of Titantic and Dogma.) <br /> <br /> So, the plot. There are a few scientists, and some foresters, and a hot chick with big fake breasts. They are all really bad at their job, including the hot chick (which I think is a photographer, but caring because she wears a bikini). One of the forester says scientists are "professionals," which is good because it would be terrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They walk through the woods in search of some strange monkey-like legs, and no one once mentions that the legs can only be those of the infamous Bigfoot. They just wander around and one of the rangers goes unashamedly at the hottie. We all hope that he will soon die (along with his sister who is meant to be the naive, but is really just annoying). Then they find, * gasp *, find a Sasqu .... I mean, Monkey-like Cemetery. Of course, no mention that it might just be Bigfoot legs, but with the ... I think scientists and foresters just don't think about those kinds of things. <br /> <br /> When Sasquatch and his tribe really get angry and murder all the people we don't like, the other losers chase away and bury his big aunt Muriel and niece Josh (who died in an unlucky note accident ). Insipid, boring dialogue (I've zoned several times), a plot, unlikely characters, a bad CGI (a man in a monkey case will look better), and acting just not very good, add everything together to make a movie. I won't look again. <br /> <br /> You see it all; It's good for some unintentional laughs.
