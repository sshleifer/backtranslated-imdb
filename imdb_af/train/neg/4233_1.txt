I couldn't believe I spent $ 14.00 on it. The only redeeming quality is the outrageous gore. The dubbing was worse than I ever experienced. It looks like it's shot with a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig was spent on the special effects because there was plenty of blood and body parts everywhere. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I have to recognize the big gores that weren't as disgusting as it could have been, because the whole movie is so stupid and incredible
