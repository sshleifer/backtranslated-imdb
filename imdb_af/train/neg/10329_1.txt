I'm trying to picture the scene for Dark Angel. "I think Matrix, I think Bladerunner, I think the chick that Faith plays in Angel, with shiny black leather - or a chick, like her, leaves one with us. Only - get it! Dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just a few hard buttons and a hot chick in shiny black leather protruding a big throbbing bike. "<br /> <br /> Flashy, level, foolish, formulated, passionate, boring, boring, stupid, humorless, desultory, barely skilled. Live action anime without any action, or even a life. SF like Joe Fanboy likes it. :(
