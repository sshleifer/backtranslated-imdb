Alone in the Dark is your Boll's kick in the nuts to Hollywood to face House of the Dead's punch. <br /> <br /> If it proves just how much of a master engineer is Boll. After Artisan was forced out of business over the flop, the House of Death, one can only assume that the usually credible Lion's Gate movies released only AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan's assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of a complete lack of coherent film-making ability, plot outline and simply steal weakly from other movies, because it was supposed to look cool instead of being fitted within the film's framework. . <br /> <br /> But that's the point, isn't it. Boll doesn't try to make a coherent movie, as he doesn't try to direct Alone in the Dark. He's just manipulating Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Only in the dark, such as House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects "announced" or "in production". <br /> <br /> These aren't movies, but investment portfolios. Each of them raced in production under the premise that the Boll and its investors could exploit the bill within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that timeframe, the more money he and his investors can get. Why make it hard to make a good movie if a bad movie makes you a coin anyway? The result is films like the horror of Alone in the Dark. <br /> <br /> Like all his other movies, Alone in the Dark is just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for lazy movie viewing. <br /> <br /> And for those who support Boll by calling him, he misunderstood whether the next Ed Wood, congratulations, by making a cult figure out of man, makes it easier for you to get investors but to make him known. <br /> For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid = 21699 Aside, just ask me how he gets his cast lists together. Unless the actors are somehow on the investment fraud, the secret has yet to be uncovered.
