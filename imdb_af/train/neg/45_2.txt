Like the number of videos I've seen, I saw this little heap of waste on my list to rent when I saw it. <br /> <br /> The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken in the jungle, held by cowardly ransom idiots. Some other goofs are hired to bring her back and get a bag of money to use as a bargain slip, but when he comes back with the girl and all the money, he gets a substantial cut. He brought a helicopter and pilot with him, and, wow, that pilot has ever been one of the worst actors! Granted, they are all terribly horrible and the dubbing will make you cry. After we walked into the jungle, we learn that the nearby is a cannibal cult whose wing-ruling earth destroys the forest, like a human King Kong, seeking for tribes to destroy and devour. Now, this guy is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, table tennis balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are a perpetual feature on the soundtrack, and I mutilated many of those scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this movie is banned, although there is one particular scene, about a second, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her bowels, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows long neighbors of female genitals, and unfortunately also male. So, if you want to "justify" in terms of exploitation, you have it. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this waste to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just a pity that it will only be a video Nasty fan, and even if you make your way through the list, you should leave it last. If you look at it first, you can get the idea that it is the norm for the list, which is definitely not true.
