Although I heard this movie, it was a little dry, I watch Scott Bakula anyway. At the beginning of this movie, I had a lot of hope for the classic cute but pleasant Scott girl who ended up and up to 20 minutes before the end it was going well. The plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever. I crossed my fingers that it would work out and that would be a horrible misunderstanding until the credits rolled and I realized that there would not be a happy and happy ending. Unfortunately, I left my trust that I had watched it and hastened a quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great Scott!
