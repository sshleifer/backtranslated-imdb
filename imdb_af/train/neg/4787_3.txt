This entry is definitely interesting for series fans (like myself), but it is mostly incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, just like the succession of the successor. Some striking effects, certainly, but we never find out what that really means. <br /> <br /> Try to see the "NC-17" print job version containing the slots cut to be re-assessed. "R".
