Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master of this movie. He had the brilliance of making a film with actors who couldn't perform. In addition, he decided to write a roadmap based on a kind of bad trip that went badly. Put it together, you end up with a movie that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and moisture cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain it causes is about the same as the pain caused by having your genital organs cut out and then covering the entire wound with salt and hydrochloric acid.
