It was made in 2007 and the CG is bad for a movie made in 1998. In one part of the movie there is a stop motif shot of a dinosaur that actually looks good, but it only makes the extremely amateur work on the CG stuff worse. <br /> <br /> The writing, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is just awful. It's as bad as, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure crap! Again, as with the other movies, the only part of this movie is that it is actually made and is now being broadcast on the sci-fi channel. <br /> <br /> I still can't understand how they somehow get people who have acting skills to act in these movies and somehow make them as awful as everyone in the movie. movie. <br /> <br /> For those who aren't sure, the other poster is obviously sarcastic in its review ... or he's one of those people working on this movie.
