Did anyone read the script? It must be the worst writing and directing of the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson, couldn't get this one out. About two-thirds it seemed as if Giamatti's eyes had said, I can't believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines, but what can still be said? Okay, the movie doesn't just move with Vaughn's conmanial dialogue, but his character is just a creepy man you just can't pass by. It was just an ill-considered step that nobody was able to enter.
