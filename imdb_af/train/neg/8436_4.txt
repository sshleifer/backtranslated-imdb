David Mamet is a very interesting and very uneven director. His first film House of Games was the one I liked best, and it made a series of movies with characters whose perspective on life changes when they come into complicated situations, as well as the perspective of the viewer. <br /> So is 'Homicide' which is trying to put the viewer into the ordinary crime drama. The main characters are two policemen, one Jewish and one Irish dealing with a racial area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner proved to be an old veteran of the Israeli War of Independence sets the Jewish identity in the heart and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> These are the mistakes of the movie. is the more obvious. The awakening process is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operational and the way the detective eventually goes to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the movie itself is Mamet-like, but disappears from a human emotional perspective. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the story's flaws are too clear to be easily compensated. .
