Can you say, "All shock, no plot?" There were so many unexplored directions in this movie. There was no history of the room except the deaths. * WHY * was it evil? What made it so? Why an "hour" countdown? Then there were the unexplored things being foretold; For example, we've seen a camera in the sky, which he called. But when he got up the guy, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> What about the fact that all the ghosts looked "Digital" and things being printed before they hit the ground to make a static noise? Hmmm ... if you bring all these things together, make room 1408 like a high-tech haunted house. Apart from not being followed up. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... by the way ... electronics don't work in 1408. Well, except for the TV ... the phone has no signal, but Wireless Internet works well. How many instabilities can you add? I'm sorry, but this movie was nothing but 'shock after shock'. All this has been done before. Reflection in the mirror. Things just outside the yard. Changing paintings. Blooming walls. The "Oh, it was all just a dream ... no it was." And if the room was angry, why does our main character kill the death of his daughter if it keeps him trapped anyway? It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> There was also no background information on "The First Book" he wrote. Just a few vague information about the "father was a while" and so on. Talking about daddy, what was his dad's bit? "You will be in my place." <br /> <br /> Overall, a real LOVE movie. It was a 100% adrenaline shock factor, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly no back story, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My overall impression is that the whole movie was made on the "Cheap"; pretty much using one set and some of the spot shots, and was nothing but an effect film of recycled, cheesy, saw-before-effects.
