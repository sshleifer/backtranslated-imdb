I hired End Game, but I have never heard of it, but I love political excitement, so I thought I'd give it a chance. Having done some research on the movie, I found that it was originally intended for the release of the theater, but rather went to DVD. After I saw it, I thought, "No wonder." The film is shocking in its unoriginality. The plot and the characters are perfunctories. I came out whodunnit through the halfway mark, but the end was a curved ball. I have to say I didn't expect to do this, but it's not a point in his favor. The more predictable end would have been better than one that is so bad. Perhaps the filmmakers have seen how predictable the movie was and so they decided to make a move - even one that made the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want the $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back.
