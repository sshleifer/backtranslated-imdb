O my God! Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not watch this movie! It's 82 minutes of my life, I'll never come back. Certainly, I could have stopped looking halfway through. But I thought it might get better. It didn't. Anyone who actually enjoys this movie is one seriously ill and twisted individual. No wonder our Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this movie is terrible, from the play to the editing. I do not even write reviews about this, but in this case I make an exception. I just wish someone warned me before renting this disaster
