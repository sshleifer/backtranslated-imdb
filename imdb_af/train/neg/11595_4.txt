Star count: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice, who defeated Freddy at the end of the last movie, is now trying her life to adapt again. But her unborn child carries a demonic presence. Freddy, trying to get back into their world. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to direct the directors who have broken their heads. Freddy Movies - Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (Lost Space, Predator 2). While Russell and Harlin did well, Hopkins IMO has something of a podge with this entry, which should soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The story is clearly stretched as far as it can go here, with Freddy ridiculing a father himself and the ridiculous, demon baby. For about half an hour everything has become pretty, and of course, not scary at all. <br /> <br /> The "bon appetit, bitch" catch phrase is the only memorable point of this other, very forgetful entry. *
