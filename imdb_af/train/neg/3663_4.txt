Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy stars in this, one of his weakest werewolf movies ... but with me for a moment. Most people will know it under its most common television title, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and over the years there are many home video versions of it. If you want to be serious about making it fair, the most workable edition I've seen of it is the title WOLF MAN NOVER SLEEP, which is an unsaturated and complete European version that restores some disturbing scenes and contains the original shots that lack FURY's pressure. It is also letterboxed. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, who comes home from a trip to Tibet, to find out that he has contracted a weather-wave curse and that his wife has a relationship. He cares for her and her lover while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant. Apparently, the doctor tries to "tame" the werewolf and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love image between her and the hairy and captive Daninsky who is below her trance, at least in the original version. Eventually we get two werewolves for the price of one, as Daninsky is fighting a silkwolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is that the director (according to Naschy's claims) was often drunk, and the results are indeed quite incoherent. If you look at the WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS copy, it's not that hard to figure out what's going on, although the editing stays in place. The worst of all is occasional non-matching footage of Naschy's rawige werewolf straight from another previous movie (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, also known as "FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR") and without any meaningful reason mixed in this one! The wolf clothes change from black shirt to white and back, just like his attitude; One moment, the wolf walks around in a hypnotic trance of FURY, and he grows again and runs running from BLOODY TERROR. Actually bizarre.
