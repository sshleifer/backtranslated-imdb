If I was a filmmaker myself and had a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought I was a surprise when I took my "My Wrongs" home (not that the DVD cover is giving away something but rather for the ambiguous selection quote from controversial director Chris Morris, "a short film including scenes"). I should have really known, and avoided this awkward (and often offensive) piece of twoddle. <br /> <br /> The scene in the church is repulsive to look at (especially since we are all familiar with Morris's distorted attitude towards pedophilia of his infamous TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than do not shock. How this movie is a comedy I will never understand. <br /> <br /> In principle, the runner's comment sounds like a new idea. I myself was a runner, it is often an interesting and unobstructed perspective on the film processing process. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. Instead, we are treated to a public schoolboy who is dogging dogs on the film, before deciding that there aren't really big movies with dogs. It's all very interesting, but not a single frame of celluloid. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie doesn't go anywhere, would be an understatement. It relies too much on its enhanced style, at the expense of the plot, character and dialogue, which leaves the viewer boring and unfinished. The over-emphasized message - the man must take responsibility for his actions - is suddenly illustrated clearly and poorly. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately it fails to convince, to entertain, relieve and just stop being annoying. If you want to see a very large piece of short movie show, I highly recommend "Franz Kafka's This is a wonderful life" by Peter Capaldi.
