I saw "Rachel's Attic" and thought I'd be a pleasant visceral ride. However, that was not the case. Visceral, yes, but tasty? It would be a big, fat, no! In fact, the only reason I gave it a 3 is because Gunnar Hansen (ever so briefly) appears as one of the movie's reprehensible characters. How did they ever lure Mr Hansen into this piece ... work, I will never know. The story idea is interesting but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre. The only thing worse is the special effects. Yikes !!! I saw better effects in a grade school game. Give it up, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I hear they are renting at Mel's Diner! There are very few, well made, Indian movies come from Michigan and Rachel's Attic is not one of them.
