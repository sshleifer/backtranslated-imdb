With a list like this, I expected much better. Venessa Redgrave laid the majority of the film in bed. The best actresses in the world can make nothing very interesting, as their acting is limited to sleep and throughout the film. The plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the girls, since their mother is coming closer to death. The thing is, she never tells her daughters anything but cryptic advice to be happy. All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped. I also felt that the back and forth between the past and the present was unnecessary. It seemed the idea of ​​the book, the Da Vinci code, was stolen in which the device was used to increase voltage, or from the Notebook in which they used the device to create the never-ending novels of the story's main characters. Either way, it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn't work to create anything. It was a way to try to get stress in a movie that has nothing. I asked why good movies can't be written for women. It was a real disappointment.
