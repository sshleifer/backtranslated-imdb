Man, even Plan 9 Outside space is better than this movie. This movie does not have enough time for half an hour, but it has prolonged it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in those exaggerated scenes, but things like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk are much better than this unfortunate thing that would be better, we no longer made.
