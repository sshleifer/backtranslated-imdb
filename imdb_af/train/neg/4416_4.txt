A dark shadow of death near the end of the show is given a less subtle pose to the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church. Throughout the show, dark humor plays a medium through which various common trial rhetorical questions are asked, especially: "If God is so good, why does he allow evil in the world?" <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (although some may disagree) of their stereotypical religious teacher who emissions the "company line" and condemns half of the world in the Hell to burn. To celebrate her school's 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return their Christmas show. <br /> <br /> But when the quartet updates their drama on the parody of Sister Mary's "deceptive" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiral into a chain of unfortunate events. The end eventually makes the audience feel sick in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Rather look at the play.
