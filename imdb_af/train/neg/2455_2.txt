I remember seeing the movie in the summer of '78 with my parents and being pretty good at the time. Of course I was seven at the time. <br /> <br /> Just before the Jackson movies came out, my wife and I rented this movie because she had never seen it before and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bakshi ran money from the animation process for this movie and forced to cut these corners drastically. Since this film was done primarily with rotoscoping, it is the animation technique for people on a budget. Much of this movie is just animation in the very least sense of the word. There are a few scenes that obviously just people stand in front of a screen, with some animation effects placed on top of them. <br /> <br /> Due to budget constraints, the movie - already a compression of "The Society of the Rings" and part of "The Two Towers" - was even more disapproved. What you get is like a movie version of the Cliff Notes of the books. <br /> <br /> It's not bad, but the animation brings a warmth to it, which I found in Jackson movies. It's nice to think about how it was with decent funding. <br /> <br /> This movie is also remarkable for having the never-ending successor. A few years later, a half-hearted half-length TV special was broadcast, which was meant to stir things up. All I will say is that it is a musical.
