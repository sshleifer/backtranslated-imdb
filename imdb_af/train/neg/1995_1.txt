Well, I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie, and it wasn't even worth it. It seems like it's out of print and is in the public domain, I guess. <br /> <br /> Despite its glory, awards and reputation, Neagle is a domestic British gal who can't sing or dance or act. <br /> <br /> Some of the fine old Hollywood character actors featured here thought they had done a classic thing. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen. He was wrong. She was unlikely to be popular in Britain before and after World War II. Her "serious" roles are even more ridiculous than her musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only a few of the famous songs are included and none are well presented. Skip this one and find the one that Doris Day stars. At least you get real comedy and professional style dancing!
