You can't really go far if the initial story isn't that good. The prospect of cyborg's blood needed is just dull. <br /> <br /> The writing is blisters. The actors don't have much to work with. The sets were staged in the desert to save costs. It's a trademark that if the background is the desert, then the movie has no budget. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget is good if there's a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work of no $. but this movie looks like they have to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich. Forgive if only the story does not suck. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie connects the biggest crime of all: it doesn't end! It just ends as if it is a commercial break from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. Just strange. <br /> <br /> Not bad.
