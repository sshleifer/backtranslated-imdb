Words cannot describe how completely stupid this story is (and therefore badly this movie)! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think? So there is a shopping mall and its parking is full. Basinger's character goes into buying a cup of tea and some wrapping paper. <br /> <br /> When she gets out, the whole place is so empty that no one can hear two shots in the vicinity? Even if she lives there, when she walks away from the bad things, is she possibly going to the most remote and missing place instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place? Come on !!! I won't even go into the infamous red toolbox, as other people have done it before. Let alone how she kills the moronic boyfies one by one. <br /> <br /> It's so stupid, without the least bit of logic, I can only warn you look at it, it's a total waste of time!
