This movie is really amazing. I saw so many cheap rubbish films, especially "Full Moon" Pictures, but "Dollman" is very difficult. There's so much coming together: the ridiculous story, the actors always on the verge of parody and the special effects! How long could I talk about them! It's a very bad movie, but also one of the funniest. If you're a fan of bad movies to laugh about, you should see it. And don't miss Dollman vs Demonic Toys. It is very funny and worse.
