The name "cult film" is often given to films that are still being shown over a generation or sold in home movie format after being released for the first time. Superchick, released in 1973, is now in this category. The cult status is mainly due to the continued interest in those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film. <br /> <br /> In spite of the Superwoman connotation, "Superchick" is not a cartoon character, but a very capable young lady working as an airplane - a career option widely regarded as one in the 1970s. of the most glamorous for any girl, and also enabling her to imitate the traditional matelot that allegedly has a woman in every port. As she has black car status in karate, she can make it clear that she is very happy with her bachelor's existence and in no way looks at any of her extensive male admirers. This film is a situation comedy that generally avoids much shorter alleged appeal of absolute farce. The appeal to feminists is also enhanced by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate skills to prevent a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film will appeal to both men and their partners, the director wisely ensured that it sprinkled with old-fashioned ones. <br /> <br /> Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not critical and want a very light comedy that will soon be forgotten shortly after they are watched. It is so forgotten that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if it is viewed again in a year; Despite its age, it can retain the status of cult film for some time. But the dialogue and acting will make it difficult to give this movie a score of more than 4/10.
