There are some talented black directors Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and a host of others who bring good earnings to the film industry. Then there is the Wayans Brothers who once (15 years ago) had a very funny television show "In Living Color" that began Jim Carrey's career, among others. Now we have replaced stupidity for humor and rough-out gags (toilet humor) as the standard operational procedure. People aren't as stupid as those shown in 'Little Man', they can't be. A baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as only months old? Baby comes with a five-hour shadow that he shaves off. It is testified that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her men, Darryl's, back. Oh yes, it's just hilaries. As a master criminal 'Little Man' is the dumbest on planet earth. He stamps a stolen stone that is just big in a woman's purse and should strive for it. The co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best line: "I'm surrounded by morons." Based on credit, on a Chuck Jones cartoon, Baby Buggy Bunny. It's too stupid to be even a little funny. A tip for how bad this movie is, Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno the previous night, before the BAT awards and he didn't even name this horrible movie. When will Hollywood stop greening the Wayans Brothers? When they are likely to get their white money.
