On a distant planet, a psychopath is saved from the execution by a space monk. He frees some fellow prisoners and breaks out of prison into a spaceship. They dock on a ridiculously large spacecraft that surrounds a supernova star. This massive vessel is populated by only three people, presumably because the film's budget has not expanded to hire many actors. Anyway, to cut a long story short, the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the bad stuff. <br /> <br /> The psychopath in this movie is curious because he is annoying. "Annoying" is generally not a term that one will use to describe an unmade, frightening, dangerous, but not "annoying", but he is. The three people who man the giant ship are seriously convincing to justify such important roles. This ship is almost the size of a city! As the film is about 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a great artificial craft can exist, never mind being used for such a relatively everyday task. Despite the large size of the spacecraft, the crew all have frightening outfits, small rooms and the dining room consists of a plastic table and chairs. But there are many passages. <br /> <br /> The movie was pretty good and it works as an average sci-fi thriller. But nothing good.
