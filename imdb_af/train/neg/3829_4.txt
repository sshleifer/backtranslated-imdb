Frequent train rider near Yuma breaks his chain loops and heads for the retired sheriff who is responsible for the death of his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold hidden, thanks to the scriptwriter). Attempting to bring the Western genre up to date with violence and cruelty in the 1970s is not even in the same league as some of the late-60s new prisoners. It is impossible simple and square, with the female characters merely punching bags and possible rape victims. As the former sheriff is in charge, Charlton Heston ever gives one of his funniest, least-inspired appearances ever. He had a good moment, trying to read a letter and staggering his glasses. James Coburn, as the half crazy half-breed, is also much on an automatic pilot, but Coburn has a way to make even the hardest dialogue and situations in something spiky and unpleasant. It's his performance completely. * 1/2 of ****
