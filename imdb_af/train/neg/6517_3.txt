I went to a show of this movie and while it had a few moments that made me laugh, it had very big mistakes. First, it separates the humorous benefits of divorce, trying to find love in LA. Collecting it is a depressing, narcissistic and unfunny skirt throughout the history of the film director's love life and professional life. Jokes are thin and you suddenly don't mind how the man's dates go. The ludicrous thing is that the director, at the same time, presents himself as an extremely annoying and severely defective character and then expects us to worry.
