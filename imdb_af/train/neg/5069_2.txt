I have a serious problem with this show, several actually. A simple list will now suffice. Later I will go into depth: superficial characters, a laugh track and boring humor. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to look at the rest of this review and just read it so you can feel better (as if you're seeing something in this show I didn't do) to a regular irked teen Canada, I will summarize: Friends suck not only because it is unfriendly, but because it has been destroyed. the TV audiences for new, good performances (Arrested Development, Dexter etc.). Friends are so much to blame for reality TV, "Two And A Half Men" and "The King Of Queens" as the television stations. Now, with the review. <br /> <br /> These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in all ways (out of gender and hair color). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely safe in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humor associated with it? Why didn't Rachel storm out on Monica after Monica started hanging out with Rachel's enemy? Why doesn't Joey think suicide because nobody takes him seriously? Oh right, because he's the stupid and he's comfortable with it. This is the curse of perfect characters: enduring conflict and (God forbid) personality becomes impossible. <br /> <br /> The laugh track is the one thing that died just after it was born. Any show one has is almost the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a performance claiming to be "comedy," it is necessary to laugh at someone, BUSINESS THE AUDIT, it should mean that the audience will not laugh at it. Laught tracks destroy humor by preventing quick return. Humor becomes a construction rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office, Arrested Development). <br /> <br /> This leads to my next point: humor is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything but light humorous (without a laugh) simply because our everyday humor comes from acknowledging our mistakes. So what if Monica was 17 years old? She immediately admits that what she is doing is not right and breaks with him. There must be some kind of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Perhaps her mother finds out if one of her friends is trying to get rid of him and ends up tempting him. It will be good, it will be like a conservation battle! So now I have provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching with your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br /> <br /> I have seen very little of "Friends" in my life, but I watched enough to spot big mistakes that make the performance totally uncompromising. If you've read so far, thank you, and I hope you at least start looking at some of the shows I mentioned.
