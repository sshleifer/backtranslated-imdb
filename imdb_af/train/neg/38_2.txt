or someone who has been praying for Al Cliver's face has a naked, 7ft long black man in a full Nelson, your movie has arrived! Movie star Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group needing the $ 6m ransom to get away from their island. What they don't rely on is the cunning Vietnam veterinarian Peter Weston (Cliver) appointed by a film producer to save the girl. And what they don't really think was a local tribe who likes to offer young women to their monster cannibal god with bloody eyes. <br /> <br /> Slightly the same action as CANNIBALS, this one rates a bit better than entertainment, mostly thanks to a hilarious dual panel and the impossible goofy monster with the bulging eyes. disk's maintenance split). Franco gets a strong EuroCult-supporting role, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most scathing things I have ever seen as a man who is not quite him in the near future to be him). The movie contains tons of nudity and the Gore (Tempra paint variety) is there. The highlight for me was the world's slow fist fight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the glowing waves. Unfortunately, Jess pushes this one out to an astonishing (and sometimes disapproving) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it has 80 minutes of tops. <br /> <br /> In general, the Severin DVD looks pretty, but there are some strange ghosts going on during some of the darker scenes. In addition, one long section of the dialogue in Spanish is without subs (this is an option, but only when listening to the French track). Franco gives a good 16 minute interview on the film and has much more enjoyable things about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.
