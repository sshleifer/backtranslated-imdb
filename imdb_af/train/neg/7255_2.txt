I was not particularly impressed by this movie that has a dark music and lasts only 40 minutes. Thank you, because I fell asleep. I make excellent use of time-lapse photography over time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. To display. Unfortunately, that's all it is. <br /> <br /> My preference is for his predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi made in 87 minutes in 1983 and to prove that a successor can be better than the original. Powaqqatsi performed 90 minutes in 1988. <br /> <br /> Try both.
