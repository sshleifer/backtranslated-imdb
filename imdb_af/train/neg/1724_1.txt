... and this is this movie. I think that if there is a negative survival, forbidden souls are tied to an uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for eternity. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it's not that bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen along Manos, the Hands of Fate ... and I've seen very bad movies, believe me <br /> <br /> It's just a crummy B movie, bad movie recording at its best (or is it the worst?) The thing I really don't like about this movie is the moronic duo they've got for comed in. relief. Now a bit of comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than the "heroes" of this movie, which are actually in less time than they are! <br /> <br /> To be honest, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing bad work. But frankly, it was probably a bad movie to start with, so Crown couldn't really have done much to hurt it. <br /> <br /> It should really be in the bottom 100 list. I don't want to wish this one on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> It's actually my kind of camping B movie. It was bad, but I've always liked it, despite my one star rating.
