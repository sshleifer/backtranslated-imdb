I was killed to see this movie after reading a positive review from another site and the guy I was p.o'd !!! It took me at least 15 minutes to take it off the shelf. I didn't want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use money to rent it. I thought all my stress would be paid by the time I got home and watch the movie b / c the review I read, saying the movie was a pleasant surprise; What a joke! If you can make it through the first hour of the movie, then your luck! b / c it is not until then when the movie turns into a horror. do not wrestle with this one, look better "thank you"
