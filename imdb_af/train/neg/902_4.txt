I suppose this movie is applicable today because it was an early Sofia Loren movie. She was 19 when the film was made in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because I wanted to see Sofia Loren's early work. I was surprised when she came to the camera after her skin was brown in brown makeup to look like an Ethiopian princess. Certainly, today it would be seen as a slur and avoided in making movies. It actually looked annoying at me. Loren in skin color paint through the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie would have been better if the real opera singers made this movie. Then the singing and the actual facial expressions of the right artists would have been clear. I endorse the comments of others about whether the real opera singers have more and more weight. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as me. Loren was 19 years old and still today, the film would be better received than being performed on stage. After all, we don't see beautiful young people on stage with an old opera singers, behind the song from behind the curtain! Don't discount the success of using heavyweight opera singers. One should only refer to the most artistically crafted television trade for the J. G. Wentworth Company with the opera singers on stage who so professionally praise the company's product. This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials ever produced. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film makes this production of somewhat less quality. The color ink is very blurred and it cannot be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this movie on DVD, the production company needs to add English language subtitles so we, who don't speak Italian, know what the lyrics are saying. This will help the story and teach it more than the narrator who gives 30 seconds of the plays. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie because of Aida's story or the fact that it's an opera. Apart from me. Sofia Loren is not known or remembered by any of her fellow actors. Rather look at this movie if you are a fan of Mrs. Loren is and wants to see her at age 19 - no matter what the production is. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
