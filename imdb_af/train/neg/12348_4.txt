This movie is much like "Flashdance", you know that dance movie with Jennifer Beals. The movie is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen, because it's not even bad enough to be funny. "G.I. Jane" is much better than that movie, but it doesn't say much. Here, Demi Moore swears a lot and there is high music and we get to see her struggle and everything, but it is certainly not very encouraging. I really think the idea behind the movie is interesting, but the writing is too clickable and Ridley Scott can't do anything about it. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
