I think I've found the most misogynistic movie of all time: Darklight. <br /> <br /> The core of the film Lilith was Adam's first wife and she was regarded as imperfect and banned from the garden of Eden because she considered herself as Adam and refused to submit to him. Look, I took the words straight out of the writing. Then the movie goes on and even though she is the heroine of the movie, the only time she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her! She ends the movie under the control of The Faith - a whole male group! <br /> <br /> Unlike that, the script was predictable and the FX was terrible. Apart from the obvious hatred of women who are usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about Darklight.
