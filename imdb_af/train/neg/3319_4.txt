I was surprised when I saw this movie. I heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel. How disappointed I was. <br /> <br /> How a real Jane Austen can evaluate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. The screenwriters have decided to hold in ridiculous humor, which best suits them from time to time, but also destroys the feel of the period. Regarding the film: Gwyneth Paltrow is a rather shallow heroine (but then a 'hot' American star in the role will be questioned), Toni Collette is defiant, and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look lazy! <br /> <br /> I really couldn't say a good thing about this movie. I seem to be among the minors who don't judge it, but if you want my advice, look at the TV production with Kate Beckinsale. Believe me, this is much better for this superficial trash.
