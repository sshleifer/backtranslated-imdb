I had a while for this Kari chick, and as far as she was watching this movie, I didn't have any complaints. But after catching it in HIGH DEFINITION last night, I'm sure it's the only thing in the movie that is not substandard. The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the direction is terrible. In another comment I saw someone commenting on the size of the sex scenes ... what? Not at all. When a movie is so bad, you can change as well in soft porn pornography, but I see that some white girls don't see me seeing Wuhrer's body and scenes that offer me nothing but a scourge. They just had to go cinemax, so the movie wasn't a total waste of time, but no. With a screenplay, this terrible, they had to capitalize on Wuhrer's appearance, as it was the only proponent of the movie. 2/10 just because she looks so hot.
