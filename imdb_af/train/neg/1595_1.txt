The movie confronted me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was natural and not so interested in the other movies. It was a waste of money and time. Same grain humor and cliche bad guys. The movie was of no use if you wanted to make Pokemon known. The movie should not be better associated with animations such as Dragonballz, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawings and settings are of no level that rises to the standards of original anime. It's a pity to even talk about this movie. I'm sure Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on Pokemon. Digimon is more of an anime and does not fall near Pokemon. This is the second time the second movie came out in 2002.
