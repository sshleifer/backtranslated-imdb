I'm in bad movies, but it doesn't matter. Despite what the morons mentioned above, it is not funny. I know comedy and underground movies, but it's so boring that the Director / Author should ever be banned from ever regulating ANY local cable access! To love movies and comedies is to despise this movie. I can never see how indecent and boring this work was. If you like this movie, you're a pothead like sober, there's nothing here. ZERO! If you have to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or early John Waters. The movie begins with the definition of satire and I defend someone to show me the satire. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUNNY, you can say or do something, but if it's not funny, you're not satirical, you're not edgy, you're just pathetic and this movie is simple not funny. ZERO!
