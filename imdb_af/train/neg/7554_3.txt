I have never seen the 1973, highly rated version. I'm a Nicholas Cage fan (incidentally, good as usual). This movie has probably been hammering for five minutes to hammer the whole plot (I can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at an evening party), if you can't figure out the end of this shoot in the first thirty minutes, you probably find this movie entertaining. It's too late, the horrible destruction Hollywood has dug for itself with the horror / mystery / thriller genre, can't give the audience enough credit and write a fresh, clever and surprising script, they make some dirty music and throw in a few things to make you jump and then send the final print to your local theater. At least it didn't have the jiggling hand-camera syndrome.
