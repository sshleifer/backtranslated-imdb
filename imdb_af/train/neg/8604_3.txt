Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a trivial role in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there are murderous snails in his small town. Not only snails, but only carnivorous killer larger than normal, mutated by poisonous waste (which is still as fast as a normal snail, which is not as scary but I deviate). No one will believe him, but they will. Oh yes, they will. <br /> <br /> OK, killer snails are right above psychotic lazy and right under Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the creepiness factor. So the absurdity of all this is clear from the visit. The movie is a bit on the look and feel of being so bad it is a good variety. I appreciate being spelled out that it was snails: the movie unlike snails: the child's play or snails: the other white meat. Probably not worthy to watch it more than once and forget it soon, except to play a rather obscure trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is more known for his previous films "Pod People" (which mocked MST3K fairly) and "Peices" (which is probably the funniest bad movie ever made). <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T&A <br /> My Degree: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Just a theater trailer for this movie
