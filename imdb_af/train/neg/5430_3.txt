Priyadarshan - When a person heard his name, his first thought would be "comedy". This is what this man is known for, or rather known for. After giving a spectacular comedy like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train slowly distracted with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I still can't remember. Dhol is now a mixture of bad, indecent toilet cats, a bit of drama, poor tension and idiocy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes that were funny, but not scary. Secondly, apart from Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandmother, the play was decent. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the acting, and I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were on top (if you compare them to the other in the movie), then Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and finally the two idiots mentioned above. The mistake in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandmother first looked like a ghost, and she wasn't funny at all, but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same, seen before one. Need four boys behind girls and money, but with a few twists. There is a bad man who is completely stupid and stupid. And finally the good wins over the bad and everything is good. The idea of ​​having a Dhol with a ton of cash is simply not greasy. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of the movie is its length. After an hour or so you get exhausted and you want to leave the theater. But to be critical, it's my responsibility to endure the entire two and a half hours of the movie. The movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated time after time and the situations are always just another place. <br /> <br /> When your mother-in-law arrives at your home and starts scoffing at everything, send her this movie and enjoy it. 3 out of 10.
