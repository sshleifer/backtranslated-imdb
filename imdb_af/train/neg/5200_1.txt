This movie is very very poor. I saw better movies. <br /> <br /> There was a little tension, but not much to get you out of your chair. It slowly starts building tension. It's not a success. At least if you ask me. Although I have to say at some points or moments it was a little funny when people were shot and how they went down. <br /> <br /> They should have made it like Scary Movie, then it might be a better movie. Because I just watched some pieces of the movie by hitting screens and it became boring with the movie. I have to say I felt good to watch this movie so I can say it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time even thinking about doing something with this movie, except leaving it where it is already. Somewhere very dusty ..
