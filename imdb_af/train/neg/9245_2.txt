This video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995. Beautifully finished! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have great screen chemistry when talking about what the Start button does. I'm waiting for Microsoft to download a special edition DVD with the deleted scenes, Bill Gates commentary, a documentary version of how Windows 95 compares to Windows XP, and more! <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 won at least a Golden Globe)
