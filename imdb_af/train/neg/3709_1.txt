First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies, but this movie is just like my summary. The greatest Sack or Crap ever. In the beginning, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who gets scary at a comedy building called the Apollo. On his way home from a march while riding on his bike, he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a truck. A short while ago he chose the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then he pulls himself out like the music group Outkast while trying to play the scene from the original where he comes as a Jockey. Second, he goes back to the Apollo, and tries to be the comedian he tries to be in his previous body and begins to reject the white population and try to be black. Do you get my drift? This movie is horrible, it is trying too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out like a bag of shit. Just take my advice, don't even look at this movie.
