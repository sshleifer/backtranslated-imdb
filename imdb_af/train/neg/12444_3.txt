Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space girl costumes. <br /> <br /> I love 50 sci fi, I even love cheesy 50s sci fi, but this movie is really very bad. And not in a MST3K way. <br /> <br /> Almost irreconcilable as a few madness, do their best "hip cat" impression from Abott & Costello. <br /> <br /> Chesscake can usually save cheesy sci fi, as in "Cat Women On The Moon", but it can't be in this case. This movie needs a dumb button and fast forward. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I could watch Gloria and Dolores roam the spacecraft about an hour or so.
