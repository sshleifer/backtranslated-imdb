I don't know what Margaret Atwood thinks to allow this movie to have the same name as her book. I have always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works. I am aware that the translation from book to movie is not perfect, but this movie was the worst ever. The names of the women are correct and some of the back stories are correct, but that's about it. I feel like I've lost a good portion of my time making it through this movie. It really had to be a mini-series to tell the story as it was written. <br /> <br /> The actors for Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well chosen, although I was initially skeptical about Maria-Louis Parker. I just wish they had a better script to work with, because it had nothing to do with the book.
