I was one of those "little Americans" who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds were a great series for the time and would have made a wonderful action / adventure movie if only the writers could find out where to go. <br /> <br /> I was expecting it to be a skirt, but I did it. Don't expect it to strive for such a low age group. As lost in space, both could have been visually amazing and exciting. It should have focused on more action / adventure and the purpose of the original series ... to save people in trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead, it focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who also threw young at any rate against the original). The breaking part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I don't care too much for the characters in the original, but I was grateful for them in the movie. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed Thunderbirds for high technology and stories, and even that didn't have enough screen time for me. I would have liked more of the cool gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then I'm just a big kid ...;)
