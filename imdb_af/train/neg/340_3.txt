Of course, I think the reason why this movie did so well is Eddie Murphy. I think it was his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop" so he was hot. As one made over two hundred million and it was R and this one made about 80 million and it was pg, it says it wasn't that popular. I've never been a great Eddie Murphy fan, so it's probably another reason I didn't care much for that. This one has Eddie as a sort of seeker of lost children. He must find the golden child or the world is in a terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is, it doesn't compare with the special effects. I saw better things done in the 70's than some of the things this one offers, Ray Harryhausen did better things. Yet the main reason why you see such a movie is because of Eddie. Unfortunately he is not very funny in this one and it just seems stupid to put him in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" type of scene. I think they were hoping for a fish that was out of water, but it just didn't work for me.
