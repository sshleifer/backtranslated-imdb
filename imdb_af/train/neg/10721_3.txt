An expedition led by the brave Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to a previous expedition. They meet beautiful, mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. They quickly confronted themselves with a blood mummy ... and only Simira seems to know what is going on. <br /> <br /> A real snoozer. I caught it on the late night TV when I was about 10. It slept me! See it all the years later I can see why. It's slow moving, the mummy doesn't even get up to 40 minutes (and it's only 66 minutes!), The scene ranges from bad (Dana) to REAL bad (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood found This movie concentrates more on drama in the second pace (with a foolish love triangle) than horror. <br /> <br /> These prizes are three star because it looks really good, everyone plays it straight, there's a good thing from Diane Brewster, it's short and the mummy attack scenes (all three of them) are not bad. They are not terribly just soft. Yet this movie is pretty bad. A safe fire cures for insomnia.
