I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie. It's so boring that I feel I've been watching for 3 hours. Some where the plot summary says: "But what Satan doesn't know, he's stuck with annoying tourists." Well, they didn't bother him in the movie, just me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I like bad movies but it was just boring.
