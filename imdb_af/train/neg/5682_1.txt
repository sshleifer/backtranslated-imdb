This movie is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but it's the worst I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie are not shown. It just shows us both dead bodies, and the only death scenes they actually show in this movie are terrible. The graphics look so natural. The actors are also terrible. There is no real emotion from any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this piece of k * t movie, but I had to subject myself to the real footage of animals being hit at the beginning. If I could rate it a -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It's crap. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it.
