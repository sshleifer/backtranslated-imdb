this movie was just stupid, i don't think it was scary, i was hoping to be shocked and scared but mostly laughed at the screens, just to fall and throw together. Blood scenes were much above the CG and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking too sucked because the acting was just plain horrible you think they might have some good actors and most of the characters I hated just because how stupid and crippled they acted, even though they were supposed to be in the army, I watch movies for free and see many people running out and guessing because it was so stupid, I didn't need to pay it briefly. DOMB ASS MOVIE doesn't see it ... but then it's my opinion again
