Once again, Disney is making a children's movie that completely ignores its background. The only thing about this and the original Gadget cartoons is the names. The scariest mistakes are the characters - Penny doesn't have her book. Brain has been reduced to a fancy prop. Dr Claw is more of a show than a bad villain. But there is more to it. The horrors start from the first minutes of the film - with Gadget as a security guard named John Brown, not helping him as the classic Inspector Gadget. And in the beginning we see Disney's blatant attempt to ever change every story into a love relationship between a man and a woman. They suggest Brenda, who only serves to make this movie Disney compatible. Add to this the fact that the "Claw" seen in this movie and the classic Dr Claw are almost diagonally opposite and you will see that it will be nowhere near the original story. What would help would be a better storyline to replace it - but as you guess, Disney hasn't succeeded. The whole movie is just Gadget who is foolish for psychology and Brenda. As if the insult to the injury was added, Disney launched the new Gadgetmobile. It doesn't seem to work or think like the old Gadgetmobile. It's just the canonical "comic relief" figure. Disney, of course, realized that the gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they also made the movie a comedy, but they exploded all the clever holes (such as the headline paper) and replaced with Gadget as Moron, the Gadgetmobile is a wise ass, and "Claw" shows off. Someone should tell Disney that "child movie" does not imply "total lack of brain consumption". Gadget should be targeted for children aged 10-12 ... not children from 10-12 months like this movie. Whatever this movie should be, it's NOT, repeat NO, the real Gadget Inspector. Because I like the old Gadget, I hate it.
