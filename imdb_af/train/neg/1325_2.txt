Richard Dreyfuss is indeed in this movie, but in a fairly small part. He is not the "obsessed" filmmaker - he is the group's business manager / accountant. Even the box describes the movie inaccurately. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke as advertised unless one uses the term "erotic" altogether. I would not have considered watching the movie without Richard Dreyfuss in it as an important character. However, I might have realized that the famous 60th anthem, Leonard Cohen's "Suzanne" was an artistic influence. In addition to the brief overview of lines from the end of James Joyce's "Ulysses", and an interesting visual reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal", I have made a poor effort to symbolize elements and moods. immortalized immortal in films such as "Last year at Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou." If you like the idea of ​​eccentric artistic troops, there are much better movies, ranging from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" to "Cecil B. Demented."
