When I first saw, I thought it would be a good sasquatch movie. Usually when you have these kinds of movies, there is generally ONE sasquatch, but in this one is there like what? 7 or 10 of them? Acting was good, plot was OK, I like the screens where the sasquatch kills the first few victims, very good camera work. I expected it to be a gory movie, but it was very little. This movie was better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel should really make more sasquatch movies, I mean I loved Sasquatch Mountain very much, Abominibal wasn't good, the one I reviewed was OK, but the movie was Sasquatch, but I reviewed it don't let me get back on track. This movie is good for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but for any other occasion, no.
