Sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can give is that it maintains the old tradition. These three stories are not as good as any of the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> By far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol that comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who murdered its owners. The second story is about a lake monster that seems to be nothing more than a very floating scrap, wondering how someone might be scared about it. The third story includes a comic from Stephen King as a truck driver, but otherwise it is a very relentless story about the victim of a traffic accident coming back from death for the person who dropped him. <br /> Just look at the original Creepshow, or if you've already done so, be happy with it.
