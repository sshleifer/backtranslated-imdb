I despise horror movies, it's no secret. No plot, bad acting and liter of blood are staples of these mistakes of the theater, and this "movie" is no exception. I can't believe some cable stations actually operate this garbage. (This particular garbage is released straight-to-video, as I remember.) Like to mention, any other movie will be a great insult to the other movie, I say it: All the Phantasm movies, all Jason movies, Freddy movies, Chucky movies, and most Michael Myers movies can be summed up in one word: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
