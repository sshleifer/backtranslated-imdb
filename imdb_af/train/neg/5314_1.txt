Music that sharpened on the nerves such as fingernails on a blackboard, acting so viciously, was sorry that the roll throw is wasted by not making a second movie; throw everyone in it as real zombies --- with the cast of Sabrina the Teenage Witch as the heroes ... a movie so terribly horrible that if "stoners" were still around, it can be considered a cult movie --- but, o Amateur, the scripts can be worn by the actors. Read their lines as they slowly turn through the movie. Banal, illogical sets modeled on LA subdivisions, props straight to ToysRus! Was there ever a movie so completely and totally inactive? Logic flies to the wind in this plodding, senseless, useless and with a "monster" so stupid and uncoordinated that it can't catch a turtle in a fridge --- low, leggy --- and amazon! It kept my attention throughout; the way a terrible continuous chain crash in the various vehicles involves keeping one up to the end ... like after a ridiculous jet gun in a prison on another planet, a pneumatically-disadvantaged sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter chases a delayed extraterrestrial refugee --- TO EARTH! Don't allow anyone on your popcorn, you might enjoy watching this one. It's so bad!
