It could be a strong candidate for "The Worst Flick Ever". Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, it can be tolerated as a children's movie. The TRAGEDY of this whole effort, however, is that John Hurt, one of the screen's greatest actors, reduces himself in this. I gave it two points just because Mr. Hurt SHOWED UP ... I take 8 points away because he doesn't run fast from there. As for the rest of the cast, they are simply awful. Janine Turner, as beautiful as she can be, can't act to save her soul. And the main actor is, for all purposes, WHEN. If you can save yourself this embarrassment, please do so. It's so bad, it almost fails.
