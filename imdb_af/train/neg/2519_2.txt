I actually paid to see this movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> It will get a 1-rating, but the battle scenes between the robots are good and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have bigger budgets than others. I don't have a problem with that. Unfortunately, scientific fiction movies are probably the smallest budget for the obvious reasons. But one way in which this movie fails, is that just about every piece of each set looks and cheap. I mean, can't they even make it look good? <br /> <br /> The other big reason why this movie is terrible is the play. Looking at the movie now and knowing what to expect, I can just enjoy it. It was for the cheese factor, but at the time I expected a good movie and had no idea how terrible it was. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience was in just 85 minutes.
