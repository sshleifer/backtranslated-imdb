I watched "The Eye" before watching this one. I really liked "The Eye", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror cinema. So, I chose this "Bangkok Ghost" because it was the same director, and it was so popular here. But man, who is a disappointment ... "Bangkok haunts" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. What is not scary at all, not even disturbing (as the eye was) ... nothing. I can't even fill out the 10 rules needed for the comment. <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10
