The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, even if it is an understatement. This movie doesn't just cry - it screams loud enough to break glass. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made shrewd, humorless tension teams that strive for a semi-documentary feel. Here they shot at the real New York places with tinny "real-life" acoustics to chase away the veracity. But the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to strengthen the Stones' maladroit dialogue and the mouth-watering histrionics of tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> In a performance that is completely without modulation, Stevens plays the wife of electronics Whiz James Mason (look at haggard and bored); Both are captured by the extortion stick Rod Steiger (look bloated and bored) and its clever cohorts in a scheme to enforce an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason unknowingly helped to build. <br /> <br /> Here's another credibility strain. An example of a criminal master brain that is so brilliantly attentive to every detail, yet enough to hire a drug addict degenerate as a downfall. The Stones' idea of ​​nail-like tension is to catch the Stevens alone with the Benzedrine pop rapist Neville Brand, who fills the frame with his sweat, cold kisser. But the camera work is so loaded and so burns (uncharacteristic) demure that the effect is hardly lurid, much less voltage. The Stones, a square pair at heart, do not even have the courage of their own lack of beliefs. <br /> <br /> The movie, which ends with the Portly Steiger, which trains fleetfoot Stevens on a subway train, is as clumsy as its ominously heavy. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's amoral friend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey, and Barney Philips.
