It has high intellectual pretensions. The leader intends to give a "deep" "meaningful" version (with voice over to his state of mind of course) and he is certainly influenced by the fifties and sixties "method" - which, when writing and direction was bothering has achieved great results (see Clift, Newman, Winters). But here's the story abysmal. Besides moving too slowly, you can change at least 20 minutes, including senseless flashbacks - and the plot line won't be. change. Sometimes it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his "Uncle" character and his portrayal is often on parody. An interesting side is just being persuaded: the young boy / hero relationship - or we admit that the hero himself is kind of a child - when he tells the young child that he would not hurt anyone, there comes a welcome tenderness for. But it is blown and just the last scene returns. <br /> <br /> Word of the Wise: Take Foley's "Close Up" Rather: It Has Two Big Actors (Christoph's Walken and Sean Penn together!), it's also a horrible movie, but it's tempting, exciting. Review my hitchcockometer worse to zero throughout.
