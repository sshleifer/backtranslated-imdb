Jean Seberg did not have one iota of acting talent. Like all her films, Bonjour tristesse does not like her appearance (although she may be the first of those modern women, Tom Wolfe describes happily, accurately as "boys with breasts": publishers obviously use the word "gamine") but suffers heavily from Seberg's dull, monotonous, deadly voice. In all her films when she had to play anger, Seberg played it with grossly audible, distracting, gossip panting between her monotonous drunkenness. Oy. <br /> <br /> Preminger's adaptation of Françoise Sagan's breathtaking youthful fantasy soap opera plot is just remarkable for his sumptuous cinematography - but then it's hard to operate on the photographic French Riviera, and perhaps for his appetite but certainly not groundbreaking work, black and white work for the contemporary screens from which Seberg's monotonous narrative leaves us to the enlightened display. <br /> <br /> For a short time, Juliette Gréco has been a nightclub chanteuse in the black and white spotlight, which in the smoky Dietrichesque voice gives the dark existential lyric of the title song. This moment is more than a little drooling in the future. Except of course, if you are French - especially if you are a French 68-year-old who longs for the glorious days of the barricades around the Sorbonne - and your children's uproar to retain the lifelong sinecures that France's face and emasculate economy: you still believe in Sartre and Foucault and all such arcane, irrelevant theorists. <br /> <br /> David Niven has the hardest part to play with enough gusto an aging hedonist who still has to understand that life is not "It's all about Sagan's teenage figures of a hip, cool, swingin" 'mon copain! "Dad. Deborah Kerr delivers her ordinary, completely professional presence, convincingly playing the woman who plays carelessly. Seberg's fearless teenage jealousy (fulfillment of Sagan's level-of-age fantasy of the Classic theme of "there can be only one Queen's in the hive"); In fact, Kerr is the only big and memorable screen moment of the movie. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is unnatural. I agree with an earlier reviewer who said it was a very bad translation of French; combines the unnatural essay with Seberg's incomparably dull, indelible monotonous and you can save that Valium for another night. In addition, the incessantly synchronized post-production voice coding is almost straight, obvious and so much more than irritating. This is especially true for Mylène Demongeot, as it otherwise spoils her very pleasant silly blonde performance. <br /> <Hunky Geoffrey Horne gets the tip of the stick here - a very nice young man who has also suffered from a less than lovely, unimaginative voice, which, when associated with Seberg's drones, is undoubtedly scenes of puppy love. (Horne, if we were to say, was just enough in 'Bridge On the River Kwai', perhaps because of the end by big-screen predictors William Holden and Jack Hawkins instead of being supported by the unfortunate unsaved Seberg). <Br /> <br /> In short, 'Bonjour tristesse' is nice to look at, but it's shallow, immature soap: thin gruel with soot.
