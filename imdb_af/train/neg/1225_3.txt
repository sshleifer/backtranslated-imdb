Well, let me start by saying how completely HILARIOUS this movie is, I just couldn't laugh at its mere stupidity. Don't get me wrong, it's good, especially by Bassinger, but the writing is just. Well, the thoughts really work. <br /> <br /> The premise is good and until Della actually testifies to the murder, it is endearing but then it just goes downhill. Halfway through the film, the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and, of course, instead of making it to the parent's head, she decides to pull out a screwdriver, car snare and finally a flare (like in a sink). kill her victims. <br /> <br /> Then there's the final line I promise, if it doesn't have you in stitches, then I'll eat my own left foot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie. to those who just want to laugh at some good old-fashioned, scary movies. Perhaps I would also suggest that you watch the scene in the scrap yard with the guy who falls from one foot high wooden board every time.
