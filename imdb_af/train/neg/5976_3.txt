The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than guys. And the reasons are clear as soon as the plot is given. Jersey girl goes to New York to become a songwriter. And after the first frustration of being unsuccessful, some girls are hearing about the $ 300 each they made last night. She gets an audition at the bar where they work and surprise! The place is full of "two-year-olds" dancing on the lookout for babies. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are nice, especially Cammie (the "fashion coordinator" party was cute) and the bouncer but let's see it, the drama was terrible and totally laughable from the beginning. Violet and her father looked far too ridiculous as they were related throughout the film. And also look at Violet on the keyboard with the break dancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time I could think, how can production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this movie, Hollywood can stand on its two feet and display a new layer without any big public exclamation without saying, "You're warned!" Instead, it looks as if COYOTE UGLY is trying to kiss every big back world in the world. Advertise kids in a bar, but show a paper thin "dream to your dream" story disappointed every male teenager you've targeted! <br /> <br /> And finally, the music. There was absolutely no pause in music I found in this movie, especially when needed (the hospital scene). Every scene felt like a short music video you just wanted to stop until the bar opened. But the climax was an ultimate heavier: an 80's like a song you'd expect from Cyndi Lauper to jump on stage and jam with Violet. Very, I personally thought Bon Jovi would also jump with the long hair and jam! <br /> <br /> Unlike a very clever camera working with the coyote girls when they dance (especially the wet scene) and some cute cliches, COYOTE UGLY is something to be ashamed of. Whether you watched or made it, it looked like nothing but the time to kill. Or waste depending on how you see it.
