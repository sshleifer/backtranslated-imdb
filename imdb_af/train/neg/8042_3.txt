The secret is ... this movie is blowing. Sorry, but it just did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riff on I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE LAST SUMMER AND SCREAM, Beth, played by Dorie Barton join several friends on a Spring Break trip. The group is renting a nice home and trying to enjoy a fun holiday. Then death begins. Only one more, then one of the friends is murdered, leading to a sad and thin climax with predictable results. <br /> <br /> One note, Dorie Barton is the poor man's Reese Witherspoon? She looks like Reese, acts like Reese and can succeed Reese in a police action. Maybe that's how they throw her? Anyhoo, proper cinematography and fair play cannot really make for bad dialogue and terrible writing.
