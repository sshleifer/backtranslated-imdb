For a good half hour or so, I remember myself, "Hey, this can be Bill Rebane's best performance ever!" The opening rows are atmospheric, there are instantly some terrifying moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker "The Giant Spider Invasion" in a playful way. The concept is stupidly stolen from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill", with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to a secluded house to win $ 1,000,000 in a game of elimination. Of course, the contestants disappear quickly and one by one and it takes the remaining greedy bud heads too much time before they realize that the old people are sadists ... or there is another killer among them. The movie begins and ends with a weird narrator who tells many senseless things that are not relevant or even interesting to the plot, but there is a nice T&A to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo (Shelly , I believe she was called) is really hilarious to observe. Of course, after the first half hour, the inevitable happens and "The Cold" turns into a Rebane production textbook with delayed plot twists, the stupidest dialogues ever and a total lack of excitement. There was no budget for bloody murders, but our multi-talented director (?) Tried to compensate with endless footage of disco-dance girls and an amateur rock band. The movie also has four or even five different climbs and none of them is a little bit satisfying. Perhaps it was an inspiration to LOTR: Return of the King? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
