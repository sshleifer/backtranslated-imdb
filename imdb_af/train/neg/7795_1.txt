First, I'm not really a fan of all the "stuff that flesh eats in the disgusting new ways" genre of the movie, but I'm a bad movie afficionado, so my neighbor said he had the worst movie ever had. This one. So we start to look. First, it's recorded on a camcorder sans tripod! Secondly, the voice of the skinny white doctor is baptized by a big black man! Thirdly, none of the dialogue makes sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and dumb of poor makeup and tomato paste, lead me to believe that the director (and my neighbor neighbor) needs psychological help. It's funny for about 5 minutes, but it gets old fast. It's so amateurish, it's like watching a poorly bought high school video yearbook ... with zombies. A note to anyone involved in this movie. I want the 20 minutes of my life. I spent it before I fell asleep.
