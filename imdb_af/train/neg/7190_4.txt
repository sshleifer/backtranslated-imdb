The 7EVENTY 5IVE plot involves college kids playing a brutal phone game that unexpectedly (for them, if not for horror fans) enter their heads. The story of 7EVENTY 5IVE, on the other hand, is that of a horror movie that had a very small promise, which was unfortunately excited by very bad writing. <br /> <br /> What could have been a pleasure, as a somewhat stupid, old-fashioned slasher story, is escaped early by the filmmakers' deceptive belief that the audience will enjoy a bunch of hard, shiny, rich children who connect most of the movie's running time. With the exception of a police detective played by Rutger Hauer, each character on the screen is another race of young A-hole. In a minor role designed primarily to add the film's only strength. <br /> <br /> Man and woman, black and white, straight and gay, a whole ensemble of shallow and shrewd college kids carry the bulk of the film's story. Worse, since the story about a PARTY game goes wrong, most of the time the screens are completely filled with this little b ***** ds. As a result, there are few pauses for the viewer, which must catch the sharp sniping of the heavy protagonists. Although at least some of these people are thought to be friends, all characters always vary in a very hostile way, long before a real conflict actually arises. This leads to the worst possible result in a treasure trove: The audience, which is meant to care about the clues, does not only plead for the anonymous killer, but wished he had come to pick up the fleeting brats much earlier. <Br /> <br /> The real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7EVENTY 5IVE actually has a potential. Visually this is good. First time directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build an exciting mood. They also succeed in rendering some skilled, as sparse, moments of classic 80's style. Surprisingly, the production output is also quite capable. It's not that the actors aren't able to express realistic human emotions; It's simple that the script (co-written by newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks, who went much better behind the camera than with a keyboard) is short of such moments. <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE can hardly be recommended, as its well-known prospect and little excitement cannot leave the bad taste left by a story driven by a lot of unpleasant characters. In this low misconception, the real mystery is why someone cares about a group of young people who can't even love each other.
