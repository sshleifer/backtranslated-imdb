This film is not only a very bad movie, with frightening actors - or suspected actors - a bored direction and a story that is unattractive. It also replicated exactly a scene from the excellent "giallio" Torso, led by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years ago), one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of Italian theater and a cult film around the world. In 'La Sanguinusa conduce la danza', the director repeated the bedspread between the black girl and the white girl, with a look looking out of a window in the bedroom. Of course, the scene in Rizzo's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the gentleness and charm of Martino's film. To place another black girl is another white girl and another girl who plays the scene again, simply the best way to prove that Rizzo's movie has no ideas, no originality, no taste and nothing. I think such things are an offense to the spectator.
