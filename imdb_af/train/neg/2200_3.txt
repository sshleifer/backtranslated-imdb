I love bad shark movies. I really do. I laughed hysterically at them. and the scifi channel had a marathon of them, culminating in the premier of their new original picture, hammerhead: shark frenzy. Based on the previews, it seemed to be very entertaining. basically a remake of benchley's creature, really. It was predicted by a show of shark attack 3: megalodon, which is the shark movie hilarity at its best. I was in the mood; I was ready to go. bring it up, hammerhead mad scientist man! Oh, god, that movie was wrong. <br /> <br /> wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br /> sick. turned. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> This is theoretical reproduction at the very worst, my friends. when a stunned girl is brought out of a suspended animation and strapped to a table screaming her head, because the shark-human hybrid fetus wants to utterly outrageous "scientist" intentionally implanted in her womb Jesus monkey. That's what I call disturbing. <br /> <br /> It's really how the plot works: hmmm, the crazy scientist thinks. My son died of cancer, but I brought him back by combining his DNA with that of a hammerhead shark, because sharks don't survive cancer and reproduce further hammerheads via placenta. Oh, look! a perfect amphibious creature! I created the following evolution of humanity! I KNOW! let's propagate him! but warned if all those sharks did not make my son bloodthirsty; Instead of raping the hot babies, I still keep in his jungle paradise, and he still eats him. but check it out! among the random people who landed on my research island by way of a trivial plot, is the woman to whom my son was engaged before he died! I bet he'll do her! all this leads to an extremely convenient and cordial reunion: woman: are you going to make me busy? mad scientist: no. he is. (indicates rabbit in the tank) how sweet. <br /> <br /> DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE. ever.
