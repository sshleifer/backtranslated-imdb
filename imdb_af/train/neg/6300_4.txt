It was a strange combination of Withnail and I with a room with a view. Sometimes it worked, other times it didn't. tragedy that they have changed the name for the American release. Keeping the Apidistra Flying is much better than the Nothing's a Merry War. acting was okay, script was okay. overall it was a mediocre movie.
