As a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of BSG and the standalone feature, BSG Razor, I hoped this release would bring the franchise back to its original glory days. Usually I have no problem with science fiction, which is mostly dialogue-driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is rigid with some original ideas made by good actors, one can create an in-depth movie with little CGI money spent. This prequel has none of the above requirements. The virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous and incredible. This scene was simply there to limit the release criteria to Limited. Not that teenagers do not love virtual reality, with an effort of sex and violence and heavy dance music. This is the part about the same teens with the intellectual depth and reason or political and religious passion to create such futuristic software or to make suicide bombings that plague me. These children are definitely not of this planet. The movie plays like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes of slightly interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz gives his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade, was amusing or not entertaining. But this old concept is much better portrayed and much more credible in the brilliant, classic original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips his only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror movie. No surprise there! Overall, this movie is fine and original and inexpensive, using reclaimed CGI from Caprica from BSG. I doubt I will watch this space soap when it is on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless of course I suffer from a bad bug of insomnia, this show will definitely be the cure. Zzzzzzzz
