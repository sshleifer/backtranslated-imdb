Nobody should ever try to customize a Tom Robbins screen book. While the movie is good and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well to read it, is clipped when it is spoken. Or to put it differently, no one would probably suggest that someone else's name be heard as if it was written in radium on a pearl. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie feels like a heavily customized Stone Notes to the book - most of the parts are down in the book to a fifth of their size in terms of background and current story, and the end is wild (and unpleasant) other than that of the book. Most of the images from the book have been lost, including the one that does everything in the end, and there is more than one reference that makes sense in the book the viewer says "Huh?" Not a worthy effort, unfortunately - the writing had to be read, compared to the book, burned, and all the actors sent out to do something much better. I admire Gus Van Sant unbelievably, but not even one of his caliber could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries.
