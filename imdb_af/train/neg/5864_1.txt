I'm sure it's the worst movie ever made. If you can't make a 13-year-old boy, you can give the comedy humor. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. The movie is full of predictable gags (some of which are racist) and very indifferent jokes. Especially memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit is dead and he is pregnant (as I write it, I can't believe it was actually a movie). The man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctor's bench and tries to give it mouth to mouth. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The punch line that can tell how bad things are in this movie is, "I knew I had to be on top." ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
