All right, let me break it down for you guys. It's contemptuous! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble did such a fine job on the first cruel intentions, why did he do such a bad job. I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid, it's probably better than its series ever broadcast, but it can be realistic. This movie is a crook! Very bad acting * NOTE The Shower scene * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What kind of rule is this? "Slipery when wet" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This movie has trouble, I'll give it to you, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it funny by giving the housekeepers dumb accents that were actually .... It was pathetic. Not to mention that they all made in this one. Absolutely nothing like the original cast. It's as if they are making them look different or different over time! I like to watch it when I really really advice what doesn't happen occasionally. For those of you who liked it ... Okay, what did you think? Can you possibly choose this movie about the other one that had great acting and the fantastic Sarah Michelle Gellar? A movie is gold if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar in it, DUH! But this movie doesn't, no crime Amy Adams. Oh yes, since then, Sebastain has a heart ????? UGH!
