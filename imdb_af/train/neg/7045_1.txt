It must be the worst, and I mean the worst biker movie ever made! And it says a lot, because the line of stinkers is long and stinky! <br /> <br /> At least we know what happened to Ginger after she was saved from Gilligan's island! A terrible look at Tina Louise (she was probably afraid someone would see this mess!) Is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history. But, don't worry about fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a doctor with a doctor, come to the rescue! Pow! Beloved! Boom! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good points of this "bomb" are some cute women, some ridiculous combat scenes, and the "sexy" Tina Louise!
