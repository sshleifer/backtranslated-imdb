My friend's mother worked at a video store and watched movies before they came out. When she brought The Convent, a horror movie, home, I couldn't wait to see it. Since it's supposed to be frightening, but actually actually hilarious, I can say it in a strange way, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! "WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!" I didn't know this movie was ever released ... I thought it was too bad ... yes, so ... overall the movie is very bad (you have to admit so much to the least), but I promise you, you will get a good laugh from it. <br /> <br /> * This movie is so nice, but it's good for a laugh ... especially the man who's the "dagger of despair" .. THE DAY OF DESPAAAAAIR!
