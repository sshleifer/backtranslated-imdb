The movie itself is so pathetic. It depicted deaf people as cynical to hear people. True, some deaf people are cautious about hearing, but they are not necessarily angry, because Marlee Matlin's character was throughout the story. Deaf does not go to the bar and dance as Matlin did. All in all, the film itself is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring that I want to believe it's an insomnia. If I have a problem sleeping, I can simply plug in and look at Children of a Little God. It will make me sleep. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, it's a deaf guy talking.
