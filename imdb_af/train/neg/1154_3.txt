May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) pay an apparently irregular visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even if the visit starts, Toots has a fatal heart attack, which leaves May, uncertain and questioning her life and future. <br /> <br /> To lure herself to her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, but for all its proclaimed realism and praise, the Mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant, even repulsive characters, and asks the viewer to engage with them. Reid shines in May, and it's her skill and dedication as a wonderfully understated actor who saves the movie from a completely depressing ant, but Michell and Kureishi allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such completely unpleasant characters. It is becoming increasingly difficult to care what happens with May. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are so completely selfish and cold-hearted that one begins to wonder what exactly Kureishi is trying to say. As indicated, they are either unwilling or not Bobby and Paula above the two-dimensional uplift in their atrocious selfishness. <br /> <br /> Appreciate Reid's performance, but little else. A crying shame ...
