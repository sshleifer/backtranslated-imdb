After reading the book, which had a lot of meaning to me, the movie didn't give me the feeling that the book had conveyed. It makes me wonder if Kaufman even kept this book because he successfully made it into something else. Or it's just bad. The most important is where the lights are? From the very first scene, music drowns most of the dialogue and feeling, and it stays throughout the film. I think the makers thought that playing good music through the movie would make it feel the story, but they completely failed here. Instead, the music succeeds in giving everything that 'movie feels' in a way that dramatizes events so that we stay on them, so everything really feels heavy. <br /> <br /> Another example of how this customization fails is by decorating the story line that makes it more dramatic. In the movie we see Franz leaving Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this accidental meeting / passing, which certainly did not happen in the book, gives Tomas's story more meaningful than it makes it light. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has changed, imo for the worst, but it could be done because the book simply doesn't turn into a movie, like Kundera's style. . It makes us wonder if all the generous judges on this site, with their book AND movie experience, rather than just writing about the film. A movie that is as long as it is indescribable. For those who haven't read the book yet, I recommend just reading it. For those who have, I must say you will just waste your time and probably eventually write similar lasting warnings here.
