Not so bad as it is credited to be (Hooper is worse) ?? more so disappointing to me. Such an imaginative concept, never used by Hooper with his economic direction, and even less in the smoky (excuse of the word) writing. It becomes so sinister and over-top in a deadly serious tone, becomes ridiculous and unfocused, so the whole pessimistic mystery / conspiracy-happy story is easily picked up to end up on something completely sudden. As a result, the pacing remains rather slow and Brad Dourif (cool to see him in a leading role) seems to struggle with a balanced performance, despite expressing a particularly peculiar intensity to his out-of-color character. Though cheaply done, there is a competent technical attitude to it. However, it does not seem to be anything out of the ordinary with his idea, and wants to push them into nasty thrust plaster (which does some work) and strikingly special effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper shows some stylish, frenetic images (more so on the last side), and the camera work is quickly adjusted and the radiant count is titrating. The performances are across the store with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis the small but amusing cameos ?? especially Landis. Nothing surprises, but it is passively endearing.
