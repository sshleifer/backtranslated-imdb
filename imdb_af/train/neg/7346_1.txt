I feel like I've just watched a snapshot .... a beautifully activated, naughty, annoying and horrible thing! A two-hour perversion in the most basic and all-encompassing sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, dapitation, incest, corruption, living burial and abuse, abuse, abuse. No salvation whatsoever. And I was entertained. I couldn't stop looking. What it says about me, about the people who do and do such things, and a world that has become so, is unhappy that ultimately real sniffing films will be the norm. And I'm not puritanical or humorous, I'm not trying to hide from the existence of darkness, and I certainly didn't lead a protected life, but I'm ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see my British cousins ​​dragging the topic, sewing the way my own tribe does. It doesn't have to be fun, but should it enclose it in a deadly sadism?
