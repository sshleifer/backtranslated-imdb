'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a few Australian postal service employees. They struggle to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past and accident are unclear and overshadowed. What is most disappointing, however, is the portrayal of life in the movie's title: there is no mechanization whatsoever and it is quite impossible to determine what any of the staff really does for a life. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this kind of office definitely closed in the 1930s if it ever really existed. It's a shame, because the movie's overall tone is dirty and cruel, and there are some promises in the scenario: little of the details convinced. In general, it feels the work of someone who has not really experienced much of real life; a student video, with a concept and an overview, but unfortunately little else.
