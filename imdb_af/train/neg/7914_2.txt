This film was divorced to be a flashy movie, and it really is. This is the type of film made to eat popcorn and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind, the movie may not deliver as well as the ultra-fast Iron Man, but good enough. Outside the popcorn action and special effects, the movie falls faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers, including myself, will complain about how most characters have changed badly, but it just makes the movie a bad adaptation, not a poor movie. This movie is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The makers have focused more on bringing them to the eye than they thought. The long-awaited and promoted characters are reduced to 4-scene comos. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the movie) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are set along the way to make room for the whole eye. Wolverine's character has been developed after 30 minutes, such as Sabertooth, although Victor slows the surprises late in the film. <br /> <br /> The "final boss" of the movie is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and hardly gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that everything they really needed to do was a bad donkey character who could do everything they wanted and clapped in the name of a popular character. Very disappointing ...
