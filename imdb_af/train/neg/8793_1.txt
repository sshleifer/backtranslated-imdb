For those who decide to watch this movie or not, read these comments for insight, I first offer the following four words: Don't waste your time! "Chungking Express" is rogue, fast-paced and seems to have been devised by a Hong Kong Burger King. I can't remember ever watching a movie with a variety of such one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this everyday! This is an absurd effort with philosophical ridiculous dialogue (a man wanders in his flooded apartment and offers the beautiful revelation that "tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop)". The same character is also seen as a deep, meaningful report with its towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. The shaky, walking craft camera work was another annoying feature I could have done without. And if it's not enough to get you out of your popcorn, we hear the granny "California Dreaming" by the Mamas and Papas over and over about a particularly long series of soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, although I couldn't figure out why my husband would be bothering his talent. He was known to have noticed: "I am very happy to love such a movie." Many of us hope, however, that he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more valuable discoveries in the future.
