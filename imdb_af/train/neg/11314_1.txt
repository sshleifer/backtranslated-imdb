This movie is probably the worst I've seen. Bad acting, bad writing, bad everything. Compare it mainly with two other films in the same genre and from about the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and look stronger in both story and direction. And it's still Albert Pyun who also regulates these two! <br /> <br /> The story isn't original. The world has become a terrible place, possibly because of an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live under medieval conditions. A special race of robots (cyborgs) live on human blood and there is the story ... The cyborgs must get many people to fulfill that "prophecy" and people need someone to stop them. One girl with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs was appointed by the lot to save mankind. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the director tries a few Hong Kong stylish fighting tones with the contestants. fly high and jump far. The movie fails miserably in this effort. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie with the only reason that most people will get a new "worst" movie to relate to. And to the fans of the genre, I recommend "Cyborg" as I think it is a very underrated movie with a fairly high maintenance factor. And if you can't stand Van Damme, look at "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> I evaluated this movie 1/10.
