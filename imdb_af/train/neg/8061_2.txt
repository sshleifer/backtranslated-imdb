May I start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work a lot. I wish he was in more movies showing his talent. With this said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I'm almost all the guilt on the poor writing. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley has an excellent performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller performed well and Eliza Dushku is currently the Hollywood girl. I don't think any of the actors really got in the writing, and I understand why. To say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement. It had the turn and turn you'd expect, but they just didn't go anywhere ... except for more confusion. I just found the end to be very anti-climate, because I didn't seem to be meaningful or really able to answer any of the questions I had about the storyline. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie a good review, but I can't. In all honesty, the only thing I think you'll find terrifying about this movie is that you've paid it.
