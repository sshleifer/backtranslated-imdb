It's really a new layer in entertainment. Although there are many worse movies. <br /> <br /> In the Gangster / Drug scene genre it is difficult to have a convincing storyline (these movies don't mean, I think Sebastian's motives can no longer be far-fetched and worn clich√©s.) Then You also need a set of character relationships that are credible. (This movie doesn't.) Sure, Tristan was taken away from his family, but why was it again? What is the relationship with his father that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need for rebellious behavior of children in high school. But this movie is not in this direction. Although there would be the potential assessment by random flashbacks. Wasn't he already occasionally, why does he do it again? <br /> <br /> So, there are some interesting questions raised here for a solid social-critical drama (but then this movie is just because it focuses on "cool" production techniques and special effects which does not reflect the characters for a moment and usually compels the story along the way where they want it to be and does not pay attention to the story and of course to develop it.) <br /> <br /> This wants to be a drama not to glorify substance and violence abuse (if it is politically wrong today), but on the other hand it is nothing more than a cheap action movie (as there are so many) with a average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who fail to completely destroy what is left of his reputation by doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> Everything in i ... just ... can't recommend it. <br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
