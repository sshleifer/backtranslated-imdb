If you want to build tension in a movie, it's always a good idea not to build it further than the total stage. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Butcher Brothers haven't understood it yet. <Br /> <br /> This movie sucks, unlike the majority of its characters who (if you haven't worked out, they are vampires in the first few minutes, then you scan) give preference to the abundant offerings of 'No one knows where I am cheerleader types and gay drifters who are comfortable and with a fast food swagger past their isolated door. <br /> <br /> The only small piece of originality in the plot is how these vampires become vampires in the first place. place, but the rest is ridiculous and messy. <br /> <br /> Armed to push sticks (as opposed to sticks) on a regular basis due to their love of filling their basement with bloodless bodies, they are really not too bright. If they fed their victims, they could manage their own small blood farm and that would decrease the mortality rate and thereby lower them and get chintzy. <br /> <br /> Why the growers need the turbulent twins and the gay gay older brother, I'm not sure. It added zero to the plot, which was unfortunate as there wasn't much plot to start with and had no shock value. <br /> <br /> One was never told why the parents died unless it was obviously explained during one of my regular tea fractions. Obviously, the social worker had to be warned to the family for some reason or the other. But it was for the viewer to write their own reason. <br /> <br /> The only well-rounded character was the youngest brother who emerged as Pugsley of the Adams family. In fact, he was completely finished, with the appearance of a child accidentally flew from a Weight Watchers class to a very horror movie. Oh, heaven, he did. Never love, still have a donut with a nice blood center.
