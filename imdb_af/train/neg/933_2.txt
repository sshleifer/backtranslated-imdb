Undeveloped / incredible story line, (by the time I figured out some of where it went, I didn't care anymore) badly decisive. (Come on ... William Macy as a hit man ???) Bad direction ever seen Tracey Ullman done so badly?) (Was I supposed to take care of what happened to the unethical incompetent, uncaring John Ritter's character?) Bad Writing ... (Really, I'm not looking for a formula script, but it was really awful) The only really good thing about it was the kid. Ten lines? It's not right if your comments are less than ten lines? Come on - who's rules are that? Why can't I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines ??? Isn't it so arbitrary? Why is it not right to have less than 10 lines of comment?
