Why was this movie made? Even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that Australian film investors have given, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the forefront. For the sake of well-being, the actors in this film are Aussie-b-grade celebs (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the original drummer of the group in Hey Hey Its Saturday, and the cast in Countdown. But if you say this, it's still very viewable, as long as you give it the brain's attention it deserves: nobody's writing is bad (even for a self-confessed b-degree horror) and the acting and movie quality is worse. Looks like it's a home movie, but even a home movie has "realism." Anyone interested in the Australian cinema, please, for the love of God, pretend that this movie was never made.
