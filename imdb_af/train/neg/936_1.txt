I don't understand people. Why is this movie a 8.3 !!!!!! get? I had high expectations for this movie, but once I was half an hour, I just wanted to leave the theater. In the vast majority of reviews on this site, people say it's one of the best action movies they've seen (or from the summer, year, etc.). They say this is an excellent conclusion. WTF !!!!!!!!! ?????? What ended (except that Bourne motorcycles can ride, shoot and fight better than anyone else)? What do you learn about Bourne's character in this movie ????????? Absolutely f ****** Nothing !!!!!!! Okay, there's a lot of action, but what's so nice about the action in this movie? I don't like cinematography and movie editing. The shaky camera effect and fast-changing shots were used too much, and they quickly became old (I didn't consider them in Supremacy, because it was still easy to follow and not used in excess) and got me dizzy. I soon wanted to save my $$$ for something else. <br /> <br /> This movie has no plot. All this movie is a 115 minute chase seen. Bourne, whom you learn absolutely nothing about the 115 minutes of the movie, is a perfectionist for everything he tries. There is absolutely no character development in this movie, you know nothing about anyone, and there is a wide variety of new characters offered in this installment. Some people said this movie has incredible writing and tension. ??????????? !!!!!!!! What writes ???? What tension ??? There is no tension. Bourne is so perfect to do everything he does, I don't think he has anything to worry about. If this is the best movie of the year 2007, I can just stop watching movies !!!! <br /> <br /> Many also said that Matt Damon's performance in this movie is one of the best (if not the best) of his career. Which display? How many lines did he have in this movie? I have some respect for Damon because he was in movies I liked and played different kinds of characters, but a good actor is someone you can hardly recognize from one movie to the next, someone who has different roles choose. Not someone who plays the same roles over and over (what Damon doesn't do, but an example of someone who does Vin Diesel). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie was a huge disappointment to me. I don't recommend this movie, but I recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and I definitely recommend reading the three books (which are very different from the movies).
