With such movies you know you will get the usual jokes about ghosts. Eve as a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors also do a good job. This is the direction and the story that is missing. It could have been overlooked if the jokes worked better. The problem is that there aren't many jokes. Sure, I laughed a few times. Apart from the talk-about, there was no creativity to be noticed in the movie. I blame the director for not using the prospect, it's full of potential. Eva certainly has the comic skill to show more, but has not had the opportunity to do so. Overall, this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. Other than that, it can be skipped completely.
