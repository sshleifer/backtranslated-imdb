This movie is so aggressive. The main character seems to be 35 and I have seen scraping beans with more balls than this man. The plot turns are so predictable, it's not even worth looking at the humor factor. <br /> <br /> Also, from the worst dialogue I've heard in 3 years, we can get a tiny animal to torture. br /> <br /> Ugh ..... I can't even continue, don't look at this stack of garbage, it's been made in 8 days. <br /> <br /> The one highlight is the drunk dude who calls the main character a torch for drawing photos. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, unfit
