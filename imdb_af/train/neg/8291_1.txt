An idiotic dentist finds out that his wife is unreliable. So, no new story lines here. The authors, however, managed to create a silly, disgusting movie. If you enjoy braaiing children or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife's teeth into a bloody horror type, watch or rent the movie. If not, move on to something else (MY BURGER LADY, someone?)
