Take a scientific original movie and mix into a small alternative / revisionist history, and you'll get "Aztec Rex." Apparently, Hernand Cortes had to conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and her mate before the Aztec Empire victory. This is the print of this movie. Given the plot it could really be sucked; The fact that it's just a kind of suck is a hint of the cap for the writers. There are some problems. For starters, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering is as Cortes about as convincing that Axl Rose Gandhi plays. And although Cortes overcame the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs look like a whole Hawaiian ensemble. Aside, the T-Rex (s) look pretty good, but every time one of them is shot, it's just CGI. And they die too easily; I suspect that if a T-Rex was in real life, they would probably have been caught or at least wounded by a little rudimentary 16th-century weapon. But it takes something away from the movie. There are also some graphic T-Rex swallow-human scenes, which is amazing, but in this context I thought they were working OK. There is a lot of action, and the whole colonization angle is quite common but does not overwhelm the dinosaur angle, unlike the other recent Scientific original dinosaur film Warbirds. Overall, a mediocre (but decent original SciFi original standards) movie that has a modest 4 treasure.
