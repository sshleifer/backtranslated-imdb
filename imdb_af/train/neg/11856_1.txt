I saw this movie last night in the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and it makes me seriously wonder if the people at the festival are actively screening the movies before they are chosen. The movie was just awful - I say it without hyperbola or root motives - it was terrible. Matthew Modine's days as a leading man are over. Gina Gershon had an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben had a strange little komo in her - she should be ashamed. The writing was terrible and we had absolutely no reason to care about the characters. I doubt it will be picked up, but then again, people in Hollywood sometimes make mistakes. I really think "Kettle of Fish" is a serious contender for the worst movie I've ever seen.
