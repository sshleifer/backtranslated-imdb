The last reviewer was very generous. I'm silent like the first movie, but can't say I enjoy this one much. The start is portable, but it goes down very quickly. I don't just see Jon Bon Jovi as a "bad vampire hunter" and the vampire princess isn't sexy or scary. Many of the screens just don't make sense. I mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly comes out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing ever explained in this movie, you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining, but it was too much to ask. It must be one of the worst vampire movies I've seen.
