As if there were not enough of those who are already swinging, we have another crippled GODFATHER clone from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) I watched earlier this year. The remarkable name that has been called at this time is Telly Savalas, who will soon see the proceedings and only be seen from behind, rather be campers on his flowers and wear a beret in the style of French painters! Apart from minimizing Sicilian, he does not play any accents of any kind other than his famous sign. Antonio Sabato then makes an unlikely gangster - apart from a resistant front man; his relationship with Savalas, who also becomes an eye in the homeland, is also unconvincing (especially since he later becomes romantically involved in the latter's gracious teenage cousin)! In addition, for a gangster movie, there is precious little action to talk about and none of it is unforgettable in any way (although the final is handled well enough in a clinic); Furthermore, the score is served by Francesco De Masi, but nothing else. By the way, the cellar DVD I rented starts halfway through the credits, so none of the players - or even the movie's title - is ever listed!
