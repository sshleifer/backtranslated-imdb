Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, the mysteries of Pittsburgh are about the young boy of a notorious gangster who is moving his last teenage summer with two friends. The year is 1983, and the young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Completely against his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually faced with painstaking efforts to create beautiful hip-indie cinematography, the whole film feels like the director - whose previous effort Dodgeball was funny when he was directly commercial - was urgently looking for indie credibility through aspects of other Indian films but with stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. As many of the star-studded premiers at Sundance this year, it felt like it was a secret studio-sponsored laundry project to help the director earn credentials - in that respect and as a film of his own, failed.
