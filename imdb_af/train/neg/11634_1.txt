I have this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, featuring the great dr. Attend your ball. <br /> <br /> The movie is simple, very, very bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Boll "so bad it is actually entertaining" way, but just bad. The plot relates to a man who is suffering a terrible life (due to a previous criminal record, apparently), cannot find work, and with an enormous 900 pound fraudster. This man turns to his uncle of the cult leader in a plan to steal a truck's toy containing the bird flu virus. Al Qaeda also has designs to steal the toys, and what follows is just under two hours of totally incomprehensible sex and violence. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible (except Dave Foley, who really tries, after all), the jokes never rise above children who are slowly being shot in the chest, and people take a powder. It's supposed to be satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think "plane!" But done by the creators of South Park and without jokes.
