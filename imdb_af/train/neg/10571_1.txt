my wife is a fanatic about this show. That's when I bought her seasons one to three and the season four is on order. I personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad. Alyssa Milano had to hold on to the other rubbish films she made such as Poison Ivy, Vampire Embrace to name a few, the other female supporting roles are equally inappropriate in their depictions. I saw better special effects in the old Republic Series series I saw as a child. I can understand why the male leaders stayed on the show for such short periods of time, although I do not know whether it was their own choice or not. Please. Please do not renew for another season, because enough is enough, Bob
