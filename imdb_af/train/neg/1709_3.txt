I got myself a copy of this movie. It was the 1964 Zombie Bloodbath movie as one of its alternative titles. Perversely, this movie actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other one is really bad! This movie is also bad; Of course you can't go into a movie called "Zombie Bloodbath" and expect to see a masterpiece and in fairness it is the title with the amount of gore displayed on the screen ... but it all feels a lot old and tired, which is not helped by the horrible play. It's just your average core rinse that causes people to get into zombies etc. To change. The movie starts with a sequence that people see melting and that you know pretty much what you are; low quality zombie garbage. There's a lot of gore in the movie, and it's a good job, otherwise the movie would have been very boring. Zombie Bloodbath also looks very cheap, and is clearly compiled by inexperienced filmmakers! The most important influence was Romero's superior day of death, although it could be just about anything that contains zombies and gore. It all comes down to a typically predictable and useless end and overall I can't say I impressed it!
