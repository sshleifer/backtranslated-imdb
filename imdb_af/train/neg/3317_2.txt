I like Jane Austin novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm halfway through Mansfield Park. But I couldn't stand Emma. I gave up after 2 chapters, and by the end of the movie I couldn't care less about Emma. She didn't change at all. Perhaps it was Paltrows acting (which is excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest in the movie. Do not know. <br /> <br /> The costumes are nice, but the dance was awkward compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I basically gave it a 2 for the fact. Bloody was beautiful, and although it was a pretty little thing to Ewan McGregor, I kept his singing.
