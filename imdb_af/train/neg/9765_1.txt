I don't often give up, but if there was ever a movie that deserved this kind of attention, it's "Gas!" It is a self-rotting shit that comes to an atmosphere of M * A * S * H ​​and falls completely flat on its face. <br /> <br /> I see where Corman goes - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould have tried to reproduce Gould's deadly role in the original movie version of M * A * S * H ​​with a similar plot (in the movie "Whiffs" - see it here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould are closer to the copper ring with "Whiffs" than Corman with "Gas!" came. but did not quite come there. None of those films even came close to the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Gas!" What is not? Nobody really comes close to a high above the high school theater. The production values ​​stink. Someone else mentioned the magical reviving headlights on a breakaway cart, and there is more of that lack of attention to detail. Nothing works like this movie is supposed to, and no one cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" I actually slept for me. It is not a sure drug for insomnia, but very close. On the Cinematic Trail Induction Scale, "Gas!" Fall somewhere between "Last year at Marienbad" and George Clooney's remake of "Solaris" (which was self-evident that it is more boring than the original film, despite the studio's apparent ignorance with the idea of ​​hearing the audience) by judicious editing). <br /> <br /> Fair editing would have deposited "Gas!" up to about twenty minutes. The result would be senseless, but not so much as the original movie. <br /> <br /> Certain movies are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway. This is not one of them. Don't waste your time. It's not even amusingly bad.
