I rented this movie to see what a bloody, non-stop action movie can be and has this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action drama that looks like Kickboxer like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and if Lou saves the gooks, he is shot in the head, which is easily one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam scenes are shot in someone's backyard, I swear! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and he lives and owns a bar. Super Homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight for money and Reb goes on a deadly spree to get him back. There are no good fighting scenes at all, the push is two centimeters away from a person. Characters personalities change in the matter of seconds. One man is bad and in the next scene he is good. The acting is terrible and the music is an exaggerated sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that makes you sick. I hated this movie.
