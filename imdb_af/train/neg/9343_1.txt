How do I begin to see a movie soon to be recognized as the 'worst movie of all time' by the 'worst director of all time'? "A movie that can develop a cult, because it's so bad it's good. <br /> <br /> An analytic approach that criticizes the film seems both senseless and part of bandwagon syndrome. Let's go freely without worrying about the setbacks because every other person on earth does, and the people who find the movie find it for the mistakes we want to call. <br /> <br /> The universal poor quality of the film is without a doubt: 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' Not without competition for the title of the worst movie, so it must sink quite low to get and hold the title it stuck, but I believe this movie can go the distance. IMDb does not allow enough words to mention all the films 'failures, and it's much easier to place the elements' sixteen years of alcohol. Unfortunately those moments of glory are buried so far in the shadow of the weakness of this movie that it is a task that is not worth following. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was doing, I was warned to drink a few cups of coffee before I sat down to see this one (wish the suggestion was cups of Vodka). Despite my low expectations, 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol', I didn't even enjoy having a 'making fun of the bad movie'. Not only bad, but ominously bad, as if Jobson had deliberately tried to make this film a poetic yawn, but went to the left and pushed the poetry into our throat. It doesn't make it deep, but funny. .. and presumably Jobson tried to make a good movie? Even after watching the 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' promotional literature, I have trouble believing Jobson's sincerity. Pointless and unpleasant to the end with a few grin / bell moments (all I'm sure is not intentional) crossed the movie, and those few elements prevented me from turning off the DVD. How bad is this good? No, it was just enough. "I can't believe it's a serious movie moment to keep me from doing that, and nothing more. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch with a group of bad-film connoisseurs. Get your own This would have greatly improved the experience for me. So bad is Mike Myers who speaks Scottish accent in his cod, as it runs, to make the whole slurry in a comic farce. " mother man, give me an anniversary glimpse of that whisper. "
