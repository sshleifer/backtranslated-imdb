Well, the film festival crowd probably loved it. But your average popcorn movie cast that sees the ten or fifteen dollars it costs to watch a movie will probably wonder why he or she made this choice. If it's labeled 'Copolla', it's automatically good stuff, right? Wrong! This is a neat spoof of filmdom's predictions. But it's terrible "in." I'm worried when filmmakers are more concerned about their entertainment rather than the public. It's interesting as a movie cricket and it does have a nice or two in it. But once it goes in the movies and on TV, the dust will get thick on the film cans and cupboards it holds. Almost epidemic or epic!
