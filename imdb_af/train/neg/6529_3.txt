This movie is funny and painful at the same time. The "Cinemagic" almost seized me. Despite what it means, Cinemagic is not an innovative technical procedure. It was "developed" because of an accident, and they used it because it disguised the fact that their "monsters" were so stupid. I also don't think it's a coincidence that the author Sid is "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is great if you're really looking for a movie made in $ 200,000 in 9 days. It is entertaining; I can say at least about that. The bat / gear / spin is the highlight.
