WOW! I didn't know anyone would make this movie! it is terrible! I wrote 5 things that can tell you why you don't want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> number 1: "is the biggest rave ever" where is the rave? I could only see a few people dancing. <br /> <br /> 2. When on the rave, they can only see blood, no people, two ruined tents and one stage. And what do they do? they drink! <br /> <br /> 3. The worst actors I've ever seen! the captain and his crew .. horrible! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the people shoots an ordinary gun, he shoots almost 30 times without reloading! <br /> <br /> 5. I didn't know that every person in the world could fight as a pro! must be a new thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder what the producer thinks! "It's going to be a big hit, it's going to be a classic ... sure you're not seeing this movie, it's a middle of the time. MY EYES ARE CLEANING!
