Most of what was said about the negative aspects of the movie is true. <br /> <br /> BUT .... If I have to sit through a movie, it was: <br /> <br /> Director <<br /> <br /> <br /> > Director of Photography <br /> <br /> Editor <br /> <br /> Can't even blow the Darn Microphone Tree in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie. , how can i enjoy and concentrate on the story as well as believe in the darn thing when i am reminded of the technical aspects of making a movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> WAIT FOR THE DVD OR DO NOT BOTHER
