I actually had a lot of hope to go into this movie, so I took what was given with a salt grain and hope for the best. About 1/3 of the way through the movie I just had to give up, simply the movie is a mish-mash of things that happen without apparent reason and it's all disconnected. I like movies that make you think, but this movie was just a lot of ideas thrown together and never really connected. <br /> <br /> Don't think this is David Lynch-esquire as some would believe, it's not near that realm except some trippy footage. To say it is art to disguise the fact that there is no apparent plot or story is just a way or just why you wasted the 1.5 hours in the movie. The acting was good, but it can't save a lack of story. I agree with the one comment previously published. "It's like being in someone else's head ... while they're drugs." In other words, nothing makes sense.
