"A Guy Thing" is trying to capture the feeling of "There is something about Maria" or "Meet the Parents", but more as if it was edited by the room rejections of the two films. Luckily I rented it on a 5-day rental because I couldn't sit for more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The premise is decent and I like the scenes where other guys automatically cover Paul's failures (the checker at Save-Mart was wonderful), but the writing is absolutely horrible. The dialogue flatters most of the time and just when you think things are coming to the right track is unnecessarily unnecessary. Plus, how much toilet joke does a movie really need? <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, slapstick humor is great if done smartly like the other movies I mentioned, but this movie misses the point. Bad as I like Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate about you were wonderful), but even that can't help me put this terrible movie. Save your dollars and go once more 'There's something about Maria'.
