SPOILERS HERE <br /> <br /> My High School did everything they could to motivate us for exams. But the most memorable method they used to get us in the right mood was a guest speaker, who was nothing but the Australian Kickboxing's favorite son, Stan "The Man" Longinidis. The first mistake they made was to give this man a microphone, because he shouted half the time, despite us being no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now his speech was full of the usual "if you didn't prepare, then prepared to fail" things, but there were several cases where I really worked. The man stood there in front of us preaching how he did everything for himself and no one else throughout his life. He offered many offers in the past to give up boxing, but he never got the prize to become Australia's biggest boxing boxer. He said he was not a salesman, he was happy and retired. He was never involved in any activity other than Kickboxing? then he plugged in his film. Yes, you have heard it right, he has placed his new FILM. Talking about it, he got a wife to go in and keep a poster advertising it, and he showed this brilliant 4-minute clip of this dirty movie called "Trojan Warrior". (That's all before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his final career battle). Stan plays Ajax, a boxing-ex-special force in the cunning underworld of Melbourne. Ajax's cousin, Theo (Arthur Angel), recently sold out (well, at least Stan didn't get lost too far from ALWAYS) to the feds, and as a result, it's going on all levels of organized crime. Ajax and Theo are in all sorts of ridiculous situations, fighting in a Kebab store to play as a playboys on a slavery. It's pretty ridiculous, but if Silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible movie, this guy should never be handed a camera again. <br /> <br /> I'll admit I'm actually pumped to see it. I love action movies, even if they're corny, and especially when it's in my own backyard. But what I suggested was a movie of acting that was from the word "go", and did it after the words "for the love of God, please make it quiet!", Subplots were introduced and not even touched Again, after being open, characters were simply thrown in for absolutely NO reason whatsoever, and the most choreographed battle scenes not even exploring the distance from Stan's real talent in Kickboxing. The movie consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about everyone who was famous for REMOTELY (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Chopper" Read and Greg Matthews). All the time you sit there and play the guessing game of just who's in the background. Badly, the film relies heavily on split-second appearances by former celebrities. Remember the plot holes I told you? At one time Ajax was apparently locked up, wrongly accused of killing his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in a single sentence in special troops throughout the film, and then let it be buggy. This is followed by another SINGLE sentence that persuades Ajax to help the same people who mistakenly locked him. Then it gets, in the end it is revealed to Ajax that his wife is not actually dead but sold in prostitution. Do we see her? No, is Ajax going to get her as soon as he hears it? No, it's a marriage now! <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this annoying puerile crap, a site has described this movie as "a cross between Jackie Chan & Guy Ritchie ??". Did this man ever sit down and watch a Jackie Chan movie?! Chan shows more agility than a dump than Stan did? Well, ONLY! And Guy Ritchie is the crime film Messiah, and you compare him to Salik Silverstein! This movie is more like a mix between "Pizza" and "Enter The Ninja". <br /> <br /> Now, where do you get the whole "Trojan Warrior" title? Ajax's fiery fighting skills like that of an ancient Greek warrior? No. The gang's unification to find Theo, like that of the Trojan Empire? No, that's because? waiting for it ?? Theo carries a condom with him. Yes, right, because THEO is ALWAYS prepared with a Trojan FIRE RUBBER in his pocket, he is a Trojan War! <br /> <br /> I had the disappointment of seeing "Trojan Warrior" on DVD, as well as the "special" features: <br /> <br /> ?? Video clip of "Chop Chop", a quick song by Mark "Chopper" Read: Chopper has the sole purpose of proving that ANYONE can rap. The funny thing was that Chopper only threw 30 seconds and then threw it to these two albino teenagers from Doncaster. They use such words as "dis" and "dope", etc. In their Australian accent. Face it people, rap is developed in the states, leave it there! The clip looks like something that a Channel 31 cameraman put on ecstasy. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There was no real difference between this and the real movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man" Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: It wasn't bad, as it was just 6 or 7 different fights from different angles. (I think I've fallen over Dennis Alexio in that 3-minute montage over 15 times.) /> <br /> I don't want to say this movie adds to why this country goes to hell when it comes to film, but ... oh wait, I just did. My advice to anyone reading this is to unpack 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", tie it together and use it for a paper weight, as this movie is just as sorry.
