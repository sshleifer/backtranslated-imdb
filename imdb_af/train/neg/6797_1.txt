What can you say about a grainy, poorly-filmed 16mm stag film, where the best and most beautiful artist is a German shepherd? Nothing positive would be. Avoid this travesty at all costs. Anyway, it will be hard to find, as bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the US. I strongly suggest IMDb to visit their weighting formula for determining ratings as an 8.8 rating for this piece of faecal matter is absurd! I am by no means a prude and have enjoyed many hours of classic porn movies of the 70's and 80's; but it is inferior product, even by the looser standards of the (then illegal) stag loop.
