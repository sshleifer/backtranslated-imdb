It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The Avengers kept this dubious honor? but not anymore. The play in "Jill the Ripper" is terrible and was just obscured by the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Tellsubbes. It doesn't know if it's a S&M movie or a very bad thriller. Just look under extreme intoxication or if you have been riding a bed and need a leather upholstery. This script should be processed in a porn, it will not take much effort and will have a longer shelf life. A porn, even a bad pornography, won't hurt the damage to Dolf Lundgren's career the way this movie has.
