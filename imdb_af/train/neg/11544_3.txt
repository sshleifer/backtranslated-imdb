I was really looking forward to watching it because I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The start was interesting. I like the relationship between the two stars. It then jumps quickly to the main plot, which is attacked by a group of aliens and Dyer is extremely badly beaten while Anderson is raped. They then decide to take revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not. The story becomes boring and pavement, and some things get very strange. I won't give any details, but things happen that I, for one, have no desire to see. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I wanted to have this one. It just didn't work out. I give it a 3 out of 10, mostly for the acting.
