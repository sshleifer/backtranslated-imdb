Then a friend set me a box of "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies!" Given. I was understandably a little careful. But since the item was a gift, I really didn't really care much about my mind. After all .... movies for free! So, if they are a little rude. After much consideration, Alien Intruder was the first of these movies. Ironically, it was the first choice because it looked the best of the bush. All I can say is, if it's the best of them, I shake to think what the rest is. <br /> <br /> On the surface it had good things for it. Four ('em!) Actors I was known to. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I told myself ... "Billy and Tracy were in a good scifi (Star Wars and Babylon 5 respectively) so they could not register for a turkey. Max is a veteran soap actor who never really succeeded. has to break into film .... but not too scary an actor, a Jeff .... well ... he did the good and the bad about movies and TV. "I soon discovered that Jeff decided to add the "ugly" to his repertoire of movies. <br /> <br /> The first clue was in the opening styles. Jeff fights his way with a gusto through an "I'm crazy" scene before finally killing himself. An entertaining thing is really. Unfortunately, without much exaggeration, it's the highlight of the movie. From there we go downhill. <br /> <br /> We then have the mission commander (Williams), who is sent out to see what happened to Jeff and his crew, putting his new shipmates out of the ranks of the criminal element. But this assortment is not so much the Dirty Dozen - more like the unconvincing foursome. Plus, one of the crimes, a computer hacker, is displayed in his cell on a laptop. Isn't it the case that a killer runs a rifle shop in the slumber? Pretty lame prison, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> When they eventually decrease the effects, it's really awful. It seems as if the spacecraft model was beaten in one afternoon by some bored 8-year-old who was left with parts of his Airfix kit. <br /> <br /> But the horror doesn't stop there. While on the way to the area where Jeff's ship disappears, the criminal crew is rewarded for their good behavior by being given virtual reality weekends, welcoming their male fantasies. All good and good, and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the "Alien Menace" that appears there. But did they have to release it for sooooo loooooong? Alien Invaders? Alien drilling, more like. <br /> <br /> Finally they make it for G-Sector and the alien presence makes them fight for each other for her sadness until only good old Max is left. The end, in a really optimistic junk movie, tips on a sequel - as if! Also a look in this movie is a character I would call the nickname "Sweatdroid". He's supposed to be an Android, but apparently the fact is lost on the makeup crew, who provided him with sweaty features every time. But don't worry, he's just there to end the body count numbers. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, to be true, do very little in the movie. They just barely stay awake, let alone act. And as I mentioned earlier, Jeff gets an early trip to the showers, so his masculinity may not relieve much of the movie. Max tries his best, like some other members, but the movie is just a pity, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The one and only halfway imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship name convention. They are all named after musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the movie is slim and uninspired. <br /> <br /> In 1992, I thought it was initially one of the 80's straight-to-video work. They still seem to have made cake films well in the 90s. It looks the best. <br /> <br /> This is best avoided. Even as a beer n-movie movie, this movie is a stinker, but at least you can make it fast.
