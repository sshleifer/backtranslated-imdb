Warning: This review contains minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well the authors of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two pursuers are pretty good for straight video rates. Tremors 4: The legends begin, but are a very dull movie. Where are the Grabokies? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of Graboids by the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry into the series is supposed to be a "character study". Unfortunately, there is not one interesting character in the movie, except for Billy Drago's character who is given too few lines, too little to do and ultimately too little screen time. What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. When there was no action on the screen, you can be sure that Burt Gummer will be interesting to listen and / or watch. But in this movie, Gross Hiram Gummer plays a very poor and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) appear on the screen, it looks good, but it's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> I was impressed when I saw that Tremors was listed at 101 minutes. Pretty good for straight to video. But after watching it, I'm sure this movie is a good 15 minutes too long. There are long streets of dialogue that are boring and not the plot further. Was there a rush to make this movie? I don't think more time can and should be spent on writing. <br /> <br /> I thought I hit a gold mine when I packed Tremors 4 to buy with .... Tremors !!! What luck I thought, pay for # 4, get # 1 for free. Well, after watching Tremors 4, I think I pay for the original and get this mess for free, I can't imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4. For fans of the series it is best to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exist. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The legend starts pricing a 3 out of 10.
