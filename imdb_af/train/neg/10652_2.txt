You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Get ready for: The Safety Pin Killer! It's right, in Killer Workout, a stupid treasure movie I've ever seen one, the unseen killer sends her (or her?) Excess safety peg victims. It's a strange choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Of course, the film never tries to explain where the killer got such a thing. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect. In fact, the movie gives so few clues about the identity of the killer. Just about everyone in the movie is a possible killer until they are killed. And since just about everyone but the killer dies, it's just a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Strangely, while the entire name rejection is being killed, the aerobics classes are serious. In fact, nothing is able to stop the dance. While three men are being murdered in the next room, the workout continues. Death is not even a factor; one character dies, but is still seen prominently in later practice sessions. Director David Prior knew what he did when he mentioned the movie Killer Workout and not Logical Workout. <br /> <br /> Head hunting, explosive tanning beds and hundreds of shots of exposed women are well thrown. Like the woman who was caught in tanning, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of Killer Workout. Finally, the end happily flashed on the screen. What happened next? You got it, shots of the women working out. Not even the end of the movie can stop them! <br /> <br />
