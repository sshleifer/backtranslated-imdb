I will not describe the story, as it has been done elsewhere. We are good Clive Owen fans, and when we recommended Netflix the movie, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> No wonder we have never heard of this "movie" because it was a BBC television movie in 1992. That's why the poor production values, grainy image, rough camera work and poor sound. /> <br /> But you don't really think about the mechanics, because the story itself will let you sleep. It's an interesting human story, but not compelling, and there's almost no end to it. You don't really care about the characters, because their lives are as boring as your life is watching this boring movie. Save the two hours and do something to make the time worthwhile.
