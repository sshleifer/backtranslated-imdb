LOTS OF BAD FILM ........ and I mean LOTS OF BATH ... The plot is predictable, and it's ESTELY cheesy, the creativity of the battle and the dance scenes for the time is the only reason I didn't give it the movie is one, except that ... it's a movie one can afford not to watch. I feel watching the movie, the idea behind the movie was an interesting one such kind of clich√©. I suppose it might have been a little better if it wasn't just cheesy, very poorly expressed from idea to screen, I think. The plot is sometimes predictable, because the dance I can say AT TIMES is pretty good. The break dance battle twist was good ..... If you just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make your own dialogue Maybe it could be a 5 ... lol
