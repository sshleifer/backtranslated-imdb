I trusted my instincts better: no expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece such as Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to pay cash on the cult success of his predecessor, and - artistic - failed failed. It appears that a manufacturer has collected the remaining material from Koyaanisqatsi, eventually throws it, placed it all in slow motion, and bought some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to quickly and all the banal background music. It is repeated repeatedly. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertaines the viewer with cleverly fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long row of everyday images in slow motion (if you see it on your video recorder in preview mode, you'll see what I mean). But what disappointed me most was Philip Glass's soundtrack. I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these commercial sounding New Age-type drones, which could easily be composed by a 14-year-old on a Casio calculator, were of the same composer so brilliant has created the emotional and perfectly synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a great waste of time! My advice: forget about commercialism! Look again at Koyaanisqatsi!
