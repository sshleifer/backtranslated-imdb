I have been taught Catholics in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school and college. I am still a practicing Catholic, but would not be seen as a "good Catholic" in the church's eyes, because I do not believe certain things or act in certain ways, just because the church tells me. <br /> <br /> So back to the movie ... it's bad because two people are killed by this nun that is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figure. There is no comedy in it and the satire is not well done by the over-show of Diane Keaton. I never saw the scene, but if it was very different from those movies, it might be good. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought the gun could be a fake and the first shot a plan by the feminine advantage of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Maria's emotional and intellectual beliefs. But it appears that the bullets are real and the story has tragedy ... the tragedy of loss of life (except the two former students ... the lives of the birth babies, the life of the student's mother), the tragedy of dogmatic authority about love of people, the tragedy of organized religion that replaces the true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam, and yesterday's Judaism and Christianity.
