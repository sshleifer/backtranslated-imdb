This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who says the play is wonderful and the casting is wonderful, has never even seen mediocre theater. Of course, the acting is terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Lamb. I feel that all the other "oblique" comments made by filmmakers should be made. I was not very impressed with the storyline, but just wanted to see a beautiful Oregon countryside, and there was decent cinematography - but the casting was anything but inspired. I think this movie also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in the American culture is ignored and perhaps lost and that it is worth and possible. It puts jokes in the wrong and all-obvious places, and lets me think it's written by the state department or something. Back to the drawing board. To even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same environment of classics like Harold and Maude, is absolutely delayed, and on the same line of begging and pretense and "joking" as in this movie is turbulent.
