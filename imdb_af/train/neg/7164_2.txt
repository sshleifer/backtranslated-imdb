This movie is more misleading than ever, using an exciting watch actor like Walken to play in this piece, it seemed he could do nothing better than a boring role like this one! And the fact that the movie was supposed to be about a witch and you really don't see it to almost the end of the movie, but meanwhile you have to see this boring movie while it is getting or trying to get the meaning. from the point and you have to think through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses all the time about how you have passed another movie and decided on this one and how you just dragged your money, just make the whole time useless meeting there. I'd rather watch cartoons for goodness. Leave this one alone, please!
