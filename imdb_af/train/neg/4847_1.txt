As usual, I make a crazy dash to see the movies I haven't seen in the anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because it looked like it was upright me. I can't understand for my life why this movie got the buzz. There is no story !! A group of guys are walking around in Iraq. One day they were spreading a bomb. Tomorrow they are ready to cultivate the countryside, no less and start sniper burning. No, wait here, they're back in Baghdad. There is no coherent story at all. The three main characters are so over-emphasized that they are mere caricatures. By that I mean, we have the lovely child who is afraid to die. We have the tough military man who is practical and just wants to come back safely. And then we have the bravest cowboy who doesn't follow the rules, but has a soft spot for the former little Iraqi boy selling soldiers of DVDs. What do you think is going to happen ??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier doesn't follow the rules, will the sweet child be injured with his apostate ways? Why Yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid that the cowboy soldier has a soft spot is going to be killed and mad? Why Yes! There is no story here. The writing is young and predictable! The camera is very shaken to make it look "artsy". And for all of you who think it is such a great image of war, hire "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Don't waste time or money on this boring movie!
