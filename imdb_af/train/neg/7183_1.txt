This is the worst adaptation of a classic story I've ever seen. They modernize it unnecessarily and some points are actually just sick. <br /> <br /> The songs rarely move along the story. They seem to be randomly thrown. The flying scene with Marley is useless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's definitely the worst music I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is probably only considered a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic, doesn't mean that some cheap adjustments are.
