I can't believe I wasted 80 minutes of my life and watch this horrible movie. I was hoping it would be better, but the boy was wrong. The plot was uncomfortable, the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were terrible. Not even the 2 beautiful girls can revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. But I can't lie, some of the lines in this movie were quite memorable as when the Asian boy says '' I lost my virginity to the babysitter, so **** stereotypes '' <br /> <br / > please do not waste your time with this accident unless you are prepared or want a good laugh. Maybe you can look to rip this movie with some friends
