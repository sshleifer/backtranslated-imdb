If you study Welles and want to see how far he has fallen to Citizen Kane, this film will prove it. The cheap excuse to make the protagonist a self-permitted dummy to explain how he could fall into such a half-baked scheme failed to explain the absurd courtroom theater and ridiculous plot moves that eventually ensued. Don't be overtaken by the high rating of this movie in the DB as I was; All I can guess is that there are many old, old Welles and Hayworth fans there.
