Attack of the dying creatures will certainly be in the "so bad it is good" category if the film is not quite as sexist or racist. That it is so, it just makes it bad. <br /> <br /> It has the same kind of hard stereotypical sexism you have seen in the Queen of the Outer Space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case, Native Americans) that you normally find in thirty and forty western find. In terms of the fact that it is not funny, the same walk-through-the-hole gag is repeated over ten times in the course of this rather short movie. Ray does make a good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but can't make it for two Cagney impressions in a row, and doesn't even handle a Peter Lorre when he tries it). There are really no production values ​​to speak of, as the "Star Creatures" make the Ro-Man of Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 of the Outer Space look like Industrial Light and Magic creations. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely one of the fronts of what you would call early independent theater ... not art enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything other than the last feature of an all -night drive-in. <Br /> <br />
