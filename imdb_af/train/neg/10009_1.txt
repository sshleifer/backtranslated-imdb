This movie is a huge pantry. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his own bad script. And his direction is about as comatose as it can be without actually sleeping in the process. <br /> <br /> The worst is Woody Harrelson, which I usually like when he is properly thrown. He plays the "walker", a gay man in D.C., who plays social companion for the bored Washington elite women. He could no longer have been one-dimensional if he was cut out of a magazine and jumped in front of the camera on a popsicle stick around the camera. His "southern accent" is the version of the shelves that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as if the heat and humidity of the South still diminishes from each of our energies. It's monotonous. But she's not the worst accent in the movie. His "boyfriend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, is trying to influence a Middle Eastern accent that is so clumsy, barely producing the bad lines written for him. He is unable to roll his rs, despite being real in German and speaking several languages ​​- one of which is Italian! It's kind of a good reason to throw someone else, don't you think? <br /> <br /> From the story, to the screenplay, to the director, to the camera, after the performances of the lead, this movie is bad from start to finish. The only tolerant moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to make it through their dignity in tact with this movie. In fact, all three are excellent, despite being trapped in a very bad movie. Unfortunately, no one can ever be good enough to solve this endless series of errors. If you like these three actresses, they look into something else. This movie is not worth your time.
