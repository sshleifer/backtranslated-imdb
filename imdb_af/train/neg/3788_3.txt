There is a lot to do here. The actors are first and foremost, and the script provides a good dialogue that suits the atmosphere of a hearty, enjoyable family. For that reason, the film doesn't ring true. We see Leo, who apparently only learned from his HIV-positive diagnosis, reacts essentially in a way that does not match the supportive atmosphere he finds himself. Likewise, the film ends a bit suddenly to avoid what Leo, his brother and the rest of the immediate family should handle in the light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother Marcel is impressive because the rest of the role-play is usually. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide whether they wanted an insightful thesis on the effects of HIV on a functional, attractive family or what is the devastation of HIV. So this is just one thing. While this movie gives food to think, it leaves the viewer much more than he does.
