It makes the third Errol Morris movie I've seen, and I no longer like his style. He looks very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries, and then with the in-cheek editing makes fun of everything they go about. It is never really a direct caricature of them, and Morris seems most of the time to say, "No, no, these people are really fascinating, really!", But there are always these subtle little edges and no- so-subtle editing techniques that show Morris ridicule them behind their backs. <br /> <br /> This movie follows four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man who studies African hairless molerates to find that they are incredibly gluttonous, a lion-tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animal shrubs and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to be asking the question of what animal, human and life aspects indicate. So, the title of Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control doesn't really look like the movie. Except of course, Morris looks a little disturbed by the passions of these individuals (he can call them "obsessions" that make synthetic designs on life). I don't share that fear and honestly don't appreciate any of the connections Morris makes in the movie. <br /> <br /> But I emphasize his subtlety. With no voice-over story leaving the words entirely to the interrogators, it is not as if Morris is pounding on the spectators' collective head. Instead, he often mixes circus material and ant footage when taken out of the circus and ants context, which shows a kind of collective absurdity over which all these people speak. I don't find them absurd, I find them all very neat and interesting individuals. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, he didn't plan such contradictions, which means he's just a bad craftsman rather than a silent subverter. Since none of these movies I have seen so far has impressed me, I really don't mind finding out what he's trying to do. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
