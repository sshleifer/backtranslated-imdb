A mummy tells vignettes about men, women and the sex between them. Huh? Initially, the mum randomly asks the spectator: "Imagine you have sex with this girl. Imagine having sex with this boy" about 37 times, while flashing photos of half-naked against youth. Later, mods say boys are mod-girls with ... vegetables? If you walk the (or fast forward) through the mummy, ignore, the shorts are not bad in their own right. I found some of them rather funny. My personal favorite is one where the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard is sitting on the bed. This is a, though, bizarre movie.
