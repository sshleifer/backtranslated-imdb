I was disappointed. The film was a bit predictable and did not plaster the hype that was pasted over the box. In addition, the characters were well developed, the Windego myth was used in a unique prospect and the house was pretty haunting, but it just missed me. I was waiting for the big AHHHHH or BOO! But it never came. <br /> <br /> The movie has been plagued with poor filming of bad special effects. So much of a bad thing and not the use of atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and tension. Try movies like Session 9 or the Cube if you're looking for a low budget but well-thought-out horror movie.
