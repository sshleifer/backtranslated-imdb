Hello. this is my first review for any movie I've seen. I made the effort to do this to tell everyone that it was literally, the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. I feel that the film is painful, which will give me some understanding due to budget constraints to make it. I felt that I saw a very bad remake of the movie. Whatever I can agree, see, is also very graphic, but I've seen the movie. <br /> <br /> The scene where he takes the hammer at the head of the tied victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene I've seen. The scene lasted almost forever, actually, it was probably about 5 minutes but still. I would note that I like horror movies and I give credit if they are good. This director is sorry, and his group of people who made this movie have to consider it before making another one similar to this one. a final note haha ​​!! FOR ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DEATHING THIS ANIMALS, IT WAS ROCKED, PLEASE WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND A FIVE MINUTE SCENE OF ANYTHING HAVE SUBMITTED THROUGH A HAMMER, then you will enjoy this movie if not, and love horror, go with a higher budget movie, for example. I can't believe people actually make movies like this. Anyway, sorry for anyone who loves your ball and took it to heart, it's just my opinion of the movie.
