This movie is similar to the play entitled "Blithe Spirit" written by Noel Coward. The plot of a ghost woman and a medium is strongly linked to Coward's writing. I am surprised that movies of this nature do not recognize the original author's concept. I realize that the public may not be aware that it is a knock, but it is. <br /> <br /> Sad. These movies are so expensive to produce. I like a script when a script is original. I even stop when it is an innovative way to produce a previously released work. There are a few examples mentioned (such as Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realize that movies are still a relatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I am not welcome if the taste of the public is taken for granted. In this situation, the taste of the public is overlooked. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to better-made movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> In this case. I'd rather see the play.
