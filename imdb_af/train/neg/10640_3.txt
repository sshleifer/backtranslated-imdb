From this is an uninspiring title for flat acting performances, anyway, Curdled is an unbeatable movie. The film has gained a few fans by attaching Quentin Tarantino's name to it, and nodding and nodding to the Rodriguez / Tarantino movie 'From Dusk till Dawn'. However, these things do not make a big movie, and it is more than clear all the way through 'Curdled'. The film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas, and it tries to mask it with murders designed to be stylish and disturbing events. The Mexican music score accompanying many of the sequels in the film is, of course, meant to be cool, but it gets very annoying; especially since the main character is Mexican, it does not fit in with the tone of the movie. The movie's plot is typically indifferent and it follows a gorehound that, due to her obsession with Greek murders, is working with a murder scene firm. It sounds boring and it is. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin is the only "name" on the cast list, and even he doesn't make an impression. He didn't give anything in the film and apart from chatting with his victims and standing to try to look threatening, he's almost lost. Angela Jones, or rather; The taxi driver of Pulp Fiction takes the lead as the murder obsession young woman and it is always clear that it is her involvement in Pulp Fiction that won her this role, not her acting ability. She may be good enough in her small role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she doesn't have the talent to lead a movie herself. She looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film, and if it wasn't for her Latino accent; she will not convince the audience that she is a strange thing at any level. Curdled is a hundred percent proof piece of forgotten trash. Films like this often gain praise for invention or black comic antiques; but this one fails at all levels. Whether you're a Tarantino fan, William Baldwin, horror fan or not a movie buffalo; this is one that misses.
