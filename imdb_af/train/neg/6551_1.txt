A study in bad. Bad acting, bad music, bad screenplay, bad editing, bad direction and a bad idea. Pieces do not become stocking or inadvertently cleaner than this ... thing. By the end of the "movie", you wondered how they were saving in the first place. Poor Malcolm McDowell, was he short of cash or something? Still thinking of seeing it? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you are not believing in the first thirty minutes, you will see the cyborg population town called "Cytown" by the time. Avoid it, my movie love friends. Avoid.
