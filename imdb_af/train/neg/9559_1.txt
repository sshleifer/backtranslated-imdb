I will try to use words to describe this. <br /> <br /> I saw the original, which was good in its own way, but then I had to fear a sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was scared when I picked this one up, but now that I've seen it, I must say it's even worse when I thought. Why this movie still gets money, turns my mind around. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they're not that good, but it has to be said, some make heads by just being terrible. But what can one actor with a script like this one do. It is trying to be a copy of the original just this time the sites have changed, any kind of story is gone and any attempt to make something that has not been done before has failed. In a useless attempt to keep it informed, they are trying to make it exciting by using the whole-big-brother theme, but it has been depicted centuries ago and offers nothing but a filling between the beginning. and the end. An attempt was made to save the film by making a ton of references to the '83 original, but it just got funny and sometimes a bit sad. Finally, if you have nothing, and I mean nothing, to do ... go see or play Frisbee ... with the DVD .... with yourself. It offers you the same amount of fun. I promise
