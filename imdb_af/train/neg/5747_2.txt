I love Zombie movies and I love amateur productions. And meat market 2 is really promising with a nice tribute to Fulci's classic "Zombi". <br /> <br /> So I stood back and waited to be impressed. Okay, some of the make-ups are great for such a budget movie and some actors (the vampire cat and the cook) are really out, but otherwise there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I'm not expecting a new Romero here, but there's no sequence in the whole movie that has even a bit of tension or shock value. The director certainly knows how to perform body accelerations and interesting eating habits, but now (to two parts) it's time to learn something more. <br /> <br /> In Marketplace2 Gore rhymes with drill - for me it's not enough - sorry. <br /> <br /> ** from *****
