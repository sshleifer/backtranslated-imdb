This is absurd - apart from the fellow Australia reviewing this movie, I can't help but think that anyone who has so far submitted a review was somehow involved in the production of Elektra, taking into account how generous they were with their praise. <br /> <br /> I'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversions, so I didn't expect much, but I found that Elektra is incredibly entertaining. The thing that most annoyed me was the fact that there was so much in this movie that was inexplicable. It made you think, "Huh, what relevance does the plot have?" or "how did that aspect of the character originate?" I can only hope that it is things that may be explained in Daredevil, which I do not intend to see. <br /> <br /> Also, the behavior of the characters in this movie seems to be faced with random moments to adjust the storyline, and don't even get me the totally unassuming romantic subplot. I also kick my head over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems inexplicable. <br /> <br /> If I can give kudos to this movie for anything it'll have to be the fantastic places it was shot at, but otherwise I didn't get much pleasure from Elektra. I know we should suspend our unbelief for fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so unlikely or confusing (even according to action film standards) that it just frustrated me. <br /> <br /> Well, hell, Jennifer Garner looks at least good.
