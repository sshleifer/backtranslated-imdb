Admittedly, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, although it is especially my favorite, Knappertsbusch, in 1951. Syberberg's whole approach is so static. When the music suddenly starts to swell ... Syberberg moves the roll at the same pace. Adopting Amfortas and Klingsor is endless. Whatever happened to movie editing? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The viewer is never transported spiritually. Your impulse is to chase home and play again to confirm that Wagner has done it, Syberberg is wrong. And the decoration with the "clever" memories of Wagner's anti-Semitism - will there ever be a viewer of this film without any knowledge of Wagner?
