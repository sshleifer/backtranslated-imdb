"A Damsel in Distress" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musical. But even Astaire's bad movies always have a few good moments. <br /> <br /> In "Damsel" is Astaire Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is on a personal appearance in London. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heir who sits in the back of a taxi he takes to escape a bunch of admirers. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes Alice is being forced into marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to save her from her family's mansion, but soon discovers that the housekeepers are putting bets on which the wife, Lady Alice, will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), the torch bowler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, occasionally turn around to help sabotage Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> This musical has many problems. First, there is the plot based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who wrote the script together). The story is slow, painful and nervous. When Fred does not dance, we must endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romance Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert clashing with them and each other. <br /> <br /> The butler and the house boy are particularly annoying. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to bump into the mouth. You wish they would come off the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire suffers from the absence of his regular partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a shining leading woman in this movie, and is in disgrace in a musical. She has a bit for her, character-wise, unlike her beautiful face and beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are with Jerry's publicity and his sinzy secretary. The duo adds some essential chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying. <br /> <br /> The direction of the movie by George Stevens was not well done. Sometimes cinematography is terrific and out of focus. There are a number of outdoor plays on extremely foggy streets, trying to convince the audience that we are in London, not in Hollywood. (They had to use tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the positive side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are great, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dance in the film is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But the music and dance numbers are bad and inappropriate. Sometimes it seems that the cast starts to sing and dance because it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The music numbers randomly appear in the winding plot. (At one point the butler stops outside the shepherd's house and doesn't break it for a clear reason in an operetta solo.) The numbers include:  "I'm dancing and I can't be bothered now" - Fred dancing good on a misty traffic-filled London street. He does a big "reed straw" with a rolled umbrella - but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double decker bus. (In the Broadway musical "Crazy For You", Harry Groener has done a much better version of this song with a group of choir girls.) <br /> <br />  "Sit My To The Test" - Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie play Fred step by step, but the number ends poorly with anyone who doesn't kick for any reason. <br /> <br />  "Stiff upper lip" - at an amusement park fun home, Fred, George and Gracie have fun dancing on the rotating floor, rotating barrel, and with the playhouse mirrors. This is the best movie movie, but sometimes it gets a bit repetitive. <br /> <br />  Things Look Up - Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number in the movie. the backwood of the estate. Luckily this is a very simple dance number because Joan is not a good dancer. <br /> <br />  A Dull Day in London Township - Fred wanders over the misty estate at night and winds over the misty day when he met Joan in London. Sometimes he or she doesn't seem to know how to go into the mist - much like the music number himself. <br /> <br />  "Nice work if you can get it" - A great song that gets abused in the movie. During a social event at the mansion Fred is drawn to a choir of dour-faced singers who sing this song randomly. Every time Fred joins, the other singers watch him as if they want him to go. (Again, Harry Groener made a better dance number with this song in "Crazy For You".)  "Drum Dance Number" - While Fred and Joan stop, Fred must stop and do a final tap dance number while he is a group drums. As usual, this is a good dance number. But it is absolutely not necessary, except to extend the movie. <br /> <br /> The most confronted moment in the movie comes when Fred decides to jump into a high stone balcony on the estate to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he jumps out of the balcony, he finds a comfortably placed trapeze - it is right, a * trapeze * - hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings on the ground from there. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth DVDs for the dance tracks alone, but you feel guilty of the man. who invented the Fast Forward button at your distance. The >> FF button allows you to skip through the other boring scenes in the movie to get to the dance numbers.
