I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror movie. When a terrorist's body is infected with a stolen chemical restored by the American army, the body is then cremated and the virus released into the atmosphere over a small island. Soon, the infected inhabitants will become meat hungry zombies, and a group of soldiers on holiday will merge with a group of tourists and sit in a deserted hotel as they try to fight the aggressive living dead. I didn't find this movie as good as the original movie, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was another OK horror movie with some good action. I didn't think it was one of the best in the series. 10/04
