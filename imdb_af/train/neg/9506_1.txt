Oh yes, the VS series, MVC2 is the pinnacle. It has been said before, so you get to sleep half of the crew. Unfortunately, the game half did it. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but you get tired of buttons. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot. Beat the guy at the end and win! Eh, who's playing it himself anyway?
