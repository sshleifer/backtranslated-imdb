Seriously, there is absolutely nothing good about this shit party. Randolph Scott, a cupboard homosexual who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is in his most woody and boring role. At 57 he was clearly too old for these romantic roles, but it doesn't matter, because Gail Russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly because of her chronic alcoholism and chain smoke. Lee Marvin plays his usual shameful role, but it's not enough to save this garbage. Thank God, they no longer make Western, they are just dated, racist old movies that glorify guns and murder. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
