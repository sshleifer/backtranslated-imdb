Don't be wrong, it's not an abomination, not even a movie. I strongly recommend watching this 82-minute failure. The only reason it earned a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently, hoping there may be a flash of a twist, a surprise, a plot to come forward - but no. <br /> <br /> The characters take fluctuating turns in their deeds and yet they do not have time to develop - thanks to thrifty editors and honestly shameful chambers - before returning to idyllic and playful on the teen rock montage). The only thing that could make it worse would be the perishable award of an ethnic "companion". <br /> <br /> Meetings with obstacles (whether human or physical) are short, confusing and completely useless. <Br /> <br /> Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface as it is drowned by a misery of a lightweight tiger. Lou Taylor Pucci could not be dry when he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves who had come to the Navada desert. <br /> <br /> See 'The Road', look '28 days later ', watch TV daytime ... anything but this; I beg you. If the boredom licks, unlike the movie, this movie is not healing.
