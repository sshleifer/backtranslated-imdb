The movie is actually too slow. There are some nice images, but it can't be any more than the fact that the movie is actually boring. You see a sexual intercourse with many watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and perhaps a little more. It may even be interesting to anyone, but believe me to watch it for 2 hours is not fun. Although you laughed a few times, but it's really not enough and it may be more despair and don't believe it. To disturb the boredom, try to put some movie videos in the movie. They are really colorful tracks of absurd songs, perhaps from the fifties, but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be so funny that it's very sad. Several times you have the feeling that the plot can develop into something that creates a powerful scene, but in the end it just evaporates somehow and that is it. Apart from the cuts, there is almost no dialogue. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally, I can't recommend the movie. I believe art is something that should not be boring. During the projection there was everywhere in the theater that confirmed my brief review.
