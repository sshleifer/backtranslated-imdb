Silly, often ridiculous skirt that concerns the landing of a spaceship and the consequent destruction it causes on Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people in his job. <br /> <br /> Always amazed by Daniels. He showed such depth and promise in 1983's "Terms of Endearment" as Shirley MacLaine's clean son-in-law. As the years have passed, Daniels can't get his hands on a good, fleshy roll. Instead, he is in a silly comedy like Dumb and Dumber. <br /> <br /> As far as this photo is concerned, it has failed because of the subject. At least, the television program has caused a variety of situations. In the film, our constant slapstick and people turned into monsters, as the government is forced to catch the Martin Martin. <br /> <br /> The part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the non-success of the movie. On television, Pamela Britton expressed a silly individual in situations where the martyr disturbed her. <br /> <br /> Television star Ray Walston has a small role as government agent, or is he really like that? <br /> <br /> A huge disappointment for those who enjoyed the television program so much.
