Whale hunters choose the wrong freaking whale. <br /> <br /> A group of yahoo whale exporters attract a female and pull her through her tail fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing, including the moment the woman's unborn baby slips and slides on the deck. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) can say that the big man is really angry at the way he stings, like saying, "Get out of the village before high tide." <br /> <br /> This story of revenge has Harris's presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else. It was Bo's first 'released' movie, although her first acting work was released in 'En Once Upon a Love' in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (director John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Today is the date of this review (November 20) Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a "whale" of a good time ..... get it? ..... whale? ..... hee-hee.
