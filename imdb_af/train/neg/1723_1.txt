Man, what a scam it seems to be! Not because it wasn't good (because I didn't expect anything), but because I was deceived by the DVD sleeve, ignoring his "stars" as Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Sure enough, their names do not appear in the opening credits of the movie, much less in the rest !! As it turns out, the only obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975) is the only film that connects the three actors. but what one has to do with the CRATER LAKE SAMPLE is someone's guess ?? <br /> <br /> However, since I paid $ 1.50 for his rent and I bow in a monster movie anyway, I chose to watch the movie, no matter what, it hit! Apart from the fact that it had a name and an anonymous crew, there was an unmistakable amateur air of miles away, and most of what I could do was laugh at the JAWS-like pretensions and deliberately so at Resistant denials from two moronic alien cum-boat owners who regularly look at themselves with the confused local sheriff. The creature itself ?? a plesiosaur ie half dinosaur / halffish ?? is imperfectly realized (of course), but as with The GIANT CLAW (1957), which I have seen now, it has not disturbed the filmmakers as they can do as much as they can, especially in the second half of the movie!
