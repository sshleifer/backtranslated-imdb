My flat mate hired this movie the other night so we watched it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is actually a positive one, as the whole movie is shot in this colorful, grainy, post-MTV texture. Fast ranges, cool corners, moving camera moves - for the moment you feel like you want to see another "Snatch". For the moment .... When the plot actually begins to unfold, one begins to feel like an over-dosed amphetamine. things just don't make sense. I would hate to have fun watching it by giving out some scenes, but then the movie is so bad you are actually better off viewing it. <br /> <br /> First, you think it's a crime. story tells in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. WRONG. This conversation does not provide any coherent narrative whatsoever. On the contrary, Domino's lesbian continues on Lucy Liu's character during the second part of the movie, but throws the audience further confusion. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it might be a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background that has grown to be a difficult bounty hunter. Anyway, this is the message conveyed by the opening styles. But after that, the question of Domino's character is completely lost to the criminal plot. So briefly, NO this is NOT a movie about Domino's character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought, it's probably a story of one robbery. A fun bloody robbery. 10 million missing, bounty hunters chasing suspected robbers, mafia children being carried out, hands being removed, Domino trying to break why they do not receive bounty certificates this time around. But soon this impression is driven away by another U-turn of the plot. <br /> <br /> This time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese African-American woman who disapproves of driver's licenses at the local MDS and at the age of 28 is a youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars at the Jerry Springer show, trying to publish a new, wacky racial theory, while struggling to get money for her ill granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main chart? Unfortunately, nobody knows. Apart from that director, the audiences had to explain where bounty hunters would have their 300,000 collector's fee. <br /> <br /> Then you start by thinking, "Oh, it's about our society and the way the media distort." There is a reality TV crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent images. The bounty hunters are also stuck with a lot of Hollywood actors, who are just sneaking over their noses and dragging themselves on too many crime scenes. But no, it's not a movie about the media, they just appear sporadically throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Plus there are many other sub-plots: the crazy Afghani man tends to free Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the mescaline episode, the FBI oversight operation ... < br /> <br /> Can all of the above be packed in 2 hours of movie? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it's a real mess!
