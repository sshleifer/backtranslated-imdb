This movie must be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Apart from a few chuckles and one or two scenes, this movie is a total waste of time. Call it "Campy", don't even cut it. "Campy" means fun that this movie was not. You spend the first half of the movie thinking, "It must get better, right?". In fairness it ultimately means when it finally explains who the "brother / sister" team is and what they want, but by that time you hardly give up, because you spent the whole second half of the movie, wondering exactly what did Mr. Onorati & Mrs. Pacula crossed someone from HERE to hold it in such a horrible movie. <br /> <br />
