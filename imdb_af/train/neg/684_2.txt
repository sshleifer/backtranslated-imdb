Couldn't believe it! Cut sentences? Good pleasure! Know what? Everything true! Real people talk so now? Don't think so. Good girl! Naughty man! Biggest upper lip! Only reason given film 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a dish. Movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless dual dogfights. Seems endless, anyway. Think of all the Franchot Tone's dialogue baptized. When Crawford and Young made a special effort to sound British, they came over as Irish. Convenient point - our British cut words, not sentences. And in one way or another we succeed at the same time to turn around. But that's only when we went to a very good public school.
