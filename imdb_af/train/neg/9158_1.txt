Oh my God. I bought this movie and ... I ... watched ... the ... whole ... thing. . . Okay, it's gonna be fine ... I know I'll be good in a month or two. Shortly I hope to get rid of the flashback. I did eat something after the movie, but I just can't get the courage to try to keep any food right now. Bad? Yes, bad. Very bad. BATHING BATH BATH BATH BATH BATH. Wait, the message doesn't seem to get it right. Hmm ... There is no word to just describe how terrible .... not terrible. Hmm disgustingly gruesome / acted / filmed / directed / written. Now I don't know what to do, but throw it out. It may be burned. I don't want it to be down an architectural dig for a thousand years. The worst movie ever since, "Hey Happy"
