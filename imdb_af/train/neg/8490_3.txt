It was a great effort to do something, but it's too pretentious and boring to rise above the low budget drawings. The use of virtual sets works almost but on some points it fails miserably. They made good use of the small budget I think. I just wish the story and most of the acting was better. There are many areas where you see what they are aiming for and it will be obvious if they actually hit the points, but they do not. Confusing and amazing story. Bad DVD transfer too. It doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. I had to turn it off. It was too boring. I can do movies slowly. But just make them attractive in some ways. Visual, story-wise, acting, etc. It was lacking in all sections, so it never gained an exciting experience. Maybe the next attempt by the filmmaker will be better.
