How did I ever appreciate this dud of a successor? All that does is throw balls! Worst of all, it doesn't compare to even the first installment of the series! The comedy suffers from not being funny. Where did all the unintentional laughter go? Enough slapstick-on-the-field action goes on for too long. Bob Uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine innings shutout. What is next, GREAT LEAGUE 4: BACK TO LITTLE LEAGUE? Ehh, can be! Solve this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game. This one had three strikes too much.
