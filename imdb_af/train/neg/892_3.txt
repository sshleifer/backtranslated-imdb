(I will point out in this review where spoilers start.) My dissatisfaction is divided: 30% tone darkness, 70% slim writing. <br /> <br /> The 30%: I agree with the first commentary summary on the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories. I was amazed at this film's best NYC briefly admonishing the real NYC by suggesting a collection of people and relationships so narrowly that it is just inhabited by the Gossip Girl (it comes from someone who loves Skinder Meisie). A few minority characters are written in the stories, but they are included by obligation, while we can see the gears beneath the film so clearly, striving to be "diverse", but ever falling short. <br /> <br /> The 70% is why everything gets short. All characters, white plus a few token minorities, are one-dimensional, cardboard cutouts of human concepts. Worse, their interactions with each other are written so that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated, what I want to say, is a "gag": we get a basic mind, then a punchline is meant to be smart . turn. But even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say, "Oh yes, it was a surprise". The stories are still not that interesting, because they are also level. When you draw stories so that they exist solely on the unexpected end of the end, you write jokes. <br /> <br /> Spoilers below ... <br /> <br /> The movie is mostly about telling romantic stories. It is good. But romance is wonderful, deep, sometimes complex. These "romantic" stories each have a girl and a boy who share the same place and look at each other at a certain time. Words swap, thoughts are projected through voice-over, but they can also only communicate to the audience only that one person is attracted to another. <br /> <br /> Meaning, there is no temptation (in the broad sense), no tension, and no confrontation or fellowship between the will of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to the other. do not accommodate. The only story that entails a superficial "seduction" with him is just as told that the audience is finally surprised that the man (Ethan Hawke) is being wiped out by the girl he is attacking, which seems to be unexpectedly hooker to be. Certainly, his words when we try to upload her are interesting to hear and we are amused as we would be if we were next to them, but there is nothing in the content of this story outside "A then B". So it deploys, if something like a postcard can also be "unfolded" with all the other stories: A then B - It's the only point that it happens in Manhattan. By the way, the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island sketch; The only Queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the West Village. <br /> <br /> It's easy to choose from movies that play in all the common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation, and so forth. _New York, I love you, but deserve more rigorous investigation because of his title. We expect to see the real New York, and true New Yorkers, but instead we have flown the selected cut of a demographic paradigm, the characters of the OC, plus a few others to show it as if we pay attention to diversity. But when we look closer at who those characters are, the whole soul becomes a deterrent to the thought of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures that the film does not shamefully represent. <br /> <br /> For example, the story with the Latino man with the little white girl in the park, confused by two ladies if her husband is actually the father. Notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic construction point of view (it would have been very interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend / stepfather knocked the girl away), it is frankly a little disgusting that the scene where we knowing that the girl's father is Latino, we must also inform him that he is a sexually popular dancer. What, the father can't just be a guy from South America? Now that he's apparently hot, is the audience better prepared to accept having a child with a white-and-white middle class? Are we as naive as it needs? Of course, as a Mexican construction worker would be too unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It's not my place to decide where the movie was going. But in every imaginable setup and plot turn, the direction taken, screaming status quo, appeals to safety. All these stories could be made more interesting, even if we were forced to occupy the single-dimensionality of the characters in them, at least by not choosing standard and obvious stereotypes. Asian girl living in Chinatown is taught by a skurggly old white man? How about an Asian cougar instead of a white college. Again, I do not say the whole mind has to be changed. It's just that. damn. story starting point. is so hackneyed - and so they fail to find out why someone in New York, outside the trite, loves. The right way to improve the movie would be to write a book worth reading. <br /> <br /> I would like the soundtrack of the soundtrack, the good fit of the movie (even if it was fit, good, dredging), and the general feel of many of the screens. The movie was just nice to go through, and I won't stop anyone from doing it. However, it is believed that the main tribute to non-superficiality is when the old opera singer says (paraphrase). "That's what I like from New York: everyone is from a different place." Well, you won't know if you look at this one.
