Roy Rogers stars as Jesse James and his corpse equal, the gambler Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is Mr. Rogers's ex-press. Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a notable team, as two reporters looking for stories about the elusive hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, wrong identity / imitation is a plot. development, as Rogers sets up a "dual role". Rogers is charming as usual; but there is nothing really elevating its performance over the ordinary - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is done by poor material. The better couple to watch is me. Storm and me. Paye as the reporters of the St. Louis Journal - they are the highlight of the movie. The songs are good but poorly synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James by Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
