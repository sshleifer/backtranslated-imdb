Wow! This movie is really awful. I can't imagine how anyone could read this badly written script and give it the green light. The cast is uniformly two-digit with some really horrible acts of virtually all the cast. The story is diverse, fragmented and incoherent. The telling, guided and predictable. No whites, no charm, no humor. Not sexy at least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There is also a strong stream of misogyny that has become increasingly difficult to stomach while filming. If your lead (Carrell) is indecent and unattractive, it is ascending from there. In spite of this it is ominous to end where love over lust prevails, and I left a sick feeling in my stomach. When it comes to humor and social comment, we are definitely doomed.
