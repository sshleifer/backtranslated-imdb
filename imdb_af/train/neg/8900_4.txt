I like the first movie, but it's a textbook example of a sequel that would be better on the drawing board. The general idea in the first movie was, if not large, then at least very interesting. This successor tries to build on the idea and characters of the first movie, and while Christopher Walken is still good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly becomes a bit ridiculous. If you haven't seen any of these movies, get the first movie and forget about the persecutors, they can take away all the joy of the original.
