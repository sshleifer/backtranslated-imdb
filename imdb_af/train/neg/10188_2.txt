This young, blind movie is strict for teenagers in old people's bodies, desperate to relive their hormonal challenged teens. How? By burning gas and comparing a fast, reckless car (or airplane) with freedom. <br /> <br /> The plot is heavily borrowed from Mister Rogers' environment (if it managed me an oil conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if it was heavily calm and had a clear sense of style.) <br / > <br /> The lead roles of Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith are in a post-gas crisis world in which an almighty government does not want it. You (* ahem *) manage your car and fire gas. Kind of the opposite of today's Enron and Bush oil spilling SUV-busting government. <br /> <br /> This contradiction alone makes the movie ridiculous. But wait ... there's more. Although the film is set in the future, no signs of future technology are shown, except for a return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks ... exactly like today. The same clothes, the same suburban homes, the same green lawns as today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no alternative energy concessions. <br /> <br /> The play is flat and odorless. Even scenes that could have been eager or moving, kindness, honor, romance, horror ... all fall fatter than a paper doll under a briefcase. <br /> <br /> Missing continuity - the plane flowing through Burgess Meredith's character changes colors and intent from moment to moment, as filmmakers once again insult our intelligence with unprecedented stock footage. <br /> <br /> The plot is so moronic and only half as exciting as a Dukes or Hazzard episode. <br /> <br /> Even the hard-car movie and SF fans have to avoid this movie as a month-old roadkill, unless you enjoy a fierce Exxon CEO who is trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's guest cap.
