I remember a certain Tuesday, the morning of 6/6/02 to be exact. I was killed and tried to convince myself to get out of bed when a terrible explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I had a view of several districts in the south of Jerusalem and a pillar of smoke rose from a distant point, and the eyes of the smoke were followed for a moment by the fall of sirens. I remember moving to my bedroom, pulling out my binoculars, chasing the kitchen, and seeing the image of a glass-split bus. The bus was still near the driveway where a terrorist pulled it, and with a single click on a TNT device, 25 passengers were killed. Many of them were on their way to school. The wife of a good friend of mine went on the bus, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. <br /> <br /> I'm sure every Israeli would have at least one terrorist-related memory he'd never have had and it was just a matter of time before someone made a movie about it. The film is about a play on a dry run, Haim Buzaglo (portrayed by Hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film) who spends the better part of his day on solid competitions with his white word processor page. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to make a piece about a debt-alleged former army officer. Buzaglo, bored and a bit paranoid because of what is known as the "earthly hot baby, dating me" syndrome, asks a private eye to take an interest in his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As the detective progresses in his investigation, his observations penetrate the play and later into the lives of his actors. Meanwhile, the play is metamorphosed from a comic play into a charge against the indifference of Israeli society. Regarding the film, the movie is an exercise in frenzy editing, in its grandchild characters and untrustworthy dialogues, while the drift of miles away from the subject it primarily deals with. <br /> <br /> If I call "cardboard characters", I refer to the characters under the author / director's obsession for a "meaningful" movie, without real dialogues and some reliability. I will not expand too much on it. That's enough to say I'm sure homeless barefoot male prostitutes rarely go to the theater. With the intention of seeing a play, it is. <br /> <br /> According to Haim Buzaglo himself, this movie is the first part of a current agenda trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from the experiences like the one I wrote in the beginning of my review, as opposed to the isolated world of characters that is nothing else and a plot that is nothing but is not compelling. /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> PS This movie was a landmark in austerity. It was shot in ten days, all the works worked for free and the total cost of the movie was about $ 12,000 (no, I didn't refuse a zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). Wonder why it took $ 34,000 to complete the Blair gate project.
