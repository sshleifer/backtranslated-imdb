30 seconds in opening credits, I felt it would be a bad movie, but I didn't know how bad it was. Then the actor who plays the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and decides to survive this movie, we must turn off the volume, make our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD. But it didn't help. About half we turned it off. Now I've been living very bad movies before, both with and without the aide of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are only a few movies that I doubt even save the Bots. Most of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people who hypnotized to believe they were zombies had rotten green skin. I think they are all hypnotized in death, then hypnotized to riot themselves. Join the real B-movie cult classics like "Plan Nine From Outer Space."
