Although this film was made, Dogma emerged as the dominant method of filming, and before it conquered it. You get the point. This masterpiece in 1991 clearly predicted the developments. Corin Nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er good writer and narrator. The pace is slow, but elegant, because cinematography is so beautiful. Record it next time on T.V., because I guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia-rip-off TV movie. Direct-to-video never felt so good!
