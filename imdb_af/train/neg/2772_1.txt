Warning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad movie, about such an interesting story. It had such a promise, but the scene was at best ridiculous. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something outside an amusement park. I laughed myself as I watched, which was supposed to be, serious scenes. I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. The best part was the battle between friends who ended up killing the "King". I like the Queens punishment. But the last shot made a beautiful picture. There are so much better movies to watch. I do not recommend it.
