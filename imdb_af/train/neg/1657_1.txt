This movie was worth five punches on my "hurter card". I saw it while stationed in Virginia in the mid 70's. I saw it alone, so I wasn't distracted while I watched it. It sucked. It was the most ridiculous, complete waste of celluloid I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know others who reviewed this movie thought it was great. I offer it to you: if it was so wonderful, how was it? End of discussion.
