I had no idea of ​​the female tortoise, since 1987 we knew that TMNT were four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each of the four brothers was named for the great artists name such as Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here has no meaning or plays any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than the new one containing Venus. As a female tortoise, no action will add to the story, we love the story. The TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good thing to do, but having a female tortoise is a very bad thing to do. We would like to see more new TMNT series, but just like the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female tortoise.
