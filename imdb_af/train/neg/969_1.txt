I was rooting for this movie because it is a remake of a 1970's TV series, "Escape to Night", though chaotic and stilted, sometimes definitely strange, fascinating and disturbing. The play in "Paperhouse" is wood, unceasingly joking. The overbubbles did not add any strain that just strengthened them, and I sat and watched. Casting has provoked the urgent dialogue, causing relationships to have no heat, chemistry or belief. As in most dark films, there are some good supporting acts. These people should be comforted, comforted and rest assured that they will not be held responsible. From all the possible ends, the most unexpected were chosen ... louder than I could have dreamed. <br /> <br /> "Escape in Night" deserves a proper remake, written by someone with life experience and aimed at a subtle thought.
