This movie really started well. It has the potential to be in a cordial, romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really needs nothing more than that, and for a moment there I was excited that someone finally made a beautiful movie for their own pleasure, another timeless classic, a modern myth. Why, oh, why, are you wasting it halfway by making the main character (Norton) another psycho? Maybe I miss the point, but do we really need another movie on psychosis? Or is it necessary in Hollywood to illustrate the morbid side of human nature, indicating that there is a more general malaise in the film industry? For a moment there I will make a mental note of the director's name; now I feel indifferent. At least in the film's defense it must be added that all the actors have invested in their roles. Also, Evan Rachel Wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with great potential.
