Being a big fan of Corman's horror movies, I expected a little more from his west than I got. Well, I was well entertained. I almost laughed so much at watching Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles. <br /> <br /> See the spectacle of mobile tires on the prairie of the old west. You can kill time by counting them if there is an otherwise boring scene. And the horses also seem to have gears in them, considering the fast forward. Also see the swinging bar room queens of the traditional game west salon a number reminiscent of a certain fashion dance from the 1920s, invented here decades before the style. Hope the salon will not crumble. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos, the main players are doing a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all really good. A special praise for them to do the best they could with the material that appears mostly from Johnny Guitar, but not in the same way. But there's really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this. Just like a very bad old horror movie, it can somehow fail, but succeeds in giving up anyway. This is one of the reasons why Corman's work appeals to me and so I dare recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance.
