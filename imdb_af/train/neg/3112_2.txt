Let me start by saying I will try not to place too many spoilers in it. Normally I enjoy Robin Williams movies, but this jewel was not one of them. It was billed as an exciting thriller. The night listener was anything else. To be quiet, there were 6 people in the theater opening day, 2 ran out, for good reason. The movie was poorly written and directed. The acting was good, but again there was nothing to work with. The film is about a storyteller who reads a good book by a dying child. But * spooky here * No one can verify children's existence. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, but all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boy's caretaker. There it is, that's all. You wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends. It had visited so much excitement and cold fever as a dental office. The homosexual undertones, or overtones, didn't really have anything to do with the story, and the movie had a little curse, but it seemed like no reason and no sense. In conclusion, I really can't write a decent review on this movie because there was nothing like it, it was so fascinating to look dry. I gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was good and it wasn't directed by Your Boll.
