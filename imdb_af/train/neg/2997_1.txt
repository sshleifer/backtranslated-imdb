It was returned with the 1992 re-design of Conan Doyle's famous novel The Lost World. And it shows. <br /> <br /> With a relentless organization planning to use the lost world and returning Challenger et al to defend the prehistoric plateau, the film begins promising, but then things go downhill. Everyone was stranded on the plateau and we had a poor, boring, long-awaited rehash from the first movie. <br /> <br /> The dinosaurs (which are almost never seen) are just nice. Are we expected to take that confectionery that is supposed to be an ankylosing sorcerer? And the tyrannosaurus looks rooted in that place. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and get the 1925 silent version of the Lost World. Incredible in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twentieth version is the best and will remain so until someone finally decides to make a decent repetition.
