They sell it as a horror movie, it's supposed to be a thrill, but I really got it funny (comedy ?, Don't think so), I laughed the whole movie I think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot. I don't blame the actors, I think they weren't very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy", I loved her in Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! she is also a beauty and a good actress, but we try to be a small goal here, the story mm mm ... the direction mm mm ... it has a very good tension, in fact is " a very boring movie, but there is one good thing, it's a short movie, just 1 hour and 30 minutes. (FOR ME WAS 10 MINUTES UNDER THE WATER !!!) <br /> <br /> I just don't know why this movie is so highly rated, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, what's wrong with good, rational and objective criticism?
