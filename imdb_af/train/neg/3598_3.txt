Do you know when you look at your collection of old video movies and realize that there are a few that you have seen once or twice, and you cannot remember whether it is worth the time to see it ? The Alibi is / was one of those movies; I found it, not long ago, and decided that I could give you a chance. I'm not quite sure I'm happy with my decision. On the one hand, the movie is really very bad, on the other hand, now I have another free band ... yes, you get it. The plot is predictable and not original in any way. The pacing is bad. The acting is bad, but it's not really surprising, as the two leads are former soap opera players ... they're used to persuading. The characters are poorly written clichés. The movie even controls the easiest damn way to impress me (through film): court scenes. Even they don't provoke a single emotion for or against any of the cardboard thin characters. The movie has no real redeeming qualities at all ... even the dialogue is bad. The thing is, it's so full of clichés that it is stackable. And that's the one thing that raised a 1/10 score above: the (though unintentionally) comic relief of the many clicks and stereotypes. I didn't pay much attention to the movie, but every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh about. One last note: I think the use of the line "Tori Spelling can't act" as a one-line summary, but I think everyone knows it, so I opted for the current one, as it is more informative is. All in all, a very bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing else to do and if it's on TV. Good for a few laughs, if you can put them through. 10/03
