The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other snooping agencies around the world should see this movie for information on how to spy people. (like MST3k Comment says it ... "Sanata has the dirt on every! Santa's tentacles come far and wide! There is no hiding from the Klaus organization. <br /> <br /> From telescopes over millions miles to ears that can hear everything. It's amazing that the CIA doesn't have Santa on the payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is hilarious.Pitch ... he's so useless. <br /> < br> The cheese factor of this movie is great, very low budget but so nice to watch I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version for even more laugh. <br /> <br /> You even get a laugh for the misfortune of the good kids. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
