I just finished watching guinea pigs - Demons are experimenting. I have to say that this movie, although I am very good FX, better than I expected, was NOT a good movie. I can honestly say I didn't enjoy this movie at all. Of course, it is effective in the way of being a shocking, realistic, 43-minute torture, but I found it very boring (and not as greedy as I had hoped). And I also found that the martyrs were very annoying when they talked and laughed to run hard all the time, it ruined it even more (and I'm sure there are some people going there with me be). Now I have seen guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Bloody of flesh and blood. I will not say much more about Devils experiment, except Big Fx, descent of the girl, annoying fussing martyrs, overall I give it 4 stars because of the FX cos they are wonderful.
