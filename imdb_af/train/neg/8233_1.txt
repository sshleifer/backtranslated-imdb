It was probably the worst movie ever, serious. I could do myself better, it wasn't even rectified. It's like this movie has a $ 5 budget and is left with change. Don't look at it. I didn't even get through this movie, had to turn it off. I gave it a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie but actually became a very bad comedy. In fact, a lot of girls crashed into a car, broke a headlight, and the owner of the car went after them. The little I saw was a woman with a gun telling a load of girls to take off all their clothes, what the hell? It should also be a kind of cute porn movie.
