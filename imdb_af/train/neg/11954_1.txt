This movie was terrible. Throughout the movie I was amazed and I didn't see any point. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it is all about. This movie is not worth watching. Not only is it sick and rebellious, but totally STOM! Please do not look unless you are one of those who likes watching bad movies. If this movie calls for Japanese society and their values ​​and roles, then it's a country I don't like to visit or bother. It's a totally sick movie !!!!!!!! I didn't enjoy it because it didn't make sense. My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was an abomination, because it is under the list. This was total disappointment.
