I must admit that I like the first half of Sleepers. It looks good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. A superior Hollywood movie. But ... No one mentioned it so far (at least in the last 20 remarks), when it came to the courtroom scene and Brat Pitt's character followed his plan to save his two friends, who are accused of murder , I feel cheated. This movie insults my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning Breakers !! <br /> <br /> Why did anyone accept their false alibi, testified by the priest? If these two guys were with him, why not tell them during the investigation? Memory loss? If you were the judge or a member of the jury, would you believe it? Is it wise to give away the motives of the murderers? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but in the end the story is very bad and it hurts me. This movie had great potential. 10/04
