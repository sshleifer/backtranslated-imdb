I can't believe the Indian film industry still leaves such a deadly dross as Waqt. For starters, the storyline is totally indescribable ?? spoiled son is thrown out of the house of the family so that he can learn for himself. So what does he do? He will instantly win a national talent competition by doing a few star ratings in front of a panel of judges (I'm honestly not here). Meanwhile, his father died of lung cancer, but kept it a secret from the boy, but he survived long enough to see his son become known to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> Is the play worthy of his hamminess? There was no attempt to try any of the main players in this movie in any convincing manner. As usual for Indian movies, the family lived in a large house and appeared relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main losers are when such brave films are made, the intelligent viewers. which made the mistake of seeing such a movie. The actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be worshiped as God's by the people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
