Worse than worst David Lynch "confusathon", "Brain Dead" doesn't make sense. Disgracefully wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), refusing to acid like them in a "Tom and Jerry" cartoon. There is insignificant character development. It just starts climbing the "strange scale" until the total chaos climbs. Don't get sucked by this fine actor. They're given nothing to work with, and you'll wonder what's going on for the unbearable 85 minutes. I recommend avoiding "Brain Dead" at all costs unless you scatter your brain in total nonsense. - NOTE
