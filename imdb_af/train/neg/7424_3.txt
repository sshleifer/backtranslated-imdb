Very, very humorous movie goes with Stella Stevens to guide someone in disguise (it didn't need me to guess who it was) in the old Nevada town outside Vegas for a money head in Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads her girl gang of three, and they find that they have to act much faster than expected. Despite a neat look at Las Vegas in the 70's, a very average but credible actor of the most involved, and a plot line of potential, Las Vegas Lady lays a big boring egg. It seems to be forever for the movie to kick in the gear, and when it does, it just spits here and there and never really speeds up. I was somewhat disappointed with this movie. Certainly, I didn't expect anything good, but at least I thought it might be one of those neat exploitation movies from the 70's, or something like that. Not even close. Nobody dies. There is a lame rifle battle between creaking Stuart Whitman and officious George DiCenzo, one year before his big performance as the prosecuting Bugliosa lawyer in Helter Skelter. The shooting battle has all the tension to watch a waterfall. There is one punch and one head is hit with a blunt instrument. In addition, nothing is in terms of action. And for the girls, don't expect much there either. Stella and her girls (both very mediocre but rather talents, come in a bath and a bath.) What do we see? Nothing but a smooth side profile. Stella wears this pretty open blouse that emphasizes her real talents, but I wish she'd been a little more open with her performances. That way I could write one thing that would recommend the movie. Oh, it wasn't, and I have little to say in the film's favor. It is by no means a horrible movie. , it just has nothing for it. Yawn.
