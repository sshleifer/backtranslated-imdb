The word in the summary puts it on the oh;) Five girls go away to get their way home, when they stop at a shop to get directions, they find a parked car breaking up a headlight, they flow the scene in fairness to get into trouble, but suddenly they see a headlight coming behind them. (Ooooh). <br /> <br /> From there, everything, crying and violence screaming when they get away from this crazy man who lost it because of the headlight;), and the screaming and crying remains almost the whole movie (very annoying). The movie was shot, with a cheap camera trying to make it look 'real' or 'shocking'. It's just embarrassing and useless though. In the absence of anything better to compare it to a Blair witch style. <br /> <br /> The screaming and crying for almost the whole movie with crazy sound was on top, you literally get a headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but this was not scary, just an annoyingly painful piece of crap movie.
