Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm after leading "Apocalypse Now" which made it absolutely impossible for him to make a good movie? <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" thought when making this flabby movie. This gives Kathleen Turner a lead car, plays a woman who travels early and revives her adolescence by knowing all the things that life as an adult has taught her, and Turner, the trooper she is, does what she can with this, but this movie cannot be saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even have a style, and with its director one can expect that even if it had nothing else it would have. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
