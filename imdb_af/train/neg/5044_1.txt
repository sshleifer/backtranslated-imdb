I look forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, I am also Shanghai, so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject. But after watching it, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie's tempo was extremely slow and monotonous. The director has gone on certain scenes for too long. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was hardly any dialogue. Dialogue was much needed to compensate for the lack of acting. At the end of the movie, you didn't feel compassion for the characters. This movie was missing in everything. The writing was poor, the acting was poor and the editing was not there. The director tried to imitate certain noir movie styles, but unfortunately failed. A good movie is one that catches your attention, maintains it and is successful in ending without feeling time. This movie felt like it would never end. Don't waste your money on this movie.
