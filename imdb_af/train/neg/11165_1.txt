I mean, really ... or I suddenly lost my sense of humor or it's just a very bad movie. It is stupid, ridiculous and just not funny at all. Because I saw the preview, I knew it wasn't going to be a good movie. I just didn't think it was that bad. <br /> <br /> What happened to the good old times when you could get smart funny lines at any movie? When the actors didn't have to play ridiculous roles in trying to be funny. Now we find ourselves with movies like this, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4 where I couldn't find the funny parts! <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece of garbage <br /> <br /> PS (sorry for my English)
