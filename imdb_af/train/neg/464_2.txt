This movie is not funny at all, it tries to be funny with its lame humor, which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture. Throughout the movie I thought one thing, "when will it end". One thing you have to hand them over is that they have a few little, funny moments. That's also why I gave it a whole 2 stars. It's original and almost every old blonde joke in the book, even the one that wasn't the first time to be funny. It is basically a movie to cut down on blondes and to record the whole repertoire of blonde jokes. <br /> <br /> To sum it all up, this blonde humor is bad, it's not worth paying any money. Look, it's just as bad.
