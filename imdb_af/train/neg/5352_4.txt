The Honey, I shrunk the Kids franchise, was a big deal and not much known. I loved Honey, I shrunk the kids when I was little. It was an original story and has such an exciting plot! The sets were so wonderful and the movie seemed to have enjoyed each other's company. Now, honey, I blew the baby was pretty stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story everyone loved. <br /> <br /> Basically, Adam is a little more big now and the mother is now on holiday to leave their husbands with their children. But when Wayne's favorite item for the garbage is threatened, he wants to shrink and hold it, but he and his brother get in the way. But when the women return after forgetting their children, they are also caught in the machine. Let the children be alone in the house! <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid, but as I said, it was just a family movie I think some might get a kick out. The original honey, I shrunk the kids, is the best, I think everyone can agree. The third one wasn't that bad, I would at least recommend this one to Honey, I Blew Up the Kid movie, it was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
