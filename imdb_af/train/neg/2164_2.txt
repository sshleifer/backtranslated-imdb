I thought maybe a movie featuring a movie, including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews, might be worth watching. Oh, I was wrong. Perform pretentious nonsense from start to finish with both O'Toole and York who are wildly persuaded. I watched it twice and still have no idea what it is about. I have a feeling O'Toole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle with a drink problem and likes the revival of childhood with his sister (York). He also blows crazy. But apart from that, you guess as well as mine. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't have a redeeming feature at all. I can only accept the movie and the director is squashed in making this crazy, unattractive, stagy piffle. This is clearly a waste of time for a talented role and director. Laughable.
