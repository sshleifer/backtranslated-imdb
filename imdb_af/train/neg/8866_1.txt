In theory, 'Director's comments' should have worked. The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former TV director who tells his experiences behind the camera. Among the programs he allegedly worked on are 'Bonanza', 'Flambards', 'The Duchess Of Duke Street' and 'The Bounder'. His comments are not the least informative, due to his habit of wandering off the point. <br /> <br /> But in practice, it failed. It's a one-joke show, and the joke isn't very funny. The scripts are completely missing, and Bryden fails to convince as an old man. When it ties in for anything amusing to say, which is every five seconds, he gives a hissing laugh. Rather than being amused by DeLane, you want to shoot him. If senile old men are hitting you as screams, it's for you. <br /> <br /> It didn't help that the performances were mocked, with the exceptions of 'Mr & Mrs' and 'Crossroads', pretty good. For the joke to work, they had to be very dreadful like Charlie's Angels, OTT, Telly Addicts, Neighbors and New Faces. <br /> <br /> The show has a lot of thought time, so grateful we saved the horror of future expenses. Wouldn't it be ironic if 'Director's comments' were the subject of a spoof?
