I've seen this movie think it's one of those old B-movies that is fun to watch. I was so wrong! This movie was boring and obviously aimed at men who like to look at corpulent women. The story was so ridiculous and unrelenting that it completely lost my interest. It was in the same genre as the Ed Wood movies - bottom of the bar.
