This movie is one of the most distorted portrayals of history. Terribly inaccurate, this film does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous addicts that the sadistic Japanese have been killed and tortured. The bridge had to be built "over the bodies of the white man", as the chief Japanese engineer said. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by Japanese exiles are the source of a movie, where the bridge itself is not even close to the real bridge. The real bridge is built of steel and concrete, not wood. What about the survivors still living today? They hate the movie and everything it is supposed to represent. Their friends were hungry, tortured and murdered by cruel sadists. Those who have not died of dyspnea, famine or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times.
