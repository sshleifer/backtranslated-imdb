An overall waste of time! Just throw a few explosions, stop fighting, exotic cars, a murdered millionaire, slow motion computer-generated car accidents and lastly not a Hugh Hefner like character with a wall to wall, hot babies. a blender and you will apologize for a movie. I really have a laugh from the "Dr Evil" like a strong reinforced connection. That plot was somewhere between preposterous and non existent. How many millionaires are prepared to make a 25 million dollar race on a motor sport? Answer: 4, but did they not become millionaires through fiscal responsibility? It's written for brave males, it plays like a video game. However, I did enjoy the Gulfstream II landing in the desert already.
