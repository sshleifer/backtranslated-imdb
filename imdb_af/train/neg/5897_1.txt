The well-known Japanese director, Takashi Miike, does not look like the wheels are moving with this torpedo thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book about an evil old woman (and child abuse!) Which is part of a new urban legend: your phone rings with a strange tone - and you see the message "One missed call" - you will only play the message again to hear your own final words before your death. The most successful part of the movie is the messy satire of Reality TV cameras that enter the future victims, but the incredible death cases (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) Are disappointing and devastating. The regular shots of destroyed dead bodies are actually strategically depicted, and this overall courtesy can be the reason why the film is finally over. Hollywood predictably jumped on the far-fetched plot in 2008, but the US version didn't perform better. NO stars from ****
