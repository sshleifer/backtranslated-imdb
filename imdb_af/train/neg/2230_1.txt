If you want to see a delayed homosexual Karate expert, a bunch of running Mexican gangsters beats repeatedly for an hour, then it's the movie for you. If not, then choose another 20c bin DVD which is the only place this movie belongs to. The acting was so terrible that I had to force myself to see it to the end. The cover makes it so cool, but it's just another cheap, b-grade gangster film in the line of 2g and a key, bloody street and threat. I won't buy or rent this movie unless you plan to be stoned and plot, edit and work, it really doesn't matter to you. this is really the worst movie in the history of mankind !!!
