The king is dead, the King lives! The triad of Caddy Shack Two, the family under the stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills have been established for so long for the worst movie that they were actually symbols. But there is a new king ... yes ..... everyone gets the new king .... "Down to Earth". But some things, like Tiny Tim, for example, are so bad they are good. Sometimes it can take the incomprehensible "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult movie. So go look this .... this .... well just my word for it. Go see it. Everyone gets the new king!
