This movie was terrible. I watched it three times, and not even the whole thing. It's just impossible to watch, the story line sucks, it's depressed, and totally disgusting. I'm not writing spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see it for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning, and some funny parts in the movie. The little child in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is uneasy. I saw this movie at movie stores in America, so I believed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !! The acting is all terrible, and the nakedness itself is lame and dirty. Another thing, Starr Andreef, the other main character, was not in such bad movies in the past. She was indeed in some nice things. Same with John Savage. This movie sucks!
