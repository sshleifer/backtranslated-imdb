It's a means of enjoying such great actors in such a poor and boring movie. Besides all the unanswered questions that were posted in the other comments, what is so difficult to catch the robbers? Just do the bankers, see who was at the bank - from all the cameras' angles - before the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. Where is the tension every body speaks? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to the front door ... many times seen. At least Mr Spike Lee could have rented the movie with some good music and artistic shooting. The movie is not worth it. Pronto!
