An ensemble of uninteresting and untouchable characters turns and turns their way through a thin plot that can be interesting if you can just care for yourself. This "twist and turn" that I speak does not refer to the story (which contains all the stress of a recipe for tonic crates), but to the directors 'inability to keep the characters' faces even in the frame in the frame . On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they've convinced to do. Considering this, this movie is never released in the theaters, despite the fact that you have an all-star cast, you may be inclined to think that something stinks. <br /> <br /> And that does mean.
