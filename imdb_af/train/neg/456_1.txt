Add to the caricature list: A Southern minister and a congregation, a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dance chorus and The Mills Brothers - it just makes it worse. <br /> <br /> Despicable burlesque of "Negro" achievers, who often appear in films to parody themselves and their race. Although the "Negro comedy" can be accepted in its day, it is very offensive today, and I doubt it was ever funny. Although I wouldn't be offended, I didn't think I was laughing at the poor attempts at humor. However, as an 11-year-old white boy, I may not have understood it.
