Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem on his hands. The ceremony, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom psychic extraordinary Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him capture, was resurrected with the First Force (given to him by Satan after his performance in the gas chamber) and can owns the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins Tess (who understands what they oppose), will stop Channing or many women will continue to die in his bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) who tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic Church of the First Force, but access was denied to a weapon that Channing could stop. heart of channing ridding the world of its evil. She will take it anyway and give a helping hand to Russell, who needs all the help he can get when Channing kidnapped Tess preparing her for some kind of satanic ritual / ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always a trusted welcome supporting actor, gets the partner of Russell role. So you know what will happen to him. Like in movies of this kind, everyone dies around Russell, but if he tries to kill Channing, he'll only kill the poor army of another poor soul he owns. <br /> <br /> Pure occultic refuse. the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I'll give them, but in a movie like this they don't stand a chance. Kober, which is usually always effective when it is heavy, is really nothing more than a goofy villain who jumps into the air and throws pork throats.
