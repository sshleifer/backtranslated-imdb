Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie. <br /> <br /> These types of movies are actually made for flop. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies is worthless as C-grade movies. Or even a few C-grade films have a better and enjoyable story than Tashan. The promising and overbearing beneficiary Tashan bombarded at the cashier's office that surely earned it. <br /> <br /> In my eyes this is the worst movie ever made of the honorable Yash Raj Films banner. How did they handle such a heavy project after the new Vijay Krishna Acharya, which has no real sense of action? He tried to make Sanjay Gadhvi's ways of Dhoom, but he eventually suffered. The action scenes are more than comics or cartoon movies that are used to take out audiences. <br /> <br /> The story also loses its meaning and substance to win the hearts of the audiences. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body language and word expressions. I'm not a fan of Saif or Akshay, but Kareena's award eventually had to go to Saif's hand instead of Akshay. Just from the starting point I expected, but in the end I upset myself with the climatic truth. Saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while Akshay comes in the middle. In any movie, the final must be assessed with the entire characters of the whole story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who earns credit. And Tashan lost this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hit. <br /> <br /> Akshay's has nothing new to show off his comedy show here, but still reminds of his previous movies. He must seriously make a new picture to his fans who impress them again and again. Meanwhile, Saif had a good work in race, and now he has returned to his hilarious nature through this movie. But he fully developed himself into the acting. And last but not least about Kareena. She looks really hot with bikini dress, some of which complain as she has become lean. But I don't think so myself, instead she becomes slim. Yes slim !!! It's a good factor for a woman to attract the big people (or say male). Besides them, it is nice that Saif's son Ibrahim appeared in the beginning and last as young Saif. I hope he will also lean forward so that he can act as his profession. <br /> <br /> Those who love this Tashan are either mentally immature or want to go back to childhood, or say to be allowed in an asylum. Thumbs off to debutant director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mistook the project presented by Yash Raj Films. He has to experiment in the future and study the writing at least 5 years before going into practical directions. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I don't like to rate good stars on this type of movie.
