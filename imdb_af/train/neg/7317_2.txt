After reading the other comments on this movie, I would like to share my own view that this is a difficult movie to see unless you are a total Brooksophile. I'm not. <br /> <br /> Looking at a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced story that presents us with more undisturbed neurosis than we can absorb in one sitting. It's pretty hard to watch. The Brooks character (Robert Cole) is so impractical and unpleasant that it is difficult to talk to him --- let alone root for him as he stumbles from a dysfunctional self-absorbed situation to the next. And he should never do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. Nobody can have so many leaves and need to switch on a baby like Kathryn Harrold ---- unless of course he is Albert Brooks in an Albert Brooks-controlled production. <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" has its amusing moments ----- but they are fragmented and irregular. More often than not, I felt like I was on a limited journey with a thorough dishonest person and wish it would end. This confirms the problems that can develop if too much control over a movie is placed in only one person - someone who has the self-discipline to get back from it and sees what happens clearly. <br /> <As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who was the director in this movie, actually did what he portrayed. Six years later, he put Albert Brooks in the very successful Broadcast News. James showed us how Albert can form a credible and entertaining comic show. Albert allowed us to see James (usually not cast as an actor). Do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" will now move on to the following commentary. For you, I say ----- there is enough pain in the world without finding it in a movie intended for entertainment.
