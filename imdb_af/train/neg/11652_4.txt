The script for "Scary Movie 2" was just not right. This is a problem with the film that is blatantly visible, to the actors and the audience. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many actors are funny people; and so the movie is not completely humorous. To their credit, the film has several funny moments. But as a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is not even as smart and amusing as the original. <br /> <br /> The first "Scary Movie" was a movie. It has changed the smallest subtleties of the slasher movie genre into comic gold. The humor in "Scary Movie 2" was handed over as heavily as it was originally. They even miss obvious parody possibilities. Two of the movie stars are former Beverly Hills 90210 role players, and it was a show begging to be parodied! In the final analysis, "Scary Movie 2" is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened too soon. The writing had much more time to age. 2 stars out of 5.
