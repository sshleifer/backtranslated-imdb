"The second coming of Suzanne" is one of those surrealistic films that is so sophisticated, but it makes the viewer asleep. Like other movies of this type, there is a limited dialogue. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetics of the shot. The cinematography therefore stinks, there is nothing to keep your attention. <br /> <br /> The video box states that this movie is one of the most exciting visual adventures ever on film. Yes sure. It's upright there with such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melt or a turtle that runs for a mile. 10/01
