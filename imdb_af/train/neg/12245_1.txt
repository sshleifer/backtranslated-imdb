Why, o 'WHY! ... did I pick this one? Well ... I needed a no-brainer in the summer heat, and the cover looked cool. <br /> <br /> Of course I needed to know better. It's a really really bad movie. And it becomes embarasing when the makers know it is bad, and try to cover it by some sexy / beautiful women, and add some sections. Well, people ... it doesn't cut it, do it! <br /> <br /> If you want a cool movie about a great reptile, it's very, very good, well-played and funny: rent Lake Placid! (this is an order)
