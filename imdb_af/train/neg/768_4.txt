I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change in format. Columbo is a unique policeman with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective drama from the past. And that's the disturbing point, because Columbo is no ordinary detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in this movie that left me intriguing. First, I can't figure out the title of this movie. This is misleading. Perhaps a better title would be "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo hides a voucher without giving the reason (for the viewers at least) why he is doing it. <br /> <br /> I don't feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk returned to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
