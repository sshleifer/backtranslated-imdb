OK, so it was written in 1996 before 9/11, so you can give it a bit of credit for the terrorist concern and the idea that the CIA director makes a plunge to blow this doomed plane out of the air bring punishment. The world is predictable. That's it. That's the good stuff. The acting ... fair. The plot ... stupid. The "turn" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOOM It is not as if no one ever thought of what to do if an aircraft gets infected. Don't you think bureaucrats have a "pest" and how to contain them? Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we have seen Katrina. But they have a plan. It is not to send them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why is the aircraft door open and the "gunmen" standing there without protection? In fact, has it ever happened that anyone shoots her legs? It would stop her. But not so dramatic. I always look at a movie to see the end as soon as I start it. But it was a waste of time and for the most part predictable. I saw it with a recorder, so I didn't. To see all the ads, it was a plus. This is a good example of why I watch so little network TV. Garbage.
