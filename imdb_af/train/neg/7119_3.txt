* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I'm sure when it was released in 1958, it was very suitable for its time. Back then, movies were slower to listen to and analyze the story. Here, a man moves to a home owned by his last wife, who mysteriously died with his new wife. The gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed his film) is really an undervalued character. He was given a skull to warn Jenni indirectly that she was in trouble as he knew that the first woman's death was dirty. He can't tell Jenni directly what happened, so he tries to scare her with the skull. Jenni, we also found out, saw her parents die, thus causing a lifetime of mental anxiety that leads to institutionalization. Like many audiences today, I found that the pacing is a little too slow for my taste. But if you like a slow horror without much gore, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
