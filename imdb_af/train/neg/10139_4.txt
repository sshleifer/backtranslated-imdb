You have to hand it over to Steven Seagal: whatever his other mistakes may be, he has good taste in women. If you choose a Seagal movie, there are one or more pretty women in the chances. And usually they do not function as mere eye cakes; they get involved in action and fighting, shooting guns, killing with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers the duo of Ciera Payton (which has a very sexy face, with nice lips matching Angelina Jolie's) and Katie Jones. find time to get involved with both a cat and a little lesbian darling! And if I seem to be spending too much time on them, it's because the rest of the movie, though mentally, is so unpleasant that it's hard to talk much more. Ironically, the worst aspect is probably Seagal himself, which seems to be not even bothered to try to pretend to care. It's a military-type action, there are very few fights in it and it doesn't fit into its role (a stealth fighter pilot, of course the best in the world) offensive sleepwalkers. (* 1/2)
