This movie is a repeat of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, "Heaven Can Wait", but it is written for the upstanding comic style of Mr. Rock. The point remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) is taken before his life time and works with God's representative, Mr King, to come back as someone else. Like in Beatty's movie; He chose Charles White Wellington, a wealthy white man, because he chose Sontee Jenkins (Regina King), who arrived at the Wellington murder. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover are suffering from this repetition and the idea of ​​getting an elderly white multi-millionaire into a revolt is a black comedian trying to try. The participants also showed Rock as Wellington and then as the true 'white' Wellington failed. Improvements could be made to the original Beatty plot - which in itself did not master the life-to-death idea - but they were certainly not found in "Down to Earth".
