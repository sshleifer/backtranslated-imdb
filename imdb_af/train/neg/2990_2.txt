Ohh man! Now that's what I'm talking about! As far as bad / cute horror flicks go, this movie was really in a class of its own. A true gem! <br /> <br /> First, the movie wasn't original in English. That's good, because the voice dubbing was really exceptional! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialogue (and there is much more where it comes from) ?? "I feel a little better. I'm just thirsty for your blood!" <br /> <br /> And what drama! Here's a play of the interaction between the military and scientists? <br /> <br /> Scene 1 ?? Scientist: "You can't do it? It'll be a disaster!" - Military Officer: "It's just science fiction" (he then continues to cause a complete disaster just as the scientist predicted). <br /> <br /> Scene 2 ?? Scientific: "If you do, many people will die !!!" - Military officer: "You don't know what you're talking about." (He does it and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Don't do it? It'll kill everyone!" - Military Officer: "It's nonsense" (he is going to kill everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (you get the idea). <br /> <br /> If it wasn't enough? There were some scenes that really came out as fast-paced! In one scene, the army literally has 10 guys showing guns to two unconscious men. The leader shouts: "Get them!" and all 10 army guys, one at a time, let their guns and fights the two opponents! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> Don't worry. No attention to detail has been left out! This movie even features a hip / upbeat '80 keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood! <br /> <br /> And trust me ?? I realize that this review may contain some spoilers, but there are so many delicacies in this epic I really scratched the surface. A movie of this caliber comes out only once a decade! A real movie watching experience! A masterpiece! Wow!
