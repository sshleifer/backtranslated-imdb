In spite of a few moments in heavy rain, an encounter with a drunk as well as an organ pellet with a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanatorium, this Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle is silent comedy briefly with support from Buster Keaton and Al. John is just amusing, though there is a very funny series of Arbuckle, flirting with Buster, which is best in "meet cute" scenes, especially as it is one of the few, see The Great Stone Face Smile and laugh in the movies! Also, many screens seem to be cut cut edit possibly due to over-utilization of the movie stock. Still, if you are an Arbuckle or Keaton coach, Good Night, Nurse! is definitely worth a look.
