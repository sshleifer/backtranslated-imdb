First of all I would like to say that if I had to honestly evaluate this movie from 1 to 10, I would give it a -4. It's not that I'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is so bad. Everything from the story, after directing, to editing is awful. The story isn't even half-way to start (you can't expect much since it's based on a video game, something I wasn't aware of the movie), but directing and editing made it even worse . The film cuts on awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous one. Some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense to be put in the story, as the characters show no feelings towards each other. You can go in this movie and expect that you will see a lot of shit on the screen for half an hour and you will still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie, you're wasting your money, and if you don't pay anything, you'll waste another half an hour on your life. So do yourself a favor and look.
