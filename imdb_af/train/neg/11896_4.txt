Before I start, I love Eddie Izzard. I think he's one of the funniest stand-ups today. Perhaps that means I'm going with too high expectations, but I didn't find Eddie funny in this outing. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest problem is that Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic, and we all love him. But in Circle he seems more irrelevant than funny, and I lost myself completely in places. He already covered many of the topics he covered before. I even think I recognized some recycled jokes there. <br /> <br /> If you buy the DVD, you will watch Eddie's tour behind the scenes (interesting in places, but not very funny), and a French version of one of his shows. The hard-hired Eddie would like to see in another language, but subtitled comedy is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Eddie, you already have it or you're going to buy it all I say. If you just get through, buy Glorious of Dressed to Kill - you won't be disappointed. With Circle you will probably.
