The screen (1 out of 5 stars) This movie has brand new cool performances (a screen narrator warns that movie people will get a free funeral if they frighten this fright, a scary shot of a skull coming out of a calm. and the ubiquitous and frightening music), but unfortunately the movie is already from the mountain. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion ... and admonishes his servants and friends that the new Madam has a very fragile attitude because of a tragedy in her past. Well, in no time does she begin to see and hear mysterious things no one else can do. Her husband assured her that it was all in her mind and ... Well, you can probably see where it all goes. You will have figured out what has happened long before our relentless heroine ... because you probably saw exactly the same chart in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and better done). To add to the movie's innumerable offenses, it seems that most of this movie's movie (on many cheap DVD combinations) lacks some key screens. You see the heroine walking slowly to the window ... she is going to open it ... you know she's going to look scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene cuts to her in her husband's arms. So what did she see ??? I think we will never know.
