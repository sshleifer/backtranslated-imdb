In 2004, I expected the theater on Sky Captain in 2004 to expect a good movie. Almost every review of this movie was positive, the effects seemingly overlooked, the previews convincing. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, disappointment doesn't actually describe the feeling I got from this movie. It was anger. <br /> <br /> Besides being boring and poorly written, the reason why this movie is getting a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the movie has been stolen from another source. I understand the difference between a tribute and stealing: it was stealing. More importantly, it seems that the filmmakers are not stealing a point or moving the plot further. They just stole to show they could. There is literally no point in showing a clip from The Wizard of Oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie, except to set up another scene (which I am not going to expand) stealing from the same movie . Needless to say, every concept in the movie wasn't original or even a twist on an old concept: it was literally just a rehash of something I've seen, of pulp-era robots reminiscent of the old Superman Cartoons and the recent movie "The Iron Giant", to the silent warrior of the villain used in innumerable films, which in recent years as Darth Maul is recognizable in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. <br /> <br /> On the subject of the real movie, most of the performances were completely wood. Perhaps this is because the whole movie is done on a blue screen, with computing tools taking up everything except the actors. Frankly, it's no excuse for bad acting. If someone ever was a child, they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse not to try. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no humanity in this movie. The protagonists are the only true people here. Almost all the antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters shown during the movie can be counted on one hand. If robots are attacking the whole planet, don't we expect masses of humanity to run from them? The sub-parade of the main characters prevents us from connecting here and there. <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't the worst movie out there, so I didn't have a movie. The film was rather an example of everything wrong with modern action films: filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects, but without artistic vision or originality of any kind, it fell flat.
