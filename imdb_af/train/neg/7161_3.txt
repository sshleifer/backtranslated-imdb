A young American woman visits her Irish roots and knocks out a failing witch who owns her. Sounds interesting, but after an interesting start I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it's going. The movie seems to be in two directions dithering - do we look at the jobs of the Irish-American woman struggling with her alcohol problem or are we looking at a straight horrible movie about an evil witch coming back from the past? The director can't decide to decide. The two do not look gel and eventually you get nowhere. This can be done much better and the story seems to be dragging towards the end. It was boring and disappointing.
