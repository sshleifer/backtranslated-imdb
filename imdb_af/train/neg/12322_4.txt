As the general essence of these remarks seems to be, the movie has a beautiful animation (I saw it on blu-ray), but it really doesn't get the right depth. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters are all pretty Deaf. I have a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. But maybe my mind went astray and it was wishful thinking (Laputa is my favorite anim√©, original Engilsh dub). The characters are also not really fond of and, as mentioned in another post, they fall in love extremely quickly, leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected (she loves Agito, who seems unaware). However, she immediately seems to forgive Toola at the end without explaining the change of heart, otherwise it makes the end a little more "happy". <br /> <br /> There is also a serious shortage of explanation. Like who the druids really are? Are they people? and who are the strange women / girls who seem to be hanging out and running the bush? There is nothing to explain why they are there and how their regular people can give superpowers. The plants coming out of the moon still do not fill the spaces. It's almost like a strange version of The Day of the Triffids. <br /> <br /> Who calls Toola? Why doesn't it bother if it is not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to keep this movie, but I didn't find the plot as close as a movie like a Ghost in the Shell or any real character like that of Miyazaki. I don't do it again to look at it, but I had such a desire that I didn't buy it. My advice? Give it up if you save a few hours, but lend it, or buy it cheaply! Maybe if your new animation movies and not much of you are going to enjoy it. This is definitely visually pleasing.
