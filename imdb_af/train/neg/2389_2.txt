Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and freakishly big thumbs) riding in the country and eventually finding her place among a group of peyote-lit cowgirls on a ranch dedicated to preserving the creep cranes. Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant has corrected and modified Tom Robbins's book, but his satire has no primary target and just brilliant about the map, like Sissy (perhaps it was his purpose, but not for an audience). Notorious box office flop was not so heavily tuned in, as it is ignored, and one can see why: it is a series of sketches looking for a plot, and the performances, direct touch and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a sting along the highway trying to get a ride, but it brings the kibosh on Phoenix's career pretty much. Author Buck Henry (who did not write it, but might have) gives the most assured performance as a doctor working on one of those thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
