William Hurt dives scientifically ??? US agents carrying out the investigation abroad? The sick infected man kicks buttocks after he falls 20 feet on his back and runs away? Sniper is missing and not killed Hurt (just injuring him), but the second "dead" shot is dead? Waste of time. Comparing it to falling like other reviewers is ridiculous. Oh, and by the end of the movie they decide to wear gloves on their hands, except for the "evil" agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him the "handshake". What? VAT ... when did IMDb need 10 lines of text? I'm just chatting here. Does it not only dictate the content of the reviews if you need to have a number of lines?
