Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a huge safety point ....... these are the words to best describe this horrible movie. I love cute horror movies and I've seen hundreds. But it must have been the worst ever. The plot is paper-thin and ridiculous, the acting is an abomination, the script is completely laughable (the best is the final picture with the policeman and how he worked out who the killer is - it's just as badly written), the clothes are sick and funny in equal measure, the hair is big, many boobs bounce, men carry the cut tea shirts that protrude their stomachs (sickly that men actually wore them !!) and the music is just synthesizer tin playing over and over and over ... in almost every scene there are trashy music, boobs and paramedics taking bodies away ... and the gym is not yet close! Aside from all this, it's a very bad movie whose only charm looks back to the disaster of the 80's and has a good laugh at how bad it was.
