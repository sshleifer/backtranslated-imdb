Terrible, but mostly in the sense that it remains before I become 70. I saw it as a late night, repeated in 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but just). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a bit scary because he looks like he's been filled by a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux seems to have smoked all the beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby. It's a turkey that never had to be made. If you have insomnia and it is 1:30 on Saturday morning, and there is nothing but repetitions of the 1972 Roller Derby campsite, then I think it is beating it. But God helps you if it is your only choice for entertainment.
