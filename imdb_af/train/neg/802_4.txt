Like so many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seed of a very interesting social commentary. In the 5+ years since it was released, the premise was made less realistic by real world events in software development, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator, so I think ... The director is clearly a fan of Hitchcock, and it's too bad that the movie is not performing better, but in reality it's almost a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack that screams us when we need to pay attention. One can almost see the exclamation marks and capitals on a yellowing sheet. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have entertained it for all these reasons and much more. Sometimes the lick has less to offer, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for educational purposes. Oh yeah, and even though the seams showed and it was very cracked, my heartbeat went up and I was reluctant to get up and break.
