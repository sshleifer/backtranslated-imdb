I recently saw the Broadway revival of "Blithe Spirit" with Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson. It's a great production and shows what good actors can do with a game that is less than perfect. Angela Lansbury is extremely funny as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> It was probably a mistake to watch the movie version of the play Rex Harrison. The film does not have the energy or laughter of good stage production. <br /> <br /> "Blithe Spirit" is probably one of those plays that works better with a lively role in an audience full of people who come to laugh. The actors can improvise, touch and nude their performance and delivery of the lines, and involve the audience on a personal level that you can't find in a movie house, or with a DVD showing where the audience is separated. from the story through the "fourth wall." The story: Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in a home in the English countryside. Charles is looking for information for his next book, a book about supernatural trade, Charles Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, who plays her role from the original 1941 London production), a local spiritual medium, to his home. take a look. Charles believes that spiritism is a shame, but hopes to catch up on the tricks of the trade. But then Madame Arcati returns the ghost of Elvira (Kaye Hammond), Charles's first wife, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave and develops a spitting rival with Ruth over Charles (complicated by the fact that only Charles Elvira can see or hear). <br /> <br /> On stage, the actors offer performances that invite you to laugh in this situation. But on the screen the actors tear in "Blithe Spirit" through the lines as if they didn't know someone was listening to them. They mumble lines designed to laugh on stage. The performances of Harrison, Cummings, and even Kaye Hammond are flat and lifeless. Only Margaret Rutherford seems to retain her spark and humor as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> The Oscar-winning visual effects in the film are unimportant - not only to today's standards but to the standards of 1946! They consist mainly of Kaye Hammond who walks around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup, which is photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost. <br /> <br /> The movie artist earns some credit for creative lighting. But compare the dull visual effects of "Blithe Spirit" to the truly groundbreaking effects in Disney's "Song of the South" - which is eligible for awards that same year. In "South", people and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time. Compared to "South," the Oscar that the Blithe Spirit received for special effects is completely undeserved. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can only encourage you to catch the Broadway revival of this play with Angela Lansbury. it closes. As for the movie with Rex Harrison, it's over.
