I just saw this movie and I have to say that although there was a lot of trouble making a decent movie in the beginning, it was absolutely horrible - but not in the sense I meant. <br /> <br /> It was like a child who led this intelligence offense with the belief that everyone's viewers would be morons OR extremely difficult for entertainment or both .... Thank God for quick forward! I can't imagine how the viewer had the producer in mind when making this film. I mean, you tried actors to be serious, though scarce, and a script that cries for a total rewrite .... I just can't say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror movies, it would be a good effort. <br /> <br /> If you found this movie to be entertaining, I strongly suggest that you seek some guidance on the purpose of movies. There is much better rate out there. Join a Club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, avoid crap like this.
