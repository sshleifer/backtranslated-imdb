Well, I have to admit it was one of my favorites as a child when I watched it on a home projector as a super-8 line. Now there is not much to commend it, except that the inherent camp value of actors is "frightened" by replicas of human skulls. The special effects are pretty stupid, mostly consisting of skulls on wires and placed "ghost" images. <br /> <br /> But there's something to be said for the sets. The big mansion in which it takes place is pretty flu, especially since it is mostly unfurnished (probably due to budget reasons?). It definitely inspires more laughter than screams. Just try not to get the giggles if the woman (who screams more than her) goes into the greenhouse and confronts the ghost of her husband's ex.
