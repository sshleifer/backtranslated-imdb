The movie earns 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl (I'm sorry I'm biased, I think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies) and 0.5 for being shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 . seat. I was surprised that I could sit through it. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the pluses of the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. It's all there to save the whole movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, I'm sure most people (including me) wouldn't touch the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Now we can talk about the issues. First, it is really thin, with many repeated scenes. Areas of Nachi and Azumi hold back. It looks more like a drama of shooting. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks, as well as this movie. Secondly, the film is too unrealistic in a historical environment. I don't care for unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a bad way to show creativity, by throwing in ninjas like legs and spiders, etc. It reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a fantasy movie. In addition, in order to portray the role of the director, people roll people with blood (literally) around ... people who don't realize their heads are cut off ... etc. Etc. ... etc. Too much of this spoils the show. It seems the anime influence is strong in this movie. It greatly reduces the display. Thirdly, Azumi should not be an assassin. She looks more like a one-man army to me, just that she's a woman. I don't think you see murderers loading in lower camps. The only time I felt she had considered an assassin was when she killed the Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both movies. It is a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.
