The Good Earth may be the most boring movie I've seen in my life. The plot is slow and missing. The acting is borderline comics. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say I've seen a movie that doesn't do its true justice justice. The only saving grace I have found with this movie is the production value. Using hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very credible and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sell easily and were revolutionary at the time. Unlike the production value, I can't say much other things that are good or entertaining about this movie.
