Looking at CBS's "Surrender, Dorothy," I wonder why Diane Keaton wants to be in it (not because it is a television movie - with the lack of seductive roles for slightly older actresses, it's no wonder why Oscar artists like Keaton turns to TV - but because it offers no opportunity for Keaton to shine). A single mother who grieved the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter - and gradually became friends - was the group of young people her daughter was close to the accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters that one would cross the street to avoid. Apart from coarse and dull, these fake people are incredibly unconvincing, just like the neat scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the children live. (One young man, wearing muscular shirts to tell us he's gay, hears Diane Keaton, says: Overwhelm, Dorothy "and actually asks," This is from "The Wizard of Oz", right? "... no, Genius, it is from "Citizen Kane"!) Keaton may have based this material on the subject of confronting death, trying to turn this particularly unquestionable woman into a shadow of her own personality (very precious outfits ), but it does not keep up with the viewer, as Keaton was always hot and flexible in a flaming way, here she is a silly harp who does not learn many lessons on her journey of self-discovery (the movie soon forgets that is about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nerve wreck of a mother who is apparently an excessive hippie who has never lost anyone close to her. These are the kind of movie actors promoting on talk shows , with the proviso: "Many robbers should help mothers there." I can't imagine that t help someone because it is intrinsically a downer, confused and astounding. It's confused.
