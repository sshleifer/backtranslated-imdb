First, this movie wasn't that bad. It was entertaining ... at least for me, probably all the wrong reasons. I've never seen the original, so I can't compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of the weird Christopher Reeve movie village of the Verdde. The two movies have different tombs, but the horrible horror and unwanted comedy exist in both. <br /> <br /> The tone man is supposed to be a mystery / thriller / men don't make the women's movie angry. I don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his glorious bad self goes to a secluded island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long-lost fiance who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by other residents. <br /> <br /> Cage is a police officer and he is the tired policeman. He goes to the semi-unknown island and leaves no word of his whereabouts to anyone in the real world. Damn. <br /> <br /> Things get worse when the big Amish-esquire women who populate the island's island lie at him over the whereabouts of the missing girl. His fiancee is no help that seems to be elusive and tired all the time. Cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the happy man who has come to visit this island as a victim at the islands harvest festival. <br /> <br /> In this movie men don't perform well. A sickly twisted display of feminism? <br /> <br /> I sometimes laughed at the movie, especially if the cage was bumping some women and running around in a bear suit. I think there were too many pitfalls in this movie. I find the whole concept of evil women separating themselves on an island without giving men proper entertainment, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just strange. While most women have been hurt and angry, it is clearly a form of sexism. I would have been horrified if the rolls were reversed. This movie is something that can only be watched once or twice. It's not an excitement, it should be considered strange.
