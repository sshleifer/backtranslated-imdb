It has to be the stupidest movie I've ever seen (spoilers ahead)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The kid is strange and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker. We find that the child has a gift, the "Shining". This gift has nothing to do with anything except to make the child look. Then the movie becomes more boring and boring until the man finally gets mad. He goes on a rampage to kill the child and his wife because ... he feels that way. Why would he do it differently? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the bath. The man kisses her and realizes that he is kissing a dead body, which is completely disgusting. Somehow, a black man enters the hotel and is blown with an ax. Then the child and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies within minutes of hypothermia. Most movies are not a waste of time, but it falls right in that category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the end is very predictable, the storyline is slow, boring and boring. This movie is extremely overstated. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm surprised it got such a high rating on IMDb.
