Janeane Garofalo was well-known in her dissatisfaction with this film and called it anti-feminist. She also said on her radio program that she hates "romantic comedies" because she doesn't believe in them. I totally agree with Janeane here. This movie is at best a little thing. She does her best, but in general it was just another boring, amazing "romantic comedy" that has no basis in the real world. While there will be some who say, "Suspend your unbelief", you get tired of suspending it almost every time you get a romantic movie from Hollywood. Janeane's character is for some reason filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes her appear unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter colors (which Janeane probably deceived and probably one of the reasons she denies this movie) . It really hurts the movie if we have to buy the assumption that Janeane should be the better view of the two. As many have said here and on other commentary threads, Janeane is not ugly, but actually pretty. I didn't read one review where someone said Uma looked better. To say this, I believe that Ben Chaplin's character will stay with Uma more than likely, not Jana. Many men do not like really intelligent women (and many women do not like really intelligent men), and unfortunately Ben would probably have stayed with Uma. And despite the directors' effort to make Janea's unattractive, it doesn't work. Her natural beauty comes through anyway. <br /> <br /> I think many Janea's male supporters obsessed with her like this movie because they think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character and actually score with Janeane. Janea is much more complicated than the character she's playing here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower. This is the role that Janeane is best known for, and it is a pity, because it is not really good for a movie.
