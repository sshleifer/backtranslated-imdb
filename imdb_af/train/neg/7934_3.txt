A family going to their daughter's softball team decides to take the 'scenic route' and ends in the middle of nowhere. The father is an avid photographer, and when he hears of an old abandoned gathering in town, he decides to take another detour to take photos. <br /> <br /> Of course, the lace display is filled with inbred freaks, who immediately kidnap the women and leave the young boy and dad. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing about this movie is how the family is fighting against their vaccinated prisoners. Other than that, there is nothing worthwhile.
