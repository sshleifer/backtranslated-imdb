If an author gives himself 2 credits in front of the main title and starts about 15 more credits before the film, and the first shot shows the author rolling on a bed in lycra cycling shorts, it won't be a surprise to see that author has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex. The kind of appearance that can be useful for a homosexual aversion therapist. <br /> <br /> Others gave this thing the dishing it deserves. For me, the most spicy moment when the journey of LA was indicated by a plane that appeared to be inland. and the return was indicated by a shot of a Fedex cargo plane.
