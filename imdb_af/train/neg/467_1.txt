There are bad movies, horrible movies, even boring movies. I can look most and sit down to the end, not this time. Avoid it like the pest, annoying music throughout, terrible editing, no comedy, its smaller than a novelty mug. My wife wanted to look at this idea, it would be fair-haired material or something sort of visible but never better than average, movie for girls. It was the first time she had asked me to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> The girls, they weren't good at getting started (Denise did OK in Starship Troopers and Wild Things), but you sunk into the gravel. I feel like a cup that spent 30 minutes on it. Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognizable after many construction work on her face. <br /> <br /> Please avoid my advice if you want to avoid valuable oxygen and brain cells destroying ranting at the full time on your screen.
