I made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome. On paper, the author looks hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves one with hope. I had Pacino in the Fragrance of a Woman and saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other films of the 70's / 80's. But I forgot how important a part dialogue can play in a movie, and in this movie they are absolute ..... trash! The filming sites were also attractive, but the hopeless, pretentious and forced dialogues drew the whole thing to below zero. In addition, I'm pretty allergic to the world of motor sports and I find no interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in "Love Story" were better than those in this movie (and it says something!). I really expected this movie better and was very disappointed that I dropped so much.
