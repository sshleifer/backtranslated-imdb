If you've read the book - don't raise your hopes, if you don't, read it and never look at the movie. It's strange to learn that Toby Young was really involved in writing the script (as he claims himself in the book's writing). Because the film is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> What the movie seems to be - making a rather moving and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with simple funny sarcasm and simplifies it so everyone understands it - achieves it with perfection. The movie is full of bad and cheap jokes that are suitable for a sitcom, and has lost a meaningful message to it. <br /> <br /> You're better off not seeing it.
