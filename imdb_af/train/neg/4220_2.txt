A brief overview, but ... <br /> <br /> At all costs, avoid a thorough 90-minute waste. At the end of the movie I was not the wiser about what actually happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 seconds), the "Philadelphia" girls) and some vaguely recognizable people, but it just makes no sense. Whether the story just got lost in editing. I'm not doing it now, but jeez ... <br /> <br /> Put a DVD instead or sleep and rest! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for the cameos and a Morris Minor car hunt) <br /> <br />
