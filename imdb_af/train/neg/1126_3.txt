I hired this idea, it could be interesting, and it might have been an interesting story, except it was so uninteresting. Difficult to follow, strange editing, overarching storyline, mumbling the characters, all in a terrible boring waste of time. I just couldn't succeed and didn't mind what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm couldn't save this movie. Unless you need a cure for insomnia, I'll beat it. 3/10, and it's generous.
