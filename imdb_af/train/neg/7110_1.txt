Well, you have to give the director credit for how gutsy he was. Gutsy would be the right term. Not only did he use a total of five people (no extras at ALL), but he also decided to use special effects with a confusing and boring plot, too, and I didn't make a warning at the start the movie you can die of joy !!! However, they promise a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIINNNN. Having a creepy limping gardener is always a good move. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you look at Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen it. They like to show horrible movies just to let you know. <br /> <br /> A good gift for someone you hate.
