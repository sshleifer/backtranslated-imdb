Yes, unfortunately I got the DVD about this and found it to be incredibly terrible. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if some dork in an orange hat that calls himself 'Orange Sherbert' is the best creative idea, these guys can come for a character, then they should definitely not be in the movie. Poor "costumes", bad "interviews", and basically there isn't a "wrestler" on this whole slide with a little charisma. <br /> <br /> The "wrestling" in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully combined on a trampoline. They make sure they giggle all the time, so the experience looks more like a toddler's playing time as a "wrestling deathmatch". <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a beautiful, shiny Backyard Wrestling clone. Instead of blood, weapons, chaos and WRESTLING, we get a trampoline, giggling kids, DIFFERENT sound, and a man called Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> Wrestling fan or not, avoid this DVD. It's terrible.
