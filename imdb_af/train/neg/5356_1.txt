I'm sorry to say that this movie is indeed bad. It reminds me of a c-degree porn movie with one big difference: no porn. <br /> <br /> The story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul. Perhaps the bad act is not so obvious. At least the pacing should be picked up. <br /> <br /> While accepting that it has a low budget and the director has done a good job visually based on what little resources he has, he had to spend more time on the story or better yet , get someone else to write it. Many of the action scenes were just useless. <br /> <br /> It was a total waste of my time.
