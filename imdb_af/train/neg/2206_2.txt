A scientist on an island is deeply saddened by the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not change my dead boy in a hammerhead shark. Well, who wouldn't? It is a little difficult to deal with the fact that the hammer shark that kills everyone is constantly called Paul. Also, William Forsythe's role as a MacGyver kick-ass-rescue-day-type hero, has credibility. On the other hand, there are some hot chicks that make you actually look at the screen while shark Paul bites another one to death. In fact, I find bad b-movie pretty amusing. But for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for $ 1 million less. Then it might be fun.
