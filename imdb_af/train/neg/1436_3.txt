Oh, dear. Some of the best talent in British TV made this series, and so I can only assume they are working under incredible time pressure and for the first time they had to establish many scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some terrifying scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly when the "monster" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid I found most of the story unintentionally funny has! As the moment the hero discovers a dipped body on a golf course: Oh, look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand out there ... hmm it's a little riddle ... <br /> <br /> For many years, fans of British cult TV programs have advanced to release this series on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
