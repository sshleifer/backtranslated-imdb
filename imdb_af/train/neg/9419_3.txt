I have never heard of this, and then I realized it was the man with the deadly lens, of which I had heard, but not seen. Connery's presence drove me to buy it, and it's not good. It would be a kind of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it's just not funny unless you find the name General Wombat (?) Funny. It occurs as a flat 70-thriller to the last ten minutes when it comes to life. There are many, very flat scenes in the Whitehouse between the president and his assistants who do not work. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited to get the whole bomb bomb ransom story and the suicide bomber attacks, which I think should be meant to laugh, but again it's not funny. The location filming is excellent, but the studio looks like cheap TV. I couldn't believe the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did it. Just laughing: Connery throws his wig away before he lights his helmet and jumps out of a plane. It never says never again looks like genius.
