I read some positive reviews of this movie, and was really surprised at how terribly the whole thing was. Since there is a cross between an AIDS-related story and a kind of "Ghost" / Blithe Spirit "story, this movie can't always make the minds it wants. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an "open" relationship. Simon can have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants to. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon no longer look like sex. When Mark dies, Simon, who had a habit of ending his emotions after being rejected by his father years ago, tried to wipe out his memory and become a baccalaureus. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Markus returns in haunting form and foil his various trysts, while Simon Simon opens and acknowledges his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, it is impossible to feel any empathy for him for most of the movie. By the time he's supposed to be more sympathetic, it's too late to care. Mark, on the other hand, follows Demi Moore's footsteps of "Ghost," crying all over the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly, we get some lame efforts for humor, a lazy TV show "Bewitched." But it doesn't take long. As soon as Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing is becoming more and more mawkish, with amateur efforts to push your passion. The final, with a gilded muscle boy angel leading a tearing mark to heaven, while a chastised, sad Simon's farewell is just astonishing, mainly because it is not intentionally funny.
