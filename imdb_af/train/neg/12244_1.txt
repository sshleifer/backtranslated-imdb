This movie is terrible. The CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI. The crocodile looks like a big gray spot. The worst is that nothing is done to make it run or look alive. It is usually a photo-printed CGI that is placed in scenes and you almost see the hand moving the CGI spot across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen lots of the bad Sci-Fi Channel movies. <br /> <br /> Apart from the terrible lack of special effects, the cast has been the typical low-cost actors who probably work as winners / waiters at local dinners while waiting for their big break. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is trying to sexually attack Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight out of the water to the second floor of the Villains headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of scraping straight through the building and crushing Kate, the Croc just flies back into the same corner of the water. No laws of physics may apply to this movie or the special effects. There is at least an honor among crocodiles.
