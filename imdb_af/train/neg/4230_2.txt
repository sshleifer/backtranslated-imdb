Ok, I like B movies ... I know what B movies are supposed to suggest. But it's just terrible. I am surprised that it has achieved such a decent overall score. The only redeeming features of this movie are the (mostly) marginal splatter effects. Don't get me wrong, gore has plenty in this movie - but few effects really came out of me (like the anal "sin" ... it was wonderful!). <br /> <br /> I believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder. Come - pay at least a Betacam, I've seen porn with better production values ​​(and also better acting). <br /> <br /> Acting - sucked! But not in the Troma or Full Moon. <br /> <br /> Story - Faced! But that's what you get from movies like this. Very loose! <br /> <br /> Sets & Props - sucked! My 16 year old brother makes more extensive sets for our home on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Dubbing and dialogue - sucked! Scary voice action (I don't even call it) and every other word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are tons of good classic and B-rated horror / splashes out there and they're not that hard to find. Do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this shit!
