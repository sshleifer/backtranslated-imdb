I was attracted to this movie when I looked at the list, but after watching it, I must admit that I felt a little disappointed. The main problem with this movie is that actors can't keep this movie on their backs. Why? Due to bad writing. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones try hard to take this movie to another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too common. So for Matt Dillon fans, it's a viewable movie, just like admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always good, but it's not a movie for him; far below its level. So, if you are encouraged by this great throw, watch it but expect nothing great or extraordinary. The only thing you will remember about this movie is Diane Lane Screens; The rest of it is very forgetful.
