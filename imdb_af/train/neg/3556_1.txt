You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes works in a mid-speed movie instead of a full throttle, and "The Incubus" is a terribly worst-case scenario by a good actor who is moving go to pay the bills. . To see the hammy script and John Hough's 'baroque' art movement, he can hardly harm him. The film has something to do with a series of rape murders in a small town, mixed with supernatural lofts. In one way or another, the direction of excitement and interest in every scene is controlled, and Cassavetes looks visible. PO 'at times. The Incubus itself, which does not appear to be the last scene, is a well done creation, but it is not worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> 1/10
