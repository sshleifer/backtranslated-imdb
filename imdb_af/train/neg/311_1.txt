I just finished looking to go overboard. I have to say that we have to send every copy of this film to Iraq and let them see. I even tried to get a blind woman to see it and she turned it off like 20 minutes. Adam Sandler couldn't find a better project than this? As far as writing is concerned, if that is what you want to call, those responsible must be forced to see this movie forever in hell !! I believe somewhere I read that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and they were on their way. Did Wallmart get a good deal about it? Each store has a big big bin of this crap put on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a coaster or trade it to a friend, but then it's no longer your friend!
