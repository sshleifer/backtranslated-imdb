Fairly interesting exploitation in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The main actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and strangely appealing. She looks like a bad Renee Zellweer with a bad hair. This chick just made two of these movies and then retired to Texas. The music is terrible. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) with a different name. <br /> <br /> Best rule in the movie of Tony - "Put me up, pop? None of me did chicks me". Good B / W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good places (cool pool, also used in DE DEFILERS). Strange end but appropriate. A 4 out of 10. Best show Stacey Walker.
