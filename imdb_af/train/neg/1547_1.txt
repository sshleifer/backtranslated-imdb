I can call very funny movies. There are comedies that seem to be funny, and are. For example, some movies, such as a Gymkata, try to be serious, but eventually funny. The Womansman is a movie that desperately tries to be funny, but can be no less funny when it comes to a man who got many chicks in the middle of the wreck of a nuclear holocaust. It's anti-funny. <br /> <br /> I don't think I laughed harder than a chuckle on anything in this movie. It's just unfunny. It is boring, stupid, stupid, annoying, senseless, but not funny. I don't care about Tim Meadows, or this character of SNL, but I expected better than that. <br /> <br /> The movie is completely without logic or common sense. It's as if the writer had a bag over his head as he tapped and he couldn't see which keys he hit. They tell the "origin" of the Ladies' man, but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting, as it is still the seventies. The movie tries to get humor from a man who seems to have invited him to porn, shortly after trying to hang himself. It's comedy? I like to consider myself having a very good sense of humor (Spending a lot of time writing comedy like me), but maybe I'm just not quite clear enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, as funny as Tucker in There is something about Maria, is shamefully bad here. I pleaded with me in my head to keep. <br /> <br /> By the end I hit my chair, mumbled under my breath, and if the movie had gone longer, it would probably have committed suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've seen that came close. <br /> <br />
