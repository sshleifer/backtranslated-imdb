I wanted to read the other comments before I leave my review and the majority definitely decide: This movie is awesome! From acting to non-realistic animation to countless mistakes. I actually hoped the flaps would be prolonged with the imagination of the imagination (can't extend the valves without motors). The landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity. That little little fan that was going on was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear. The one thing I thought was quite strange. When they landed, the rear wheels cut off and then the nose broke, putting the airplane with both rear tires in the air. How did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that did not touch the ground? Did they forget the destroyers? Word to the director: Find out * everything * you can about planes before trying an "airplane" movie. Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10.
