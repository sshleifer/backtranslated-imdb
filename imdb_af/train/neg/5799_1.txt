I rented this movie yesterday, mostly because of the beautiful art and the summary given on the back of the jacket. After I hit it in my DVD player, I re-examined the jacket and although I got the cover of the plastic viewer, I couldn't read any of the production details of the movie. This movie is titled Evil on the Jacket and had to find it by visiting the Faith Films website to find any connection on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Filming and special effects made in the movie look pretty good. ... DAN spoke a line-reading actor. Oh, honey ... this actor's reading sounded like an excellent high-school jock whose voice just managed to change, and gave no attempt to go beyond reading the lines of the script . I initially thought I had a bad slide out of the audio synchronization, and then I had to suspect it was a strange movie, as I couldn't read the jacket. If they threw the right person to double the dialogue, this movie was fair. I gave it a chance about 20 minutes before I wiped it out. When I discovered, the bad line reader was not killed, but stayed as the chapter chapter. Yes, it's so bad! The jacket art and the art made in the film are wonderful, so the one star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rogue dialogue. I do not recommend this one!
