This movie earns credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic storytelling. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The biggest weakness of the films is that it is unwilling to commit anything; it has camp, moral and epic elements without ever committing to any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes is in the grave turning to this horrible adaptation that changes the sweet, unbearably innocent Percival into a very unpleasant and rude churl. <br /> <br /> Probably two kinds of people will see it, frankofil or Arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the latter, I found the movie uncompromising and an incredibly loose, irreverent treat of a beautiful story.
