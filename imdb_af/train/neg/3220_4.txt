I absolutely hate it if a movie falls completely apart after investing in it for an hour. And that's what happened to this movie. I was intrigued by his actors and the fact that malamud wrote his source story. I didn't read that story, but I don't think it ends like this movie ends. Luckily I didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it. ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting (especially the woman was so perfect). But mileage as a Jew? !!!! now it was funny. I didn't investigate it, but it played as the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the movie. Before that, a story and characters developed, there were a number of nice plot points and there wasn't too much time wasted. But oh that last 1/2 hour - if it wasn't the worst, most worthless denial I ever saw, I don't know what it is. I just hate it if your faith is so devastated; It feels like an act of violence.
