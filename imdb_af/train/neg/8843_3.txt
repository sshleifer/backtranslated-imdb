This film is indeed very creepy. Unfortunately, not for the reasons the filmmakers hope. <br /> <br /> There is also a mastermind serial killer, but he is also not creepy. He is just your standard comic book villain, a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Kruger, but with nothing very fresh to add too. Incidentally, for even the farthest and most reprehensible of criminals, they can be trapped in a stressed position, on their feet, arms stretched out 24 hours a day during the week? I suspect in the world that we gave Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay anything is possible. <br /> <br /> No, what's very creepy about this movie is the central character, Danny. This unpleasant young man, who is helped and true by some ridiculous lax security arrangements and a doctor who is totally indifferent to any understanding of professional ethics or patient confidentiality, goes astray in the hospital room which is being described as only a highly vulnerable and defenseless young woman, and by no means whatsoever (her chronic sleep includes giving anything like informed consent), suggests that she has a special relationship with her. <br /> <br /> Apparently within days he has deprived himself of evading, believing (totally fake, as we discover) that he can look after her better than anyone else, and within minutes of her back to his apartment, sexually molesting her even though she is due to her sleepiness) she is completely unable to give or resist permission. <br /> <br /> Our suspicions of feeling this connection are soon to be confirmed. Of course, he is more or less unable to form any adult friendship, let alone sexual relationships, and therefore it falls back on this essentially advanced woman, who, due to her permanent sleep, has a spiritual age that is similar to a lived experience of just a few years. The scene where she discovers the ice cream is especially circular, and the concise knowledge she gives him when he says he must clean her again, causes a horror horror. But again, I'm scared, not the horror of the horror that the filmmakers are hoping for, but a much more straightforward speed of dislike. We can all see clearly what is at the end of our forks here - it's the perfect pedophile's dream of innocence, sexual fulfillment and total dependence. Terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> What else do we have in this mish mash? Turned dream provinces not as good as del Toro. The compulsory "You need to go to the police" argument, where the main character always has a reason not to do so, even if it is the only sensible path. The automatic sequence, highly praised in the comments here, but completely and completely useless ("It serves no function!", As Sigourney Weaver memorably protests in Galaxy Quest) and looks at me just like the horrible doctor Phibes in one of the saw derivatives . <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Combs does his best, but a star and a few, because you need to keep lower rankings for movies that are worse than this and in general it's well done and skillfully executed. .
