I grew up to watch the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the band is wearing a little. <br /> <br /> I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was on TV and I could see it. <br /> <br /> I needed to know better. <br /> <br /> This movie joins the club of movie followers who just had to be left. It holds absolutely NO of the original super charm! It seems to me, very rough and almost brutal, right from the (not) sing-a-longs to the characterization. <br /> <br /> While I remember the character telling a story through a song, this movie's soundtrack was over the top and didn't seem to fit. Jaq's transformation in man is a good example: Where he walks around to eat an apple and add a few little ones here and there, he had to dance and sing about how big it was to be long! And in the ballroom there is an old barn dance-type country music. It's as if the writers have forgotten where and when this story is set. The optimistic fiddles certainly didn't fit. <br /> <br /> Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 is not too cramped with the original. The artwork in this movie looks pretty raw and less detailed. And we see part of Cinderella's hoop, which doesn't feel right. <br /> <br /> The movie itself could have been its own story, I think it should be just like that. I won't say I hate it, but I believe it has many shortcomings. It seems to be significantly downgraded from the beloved Cinderella original.
