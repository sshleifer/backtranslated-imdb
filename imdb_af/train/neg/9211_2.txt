This movie reminds me of the anti-drug films of the 50's and 60's due to the fact that it was made by people who, of course, never experienced the social evil they warned us about. Tom Hanks and his friends are "role players", but there is no dice, lots of candles, and then you are only carried away in a bad fitting. He shows that Hanks falls for the woman in the group. pretty funny but wrong. I wonder how many poor children destroyed their D&D stuff, and they said the use of their imagination was the way to destruction. As a movie, it's basically a post-school special, bad play (although Hanks does show his talent) and relationship talks, and no one seems to have fun. These movies seem to have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adulthood. It is more serious and believes that you have to bend and do what everyone else does. Despite my 2 vote, it's worth watching because of its unique genre, horror movies, which I personally find pretty funny.
