"Smokey And The Bandit" wasn't exactly Shakespeare, but nobody wanted it. It was a low, but it had brain. It had a very clever script with definable characters and a fun wrap-up. People got out of the theater. "Hooper" does not offer any of this. There is no reason to smile. If it is supposed to be a tribute to the Hollywood stuntman, it seems to be extremely lazy by giving nothing but bad choreographed combat scenes and one of the most compelling leaps I have ever seen. It almost seems foolish, badly filmed. Poor Sally Field (if the girl wearing her hands on the sidelines) is given her worst role, with no single funny or clever line ("If you do that jump, I won't be here if you come back") . Burt Reynolds looks at the camera and looks, but the joke is on any audience sitting by Hooper. * of ****
