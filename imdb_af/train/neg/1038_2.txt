Increasing Victory Vargas is just a bad movie. No amount of denial or ad dollar supports publicity with this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Peter Sollett saw that he didn't have the money to make the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad movie cynically the principles of the current "edgy film-making" monkey. Maybe he just doesn't know better. It's hard to tell. <br /> <br /> What is not hard to tell is the result. Except for some viewers who will intellectualise the bad films in pseudo-realism, few will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I know I didn't. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and give this movie.
