I was so excited when I discovered it was available! I couldn't wait to see it. What a waste of energy! These are some of your favorite tire CDs that you found in the back of the rack at your local music store. As a hard core fan, you were sure it was a valuable discovery. But as soon as you heard it, it became clear why these dogs never made it to a real album. This DVD is only recommended for completionists who have to do everything Lynch has done. "Six Men Getting Sick" is somewhat visually interesting, but short and repetitive. It lacks the power of Lynch's later work, "The Grandmother" is simply an immature job. It's boring and looks like a student video. But it was the 70's ... It's just interesting if you want to psychoanalyze the director. But you can see the seeds of some of its brands images and sounds briefly. "The Alpahabet" is forgotten. (No, really! I can't remember the one!) The official is useless. "The Cowboy and the Frenchman" are just stupid. "Lumiere" is the only one in the crowd. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing story that is comparable to his best work. I had to look at this one a few times. But it takes less than 2 minutes. It's hardly worth the DVD to rent or buy.
