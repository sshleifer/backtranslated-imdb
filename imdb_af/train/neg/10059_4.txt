I expected a documentary focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I looked at a man based on the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family. And it went on and on. As Mr. McElwee's family dominated the Dukes, I doubt that Mr. McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwee's family started the tobacco business; I expected more than McEwee's ongoing focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the consequences for the state's economy through stricter tobacco regulation. The many references to the movie "Bright Leaves" are out of place - so, when Gary Cooper played McElwee's grandfather? Does the viewer understand the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by displaying old film shows of a fictional movie? I didn't.
