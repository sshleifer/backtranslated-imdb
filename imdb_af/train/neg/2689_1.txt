Now, I'm not a film critic, but I really hated '11 September '. This film was bad on a general basis. With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu's segment, which was the most effective and direct on the subject, the short films were at best boring, and in the worst offensive. The worst thing in my mind was Youssef Chahine's predictive segment comparing Palestinian suicide bombers to US soldiers, even as far as saying suicide bombers are fighting for a bigger cause. The segment was completely out of the subject and, seen Chahine's apparent lack of decency whatsoever, a waste of time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie with their view on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was tasteless.
