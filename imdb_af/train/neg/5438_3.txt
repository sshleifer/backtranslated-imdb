I'm a fan of novelist / writer Michael Chabon. His novel Wonder Boys became a fantastic film by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years back and he had a hand in the Spider Man 2 screenplay. It's probably the biggest cartoon movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Director Rawson Marshall Thurber also released wonderful comedic pieces, such as the dodgeball and the genius short movie series "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And with a role that Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari include, it looks like a no-brainer. <br /> <br /> This is. Literally. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster stars as Art Bechstein, the son of a gangster (Nolte) who recently graduated with a degree in Economics. Jon is in a state of arrested development: he works a minimum wage job at Book Barn, has a fleeting relationship with his girlfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), making up over large amounts of sex, with no other plans as to cut away in a career for which he has no passion. <br /> <br /> One night at a party, a former roommate Jon puts on Jane (Miller), a beautiful, smart violinist. Later that night they went out for cake, and she asked Jon a question that turned him away from his catatonic existence: "I want you to tell me something you've never told a single soul. If you Doing so will make this night indelible. "Then Jon told her a repetitive dream of wandering over the village and looking at the faces of strangers passing him, but no one saw him in sight. "I think it should be dead," he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, Jane's wild boyfriend Cleveland (Saarsgard) deprives Jon of the job and takes him to a hollow abandoned steel factory. Jon, Cleveland and Jane spend every waking moment together at punk rock concerts, drinking drugs and drinking lots of alcohol. It's not good with Phlox, pushing Jon for a more personal relationship, that she meets her new friends and father. The attempt then tries to take us on Jonah's journey, as he turns off the chains imposed on him by his father, Phlox and his death career. He finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem following Jon through the movie: he is completely uninteresting. He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He walks through life like the invisible wrap he describes to Jane the night they meet. In the beginning it is not a problem. But he never gets any more interesting. He is a completely passive character. He simply follows the bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never gives us what he cares or wants to do. <br /> <br /> Consequently, the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and do a little bit different from partying, having sex and getting arguments. In other words, many ado nothing. What we have here is the plain skin of a good movie without anything inside. Demanding cinematography, quirky voice over with distant characters, many sex scenes, both straight and gay, great arguments, more angry sex, a chase and a tragic death ... but it doesn't seem important . Ironically, at one point, Jane, confused with some of Jon's aimless actions, asks him, "What's going on, Jon? What is it about?" Yes, Jon, tell it. We are also dead in the audience to know. <br /> <br /> The title "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" must refer to the characters themselves, because that is what they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional stand-ins for real people. The film never lets us in. We never know what makes any of them. We see they do a lot of things, but we don't know why. And the absence of "why" is one of the worst things a movie can have.
