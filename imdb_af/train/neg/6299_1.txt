This improper adaptation of probably one of Martin Amis's weaker novels fails to even make comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as Requiem For A Dream or something written by Irvine Walsh because it struggles to decide whether it's a slapstick story or a hyperrealistic hallucination. <br /> <br /> Compiled by William Marsh in supersaturated colors, a group of public school dropouts come together in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three American friends for a weekend of decadent drugs. And that's it. Except for the ridiculous subplot that is soon impossible over an extremist cult group expressing itself with the violent murders of the world's elite figures, whether political or pampered. Within the first line, you know exactly where it is going. <br /> <br /> What is a talented actor like Paul Bettany in this tiring, badly written drill? Made before his rise to glory and Jennifer Connelly one can be assured that he is being offered this garbage, now he would have immediately changed agents! Avoid.
