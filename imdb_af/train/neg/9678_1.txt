It's a pity to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although it was visually fascinating (eg the use of color was absolutely stunning), it was rather dull and disturbing (see the father / boy choir). <br /> <br /> What's more, music is completely absent, and if you think of those wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenaway's movies), then you can imagine how ' make a difference. <br /> <br />
