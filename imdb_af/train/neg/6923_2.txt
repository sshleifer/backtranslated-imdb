Absolutely horrible Mexican film that is supposedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a newcomer who wants to go into the boundaries of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc. ... As our hero, Gaston, is following the big show by dr. Maillard, head of the asylum, sees all sorts of things that are supposed to be terrible, such as men who hang long in a dungeon, and comic, as our hero is joked by soldiers as he climbs a ladder over off a building. Then there is one eye that may have been both meant: a man dressed as a chicken, yes, it is right to make a chicken that falls to the ground for the chicken. The scene was to be a comical highlight of the movie, but at least it was the lowest point of the movie and really the biggest uprising when you thought the grown men and women thought it might even be entertaining . Oh! It is indeed the real horror that dr. Tarr and his legion of name changes are. And this brings me to this important fact about the movie that is the most movie that undergoes various title changes, usually a serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems and others, one of them, have many title changes so someone can buy the same garbage more than once. This is definitely garbage. It's very little for it. The only artist worth watching is Claudio Brook as head of the asylum. He is one big slice ham while he maniacally, bellows orders, sashays with sword in hand and the chicken price. I got so tired of hearing him talk about the "soothing system" as his way of healing the mental illness. What a lot of ludicrosity (Hey, a movie like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word). It won't take you long to find out what's going on in the asylum, and it won't be interesting anymore. Cinematic chicken scratch!
