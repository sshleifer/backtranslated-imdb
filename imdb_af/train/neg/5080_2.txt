This is a review of the Wizard, not confused with The Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. The wizard is a late eighties film about a seriously silent boy's ability to play and run video games throughout the opening credit. The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that man who has tied up 100 straws and drank a little from the beer. <br /> <br /> Now that we've got it all. Out of the way, let me say it: there really is no reason to see this movie. It's just a 100 minute Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the Powerglove, Legend or Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "design" in the slightest sense, as it seems this movie has been written over a weekend by a cracking team of people who have never played Nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of style like my grandmother. Perhaps if the writer and director sit down and actually play, they would realize that they are about to film total rubbish and rather go to vocational school to learn how to install car gears. <br /> <br /> I hope this is an enlightening experience for you. It certainly wasn't for me. In fact, I think I could have lost some braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you are at the video store and you see The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz, everyone is sitting on the shelf in a nice little drive, giving them all a miss and playing Duck Hunt.
