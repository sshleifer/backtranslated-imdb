I'm usually not one who wants to move a movie. I'm trying to see the good points and not the bad focus, but in this case there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you are going to make something so bad, why bother? Part of the movie is shaking Anne's face while she is deeply breathing, playing violin music in the background. The other part is filled with arm and woodworking. Rupert Penry Jones is expressionless. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister in modern ways. Anne is depicted as gentle and self-indulgent. It's good in the beginning, but she stays the same through the movie, and you see no reason for Captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. Overall production has no sense of time, with too many mistakes to be overlooked, such as walking out of the concert, kissing in the street, walking around in the streets without hatching (why was this scene in the movie not at all? The scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written.) To sum it up, a terrible movie, very disappointing.
