This is the kind of movie you regret in your video recorder. This is a strange bad version of the Stephen King movie "Misery (1990)". I can't understand how this movie got a 5.2 score because it has no story like that ever, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved. <br /> <br /> This movie had to be released as a short film. Instead, much time is spent on the same thing. And, as in every bad movie, everything just happens at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minute duration. <br /> <br /> So, before you decide to watch this movie, make sure you have a few new batteries in your remote, because you're going to go ahead a lot ... don't worry, you won't lost important.
