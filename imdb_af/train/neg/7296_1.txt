Columbo movies have been downhill for years, this year it may have reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and gets so dirty in this movie. As usual in this series, crime scene protocols are unheard of, so there is not always likelihood. Brenda Vaccaro chews the landscape and pulls pantomime faces and Andrew Stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady's husband. (However, his faint was a hoot!) The script was condescending by the numbers and his delivery. They never had to bring Columbo in the nineties. We all left us with one or two happy memories of smart sites, better scripts and sharp characterizations.
