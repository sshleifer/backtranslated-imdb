This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you can't base a whole movie on it! <br /> <br /> The characters are stereotyped, there is no real story - but short episodes with freaky characters, which are not freaky enough to really make the plot. <br /> <br /> Shame because most of the actors in Hungary are recognized, a mystery why they took the roles. <br /> <br /> This is * not a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring, though it was actually or unique. They could have tried much harder than this ... 2 out of 10
