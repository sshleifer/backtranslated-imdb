Last night I finally went to television to starlight and all I can say is. . . Wow! It's hard to know where to start - the amazing hokey special effects (watch out from the laser beam shooting from Willie's eyes!), The horrific action, the poignant dialogue, the improper use of stock or the air of much pretense mix the whole production. It is truly a one-of-a-kind experience, and we should all be grateful. I nominate Jonathon Kay as the true heir to Ed Wood!
