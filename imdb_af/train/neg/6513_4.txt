I'd rather have 20 root channels than going through this movie again. The prince of Annoying, Myles Berkowitz, wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo-cool. The only amusing thing in this whole mess is Mr. Samaha's silly camera tits and ass counter. Berkowitz takes a good concept and grinds it into the dust. It is messy and badly done, in an apparent effort to look funny or funny. Nor is it. I rarely feel that a movie is a waste of film (or tape), but one qualifies for that distinction. If a date suggests watching this movie, run.
