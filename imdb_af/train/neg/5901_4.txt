Something to sing was produced at the Grand National Studios where James Cagney works during a contract dispute with Warner's brothers. He had two films for this B studio, and not one of the highest in the Cagney credits. <br /> <br /> One of the big losses for cinema is the fact that Jimmy Cagney did so few films that used his immense dance abilities. . The two who immediately come to mind are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two smaller films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Everything Small. Cagney himself said he never got used to his musicals in retirement. So why did he make so few of them? <br /> <br /> Well, this one was wrong. The plot of Something to sing relates to a hayloft that is in front of a group who discovered and gave a movie contract. There are the usual complications of a fucking studio boss and a fast-paced press agent, respectively, played well by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract calls for a marriage contract, so Cagney and the girl's singer, Evelyn Daw, are secretly married. Then we get the complication of a publicity-driven studio romance with the screen leader Mona Barrie. I think you can see where it is going. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing about singing is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. He dances briefly at the beginning and end of the film and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a nice singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich. She had the music numbers like them. I'm sure the movie audience pays their tickets to see Cagney dance. <br /> <br /> In addition to giving him dance numbers, a female dance partner would have been nice. He played well with Ruby Keeler in Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day in The West Point Story. Was Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler not available? <br /> <br /> No memorable songs came out of it. And Daw's voice is also dragged. She has a Jeanette MacDonald soprano voice that was so distorted with a sway. <br /> <br /> No wonder Cagney returned to Warner Brothers. But they had to give him decent music.
