How can there be so much corrupt police without any of them moving up? With enough police to make a mini-war that includes such weapons as flamethrowers, you'd think they'd been caught before someone wrote for a weekly coupon newspaper, heard someone telling a fraudulent cop. <br /> <br /> You'll never get your 90ish minutes back. Life is too precious to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the big names of actors who made the mistake of making this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Justin Timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. He has a very important role to play, so fans may enjoy seeing him. <br /> <br /> However, I believe most of his fans are young girls who may be fired by the violence in this movie.
