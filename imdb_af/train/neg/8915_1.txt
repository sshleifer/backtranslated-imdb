My comment on this movie was deleted twice, which I find quite offensive, as I try to judge this movie for others. Please be tolerant of other people's opinion. Obviously, the writing of Niezsches' works is not understood, so my comments change completely. <br /> <br /> I think it's a very bad movie for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Topic: One must be very careful to make a film about a philosopher that is not yet understood by the masses, and among peers bring passionate discussions. One thing philosophers agree is that Nietzsche was a good thinker. Such a film about his life, which of course includes his ideas, is one thing that one has to be very careful about, or preferably not at all. Wisdom begins by knowing what you do not know. One thinks it's not a review of the movie itself, but the movie isn't about an imaginary character. It's about the life of someone who actually lived and has great influence on the world of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my thoughts on the story itself, but also on the chosen subject, the tomato. There is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about real facts. Special in such a case and this responsibility has not been taken. <br /> <br /> Screenplay: One of the first things I noticed was the ridiculous accents. Why? This leads to what it is all about; Nietzsche and the truths he found. It doesn't help to put things in a real geographic perspective or time! Come on, make it pretty English or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson did that part ... let his characters speak a capricious Aramaic into the Passion. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is well overworked. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not an actor to portray Nietzsche. Bad decisive. <br /> <br /> 4th facts are far away. <br /> <br /> And so on. This is a waste of celluloid.
