Although many people praise this movie, I have to warn you. It has no logic whatsoever. I think Basinger is doing a decent job, but you can't be excited if there is a big lack of realism. <br /> <br /> This scene paints a good picture for you from the movie: while Basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and look at a photo she finds out of her pocket. The photo is from her daughter and it reads "we love your mom". Who does this? What the eff? And believe me when I say it's not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie. Someone said it was a "hidden gem". Well, I have to disagree completely, this movie has been hidden for a reason. And it's not a jewel. Oh, and please, I don't even want to start commenting on the red cabinet. It hurts my brain: D Usually, the lack of logic does not disturb me when it is in small quantities, but this movie is basically only possible due to the lack of logic. But, I still give it a 4, because although it is scandalously lacking in logic, it has some mood that made me look to the end. <br /> <br /> So if you choose to see it, you know you've been warned.
