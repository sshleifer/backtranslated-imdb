One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting was terrible, both for the children and the adults. Most of all characters have shown no, little or not enough emotion. The lighting was terrible, and there was too much mess about the time of the day the film was shot. In the river scene where they just ruined their boat, there were 4 shots: The sheriff and Dad in the evening on their boat, Jillian and Molly at night, the rest of the children in the day * when in the evening * at the riverbank, and doctor, Beatrice and Simonton, but not at night from their boat. ) The best play in the movie was probably from the sheriff, Cappy (Although there is a loss of character when the pulse sensor * Whatever, when people die, it shows * Cappy is dead, he still moves while it can still be crying while the nurse manually checks his wrist, then it shows the pulse again, and then he finally ends.) I think it won't be perfect, as it is an independent movie, but it can still be better. Not worth watching, honestly, even for kids. Also look good, like The Lion King or Toy Story, if you want to see something you will remember.
