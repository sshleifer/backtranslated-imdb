I can't really think of any redeeming features of this totally bad version on Asimov as the art. Forget about the product placement disaster, the unconvincing performance of Will Smith and the gigantic plot holes. It was not only fun and painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mixture of MTV has inspired production values ​​and is likely to target very small children in very poor dialogue. <br /> <br /> What a shame that sci-fi can still be made after our Bladerunner, Minority Report or, to a lesser extent, Dark City (by the same director). This one really belongs to the bottom 100 list. Actually terrible.
