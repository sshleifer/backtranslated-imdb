Where was his criticism of both democratic administrations and republicans? He has served in a governmental body for 17+ years, where his influence was unshakable. Oh, I forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the Most Powerful people on earth. The movie is fortunate to show shots from a young Senator Gore and asks why a NASA scientist was forced to make a conclusion in his scientific paper, but he does not ask about Clinton / Gore's complication in warming up. not the earth. Probably too close to an election year, or maybe it will hamper the chances for Hillary in '8. Anyway, he is a political coward and some man to the bitter end. He does not criticize consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, and it is not the history of industrial development that we have led to this moment. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie was much more about Mr. Geer himself as to any real problems facing our environment. Mr. Gore if you really want to make a campaign movie - shorten it and call it what it really is.
