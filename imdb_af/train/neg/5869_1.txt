It's almost 30 years old, and I hate everyone involved in this movie. It remains the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before I saw it, I never thought of Rivers. After watching this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see her on television. <br /> <br /> By this I dragged - against my better judgment - through peer pressure. But from the theater, those friends take an oath to never again persuade my choice of the movie. Almost thirty years later, we still carry spiritual scars from this movie. <br /> <br /> On my deathbed, one of my spits will be the time I wasted with the hope that this movie could get better. <br /> <br /> If you're ever given a choice, you prefer to put out your own eyes to put this movie. <br /> <br /> I registered for IMDb comment only in the I hope I might warn others about reading this movie. If I can only save one person to not see it, then my existence on this earth is justified.
