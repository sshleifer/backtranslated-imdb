Improper with a capital "A". It should be one of, if not THE, indecent on television. I'm like anti-forest as it gets, but this show doesn't even get a break from me. What you think of Bush as president, has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you want this crap show. The "jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene when lilbos has his underwear on his head: "Welcome to camp al-qa-eeda!". There is nothing funny about it. Should it even be joke? The advertisements that were in the weeks leading up to the scene were funnier than the show itself, and it's just sad. Hopefully it won't even be considered for a second season. It should not even have had a first.
