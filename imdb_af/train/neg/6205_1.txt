So they raped the violence and it's badly branded. Well, the violence is the best I am afraid of, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to make us understand why they are on their (completely predictable) rampage. This movie has a really terrible script. We never get to know Robert and his actions at the end are just pathetic. The acting is not much better, or the worst of them is the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is clumsy, the pass enough to make you sleep. And on earth is the school film project? A comment about the movie itself? The use of the news rule during the climate murder is ridiculous. These guys obviously believe they are intellectual, but are hopelessly out of their depth. How on earth they have the great Yorgos Arvanitis to light it, I will never know. And how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even bigger secret. Quite awfully mental.
