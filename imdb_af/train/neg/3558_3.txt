Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) is a breastfeeding breast, but that's not it. <br /> <br /> Although not lacking in violence, it has no narrative sensitivity and characters. <br /> <br /> The title "Incubus" is a demon equipped with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vagina during assembly - or to be more accurate rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, moonlighted by his successful government career, is convincing as a doctor investigating the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> Terrible possibilities of the victims mocking demonic offspring are not considered - nor is the audience's tolerance for slow-moving garbage. <br /> <br /> The script's reluctance to explore the dramatic effects of a fertile prospect illustrates the major problems with this volatile Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise.
