Man I must say when I saw the trailer I was excited. Futuristic soldiers, taking on a bad ass Vampires led by genre veterinarian Michael Ironside .... In space. I mean, I didn't expect high art, but it looked like a potential B movie classic. It was undoubtedly a TV pilot, who was later ruined in a feature film, after not being picked up. Well, I started with the movies some good points, the action was capable of a lower budgeted movie, and the CGI and locations used were sensible. Now on the bad, first of Michael Ironside was barley in it, and his performance here .... well, it wasn't that good. But as I said, he wasn't in it at all, so I can't blame him. One thing that was really stupid was the PETA-type group for Vampires, no, I'm not joking, it's the foolish amazing thing I've ever seen and it's taken seriously. Also this film links one of the great B-movie sins, it puts a lesbian scene, and does not deliver. Most of all this film sinks does not really happen. Since it was meant to be a pilot, the writing is almost inconsistent and does not have a regular end. Even the greatest villains come to an end. If ever a movie is needed to improve the Sleaze and Gore factor, it's Vampire Wars. Eventually I will tell the main staff on the spaceship, all were very competent actors and could put this mess very well behind them and move on to bigger and better things. They just had nothing to work with here.
