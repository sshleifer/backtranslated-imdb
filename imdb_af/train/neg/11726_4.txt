Wesley Snipes is James Dial, a killer, agent of the CIA and a purely bad-ass special operative. During his spare time, Dial makes a cowboy hat and breaks horses with macho names like Beauty. <br /> <br /> Fill in Agent Collins, his supervisor. Enter a new mission - kill a terrorist who is in British custody. Of course, the United Kingdom is an allied state a good place for secrets and shots outside the courtroom. <br /> <br /> The murder is a great success, apart from the fact that the escape plan has blown. So Dial's partner and local liaison is murdered in action, trying to escape the police, while Dial becomes hot property with the London hairdressers trying to get him and CIA tries to dispose of him. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dial the Safe House is frequently visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who likes to hang out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and to help them escape the evil British law enforcement ... <br /> <br /> With such a script I have to say more? On the positive side, Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be it a pro or a concert) and the movie is pretty interesting. On the minus editing it is very diverse and the stomach has an effect on the stomach.
