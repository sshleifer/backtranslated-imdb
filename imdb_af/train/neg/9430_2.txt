I was also deceived by the packaging. I also fell for the gory packaging and the DVD case claiming "grieved fans as each copy was pulled out of shelves". Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it wasn't really worth it - no frightening and very limited gore. The end was very cheesy and didn't deliver the punch it had. I really don't even know how it became a "Video Nasty" with how soft it is. The story dragged, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... it doesn't meet the promise. The DVD bonus feature (the "maintenance") is very strange, as the director looks very incoherent and not all there. The main actress speaks as she appears in a Shakespeare production. It's a good laugh.
