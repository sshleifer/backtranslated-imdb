This movie is mostly chases and special effects. It is very poor on plot. Most of the computer talks were just mumbo jumbo. I watched it because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie, which was mostly based on computer factors and actual computer terminology. This movie had nothing of it. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and very unrealistic of real computers and networks, but rather lame. This is as it was written by someone who has no understanding of real computers. <br /> <br /> The ripley game was lame and was just an arcade game. No real burglary, so what was the point? Movie was boring. Lame continued.
