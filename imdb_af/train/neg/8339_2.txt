This movie just goes around in circles, and the viewer doesn't know where they are. Initially I thought ..mmmmm, it could be a good movie, but it just drag on and off, and eventually you don't know what's going on. The main female is a good actress and has played her role well, and the psychophella is creepy, but after a while you don't really care about what is happening, because this movie just goes on. Shame really, it could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Saying that the main female and psycho will have a good career ahead of them, but they will remember this movie because they make it known, or for the film they regret, they have ever made.
