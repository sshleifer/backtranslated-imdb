I would be honest - the reason I rented this movie was because I am a big fan of Kyle Chandler's (especially from the early edition). Since he usually plays the good guy, I wanted to see him as in another role (out of curiosity). The plot itself also brought me in; A will-be hit (Tony Greco -a.a. Chandler) has to kill one at random before he has confidence in life - or rather the death of a witness who will witness in the family. The movies were nothing like I expected. It was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, you would know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically - it was dirty and made little sense. Yes, it was a mob movie, and yes, the guns are going to BOOM. But there's more to a movie than that. This film acted like it didn't have time to go into detail. Just handle it and understand it. The play made it really - James Belushi was almost amusing as "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel look credible as she could. She surprised me most. And Kyle Chandler was as convincing as an anxious newcomer to the "family". If only the author was entitled to the actors.
