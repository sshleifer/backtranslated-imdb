I found Tremors 4: The legend begins, becomes boring and boring. All the action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" is reduced to the size of a modern home cat, if not smaller. The scene was horrible, and this movie was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor saga, because although it tells the story of how the graboids are formed, the story is so stupid and useless. If you want to tell a story WAY back in time, make sure you use the same actor (Michael Gross) to be someone in the past, if he is someone in the other Tremor movies. You haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time. Tremors, 1, 2 and 3, for a good time. However, this movie makes sure you are sitting next to you, with the STOP button that works for a quick retreat from this nonsense.
