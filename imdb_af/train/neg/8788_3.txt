What a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshing low-key story begins to capture your interest and then gradually move you further until you reach your hidden head when it reaches its exaggerated conclusion. Unfortunately, this is what happened to WHITE NOISE. <br /> <br /> It wasn't Michael Keaton's fault; It was a pleasure to see him as the star of a brand new movie, which may have shrunk, but still manages to give a strong and sincere performance. As a man whose wife recently died, he became the aftermath of the afterlife (not a new idea). She is apparently contacted by her by the funky electric fuzz business you see on your television screen when nothing is broadcast. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​spirits communicating through the airwaves is called EPP (electronic voice phenomena) and there are many people who really believe it. So I'm not going to comment on what I think of it or they. Let me just say that I am all for the suspension of unbelief when it comes to buying great movies like this, but what I cannot tolerate is not understanding what hell should happen, it's about where I was left stranded when the credits finally started rolling. Many statically indeed. <br /> <br /> Occasionally there are movies like that that totally amazed me, but if a movie doesn't make it clear to me, it tends to be the fault of the filmmaker. my own (unless I watched it while I was too tired to focus or something). Well, for WHITE NOISE I was awake, bright-eyed and bushy - so guess who should blame?
