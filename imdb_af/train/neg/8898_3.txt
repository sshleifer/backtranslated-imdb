Can false scenery ruin a picture? You won't think so, but it's really for me here. Listen, I have many classic era movies and I know pretty much what to remember, such as drivers driving immobile cars in front of a screen, etc. But much of the hokey business has to do with action scenes. To have fake scenery, fake mountains and flowers shot at the shot, as seen in "Brigadoon", become insulting after a while. <br /> <br /> Regarding music entertainment, it's always subjective. Which songs one person likes, otherwise it may not be so, it shouldn't play a big part in judging a movie (or holding any of the songs). I could blow this movie for its 1950s clips, dances, romance and characters, but it was the 50's and many people liked these things. Musicals performed very well in the 50's. I love the '30s and' 40s with the big taps. By the 50's tap was out and these new things - which I can stand - were it. Does this make it a bad movie? No. It just makes one I don't mind. <br /> <br /> Despite the good role, good director and high expectations, this movie bombarded at the cash register and with me. I would have wanted it more, be myself a dreamer and that is a good part of this story. I'm not the cynical type and a beautiful village and good people who make me feel good sounds. Then why couldn't I join this movie? Part of it was also the dance. I don't care about the things that crane dance replaces on the screen. But - no - the thing really turned me off putting it on the scene. There was no Scotland, no highlands, just a hokey backdrop to make it look like this and it almost showed me from the start. Score one point for today's realism where they "go on the spot" most of the time.
