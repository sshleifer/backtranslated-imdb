I grew up to see Inspector Gadget. It was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off Inspector Gadget's Field Trip. I wanted to throw on a banana peel and become the biggest detective ever. <br /> <br /> But the film ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, a potential actor, was definitely NOT the role of Inspector Gadget. First thing - in the movie, Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the cartoon. In the movie, Gadget loosely solves the mystery. In the cartoon it was almost always Penny, Brain, and the wonderful book (I still want her book!). If Gadget solved the riddle, it was by accident. Gadget in the movie seems to be a capable detective, but in the cartoon was very stupid, where the humor came from. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it's too much, "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the movie. It's not just meant to be a dull Saturday morning cartoon. Gadget should never have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. <br /> <br /> I also miss the real gadgets that Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the movie it was an attractive convertible. In the cartoon it was a sedan police vehicle and could be in a bus. It also had scarce gadgets and was mainly there to get it from place to place. <br /> <br /> But if anything, the one thing that was terrible for the movie was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a dull Saturday morning cartoon. The film was too serious, to overdo it, had too much of a plot and wasn't even so distant at all. <br /> <br /> Tip for those who haven't seen it: NO see it. Ever. Look at the cartoon, it's a real classic.
