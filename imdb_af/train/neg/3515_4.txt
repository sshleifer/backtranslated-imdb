Actually a typical propaganda movie for the last good war. But there were a few things that struck me. First, the use of mondepit was. In two cases, the Scott character speaks at the beginning once he dropped his bomb during the dammit from the target and once he tries to make a bomber to be a pilot (' s *% t ") I was wrong in the second place, but I played it several times and that is how it looks to me.The third case is when the Anne Shirley character goodbye and strength to the O'Brien Win ("Give Hell") over the roar of the engines, she had thought it was too unladylike because she clearly said "heck." I also found interesting that the character who has moral problems with bombing, especially bombard civilians. The exaggerated superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the accuracy of the use of the bombing, given what we know about LeMay's later strategy of destroying Japanese cities in oblivion, this scene does not play a little irony keep McNamara's quote from LeMay in "The Fog of War", which means if the US doesn't win the conflict, it is being tried as a war criminal. The end is overwhelmed, in line with the movie. It reminds me a bit of the end of White Heat (I don't compare the movies, just the end!). Maybe it's just because he's blown up. Really inflated !!!
