This is a TV show and rather unnecessary Sci-Fi Channel re-translation of the Beowulf story, especially after the recent movie "Beowulf and Grendel". This film is not really in Beowulf's story, but we only known by its struggle against the ravenous beast known as Grendel, as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and unrest while the mighty Viking warrior Beowulf is called to them of the monster's rampage. If successful, the king will no longer sacrifice the children to keep it in neighborhoods. After some unsuccessful attempts, the creature is killed, but it is angry and revenge-free mother attacks quickly, and this leaves Beowulf again with its mighty power and courage to defeat it. "Grendel" looks like it's shot on a small budget and the CG effects are terrible. As I said, this movie is absolutely unnecessary.
