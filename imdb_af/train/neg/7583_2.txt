David Lean's worst movie. Even in what we serve, it wasn't as bad as this. Usually a movie with a very good reputation such as this one has at least some redeeming qualities, by which one understands why it can be considered a classic. But after looking at it, I just couldn't find out why this piece of shit was held so much in 1945! I don't like the acting, tight upper lip of British ways, story, essay (which can sometimes be pretty funny) and soundtrack. The elvira character is meant to be attractive and attractive, but was actually ugly and had a strange and annoying voice. Just another movie that convinced me not to trust a movie reputation. Another very overstated "British classic".
