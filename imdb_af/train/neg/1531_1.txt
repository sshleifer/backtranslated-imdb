This movie is so bad, it made me vomit. Poorly produced, a complete lag free zone. Why would you in the name of God spoof a movie that is a spoof (and a damn funny one) as it stands? The sets are laughing, the effects are so bad that they aren't even laughable, and the acting farcical. This is a complete riddle why you might even consider watching this lot of garbage. National Lampoon once made Animal House, which still sees people completely and completely hilarious. Now they are tempted to make TV movies like this bunch of ****. Name your explicit, and it can be used accurately to describe this movie.
