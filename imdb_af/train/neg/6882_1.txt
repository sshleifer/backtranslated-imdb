I hate the way Mrs. Perez Puerto Ricans pictured! We are not all ghetto - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can't speak to the uneducated people you attacked. But our language is rude, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better economical than any other Caribbean island! I'm glad we're not like Cuba, Dominican Republic or Haiti, free from American influence? Free in true poverty, not the US standard of poverty. We are not victims, we are resilient, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our appearance includes strong African roots, but not 'black' roots. I have nothing in common with black Americans. Do the research.) The analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King could no longer get off the mark. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero, a true revolutionary - an honest man who saw a day when we were all free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro. does the Cuba that is today is why the boat full of Cubans is costing their lives to come to America - because Che made such a better place for them? You had a wonderful, wonderful idea, but you politicized it too much. We have so many things to be proud of as a people - do not let our people be ashamed of us. I'm not a Nuyorican, so I can't share your views. I'm Puerto Rican, I'm speaking Spanish, I'm not a victim and I've achieved many of my goals in America. If there is a part 2 in the future - less politics more history, more stories of triumph - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
