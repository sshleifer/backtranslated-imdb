It is difficult to make an unbiased verdict on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is without a doubt the worst kind of mining film. I was sorry to see this movie for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made. I saw it again earlier this year and was terrified again. <br /> <br /> I am not a zeal or one to say what others should and should not see, but I have done a great deal of transgression in the way something so horrible as rape has been dealt with in this movie. I love lowbrow theater, but it's just nasty. Hire some Rus Myer instead.
