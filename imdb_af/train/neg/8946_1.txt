I think the shots and lighting were very poor. When I first looked at it, I thought it was the old version (1956). When I really found out the real year of the movie, I was shocked. I didn't know that such a bad movie could be made so recently. That's really all I wanted to say. However, this movie had a good plot, nothing you can't miss if you just read the novel George Orwelll wrote. All I really want to say has been said except for this: I can't believe this movie could receive so many awards and nominations. I gave this movie a One (terrible) because I felt it was very bad. Well, that's all. So long
