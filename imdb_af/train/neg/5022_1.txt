Oh, honey, this movie was bad for several reasons. I expected to see a very low score for this movie and was a little surprised at the over-all score. Excuse me, but to evaluate it as high as many is a joke! As soon as you get past the one shot / black and white movie gimmick, which was a good idea, drag the movie up, even on a running time of just 66 minutes. The credit line at the beginning was also so annoying! In those guys a flat tire suffers and changes the wheel, wow, it was necessary in the story! How slow were the guys pursued and actually managed to stop Campbell? They didn't seem to suffer and still chased him. Sigh. I'm just too glad I got it for free with a special edition of the evil dead!
