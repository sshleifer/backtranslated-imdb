Elvis Presley plays a "half-breed" Native American ("Indian") who has to defend his nasty business tycoons discussion. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight and make children. <br /> <br /> Although he does have make-up, it is clear that Elvis is healthier than he appeared in previous films. ; Maybe he's ready for his famous "comeback". It couldn't have been, because the movie's writing was anything to get excited about. Joan Blondell tries to seduce Elvis, and Burgess Meredith in "war painting" must be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually, "Green Sleeves" with various lyrics). The most enchanting song is Elvis's love song for the bull "Dominic". There are some surreal scenes, but it never gets trippy enough to succeed in that genre; Although, "Stay Away, Joe", you can laugh a little if you're in the right mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
