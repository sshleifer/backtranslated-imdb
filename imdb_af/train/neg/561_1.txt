Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's unfortunately worse than you can imagine. First, the plot is idiotic, it is not at all. The script is full of deliberate funny dialogues. The audience often laughed. And the voltage is very low. Actors play so-so, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has a few good moments, but also some terribly bad plays. The saddest parts are when she tries aggressively sexy and says things like "I want * beep * you" and it looks like a very mature woman who is rude and not sexy at all. The erotic tension of BI1 is completely gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD, but at a much lower lever than the original movie. For example, the scene of crazy joyride is poorly done. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his performances. The writing is done by people who do not agree with Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas. The movie sometimes looks good and badly edited. I'm sorry, but my first thought after leaving the theater was: "Why did they make this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?" All the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of breakthrough in the popular movie. It was challenging, sexy and controversial. It had the best Sharon Stone's performance in her career. It had this particular Paul Verhoeven's style. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an unintentionally funny movie, badly targeted and a sure Razzie award winner in many categories. It's a pity they made this movie.
