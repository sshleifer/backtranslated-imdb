It is by far one of the most boring and terrible accounts of the early days of Adolf Hitler I have ever watched. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but throwing him like Hitler is simply wrong. To recruit Liev Schrieber as Hitler's longtime friend and help, Haefengstal must have issued despair and anxiety calls from the Wilsenthal Center. A J-W plays a Nazi supporter, badly bad decisive. It was not a pleasant family movie with a good historical background. It was Hollywood rubbish at its best, in cash using strong (but heavily underutilized) supportive players who have all disappeared from the stage radar over the past 5 years. <br /> <br /> The false German accents (livestock vill vinis var) insult the German people everywhere. My mother is German and she sits on the sound of the voices that have changed from American / English / German in the same sense. The support cast makes better cardboard cuts at the local video store than they do on the screen. However, Jenna Malone as the outdated Geli Raubal was wonderful, she caught the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who eventually ended her own life to escape what would have been her future in Hitler's shadow. <br /> <br /> If you want an amazingly fantastic and historically accurate version of Hitler's early years up to the war / holocaust, rent "Inside the Third Reich" in 1983 with Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler. It was good and it made more sense than it was. <br /> <br /> As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you, it has reached me for my books to confirm his many inaccuracies.
