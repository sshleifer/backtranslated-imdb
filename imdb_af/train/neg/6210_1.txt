This is the worst movie I've seen since "I know who killed me" with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment awaits you when you choose to watch it. Hey, Tim Burton, I was a big fan of yours ... did you even watch this movie? I mean seriously, what the f% # k? <br /> <br /> Without giving away anything, here's the story in a vague nutshell. Nine wake up, he does things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. ..and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning! Destroyer warning! At the end of the movie .... it rains. I think part of my soul died while watching this movie.
