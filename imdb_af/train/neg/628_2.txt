This movie has the potential to be a decent horror movie. The main character was done properly and I was sorry for him and there was a decent amount of background. Yet everything is struggling. The director, Emmanuel, is incompetent in film making. He uses the most idiotic shots ever. <br /> <br /> - Some random rows of random images spread throughout the movie. I don't know if he tried deeply and intelligently and poetically, but he wasn't. It was stupid. Random trailer shots feature the main character, random buildings, random pan-shots of buildings, random cat that has escaped. WTF? And clouds. Very dark dark clouds. <br /> <br /> - He kept much of this technique to cut a scene in different shots rather than just one continuous shot. EX: Guy tries to lift his weeds and circle the camera around him. Instead of just one shot, he turns it into 10 different shots, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and SMART! stupid. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, but that's the thing that makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast, turning and turning and turning all the time. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main bull to have a long build-up death, but not. A simple corn head in the ear. The love interest was warm. Voluptuous. That's why this movie gets a 2.
