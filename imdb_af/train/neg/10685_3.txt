Predictable, hackneyed & poorly written. Sadly, I argued that such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit. I think the competition between actors is so intense today (and only gets worse) that one can no longer choose and choose. Early on we gave an inkling that was instrumental in the assassination and we have already slapped it from our throat. The film lacked intrigue, giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder. Some of the discourse was honest, embarrassing! It's hard to believe someone will even consider, let alone committing to spending tens of millions of dollars.
