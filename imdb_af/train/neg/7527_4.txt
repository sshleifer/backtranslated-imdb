There are so many stupid moments in 'Tower of Death' / 'Game of Death 2' that you really wonder if it's a spoof. Sometimes it felt like I was watching Kung Pow's successor rather than a Bruce Lee movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie has everything to do with 'Game of Death'. As something, it's more a sequel to "Enter the Dragon," which includes many elements of the movie - especially the actual footage. Bruce Lee's character Billy Lo (apparently) examines the sudden death of his friend and meets a piece of film left with the man's daughter. When the body is stolen during the funeral, Billy is also murdered. It is up to his rebellious brother to avenge both men's death. Tong Long star brother Bobby Lo and doesn't really have the kind of charisma to wear the movie. However, his fighting skills are very good. Of course, Bruce Lee is due to (no longer) scraped footage merely going into the heritage. Say the footage is actually edited, in better than in 'Game of Death', but it doesn't stop the movie as a mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so the battles are really entertaining (dare I say to blow) and at least make the movie lookable. But there are so many bold elements in this movie that it really tests your patience. First, there is the supposed villain who lives on his beautiful property ... or is that spiritual institution? Seriously the nutter eats raw venison, drinks deer blood, carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns a few peacocks and lions (?!). This effort to make him look strong and intelligent makes you feel sorry for him - half expecting someone to lead him back to his room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this middle section is awful and when the scene is involved a mere hooker and a lion pack arrived and I turned it off. However, I finished the film and was so happy that I did because the end of the fight (much like "GOD") was the whole reason to look. While the story is embarrassing, the action is very good and contains an excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> But even the final disappears when the point of departure is something to go. What we are told is that the 'Tower of Death' was a pagoda that was upside down and underground. It sounded like a twist on Bruce Lee's original idea with different styles of fighting on each level. Could it be the "Game of Death" originally planned? No! The movie should be called "Generator Room of Death" because it's as far as the tower goes. Yes, there were indeed one or two 'different' styles. There were foil-clad grunts, leopard-skinned henchman and stupid monk. It is as if Enter was never made the dragon, with the plot impersonating. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at once for the fast-paced scenes, but sometimes silly that hurts. If it is meant, then it is good. However, thumb for reviewing the projector room scene from 'Enter The Dragon'.
