For months before the release of this movie you have advertised it in all kinds of print media, so I patiently waited for his video release to see what the hype is about. After it was over, I had to apologize to my roommate for the last hour and a half to watch the video to watch such a horrible movie. Essentially, it fails because it is a character-based movie about irreconcilable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is Amanda Peet) you can't stand any of them. The film relies on his dialogue that is sophomoric, moronic and crude. The only slightly amusing character is Eric, whose portrayal of the only married member of a group of friends is dead. The final twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, just puts the same kind of resentment to Peet. All in all, rent only if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
