Hm. While an enjoyable plot to attempt plot holes, highlight the horrible acting, primitive (at best) special effects (all of which caused me to see this movie three times over the past six years). Separated ranks among the worst I've ever seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are. All I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder. All in all, I don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are nice, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialogue and images that do not make the story a logical conclusion (which I can't remember not).
