Having read many years ago about how big this movie was, it found Ruiz among French critics (especially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I watched it about a year ago, that it was pretty disappointing (but then I think my expectations were sky-high. This deliberate cerebral film (made for television and merely an hour long) is told in the saturated black and white, in the form of a conversation between an art expert and a screen narrator while thinking through a series of paintings ( shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and trying to find out if they have some clues about a hidden political crime. (The horrible Kate Beckinsale movie exposes a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I have read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say that almost any Borges story is more interesting than this movie.
