It's a bad movie, it looks like there are only 5 police in HK, they don't use gun and it makes me feel like a Jacky Chan movie. All the time they used their rifle to show only to the suspect. When they finally use their gun is when they kill each other, which is a funny movie. In the movie it is as if all the good guys went without reason. <br /> <br /> Their story line of the movie also sucks, the story jumps here and there and bored people. But if you want to see a bloody movie, I think it's just a good kind of movie, I think America made zombie film is more bloody than this one.
