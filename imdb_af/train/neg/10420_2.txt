OK, I know many people will probably withhold this review because Watership Down is a "classic" and a standard part of most people's childhood. But to see this movie for the first time at the nicest age of 18, I have to admit: I hate it very much. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people whispered with the words "Watership Down" - their memories of seeing the movie as children and their emotions torn on the seams - it recommended. To be honest, I wish I didn't bother. I gave it the benefit of the doubt; Generally, I don't like to stop watching a movie halfway through. It was an exception. It was really unfair, sick, boring. This movie was probably the slowest thing I ever watched (think a doped snail in space) and didn't really do it to me. The art was good; the backgrounds are beautiful, if not a little stomach and two, but the rabbits themselves were not very encouraging and the animation was quite leaping and poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I'm not in great detail about the storyline; Basically, it is the story of a group of rabbits leaving their war because of the infiltration of people in the area. Generally a moralistic story about the dangers of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to convey the message. For me, I wish they would get gasses, not because I am a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were unpleasant, annoying, boring, and generally pretty rude (oh so terrible English). I found that I was constantly watching the watch while watching the movie, and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before something really happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax. <br /> <br /> If I was praised It would in any way admit that the concept of showing children the dangers of rural construction and hopefully revealing the arrogance of people, etc., is pretty good. Perhaps it is generally sacred and preaching, but the message it tries to convey is good in its nature. The musical score wasn't bad either. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is pretty poor. I couldn't quite overlook it, or I'll probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom. Granted, it's not a "torque" bad, but it still doesn't rate high in my eyes, so I gave it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
