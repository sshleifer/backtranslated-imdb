This movie is classified by a sentiment that is not about any quality of filmmaking. It moves from the unlikely to the incredible, from the unrealistic to the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The incredible plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu gover to save a third soldier captured by insurgents. Indians. In the later scene, we see a complete regiment with drum and bagpipes that are in ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order a rescue effort, and if you pass by, he does not try it with just another soldier and an Indian servant when there is a complete regiment. The Indian rebels are so incredibly inactive, it's laughing. There are hundreds of them, but they can't keep their prisoner or murder the two rescuers, of course. At one point, we see the British soldiers repelling stone blocks from the controversies, which are scattered in the ambush around the mountains. One must have an eggplant for a brain to think it will do any harm. After shooting Cary Grant as the rescued prisoner, he lies on the floor to look around the water boy ... barely the action of someone shot in the back. The water boy stubbornly blows a bug (coming from nowhere) to make the alarm sound ... he does this by standing tall on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad people, and we shed a tear as he tried to sound more notes, as he was repeatedly shot and called the bubble in poor squawks instead of blowing the bull while hiding behind the lid as someone with half a brain would do . This scene was deservedly parody sketched. If they wanted to make a Buster Keaton comedy, they had to rent Keaton and do it better.
