When Marlene Dietrich was a boxing poison in 1938, one of a handful of actresses was called by the trade process. These were movies like The Garden of Allah. How a movie can be so beautiful to watch and be so careless is beyond me. Also, as Marlene tried to expand her series and not play a sex game, she was stuck with such an old-fashioned story, beyond me. <br /> <br /> The garden of Allah, one of the very first films in modern technology, was a novel at the beginning of the last century by Robert Hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaptation with Mary Anderson who in 1911 -12 played for 241 appearances. It then had two silent screen adjustments. The story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery in French Tunisia to see what he is missing in the world. He walks in a similar sheltered woman who was single and spent her first years on a sick parent. She now travels in the desert and the two meet on a train. <br /> <br /> The woman is of course Marlene and the road monk is Charles Boyer. I'm not sure what David O. Selznick's thought was about filming this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman made it possible for the audience. But you can bet that the 1936 movie audience when they picked their money for a ticket, they expected to see Marlene as a modern-day Salome, rather than a saint with that title. The public still remembers Rudolph Valentino and you can bet it was a desert novel and temptation they expected. <br /> <br /> As far as the monks are concerned, remember that they are self-supporting in their monasteries and, in particular, one bottle of a special wine of which Boyer is the one secret. The monastery will have to reconsider its economy as Boyer leaves. The monks are a sincere pious group, but off the head Charles Waldron, they have the right to worry a little about self-interest. <br /> <br /> In any case, many religious platitudes are said here. by some leads that really aren't suitable for the parts. Mostly Marlene Dietrich. I will be watching this movie for the special color desert catacombs and forget about the plot.
