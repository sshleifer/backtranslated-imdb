It was a horrible waste of time. No plot. The acting was so far below par, it should be used as an example in theater classes of NOT doing. It is merely a commercial rip-off of the previous Universal Soldier, which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel. It is sad that VD every few years must claim his ego and still sad that people will pay good money to put it through. This kind of shock gives Martial Arts movies a bad name. In comparison, it makes Segall, Norris, and Arnold look almost talented. <br /> <br /> Perhaps VD should take the Leslie Nielson song and do send-ups of his genre. At least we can laugh with him instead of with him.
