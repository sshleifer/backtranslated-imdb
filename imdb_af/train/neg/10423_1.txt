so ... it's really sexist and classic and i thought it might not be in the early stages of the movie, as when Stella tells Steven she really wants to change herself and talk in the right way and he tells her not to does not change. Well, he definitely changed his voice, and it seems that the other judges followed suit. What appears to be a love story in the beginning is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. The end of the movie doesn't make her a hero, it makes the whole thing sad. And it is sad that people think it makes her a hero. Maybe it's the commentary of the movie that people should take away. positive reception reflects ongoing patriarchal streams in the social conscience. yuck.
