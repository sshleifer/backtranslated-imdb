Come on, what's the deal with this show, Power Rangers anyways? I always felt that the performance, which was originally brought to Japan in a better shape, which was good in Japan, has turned into one of the most ridiculous and useless excuses in toy trading history! There is absolutely no point with this show. <br /> <br /> The bad hairstyles, bad costumes, earrings, etc. show everything that was ridiculous in the 1990s. Of the two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to the Duhs, of the main story, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: Give me a little! <br /> <br /> Saban brought it from Japan, and then Disney <br /> <br /> The public has to endure this program on the Disney channel and so on. <br /> <br /> All I can say is pausing!
