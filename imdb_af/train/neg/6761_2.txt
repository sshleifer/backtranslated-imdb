Let's be honest. As a film school project, without budget and "real" actors, it's a surprisingly interesting movie. As something on DVD is released for an innocent viewer, it is a very poorly manufactured product. If I were a little changing channels and would catch this movie by accident, it would probably have arrested my eye and attention for a while. As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I am getting a proper movie product, ie a movie, I feel very disappointed. It's a video recording, something along the lines of the old sixties, but without being a charm. Apart from the leading man, Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), seems to be the other campus actors, whether it's too old or members of the director's household appearing in front of the camera without any help from not only the stage banks, but also the make-up artist or hairdresser (a bonnet over overgrown permanent fur or a top hat over mullet is a very long way to create 1840s). It is all shot with a motionless mounted camera in a small, bare studio, sometimes with blue screen for outdoor backgrounds. Synthesizer generated uninspired count of lame "era" inspired romantic karaoke insult the viewers ears on more than one occasion. The film is trying to be dreamy, but it is just a conceptual collage of those shots that made it into editing (and believe me, the standards were not too high to start with). There are occasional interesting screens, but overall it is fairly lame and two-dimensional in more than one way without the brilliant flashes of the director or any member of the crew. So "artsy" movies have tried to look in the 80's. Mr Redfield does a much better job than an actor than the director.
