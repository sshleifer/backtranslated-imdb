Is no one else tired of that old clich√© 'where an almost dead person appears in a horror movie, gives us information and then expresses his head for no apparent reason? I know I am. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that its use in this movie is worthless. If you saw the first movie (the first repetition I have to say) then the given information is completely worthless because you would already have known it. I don't think it can be worthless for the main characters. But why does the idiot shoot himself in the head? Doesn't he want to live? Certainly, he would have died anyway. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie entitled "The Hills Have Eyes II." The first is the sequel to the original 70's movie. That's where it gets a little complicated for someone like me. Look, I'm probably part of minority people of my age who even knew there was a HHE2 to start with, much less an original HHE1. And now we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this successor is called the successor to the original HHE1 ... it just makes it worse! But anyways. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's original Hills Have Eyes was decent. Eventually the idea was better than the presentation, but he probably had a low budget. To be honest, Wes Craven is not as good of a horror director. He just made some good horror movies (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), some cute (Scream) and a bunch of horrible (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh, and he also made Swamp Thing ... but the original HHE2 falls under the latter category. I only saw a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he has combined the new HHE2. And this is such a disappointment! Last year's HHE remake was even better than the original film. It was tense. I think it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family, and not a lot of beer and pot and sex school teenagers. It made us feel dirty. For the first time we were in hell and eventually in the last few moments the good guys took revenge on the bad guys and it felt good. <br /> <br /> This new movie has no tension. No tension whatsoever. Only violent things happen to mostly stupid people. There is hardly a threatening presence here. Just ugly hobos hiding under rocks. <br /> <br /> I get tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they make. It was only the other day that I watched "Deep Blue Sea" where Samuel L. Jackson continued to walk around the water while giving the speech, and then he was eaten by a shark just because the idiot was near the water remained. something nobody would do in the given situation! Here is exactly the same thing. People go out to leak separately, although they know people are dying. Certainly, a pot break can't wait? And then if you think people would have learned, somebody else goes by itself! Seriously, is it no longer scary when the characters bring their A game and still lose? I'll think so ... <br /> <br /> It's even under the liver. This would have made the first remake look like "The Fog" remake (which was less threatening than an episode of "Becker"). More bad guys. More time in the caves. More tension. More of everything. <br /> <br /> But it actually drops. Fewer bad guys. No tension. Certainly, we have more time in the caves, but not much happens. In the end, it looks like there are two or three bad guys. The last film made it look like a whole tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Who keeps looking through binoculars? Seriously, these are the things this movie should bring us, but it ends with exactly the same promise that the last movie gave us, with the exact same "watched" scene. Come on! I'll give the devil because of it. The look of the movie is good. But that's it. <br /> <br /> I don't even think Gore fans will like that. Although I'm probably wrong! There are gore (although most of them are fired in the dark), but without the stress and characters you even care about. The gore does nothing in my book! Eventually you are not afraid. You are not shocked (unless you are an 8 year old girl). You don't even feel that you've seen something new.
