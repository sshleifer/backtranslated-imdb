God ... where to start. I could only stomach for the first 10 minutes before I got it off. Apart from the actor playing Robin Hood himself, the rest was just awful. And I can only stretch my suspension of unbelief so far. <br /> <br /> From the start of the first episode, I lost the score of how many bugs, plot holes and horrible costumes were there. It started with a poor farmer trying to hunt for a deer to feed his family. Everything good and good. However, the poorer lighter should have been mostly deaf, because a handful of soldiers, in full armor to horse, could reach him within 10 feet. <br /> <br /> When he ran away, he is going to have them 10 feet behind him, to a shot where you can't even see them, immediately followed by them about 20 feet behind him. Then he walks in some bushes, and is immediately treated by two of the soldiers ... who were just a few seconds ahead, galloping to the back, dozens of feet behind him. <br /> <br /> The "armor" on The soldiers are so painfully natural cloth that they try to look like ant, and fail failed. Nevertheless, the chief soldier's "armor" is about 5 sizes too big for the poor man. Seriously, he looks as if he is a small child wearing his father's excessive weapon! Finally, Robin manages about 5 perfectly-suited shots around one soldier's hand, about 2 seconds away, from what a repetitive bow appears to be. No man in life can make such shots, in such a short time, with a shotgun, much less a bow. <br /> <br /> Then they escape the soldiers and stop to help an incredibly well-dressed one. and clean "farmer" digging a ditch ... something all nobles were willing to do all the time, right? How sorry for a series that has a second season ever is beyond me. The production cost (at least for what I saw) had to rise in the dozens of dollars (or Euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think a high school drama class could have given a better version. It was so bad, even the horrible Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood was better. <br /> <br /> I recommend you skip this monstrosity, and buy or buy the mid 80's Robin or Sherwood series. Much better written, performed, costed and produced. <br /> <br /> For shame, BBC ... for shame ...
