the characters at depth-less rip offs. You've seen all the characters in other movies, I promise. The script tries to be edgy and unpleasant, but fails. it throws in a hangover at the super-bath comedy, but the jokes are out of the left field, completely forced, and are almost completely ignored after they crash. the hot chick is old and has no personality, just a few early thirty blonde chick with some wise ass non-underwear wearing jokes that are less than engaging. The attraction between Molly (the hot chick) and Kirk (the dorky love interest) is barely communicated. The attraction in no place where it is found is a completely platonic relationship until they appear uncomfortable and predictable belt accident. Only this is in a full relationship and it is just incredibly lame. The main focus of this movie is not the relationship, but a failed attempt to make a racial super-bad-esquire movie with a semi-attractive plot. I could compare it to the hangover, in his forced nature. I will not succeed. I can keep going, but it's just meaningless. don't pay to see this movie.
