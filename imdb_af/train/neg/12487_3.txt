This movie was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> I take the opposite view of the critics. It is not the case that the material does not belong to the level of the actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not at the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were as big as Davis and Cagney each time, and watched it happen. One night came out - an all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she doesn't have a talent for comedy (good thing for her, it's just the only comedy she's ever tried!) Davis's one-note show boasts petulance, but nothing of the nuances of Colbert's acting In This one night happened. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, only appears from his face with his costume, Davis. The script offers some decent lines and gags, but the delivery looks better suited for drama and comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack that, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, is more suited to a light drama than a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who played similar roles in his career, has treated many similar materials more capably. In a fairly typical supporting role, Eugene Palette is performing well. In a slightly different role than an old west relic, Harry Davenport, it's very good. But in one of his worst performances, William Frawley is rather annoying. His character's constant reference to fictional policemen is a poor attempt at irony. <br /> <br /> I really love each one of these artists, and it is a pity that as an ensemble they no longer achieve chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.
