THHE2 is entertaining in that you will laugh a lot and cringe and probably say "oh sh * t!" and "get your face away from the damn hole you dumb ** s" or things along those lines, but I don't know if it's really worth seeing - I was very annoyed overall with the terrible military characters that do not seem to know the first thing about battles. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, gore, and higher body number than the first, but I'm still debating whether it's my feel throughout the movie about how ridiculous it is (and not a good ridicule like Dead Alive or Feast. My time would have been better to watch Aja's remake for the 5th time. <br /> <br /> So go for a few laughs or go for a bit, but don't go hoping to get out of it.
