I must say as a fan of the man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best films. <br /> <br /> Then you got this POS. I can't logically think he did any trouble in doing it as he did with Cigarette Burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You should look at the fact that it doesn't look like a movie. It looked like someone else was aiming for one thing. I wouldn't believe Carpenter had any part in it. <br /> <br /> I just listened to his old school H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it was great, especially for the times. <Br /> <br /> He uses a style that no one has and it worked so well for his films.
