"It is just as hard to describe just how exciting it is to make a relationship like drama as with all the similar pornographic scenes that are cast in such a good way, and to create like a controversial resistance. and make us more like money and things. "- Ellen, the lost quote. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, Like, On, Like, Mouth And Stuff" is like the best artistic pursuit ever made. Look like Ellen's hairy arms and like Chris's masturbation was like the highlight of my years of movie viewing experience and stuff. But before I want to start breaking new US-20 something airhead records with my "love", I briefly show you the list of visual festivals as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. Chris does the act with his genitals. And not only that: the way the camera (led by Ellen and Patrick, so elegant) rewarded the viewer with a full screen of Chris's fat white trash after completing the non-Catholic act - it was really exciting. I can honestly say that I have never seen such grace. Chris, you have to do more such scenes in your next movies, because that's exactly what we need as a continuation of what began that brilliant, brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95". A quick w *** and then a hairy, thick, white stomach: the more any filmmaker can ask? Needless to say, I can sit all day watching Chris ejaculate (despite being straight) ... such poetry in motion. Such elegance, such a style. No less than the total, divine inspiration filmed the sequence - plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand couldn't get any more spiritual than that. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's hairy, thick arms. The close-ups of the wobble camera, so adequately photographed by our two directors of photography (I can't stress it enough), Ellen and Patrick, often caused confusion regarding the correct identification of the particular sex. There were several scenes where we could see a part of a body (a leg, arm or foot), but it was often a guess: does the body part belong to a man or woman? Of course, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and whatsername throw themselves deliberately, because their bodies were ideal to create this gender-based confusion. It was sometimes difficult to guess whether you see a female or a male leg. Patrick is so very thin and slightly in his movements, so hairless and pristine, while Ellen and the other girl are so much slaughtered, with their thick legs and arms. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way that fits neatly with the theme of rollover between the sexes: so completely original and sensible. Ellen behaves like a man, wants to have sex all the time while her ex-Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen's search for a leftist partner. "He must love The Simpsons, which is rather Leftist." I am glad that the makers of this movie have decided to break the long tradition of offering our intelligent left. Ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change. The number of "likes" she and her liberal friends can live in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal (3,849, to be exact). They managed to realize their real big screen disabilities with a minimum of effort, and I complain to them. <br /> <br /> 5. The close-ups of tone. Much of the stuff here for foot-fetishes, which I believe is a very liberal, highly commendable way to reach out to sexual minorities. Shoe and foot fetishes are offered so little in modern cinema, so it's nice to see someone out there. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather KLOTLMAS, offers more than the eye. It's not just a modest little film about level people involved in hollow relationships, while welcoming meaningless conversations. No, it's much more than that. It's about the light that leads all stupid creatures; the guiding light that dominates the futile lives of several pseudo-artistic wannabes, which have just thrown out of the film school, and plan to attack our senses with dull folly that will hopefully play well on pretentious festivals such as Sundance and Cannes enabling them to win The necessary exposure, therefore, a few real cash for a change, with which they will later hire the holders of Sean Penn and George Clooney to promote the saving of this planet and to solve ALL political problems that face this world. What better way to do this than to start pornography first? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen did the camera here, as stated in the final credits, then, who kept the camera while the two were in front of them? They probably hired some passers-by and pushed the camera into their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and look at me "TV & Cinema: 150 First Cases Of Nepotism "light.
