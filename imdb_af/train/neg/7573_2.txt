This movie is a vehicle for the Schwarzenegger clone Alexander Nevsky. However, his charisma is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of his poor writing. He has little to do with his Arnie act. <br /> <br /> Michael York is rather pathetic as the begging diplomat. To watch him repeat his D'Artagnan act since being a better actor made me feel uncomfortable. Come on, you can do better than that! <br /> <br /> The story is full of holes and inexplicable relationships; At the top of this bill is the informant of Vlad, who looks like an American woman, but from the context it seems to be a Russian government department. <br /> <br /> Although the story goes well after the Communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communist. In contrast, Vlad can run a pimped-up of all utility vehicles as a police car. The action scenes are poorly shot and thus lack dynamics. <br /> <br /> Don't see a movie ...
