Jason Lee does his best to make fun of a stupid situation, but the movie just fails to make a connection. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, because Julia Stiles's character looks uncomfortable as fucking and sexy, which is soon a cousin. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because she and Selma Blair's characters have to be thrown in the opposite way. (Selma Blair looks more royal than Julia would be.) <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is another Hollywood trivialization of a possible real world situation (it is caught with your pants at your baccalaureus some who do not bend your cousin), although the promise failed to deliver. <br /> <br /> There are a few laughs to be sure and the throw (even if the miscarriage) does their best with sub-grade material that does not exceed its racial subject. . So, instead of getting a successful raunch ("Animal House of American Pie"), we have a medium-sized sense of humor and some stupidity (ala Meatballs 2 or something).
