Not only was he always annoying to listen, but he had NO jokes. I swear, a fucking Asian guy who's joking your mum would have been better than Leary's crap. (Well, maybe funny for a few minutes, but at least I can laugh at least once!) Leary claims he has stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes" ... apparently he was still high on something ; He was just a few weed-like surprises, mostly drug-related. One of his jokes was something like, "I won't use crack, especially with the same name as between my ass" - Oh man, how did he reach that one? I swear the only man to close the f ** k is Denis Leary. Thank you, I didn't need him to live. This man sucks completely. <br /> <br /> If you are easily amused by swearing and "jokes" where you can get up with yourself, waste your time with this mess.
