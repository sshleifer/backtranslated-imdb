This movie is really dirty. It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70's / 80's and puts it in a school context. I am not saying that urban crime was not a problem for many or schools were not problem areas, but this dirty exploitation takes the cookie. Violence is beyond anything realistic imaginable, but in this case it is not a case of social issues, but a white, upper-middle class student uses it to change him into the crime kingpin of his local high school. And of course he knows how to play the system. Sounds familiar. Yes. This turd is purely violent exploitation, a very nasty piece of work. It is disturbing brutality dressed as a social commentary. It belongs in the same category as trash such as Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so on. The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was broken when he had to do such things.
