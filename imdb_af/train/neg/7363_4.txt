The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was that it had Erika Eleniak in it. She is sexy as always, but she plays second violin to leading man, Wolf Larson. It's a pity, because she has more action possibilities than she may show. The film consists mainly of endless shooting ranges that become unambiguous - especially if most of the time you see the bad guys armed with machine guns, Larson always misses and is just armed with a revolver (never out of the dots do not run) rather easily. The earthquake effects are decent, but there is also very vague motion and poor CGI explosions. Like the psychotic "spiritual leader," Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo he has to emit is just boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming he has any) might give this one a glimpse, for others it is hardly worth a rent. (* 1/2)
