A cheesy, compelling terrible (and not fun way) C Grade movie. Everything shouts 'amateur' from the crumby script (bizarre premises, limited coherence and predictable ends, the turgid lighting, sound and handy wobble camera angles, the concise and successful sexual content and references; the turbulent and incredible dialogue at the Z I watched it on DVD and hoped Edward Wood would come out. Everything is forgiven - your worst movies are artworks and more cohesive than this twaddle. <br /> <br /> But still, more preferable to the 'Every night in me dreams do I hear you '- are you sure the Titanic team was not involved?
