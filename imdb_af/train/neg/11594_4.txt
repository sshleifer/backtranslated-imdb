Like Freddy's Revenge, this successor takes a very strange idea and doesn't go to great lengths to express a story. Alice from number 4 is basically pregnant and her baby is pursued by Freddy, who gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. It has the least deaths from the whole series and the sensible cracks are pretty poor, so the horror fans or comedians are not happy either. <br /> <br /> I don't have much to say about this. It is quite interesting to see the characters from Alice and Dan from four, but not worth watching a movie. Uninspriring and unenjoyable, possibly just the competition direction, make it the worst in the series.
