Every Sunday, a thirteen button joins a NYC dinner to boast about the previous night's sexual conquests. Sometimes they are connected by a newly-married ex-comrade and grand-hunter who hangs on them like a beautiful little one. They are uncontaminated horn dogs / wheat dogs and Mia, who put them to the test, decides to teach a lesson, dammit. Ergo, she will date and dump - why not? All three of them! <br /> <br /> Gasp. What a wild idea. What a radical, naughty gall. Women now have the right to date and sleep as much as they want. As much as people do, even! <br /> <br /> There is a lonely, laughable element in "Whipped" - the fact that not even during the amigo's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed make their garbage. Turn the other customers into dinner and say, "Dude, we're trying to eat here." Indeed, a heh-heh gag has an older lady eagerly considering the useful sexual characteristics of certain drinks. A big fat Kermit the Frog "Sheesh" on it. <br /> <br /> It is really a pity that a good-natured friend, a smart, cute heroine and three possible descendants should have such an exchange termination. . <br /> <br /> PS - 30 sweep oosh sound effects for the screenwriter for using the phrase "You go, girl". It was tired in 2000, and it's tired now. <br /> <br /> Save your time and watch some "Sex and the City" repetitions ...
