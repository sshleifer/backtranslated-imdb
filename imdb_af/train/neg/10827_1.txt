This ambitious film suffers most of the author / director Paul Thomas Anderson's delusion of greatness. Highly derivative of much better material (Altman's "Nashville", Lumet's "Network"), this clumsy elephant takes too long to get anywhere. A few wrong roadside roads (an embarrassment between music, a biblical plague) do not help. Also the uneven performance levels. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and storyline could be completely eliminated; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing anxiety. And how many times should we see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack shtick ("Chicago" and "The Hours" enough)? Tom Cruise comes off well in comparison? his misogynistic, foul-mouthed Holy Roller was quite amusing. With the mistakes of the mouth, the writing was loaded with "F" bombs, they lost their impact in no time. Don't even talk about the horrible soundtrack, full of indifferent and annoying chorus by Aimee Mann. Her extensive version of "One," a maudlin number that started, led me to distraction at the beginning of the movie. I had to consider the handwriting on the wall and save me three hours. By that time I was pushed to the edge of hell. One reasoning feature, which I have not seen in other reviews, is the best performance in the bunch, by unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damaged Coke enemy who suffers from self-destruction. Her credibility far exceeded all others. This movie went too serious and didn't know when to end.
