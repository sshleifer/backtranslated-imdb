Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few bytes. - The scriptwriter has eliminated two main characters from the book. - Plot has largely changed. - Voices sound as if they are being lifted directly from written parts (which can read well but are not the same as it is spoken, especially with Chabon's writing style). - The play is more wood than a log cabin. (Esp. Bechstein) - It is supposed to be fixed in 1983 ??? Feel more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be fair, I couldn't bring myself to watch this movie, so it's possible that it has saved itself ... (sarcasm). I really hope no one has paid to see it, or at least anyone who reads the book and hopes something is fair (a la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but he has to be missed from this adaptation. <br /> <br /> No stars.
