The thing that really gets me about this movie (that's the thing about this movie that makes me physically sick) is that someone actually paid to make it. There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie. It's not scary, it's not mind-boggling, it's not fun, it's not good. This is a cyanide sleeping pill. The DVD case compares it to Blair Witch, Evil Dead, and a few other decent movies, which make the film's desperation clear. It's nothing like any other movie ever made; this is far, much worse. The demands of an "extremely shocking end you'll never forget" is the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse droplets. Never waste your time looking at this piece of garbage because it can make you sterile. The man who wrote this movie has to be deleted from the Writer's Guild membership list, and may never resume filming. Because if he thought it was a movie worth making, he probably didn't have much to offer in the future. Zero stars. May Grod have mercy on the soul of anyone who is unhappy enough to see it. I'm going to vomit now.
