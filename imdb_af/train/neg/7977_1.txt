Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie. The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay. But although I was very interested in the subject and thinking about religion (I am an atheist), it was difficult to force myself to look at the movie and, in my opinion, unknowingly quit. Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I do not know. It's just and so it's not recommended.
