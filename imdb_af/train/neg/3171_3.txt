Was it the biggest movie I've ever seen? No. Was it the worst? No. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four children, it's nice to see something that was light and amusing. It was wonderful, but it was cute. <br /> <br /> I think it definitely has a little room to improve, but it did try. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this movie deserves the utmost. level of abuse of the other reviewer. Of course they don't care about Eva Longoria. I think she was better off here than in The Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. The actors play a big role in whether it is a hit or a flop. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cast didn't work out. Perhaps there were too many things going on. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to talk for an average movie, not a terrible one. It can just be a chick fly. Similar to the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband is still talking about this. :)
