I had to endure almost all the performances of teenage, high school anxiety and family conflict. I really don't mind high school girls raving about their relationships. I spent my time in hell dealing with such problems and I don't care about fictional teens who go through "little" versions of the horrors I have endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. There were a few seconds of science fiction in the show. We see FINALLY a Proto-Cylon. This was good, but with a problem. His red point of view will close on an object of interest. We all know that Cylon eyebrows always scan back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world. The red point of view never ever stops back and forth. <br /> <br /> I really hope the authors fix this abuse before the second episode.
