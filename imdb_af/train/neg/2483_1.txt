Indescribable discombobulated turkey, a mix of anti-Nazi musical (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie Whodunit spoof with one big, big problem: it's deadly unfunny. In addition to the single digit I.Q. plot and dialogue, the most incredible aspect of "Lady ..." is the berserk casting. Gene Wilder (star and co-author) tries it hard: he plays a romantic lead (with his appearance !! and his age !! he and Woody Allen have to start a club for clueless, mirrorless aging comedians), and he try to move and be funny and attractive and smart, and try to sing and dance, and succeed in NO !! A Looong shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> For a while I thought I had a myopic fit, because everyone in the movie is saying Cherry Jones is this nice hot chick, and that Michael Cumpsty is this impossibly beautiful stallion! ! The man who plays Claire Bloom's male secretary is a modest naked thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion for the two leading ladies !! Mike Starr's over-the-top deserves to earn as one of the 10 most horrific appearances in recent film history as the most incompetent cop you ever saw. The saddest note is to see how wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa are completely ignored and gone. I hope both stars have paid their bills back home (and then dismiss their agents) with this flop. No wonder acting miracle Sukowa came back to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had in store for her! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a very bad movie from a very bad screenplay with a berserk casting director, study this one - otherwise stay away! - 1/10
