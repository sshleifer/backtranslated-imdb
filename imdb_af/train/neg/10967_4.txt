Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent movies. And I like low budget, B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I even like bad acting, plodding scripts, wood lines, unlikely situations, and the like. However, I didn't like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work on so many levels. For all the reasons previously listed, and many more. This includes the nonsense, blatant use of images of female genitalia. And the many relationships with male genitalia, in a very Freudian way. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that it is purely incompetent. Unlike some attempts to do something completely different. I mean any movie that takes years to film, but can't sustain the level of congruence and focus demanded by modern audiences. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination through the main character. However, this was meant to happen as we unfolded things on the screen. <br /> <br /> Being the only kindness that I can express is the image at the end, was wonderful. If it was used at the start, instead of the end, it could have allowed the movie to drop off where 2001 ended ... <br /> <br /> Too bad they didn't try. I just don't understand what was so important to this movie that it even had to be made. Was it the plot? That can not be. Were they the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I can live without knowing about Ed 15. Was that the dialogue? Emphatically, no. The music? Perhaps, but more likely, the uncontrolled ego of the principals must be stripped. <br /> <br /> Much better efforts have been made on the cutter floor.
