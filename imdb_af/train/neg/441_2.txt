We didn't do it on television in England, but I did it on YouTube over the internet. It's stupid, immature and boring! It's from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I never got into that cartoon, but I have to admit it better than that. The cartoonist has since done nothing for years. For Doug TenNapel, it's a return stroke and all the time low! The story is about three cats that inherit a house and a lot of money from their dead old lady master. They are argumentative and disagree on what they want to spend their money on. "BORING!" The animation is terrible. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they don't look like cats! Just strange animal monstrous creatures with big mouths, pointed teeth and bumpy eyes! The human and other animal characters are also really ugly! The theme song is awful and annoying! The stories are also paralyzed and are probably copied from older shows. It surprised me how this show received 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. Television is really not what it was! But now most of them are stupid, cheap and boring. Some of you on the site may not agree with me. This is a pity, but it is a total waste of money and a complete and total waste of your time and feels that Britain does not tolerate this crap (yes, if you have digital you need), but I do not So it's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it's very fortunate to get it because I gave the worst of other shows!).
