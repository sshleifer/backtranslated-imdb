Baby - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie that caused its downfall. It was released with lots of hype, but was badly hit and suffered serious financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to pay them personally for the losses incurred. Shortly after his release, he tried to risk politics, but failed. It is a very bad movie with terrible acting, bad quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from illness. I am one of the unfortunate souls Baba saw, first day first performance in the theater. The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theater before the break. Sorry, I would not recommend this one to anyone.
