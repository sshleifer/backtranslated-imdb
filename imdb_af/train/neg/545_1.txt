It is just ordinary Indian garbage that is turned out as a cinema. As Indians, we can be proud that we have the biggest movie industry, but it is also the worst. How can other poor countries have movies with real characters that challenge the opinions of their respective communities and we just keep pumping out garbage. Look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, look at the brilliant movies they have and we get to like Kisna! <br /> <br /> get real people, no wonder the international community generally laughs at India not theater.
