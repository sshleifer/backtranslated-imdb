This kind of storytelling is unacceptable. The only reason this movie is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 lines is because it has George Lucas on it, and it has the words "Star" and "Wars" in its title. It is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others out there, who have clearly made better films with a great story, writing and acting, but didn't get the credit. It's a travesty. <br /> <br /> First things first. The story. Anakin's evolution? There is nobody. Apart from a little makeup around the eyes, and a little screaming, there is no one. He gets young, stupid, cock Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in a single blow. The only thing that Darth Vader was consistent in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was almost everything he did, planning, fighting, calling it. The only consistent thing about Anakin observed in the prequel trilogy is its consistent stupidity. He even loses his body because of a little folly. <br /> <br /> What part of the Emperor Palpatine who tells him about Sith's legends does not indicate that the Emperor is a Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes used too many digital doubles. Everybody is flying everywhere in the house like teddy bears. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost every fighter has a rubbery digital double jump. <br /> <br /> In one particular scenic scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climax, they both actually stop in the middle of parrots and riposts, turning their seals a few times while the thumb falls apart. I realize the battles are being choreographed, but it just shook me in disbelief and horror. <br /> <br /> The writing was terrible. All the dialogue was of very low quality. The good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines, but it just wasn't enough. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. Too many special effects, plot holes larger than the center of the universe, and absolutely no insight into any of the characters. This is the biggest mistake of this movie: nothing new is being offered. We know the rough picture of everything, everything Lucas did, it was. <br /> <br /> We knew Anakin had lost its limbs. We knew Luke and Leia were brother and sister. We knew Luke was Anakin's son. We knew Obi-Wan and Yoda went out of exile. We knew everything. Nothing new is being offered in this movie. If it wanted all the fans, then it's okay, Lucas couldn't have gone wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin eventually becomes Darth Vader, and he asks for Padme and hears she is dead, he reaches out. His arms are uncomfortable and screaming. "No, ooooooooooooooooooooo." That scene shouted B-movie completely, and I expected half Darth Vader to go "DANGER ROBINSON, DANGER" at any time. It is what it is. A B-movie, disguised by a huge budget and an ultra-loyal fan base that will settle with everything, as the first two movies drew their standards to the wells of Earth.
