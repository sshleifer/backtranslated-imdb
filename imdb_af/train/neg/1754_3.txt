Why did Maria and Rhoda's history have to be so dire? Divorced women with careless girls. And why very little reference to the original display and characters? The daughter characters were stupid and uninteresting. Why can't there ever be girls who are like their mother on television? It makes sense that Mary leaves Minneapolis, and Rhoda will return to NYC, but why can't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars? It just seems a pity to remember such wonderful characters. It was good to see Maria and Rhoda together, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there is a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time she lights her old Mary Richards.
