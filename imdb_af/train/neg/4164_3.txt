<br /> <br /> What remains of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and hungry prey survivors. They have to eat insects and insects, or whatever, after a poison war or something, the human civilization has virtually wiped out. In these dark times one of the few people on earth can still live in comfort, we call it the All-Knowing Big Boss, have a good quest to prevent some secret traces of seeds from being released into the air. It seems that the All-Knowing Big Boss is the last person on earth to know that these tracks even exist. The tracks are far away from any living soul, and they are highly protected by very low deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> The All-Knowing Big Boss wants the secret tracks to remain in their secret protected containers. So, he plans to send in a macho action team to remove the trolleys from all the protective systems and secret locations. Sending people to the place of secret tracks no longer makes them a secret. By sending people to eliminate all the protective systems, the tracks can easily be released into the air. How about letting sleeping dogs lie?! <br /> <br /> The one pleasing feature of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu. As the unbeatable macho action team members with mechanical pace slow down predictable timing, Vivian Wu's charm makes the acceptable idea of ​​her old employer so keen on her. She is an object of love, an object of desire - a very credible concept! <br /> <br /> Fans of Vivian Wu may want to see an outstanding B-movie. She's been back a few years, called DINNER STORMLOOP. DINNER RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
