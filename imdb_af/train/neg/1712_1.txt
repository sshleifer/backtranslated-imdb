If Todd Sheets came out and admitted that this movie was meant to spoof the zombie genre, I would change my rating to eight. Try to imagine a movie where every scene, line and even every acting nuance is designed to be a parody. I can probably get alphabet soup, rearrange what is left of the letters, and still have a better script. Two scenes in particular come to mind when I think of this movie. WASTE WARNING! One is when Mike's father and the other dad walk, I repeat, walk a staircase of jam full of zombies. It is a small step and although they brush against the flailing dead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the old marine turns around, saying, "God, you're a horde of bastards," and just shoot one. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabbed a zombie with a cup and was immediately surrounded. The camera moves around her for about forty seconds, surrounded by an arm's length by zombies. She then walked out of the crowd almost immediately and joined the other people. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes should be seen as believed. Yet I enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so funny. Kudos to Todd Sheets to get as many people in his movie and have the ride to make it, but not really for anything else.
