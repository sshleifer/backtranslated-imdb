Really show that hype is not everything. Show through and through what a crappy actor is abhishek and become movie only because of his father and his wife. Amitabh is always solid. Ajay Devgan is always scary and useless and the new man is joking. The front lady is such a waste of an actor. Such a pathetic movie of such a reverent director and of such a large industry. With movies as such, I reduced the amount of bollywood movies I see. <br /> <br /> For some time, RGVs have made many crappy movies. Time to get different actors. Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back. Every other front lady wants to be a half-naked one. Pffffft.
