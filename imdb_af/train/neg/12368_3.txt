"Well, Chuck Jones is dead, leaving his characters grounded by adding cheap explosions, an American anime style, and giving them superpowers." "But sir?" haven't we all ready, have we already had several shows in the works that have been so many? Much less, do not drive everything about their original dreams. "Yes! And those shows make us a lot of money, and we need more!" "But will not every woman and child, who grew up with this age fewer characters, be annoyed?" "Hay you are right! Set it in the future, make them all descendants of the original characters, and change all the names slightly ... but not too much, but we still have to slow down the success of the classic." <br /> <br /> Well, that's the only reason I can think of why it even exists. Looking past the terrible desecration of our beloved Looney Toons, it looks like an OK show. But then there are all the teen titans, which is the same bloody thing. All the characters are dressed like batman, they drive around in a kind of airliner. They have superpowers, they have superpowers. The only difference is that they speak like the Looney songs and have similar names and characteristics. <br /> <br /> This kind of thing falls into the "it's so ridiculous, it's good" kind of category. Think of the Super Mario brother's movie, and Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons, it goes out. If you are of the younger generation (who is actually supposed to do this) and can watch, send the greedy drivers shamelessly, run with them and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this cartoon, I don't have a problem with you, these are the people who calculated this thing together that I'm angry with. You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car; This show is like a serious robbery. They can also have unearthed all the people who were involved in the original cartoon, moved them to a screen, dressed them in "If this show didn't use characters (those who didn't look the Looney Toons anyway) not) what the studios have already made millions, would be fine. But no! For shameful Warner brothers, for shame. <br /> <br /> If I saw this thing as a 30-second gag on an episode of the Simpson or Family Guy, I'd love it. As it is, I just can't believe it was ever made. I'll bet anyone that 80% of people working on this show hate it. But whatever that doesn't matter, in 10 years will this show be forgotten while the original will remain forever? Or at least to the world ends. <br /> <br /> "Come 2008, Snoopy and The Peanut Strip is back, and now they have freaking lasers and can become invisible! Can Charley Brown defeat the evil alien warlord Zapar? Tune in and sea."
