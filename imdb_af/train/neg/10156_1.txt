She spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her breasts. It was pretty tight. Before and after the movie blows a lot. The acting is like E-list and it is well displayed in the movie. Not to mention, it's such a low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. The whole movie looks like it's shot with a camcorder instead of half-way decent movie. The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Unlike seeing this movie at Blockbuster, everyone likes it behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should be evaluated spiritually.
