On Steve Irwin's performance he is hilarious. He didn't even try to be funny and he was just, but his movie wasn't even what I would call a movie. I mean if that man on his car tries to kill him, he just says, "Oh, it's a nasty guy!" And look straight into the camera. He put his face in the camera too much! And then, if the man falls out of the car, won't you expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst acting I've ever seen! Like when the crocodile had almost eaten Steve, she just said "Steve." She wasn't scared or anything, it was just Steve. I mean I hate to mean, but it wasn't worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin, but his movie was just too stupid.
