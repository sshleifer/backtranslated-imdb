THIS OVERVIEW IS MORE ALL THE SPOILERS. If you plan to enjoy this movie, don't read this review. <br /> <br /> This is the problem with kids TV these days. It's all so condescending and derogatory. "Wow, it was fun, wasn't it?" No, it wasn't. And it also seems to have penetrated into children's films. And that's what Flight of the Reindeer is about. I haven't seen Flight of the Reindeer for a few years, so sometimes I can be uncomfortable on some points, but I remember being thoroughly undefeated. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story follows a lecturer who gave a book for Christmas. Now the lecturer is a valued scientist on the flying habits of an animal. I think it was bullfrogs. Anyway, through this book, Mr. Lecturer / relative that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs. Apparently, this book was written hundreds of years ago by a scientist who disappeared in the North Pole. Now, if that were me, I'd have thrown the book out of the nearest window. Flying bullfrogs is a natural phenomenon, but aerodrome is a fantastic and totally unrealistic concept. But the lecturer is not me, so I think it explains why he decides to fly to the north pole to leave his wife and child home without any idea where he is gone. Of course things are going wrong and before he knows it, a flying reindeer crashed into his private plane and was stranded in the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following it? Good. <br /> <br /> Of course his family was devastated. I would also be, I mean, a difficult Christmas. Elsewhere, the lecturer finds himself in a hidden village in the North Pole, inhabited by midgets and a tyrannical figure dressing only in red and white. Rather than escape immediately, I greet everyone with open arms as I did. This hidden civilization of midget samples, and he greets them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They tell him this is the eleven of Santa Claus and they spend kids all year round toys they have no idea. And the lecturer accepts it all. He even accepts that Santa Claus is in fact the scientist who has disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever. There is only one problem - they don't want him to get away. The world cannot know their secret existence. Finally, before they know it, there is a McDonalds and a Starbucks at every corner. <br /> <br /> Still with me? <br /> <br /> Now, sir, my old man's family finds the book and assumes he's gone to the North Pole. Boy, wouldn't they be ashamed if they found out he had just gone for a quick walk? Before the audience knows it, they are spending a Christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet. Meanwhile, Mr. Lecturer sick of all the pride and decides to leave. I can't remember exactly, but I remember him holding the Santa. A firefighting occurs when the midgets attack and he can escape via Santa's sled. With Santa warm on his heels and with bloodlust in his eyes, Mr Whatever, through a wonderful co-incident, finds himself flying alongside his family's plane looking for him. So he jumps up to their plane, the planes fly back and everyone happily ever stays. <br /> <br /> The fact is that there is Christmas in the years, but because they are typical of those festive charms they get away with. And it's the charm that is completely without 'Flight of the Reindeer'. There is not much wrong with it; nothing that insults the intelligence (well, of course there is, but it is a children's movie and can thus get away with such things) or something particularly offensive, but the problem is that there is also nothing right. It just doesn't feel Christmassy. And for a movie that is all about Christmas, it's a big mistake. But hey, I don't think about Flight of the Reindeer's target audience? Why should they? They are all so dipped in tranquilizers that they probably can't play 'Christmas' <br /> <br /> I give it three out of ten. If it were a TV movie, I would add two more stars to it. We all know how bad they can get.
