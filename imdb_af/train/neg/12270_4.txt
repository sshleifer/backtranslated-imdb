This Kiyoshi Kurosawa ghost film is pretty wild, and it had at least one jolt that caught me off guard. But the movie is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to find an alleged ceremony, just to find out he has committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous Asian lady, and has no idea why (and not the viewer). As other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused as the murderers are easily found, and this ghost is for some reason. Not only is the plot completely silly, the women's spirit is more funny than anything, especially if she suddenly flies over the city, like Wonder Woman. And the end makes little sense, in fact, the whole movie makes little sense and I can't recommend it at all. If it wasn't that serious, I'd think it was a black comedy. Outside "Bright Future" it is the worst movie that Kiyoshi Kurosawa directed. I still saw it.
