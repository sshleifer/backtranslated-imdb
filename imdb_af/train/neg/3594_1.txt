It's not a horror movie, but a boring movie. A very bad movie that should be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot, terrible acting and annoying music. If you just look at the trailer, you'll know enough. It is a pity that such things are available on VHS or video, while so many good movies are unavailable. If you like vampires, try the Hammer Productions or the Italian Gothic by Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti. These are masterpieces when compared to this trash. Rating = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with this opinion.
