I watched this movie because I love Nicolas Cage and I found it strange and totally useless ... so I decided to brush a little and get my hands on the 70th copy. Wow. what a difference The original was better. I want you all to know that it originally made a statement, it had a purpose. It really was the Christian public who expressed their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper, it also makes comments on life, but I don't want to go into details. Simply put, if you were disappointed and you want to know what it looks like, feel free to dat the 70s version, a bit better, but a lot better.
