I thought I would never find a horror movie as bad as "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre" but competing this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person falling asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started. I woke up and started watching agian. Why did I earn it? All the movie was a torture, I have to use fast to see it completely. <br /> <br /> I can't stand why one of my favorite actors of all time (MR WALKEN) could do this thing. I have to think that he made the director a favor, or he really needed money because he rolls film to film, he destroys himself; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> What about the movie? It's not scary, dumb plot, characters are terrible (but I really like the one Jared Harris played), the effects are very poor, lack of death and blood, etc. in three words it has anything. And I mean it. Can't figure out how a director can make such a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I was more disappointed when I watched the video cover, Stephen King presented the film. Think he can never offer this crap, no? (I rented it in Argentina). I don't recommend it in a million years. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie with a 2 out of 10. (As I say in my review of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there will always be a worse one, movies, that's why it's not a 1 10)
