It's incredible! .. someone wrote to me that it was a time to sit and watch this movie. it is! Don't do it! I'm completely arranged! I love Wesley Snipes, and I found it funny that he played his name in a movie. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (just for granted at home) but now (just after that) I'm absolutely disappointed! It was his worst movie ever. Inwatchable !! Bad actor play! Bad cameraman! Bad scenario! Just one good thought: that wonderful girl! Must be a manikin! Eeeeh !! MB 10 lines minimum?! I no longer want to waste your time reading my opinion! I hope I was clear and unstable because English is not my native language. So has timetable, and see good movies, as I also try. Peace!
