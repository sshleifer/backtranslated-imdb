Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His films are asinine and amateurish, and just not very funny unless you are 14 years old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /> <br /> He's definitely not known, as his immature fans would like to believe you, by bothering people on Wikipedia or filling in the ratings here at the IMDb. He is certainly not profiled by any major media sales, which speaks volumes about his and his creation's celebrity. <br /> <br /> Benfer has a little skill with limited animation, but he has to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write real funny material before being seriously considered a real entertainer. From now on, he's just a kid with a camera, and it shows.
