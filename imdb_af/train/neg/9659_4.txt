After watching this movie, I was honestly disappointed - not because of the actors, story or direction. I was disappointed with these movie ads. <br /> <br /> The trailers pointed out that the battalion "chose the third way out" other than giving up or dying (Polish information was even wrong that they had the choice of having their own artillery or German killing guns, they even translated the title incorrectly as a misplaced battalion). The disappointment started when I realized that the third way was to just sit down and count shoots, then sit down and count shoots. Then I began to think, "Hello, this story can't be that simple. I bet this clever officer will find a cunning way to save what's left of his troops." Well, he didn't, they just sat waiting for something to happen. And so I was. <br /> <br /> The story was based on actual events of the First World War, so that the authors couldn't use much of their imagination, but even thought I had this movie really inconspicuous and even a little boring. And as I wrote in the first place, it's not the fault of actors, writers or directors. Their marketing staff increased my expectations high above the level this movie could handle.
