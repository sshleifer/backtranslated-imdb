I just watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But it's not SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some nice characters and made sense. Bullfighter had nothing of this. <br /> <br /> I had to realize that it might not be good because the always painful bad Michelle Forbes played a leading role. <br /> <br /> One poster here called the movie. incoherent. Another mentioned the worst movie ever. Both gave the film too much credit. I'm so glad I got it free from the library, but I still feel ripped off. <brD> IMDb should include a "0" in "rate this movie" voice, just for movies like this one.
