After completing the book on the same day, I knew what was supposed to happen. I had high expectations of the movie due to the rating. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was okay to be a movie. I have a few key points to keep this movie out. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. The decisive. Jack Nicholson barely fits in to Jack Torrence's character. Also, I'd never have chosen Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I depicted Wendy very differently. I can see why they have chosen Jack Nicholson, the smile, the pointy eyebrows, but he is not supposed to be really angry. He must look normal, and he gets angry. They also make one of the worst movies. Danny was good, but he needed even more life. He acted after droney. <br /> <br /> 2. The script. They cut out so many things in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book I was in the movie were either removed, changed or handled incorrectly. Some of the things in the book I was looking at (the hedgehogs, the roque mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie and it was 2 and a half hours !! I was very irritated. <br /> <br /> 3. The end. The end was completely changed, Halorann was dead, Jack fell dead, Wendy never hurt. The review didn't blow up. The end was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so badly, I was apostate. Hallorann was never supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, Jack had at least a roque hammer. You've never seen a roque mallet during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> There are other things I don't like about the movie, but there are things right. The camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book to not be scared at all. I recommend reading the book before watching this movie. I welcome Stephen King because he actually agreed to sign a contract not to be Stanley Kubrik anymore. I would never have done it, I would have taken all the rights I could scream at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6-hour version, at least it has the hedgehogs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
