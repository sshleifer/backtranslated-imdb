I love all kinds of movies, especially horror. It is said that Survival does not meet any of the hype surrounding it. <br /> <br /> I can't give any points about originality. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes, or remembering what others have done. It has just become a policeman for indie movies to take us on a shooting trip through the forest, a mad killer, and to throw in some crazy family lately. That way, I have to compare it to the Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (though the twist in that one is obvious), and others. Survival falls short on comparable films. The plot was by no means original. Some movies can have a weak (and outdated) plot with great acting, special fx or quite a few other factors. Survivors do not have any of these. If you like, note the following: The play in the movie never kicked off. I'm not the actors or the director. The dialogue was at its best mediocre, and those involved never showed the talent to pull it off. I call 2 standouts. The front man in this movie certainly has the look, but I seriously think he should consider more training before getting ready to wear a movie. The actor who portrayed Greg also has potential, but we never saw it (look at the movie to see why, you won't believe it.). <br /> <br /> The grain film looks. Oh yeah, that little bit of movie maker designed to take us to the glory days of "Grindhouse" movies. In today's film, it has become a gimmick. It works or not. In this case, it just doesn't work. There are too many other errors going on, so it is alternating from the movie without adding it. That said, I think they did a good job of adding the grain. It's some good, quality grain. I think with another script, better direction, and possibly actors, they have to try another "Grindhouse" attempt. They'll probably break it down. <br /> <br /> As far as the technological aspects are concerned, they never liked me as well. Better care could be taken with sound (sounds like it was fed directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with it) and being shot at DV was too soft for my taste. <br /> <br /> That's all I have to say about it .....
