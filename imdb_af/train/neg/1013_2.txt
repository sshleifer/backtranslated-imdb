If you watched this movie, you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe !!! Each time they said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed and thought, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie?" I can't believe how Oscar winners such as Freeman and Spacey have appeared in the background, while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaful acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a great fun of him ... but I really prefer an actor, not this Android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was level, hollow and annoying like hell. I was happy when they were both in the street. <br /> <br /> The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining, but I think Timberlake has ruined it all. It would have been very enjoyable without him. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was OK but suddenly the music appeared every time, the movie turned into an MTV video clip with flashes, low motion and such things. . Something that was misplaced for this police film, I thought. Maybe they wanted to make an MTV video clip for Timberlake.
