This God abandoned movie is about three dumb millionaires that a lot of people come together to play a deadly game and the winner gets a million dollars. First, the play is terrible, and the film makes absolutely no sense. It's not scary at least, it's so stupid that it made me laugh. That's why it earned the 1 star. The film is not violent at all, but is pretty messy and focuses most on women's breasts. , and some of the characters are very annoying and clever. Plus, the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that just makes you want to throw something on the screen. Last but not least, the end is terrible. I don't want to give it away if you're actually curious enough to see this piece of junk. Avoid all costs !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not marked (but should be R) for Nudity, Profanity and Mild Gore.
