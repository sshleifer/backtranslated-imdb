So, I know I voted 1 out of 10, but really do not deserve more than half a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can't believe one of the stars signed up to make this ridiculously absurd project. <br /> <br /> James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were great in their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good, but the story sucked and I encourage someone who sees it in the video store, not even picking it to read the back cover, but just walking away. I don't even want one. to enter into what the movie is about, because it's too stupid to ignore. <br /> <br /> Don't rent it! It's awful! Awful!
