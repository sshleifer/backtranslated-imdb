Despite what many other people thought of the first movie, I really liked it. This one however. How to sum it up in one word: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's see it in part: Here's the plot: Finally, the old queen was removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has another kind of problem: The court hunter, the father of her son, got lost, as the super splash goes to the extreme, his gray hair struggles and sells the royal offspring for blonde and full hair. In her despair, Snow White seeks the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees), who first has to find his other six companions and then try to find the royal descendants or at least try to find the name Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot appears to be written on a weekend, where the authors were very drunk but just under pressure from the studio to write the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other actors, it's really not worth buying the DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves at least the movie of full oblivion is the actions of some of the actors. That's why I gave the move 3/10. Unfortunately, the writing is so bad that none of the actors or all of them can be combined for the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at one point they even go over into our reality and unhappy. <br /> <br /> Many more actors in this movie: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as the mirror, Helge Schneider and much more, but unfortunately all these comedians are unable to kill this really bad writing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's a surprise to some hardcore fans, but for regular moviegoers or now DVD Renters or buyers it's not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I'm even sorry to rent the movie.
