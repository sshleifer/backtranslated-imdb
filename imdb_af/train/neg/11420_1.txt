St Elmo's Fire has no influence on life to the university (for the majority of our ordinary people anyway). Why was this garbage even made? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I really feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script. There are some talented young actors in this "movie" who did a good job elsewhere. It should have been just one whole joke for them on the set. <br /> <br /> I actually found this "movie" insulting to my intelligence. The only joy I got from this is the hope that Mr. John Hughes had a great time when he saw it in the same year. His masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I've made to view it because you're enjoying 80's movies. It's really so offensive to the genre.
