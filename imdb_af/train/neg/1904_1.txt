=== small spoilers === <br /> <br /> I'm, like many others, a big Jerry Bruckheimer fan. When I saw all the beautiful posters hanging from the front and the trailer ahead of MI: 2, expectations had risen. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Big cars. Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar-Angelina Jolie. What can possibly go wrong? Very. <br /> <br /> The writing is not funny (it really tries to be difficult) or exciting. You sit in a black person who constantly makes racial jokes about himself and Wooh-haha !! you have comedy? I do not think so. Excitement is completely out of the picture. First of all (and this is probably said many times) there are no sympathetic characters, so who cares who is killed? If you can alleviate the prospect of a psychiatrist killing Nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) is walking with Nic in the streets again. Is this excitement? Don't think. Then comes the best bit - the romance between Nic and Angelina. She actually seems bored to explain all these stupid lines to Nic. "Do you have a girl?" "Do you see someone?" "What went wrong?" etc. <br /> <br /> Then there's just one glimmer of hope: the car is chasing. They are disappointing to say the least because the trailer seemed to be full of them, and there was only one. A very long one, caught in an annoying, hasty camera movement. I struggled to follow the action. <br /> <br /> So is this an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - It is not necessary to decide, just avoid this terrible mess. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel I'm generous.
