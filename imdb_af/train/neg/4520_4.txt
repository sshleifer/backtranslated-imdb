Irwin Allen was wonderful. All his TV shows had a good pilot or first episode. the rest were really ripe offs from his other shows. Some episodes of the Swiss family Robinson were rip offs from his older TV shows. One episode of Swiss family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a party member needs a schedule operation. The show was a high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin loses touch with TV shows after the 60s. The play is strong with Martin Milner. Child stars started with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. One clear place is when Irwin Allen incorporates his ramparts like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption that teaches him the "Master of Disaster".
