I really wanted to see this movie in the theater. It's actually sold out. I actually saw Solaris, which was actually the worst movie to be released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough street pharmacist's kid is being shot, so he decides to clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to go well until Jack conquers his village with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). It happened very late in the movie, so it didn't reveal it in the preview. It might have been an interesting twist. But they did, so it's not. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is no single interesting thing about this movie; everything is given away in the preview. If you've even seen one preview, you've seen the whole movie, so you may just have a hard time thinking about filling in the gaps. Go to the site, download the preview, save yourself $ 3.99. There is no single surprise or twist in the whole movie, except how terribly the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone who was in control of the soundtrack was fired. Two times. Most of that was what music would be as the only songs to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets, and (I can disturb the space of the space-time continuum with a concept of mind) had less talent and musical ability . <br /> <br /> The acting is at its best, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% rigid and 33% ziploc. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) The rest of the roll with his acting abilities.
