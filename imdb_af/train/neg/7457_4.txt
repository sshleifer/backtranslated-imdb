Chris Kattan is a great sketch actor on Saturday Night Live ... but he should probably leave the film industry unless he gets some creative control. He plays an annoying, fiery character, who basically comes off as a moderately delayed and on speed. Want to know the only funny parts? The stuff they showed in the previews. Yes, his performance to tackle me is funny. Nothing else is. Especially if you can say he is trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he should not try because he is one. And yet, she's "breaking down the vet's office" bit off as terribly bad. This movie made me see an eye-catcher. Avoid it at all costs, and keep watching SNL.
