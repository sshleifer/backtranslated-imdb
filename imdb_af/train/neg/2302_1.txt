Hearing some interesting things our combat story healer, Pat, his son Gordon (TV ministry looks like a family business) and Terry Meeuwsen (Won Miss America in 1973 wearing a swimsuit and showing her legs). Oh, my kindness!) Say when our poor viewers are ill and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. A person with an abscessed right tooth has just been healed. Someone with "twisted intestines" is healed. Then Terry said there was a person with a "strange condition" (You mean God doesn't know?) A burning bones just healed. Then Gordon said there was a man (it narrowed it!) With swelling of the sinuses in his right cheek, with much pain behind the right eye, but he was healed now. Anyone with a problematic right hip, limited mobility of stroke, is now able to walk. 6. Terry said she had seen someone with severe stiffness in the neck, but didn't know the exact ailment (God doesn't know?) - that the person was healed now. 7. Someone paralyzed to the right, especially (Not exactly?!) The right side of the face is now healed. A man (who reduces the world population again) With a plate in his skull, there are constant problems, and the doctors just don't know what to do. Terry said she saw the bone reform around the plate (the funny leg?) And the man's pain was gone, he was healed now. <br /> <br /> Recognize how our war hero Pat helps our sick and poor people. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas, but it decreases it.) Who has a sinus that the Lord dries it, thank Jesus now. 2. There is a man with a financial need. I think a hundred thousand dollars. (I think they should go to school!). That need is now met, and within three days the money will be provided. through the miraculous power of the holy spirit. Thanks Jesus. 3. There is a woman in Cincinnati with cancer of the lymph nodes. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it's already diagnosed (Ask your friendly Pat!), but you didn't feel well, and the Lord is solving the cancer! (What?!) 4. There is a lady in Saskatoon (I accept Canada.) In a wheelchair curvature of the spine, the Lord is straight what we are now, and you can get up and walk! (If you ignore this condition Pat!) Just claim it and it's yours. Thank you, Jesus! Amen, Amen! <br /> <br /> When did Pat Robertson have prostate cancer, did he go to Peter Popoff, Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, Terry or Gordon? No! On February 17, 2003, Pat went to a real doctor to have his surgery! (You mean he doesn't trust his beloved friends, Terry or his own son Gordon?!) When LT Pat Robertson was in the Marines during the Korean War, he was a liquor officer, responsible for keeping the liquor-supplied officers. He was known to drink himself and regular prostitutes, and he feared he would contact gonorrhea. (Need a faith healer for help!) <br /> <br /> The reason Pat came out of the fight was because his father, Absalom Willis Robertson (D Va from 1946-66) was chairman of the Senate Military Credit Committee. <br /> <br /> Terrorist Attacks, September 11, 2001 We found ourselves innocent and consumed by the pursuit of health, wealth (Pats worth between 150 and 200 million people!) Material Pleasure (a mansion in Virginia Beach Virginia with a helicopter launching platform!) And sexuality (He slaughtered his future wife before the marriage they had a son!). It happens (Terrorism) because God lifts his protection from us. (Statement released on September 13, 2001.) Pat Robertson reminds me of Burgermeister on Santa Claus Come to Town and his evil vengeance reminds me of Venger on Dungeons And Dragons. <br /> <br /> Pamper Gordon does what Pa told him and Terry is a paid yes woman who doesn't have their own minds! <br /> <br /> It will really grab you! The September 5, 2005 issue of The 700 Club included a report, Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent Gary Lane, from outside the New Orleans Conference Center, which housed mostly impoverished black disaster victims over the weekend. A number of belongings left behind indicate the disposition of some of the evacuated "Lane said" they included this voodo observer with the words: "May the curse be with you." A slice of a plastic cup teaser cup from one of the New Orleans numerous shopping malls appeared on the screen. "Also music CDs titled Guerrilla Warfare and Thugs 'R' Us." Lane said, a pile of rap CDs that had been poached on the ground pointed out. (His fianc√© father Absalom has taught Pat racism well!) <br /> <br /> If any of your good people ever thinks of the donation to these sexist preachers, do not do so in the name of God! Sponsor a softball or basketball team, give in to a food rack, be a big brother or sister to a child, but please don't give these people over because they've been around for over 40 years and haven't solved anything. <br /> <br /> If you still don't believe, tap Pat Robertson during commercial break on the web and hit search and if you first hear what hes really likes, I know for sure. that you will not give one cent to these liars! And, incidentally, Terry had a divorce once, and Pat has talked to his divorce cases many times. <br /> <br /> I want to say the people in Dover Pennsylvania, Orlando Florida, and the nice people who were hit by Hurricane Katrina and I hope this is a pleasant day. Does Operation Blessing Use New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Please let our readers know! I do! Incidentally, people if you are ill, go to a real doctor and let everyone laugh at these liars and Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry may one day go and take their evil God Venger with them!
