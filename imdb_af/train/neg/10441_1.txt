I stopped watching this POS as the snakes took over the plane. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought it should be a "one" for comic relief. But then I realized I could only watch the three stooges for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> What respect I also had for Samuel Jackson was irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood once again shows how removed from reality they really are. When I was a kid, we caught some snakes. The only thing snakes will do is at the bottom of the freight bay. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon hats can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a trip for Blockbuster. Be warned: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is stupid. <br /> <br /> If you really want to be scared, I suggest the descent. If you want humor, go to your local stand-up comedy club. Their worst artist will be a million times better than this trash.
