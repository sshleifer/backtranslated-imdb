"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" is the worst movie ever made, even the whiteless "Plan 9 from outer space." At least that movie was just awkward; The Lampoon film, on the other hand, is improper and common. Once, films used to respect their audience's intelligence. However, this one has a greasy, decaying carcass to our faces - and then try to rub our noses into it. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are. the latest scenes; And I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash a little meat, and this is great meat. But the directors do not realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it. There is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Perversely, the filmmakers save the worst for the last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays a young elderly police officer who appears at work on his first day. He is accompanied by a tired, cynical antique car played by Richard Widmark. For a moment we hope this movie will end in triumph. Certainly, we think, the youngster's mocking attitude will rub on the cynic and change him to the better. <br /> <br /> Lost hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the young man's spark is cursed forever. "National Lampoon goes to the movies" and goes straight to the toilet and asks us to follow it in the drain. Nominally, it is a comedy. But where is the humor?
