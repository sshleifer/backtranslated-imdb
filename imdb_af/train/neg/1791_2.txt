What is the beginning of the dark video and sporadically throughout the film? It is as if someone is putting muddy water on the lens of the camera. <br /> <br /> The violence and nudity can turn some people off, but, along with the mostly bad acting, is what makes a good cult movie I suppose. /> <br /> My favorite line was delivered by Tarquin the Vampire, "Oh, your race is stupid." Okay, no one should ever say in a movie line unless they are English and live in the 18th century. <br /> <br /> The play of the Van Helsing character and bad girl "Rally" is not bad. I also love Little Little played by Ron Little. Evil martial arts! Don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it.
