Warning Spoilers Next. Wonderful recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, blaspheming! Scandalous! Caught in Canada; presumably by a large Canadian crew and throw. I recently caught the last half of this movie on global television here in Canada. Nothing else to say, but how terribly distressed I was about what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda is; and with Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that Canadian-born director Roger Spottiswoode was forced to make the VSF the heroes of the movie if it were actually the true rescuers where a small private airline is located in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
