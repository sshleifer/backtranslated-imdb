STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> This second installment of the Che movies moves the story forward until late 60s, where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of South America, without enough food and water and with tension between the group. Everything comes up if he crosses the border to Bolivia and the government forces push their campaign to bring him down. <br /> <br /> Without the flash between time and place of the last movie, Soderbergh's second installment focuses solely on the action in the hills, and manages an even dimmer experience. And more pretentious, the score is drowned, giving the second installment more of an unwanted air of art that seems so alienated. There is only an unwavering boredom of the film that never comes up. You can't pinpoint Soderbergh's ambition or Del Toro's drive in the lead. It's just a pity that something in the production could take such a disappointing turn. **
