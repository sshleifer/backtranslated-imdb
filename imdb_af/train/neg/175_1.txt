I watched the Cape tonight at the lake on the USA. Considering this movie was made for TV was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I vote for the air tonight and was very disappointed. I knew I didn't like the movie, but I didn't expect to be confused by using DV (digital video). The film would have been acceptable if it were not for these contradictory digital shots coming from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied to these shots, but there was no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE NEXT MAY BE A SPOILER !!!!) The open end in the cabin at the lake was acceptable, but the open end of the successor is ridiculous. I can only return from returning to the cabin provided by the lake that can be watched if the movie is confronted with nothing but infomercials at 4am in the morning.
