Oh, the healer! Oh, the joy! Another movie that's so bad is good! Or so I thought. In fact, this one misses the "so bad good" phase and unfortunately goes straight to the "could have been so bad, it was good, but they screwed it and made it uncomfortable." <br /> <br /> For a start she's gone too long. Cut half an hour and it could have been more recoverable. Then place such ridiculous plots as "the man who sabotages the mission to save the earth, for he has saved all the food and he will be rich if the mission fails!". Duh! Or the "Talk bomb" plot last seen in Dark Star. Guess what .... like in Dark Star, the bomb has a malfunction ..... hmmmm. Add in a piece "We can't play from a kindergarten" and you have a solar crisis in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> Light relief should be in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we mentioned in this movie), whose only purpose in the movie is to drive a child to the desert and call the child's father to finally pick him up. Between driving and calling, Jack throws senseless drives and files and funnels a lot, but adds little to the story as it is. In short, he is the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> My award for "The Most Ironic Line Delivered Straight-Faced" goes to Charlton Heston, who, when he first met his eldest son for centuries. , says his son looks a little out of shape as he stands there with his belly over his waist and in need of a captain Kirk Korset. Also amusing is the bad man's top man, who has a bright white hairstyle that reminds me of Andy Warhol, for some reason. <br /> <br /> Apart from these hilarious, little is recommended to recommend this movie. The end is a sequence of (but merely shorter than) the end series of 2001. <br /> <br /> Tips to enjoy this movie more, if you are foolish enough to watch it, as I did: < br /> <br /> 1. Any time the bomb speaks, think it's called Tarquin (Trust me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. When Chuck Heston appears on the screen and talks to talk, pre-empt him by repeating a line of the Planet of the Apes like "Get your dirty feet off me!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. When the female lead is emphasized (that's most of the time), hope is hoping she has an aneurysm and will soon die. <br /> <br /> 4. During the unmistakable "boat is breaking again" scenes, hope that technology / engineers will emit a Scotty ism like: "You can change the laws of physics! " or such a crap. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, do what you need to get through this one. I was halfway through and waking up to realize that I had missed nothing, and neither had the plot progressed (legally, though it was). So don't worry about delaying a few, you won't miss anything.
