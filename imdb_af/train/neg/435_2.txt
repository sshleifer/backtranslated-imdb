An old intellectual talks about what he sees in movies. You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and other things before the 80's. To blame him for not knowing what he's doing in the theater today, he throws The Matrix. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the same lame movie-as-art. This speech is reduced to obsolete psychological platitudes: this ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> <br /> The cheese-like effect of Zizte being processed in the movies he takes over is guaranteed. For someone who is supposed to get to know a lot of movies, his own cinematographic: yeah. <br /> <br /> To put it in Zizek's own words, I have 5 \ t 7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a big movie maker: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizek), which you just said, is one of the worst idiotic things I've ever heard. At no time in your stray, disjointed reaction were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now stupid because they listened to it. I give you (two) points (only), and may God be merciful to you.
