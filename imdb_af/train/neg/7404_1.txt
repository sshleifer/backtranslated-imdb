I initially got interest in this movie after reading a review and said the movie reminded Silent Hill's reviewer. <br /> <br /> Being a great Silent Hill fan and disappointed with his movie debut, I thought I'd give this one a chance. Mind, Fearnet calls this movie only "Dark floors", not by full name. So when I saw the name "Lord Lordi" in the credits, I immediately thought of the group (I had some friends in college like them) but didn't think it was important and immediately pushed the thought . <Br /> <br /> The movie is getting strong. In spite of the fact that a flu little girl was killed, the good use of sound and sense of isolation really started to combine the story. The tense atmosphere built fast, and every indication pointed out that the film was excellent. As monsters are the real stars of horror, I couldn't wait to see what hung in the hospital's halls. The main characters caught up with themselves. <br /> <br /> And then the first sample showed up, and I got myself very underweight. By the time the second appeared, I was bothered by the fact that it just seemed to have come from a Megadeth concert, and the sotiness had completely disappeared. <br /> <br /> In the course of the movie, the atmosphere remained intact, and the story surprised you, just what was going on, but the horrors were not quite there. However, I expressed hope that the end will make it all worthwhile. Unfortunately, this was not the case. By the time the movie reached its peak, I was in disbelief, and I immediately recognized the big bad in his last revelation ... Lordi's lead singer? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Was that what the movie boiled? A lot of poor souls are chased by Lordi members by a hospital? The silly monster design suddenly made sense. If you are going to be so ugly, it may also be in the Marilyn Manson, or even KISS members. Not to mention the fact that I'm pretty sure I've seen the end in one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago. They had to go and make a whole movie of it? <br /> <br /> The worst of all, when I found out what was really going on, was everything I could manage, a gift. I'm not going to ruin it for you, but I can safely say it's probably a plot device you've seen before. Probably more than once. <br /> <br /> So unless you're a big Lordi fan, stay away from this. It's not scary, it doesn't bring anything new to the table (though it makes a decent loan from other horror movies, especially Silent Hill). And I can't stress it enough, LORDI is the antagonist. Lordi. Talk about a buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Really, you'd better try to scare yourself into watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, it's just not possible.
