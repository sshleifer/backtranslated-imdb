Martin Kosleck's peculiar charisma brings some credibility to his character from the frustrated artist. He embraces his dialogue with a strange realism, which makes sculptor Marcel a convincing individual. The character succeeds in coming over as a real person and not so much a typical B-movie crap. <br /> <br /> The story line is nothing to write home about, and many scenes are boring. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper. Kosleck's talk-friendly, philosophical character is confronted with Hatton's low key, monosillabic approach. The character of the Creeper has not developed much further than a basic sample level, but Hatton presents undeveloped possibilities and puts you wonderfully over his back story. <br /> <br /> This movie was on Shock Theater a lot when I was a kid, so I have some nostalgic love for it. Anyway, it's worth seeing for those who enjoy Forties horror movies.
