Hey Arnold! is a slow and slightly boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) buys all the cheap, low prices for building a huge shopping mall, shopping mall and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s children's movies. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is also not very exciting, so the idea of ​​him as the bad man is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the film is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal have to find the document with the shelter of Helga, whose father hopes to get rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids have to move around on buses, and so the exciting background where a bus is involved is not only stupid, but emphasizes how this movie is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times more sedated, and a great way to put someone, including kiddies to sleep. Hey Arnold was a difficult one to stay awake until the predictable and completely boring end. If you want to send your kids to a completely non-offensive movie, this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, manufacturers start with a 30 minute TV cartoon and try to expand it after 90 minutes. This Mall Story could definitely be covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will enter a better writer if there is ever a successor.
