Neat premise. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that it is uncomfortable to go to the weekend fast, while cabin might not be the best idea. I loved how Bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill without any injury! Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his gall. Oh, and the police never got the car or found the owner of the wreck. <br /> <br /> Many dragged scenes including a regular stripper (still nightmares from that scene). Poor assistant man and his crummy useless hand. I admit I was seeing what the mysterious "thing" was behind, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HA HA HA !! The girl was really sadistically angry about revival. Personally, I really want a new body for a great experience!
