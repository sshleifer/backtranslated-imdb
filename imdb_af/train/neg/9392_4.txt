... and Ethel Merman buffs will also love her hard, evil choir as the evil witch Mombi, but this cartoon sequel to The Wizard Of Oz is robbed of real imagination, replacing fantasy and excitement with noisy action (and cheap repetition of his stuff like a bad music video). Little Dorothy is beaten back to Oz, who is devastated, and meets old and new friends. The inelastic animation hangs somewhere between the worst Walt Disney and the less-inspired performances of Hanna-Barbera, but many of the songs are good, especially Dorothy's favorite song "It's a Far Away Land", excellent by Liza Minnelli. You can count on Minnelli for energy, and so the movie is perks when Dorothy is there. Much of it is irrevocable, and I'm not even sure baby boomers will get a complaint, as it's no longer available. As a curiosity item, just fair. ** of ****
