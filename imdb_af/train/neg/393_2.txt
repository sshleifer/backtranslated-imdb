For everyone who wants a remake of 1989's New York Slaves. What are you, seven of you? Here it was ... was. <br /> <br /> This undercooked movie has adult characters (well they are club children, sorry!) What is in holding patterns. The big question seems to be, how long can a young adult stay? It took three people to write this "story"? Good God, it was easier to come up with Citizen Kane. Rather than take back viewers, this movie should only embarrass someone who was a playwright in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a fifty-year-old woman has a lot of self-absorbed children from another era is the world as just self-absorbed, twenty somethings can represent it. The strange sidebar on library work is not the sub-plot expected from Parker Posey's Breakin 2: Electric Bugaloo equivalent. Her "I'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper grinds her, is hysterical. Posey's shtick is always amusing, but there are projects under her. I slept before it crossed the 40-minute point.
