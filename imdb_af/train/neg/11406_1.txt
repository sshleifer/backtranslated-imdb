But I came across it. For me it seemed as if even the author of the book Caroline benefited. I felt so sorry for the character Louise, and she was constantly compared to Esau who was angry. I just felt the comparison was a bit hard and unrealistic. Actually, the movie was bad. I really won't see it unless you're ready for a big deviation.
