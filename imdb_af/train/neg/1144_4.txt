Repetition: Dr. Markov has developed a new theory on how to produce energy, knowledge that the world can imbalance. He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and wants desperately from the Soviet Union. KGB on the other hand desperately wants the new technology. So, they set up a scheme. During a rescue effort to enter Markov, KGB stairs, Markov takes a secret spot and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in Sweden and work for the UN. As a backup, KGB kidnapped Markov's estranged daughter. CIA now sends their best agents, a (Swedish?) Ninjas team to destroy KGB and save Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comment: A cult film that despite the fact that it is not very good to see. The film is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas. First, it is very dark, probably to hide places and bad effects, that some scenes are difficult to understand. You can't see what happens. The second thing it lacks is martial arts, despite being a ninja movie. Certainly, there are some, of very poor quality, but mostly the ninjas burn automatic guns or sets of explosions. The automatic guns also create a problem as they seem to have an endless supply of ammunition. And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets, while Soviet guards die like flies. <br /> <br /> So what does it have? The idea and ambition first. Some actually, and especially for a Swedish movie, proper action scene, though not from martial arts. Some nice slow-motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore. And some very interesting new weapon technology that explodes the victims' heart or brain. Mostly all the parts you're looking for are in a B movie. <br /> <br /> Because it's definitely a B movie, there's no mistake. But if you expect it to look like a B movie, it's entertaining. But don't forget, it's not just a B-movie, it's in the eighties. Some girls, for example, except to wear ... can say "interesting" clothes, have deadly doses of eye shadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> In everything, look for cult status and ambition. Enjoy it and forget about it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
