"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented. This movie depicting his life had to have used a fictional character, because the overdramatized events are too much of a deviation from the facts and the chronology. Not only that, it ignores interesting information that includes other versions such as the public relations fiasco in Upstate N.Y. and its religious repentance. It is true that he was executed by Luciano, Lansky, et. al. but it is as far as it goes. Luciano's explosive record scene, which carries out the performance of Bo Weinberg in his own home, is supported by his own mother, is reasonable. There is also the scene in which the Dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to Legs Diamond. It just doesn't work. The character of Mrs. Fleggenheimer doesn't work either. This movie doesn't need a damn Jewish mother for comic relief. The lame performance of Legs Diamond was humorous enough. I'm sure the man turns into his grave. And at the same time the Dutch killed people, but he was not Rambo or 007. The scene in which he erases the brewery is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I just didn't get it.
