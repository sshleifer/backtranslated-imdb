Although I have been reviewing the movie for about two years, I remember exactly what made my mind so low as it did. Because I loved the original Little Mermaid, and could have been obsessed with mermaids as a child, I decided to take the time to sit down and watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a small message for you. If you didn't have the original director and actors ... just look for your shot. <br /> <br /> In the sequel, our story begins with a slightly older Ariel and her daughter, melody. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is great at singing and dancing numbers, but really, that's what Eric made my favorite prince. He was calm, collected, and a real man who knew how to have fun. And he did. NOT. SING. <br /> <br /> And then there's the villain. Oh, how can we forget the chills that pulled off our spine, when Ursula swallowed the screen, and scared Ariel and audiences around the world? Unfortunately, the gene was not transmitted to her seemingly useless sister, Morgana. Nothing was ever, ever said about Morgana in the first movie; She just didn't get anywhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh how cute. The younger sister is turned down and decides to kidnap a month-old baby instead of going to the trident. Look at me. <br /> <br /> Unlike being a flat character with no sense of originality in her, Morgana was very unorthodox. The same plan as her sister, the same minions (who are not frightening at all. ; I'd like to see Mom being the villain. I'm sure she would have done a better job than Little Miss Tish there. <br /> <br /> King Triton doesn't like the respect he earned from me in the first movie and doesn't even get started with Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a strict but loving father in the first movie, and in the second it was almost as if he had lost his will to fear in the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his "dingle-hopper" (yes, I will admit it; I called my fork a dingle hopper from time to time afterwards). In this movie, Scuttle is all but forgotten. A supporting character even at first, he added at least something to the movie. He was rich in a scent that the other had not, and in the successor they removed it entirely from him. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as worrying as before. Disney, don't do it. Don't even try to waste our favorite crab. Or our favorite little fat fish, who becomes a father and has a lot of annoying kids. He is fat, and he is slim, and he looks as if he is going to a flat line for a second. <br /> <br /> The walrus and penguin are unnecessary, and after a while you start to hurt everyone again. Especially Melody, who has no depth of her at all. <br /> <br /> And one of these days, Disney, I'm kicking off my life. <br /> <br /> If I didn't love, your original wasn't so much.
