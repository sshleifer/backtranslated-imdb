I picked up this video after reading the text on the box. The story looked good, and it had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I realized how horrible his acting was, he walked and talked so stupid, all the time, was fake and not convincing. It doesn't end there, almost ALL characters act so badly, it's laughing. Alan Boyce (David) is the only acceptable play, but the guy commits suicide early and you don't see him again, you never know why. he did it! Everything about this movie screams low quality, I can't believe how such a thing is released! I was very tempted to stop watching, and I managed it. I decided to stop watching and turn off the thing, to go to the IMDB to see what others thought about it. I didn't get a comment (not surprised). so i decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it, then come here to comment. The only good thing to do was the Rock Band High School theme, sometimes guitar playing and singing parts, but it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and directing ... Terrible movie.
