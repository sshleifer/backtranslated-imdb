As far as I can understand, TIW WATCHER is the first job of a young director. My doubts are whether it is the work of a regular guy who likes movies or if it is the work of a theater student, as there is a reference to the Oporto School of Arts in the final credits. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unconsciousness of some basic concepts about theater. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It doesn't matter, to the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you study cinema is how to tell a story. You learn it, just like in novels, in movies, you also have to build your story in three actions: the introduction, the development and the conclusion. You learn that your story should have a protagonist and antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn that it's valid for a 3-hour epic, for the regular movie, for a short movie and even, believe it or not, for a commercial 30 seconds. You also learn that there are levels of subtlety in your approach to the academic structure and that you can even eventually deconstruct it. <br /> <br /> In rough terms, TIM WATCHER sets us his main character before and then ends the movie - the whole movie sounds like the launch of the characters in Jeunet's AMÉLIE. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. It's not a parody or an art movie, so you can't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure. You expect to tell a story, and it doesn't. Worst of all, TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; and one with no real purpose. It doesn't make a point, or at least not a valid one. The point is childish, with a sense of revenge. The situations depicted are quite simple and his approach is Manichaean. <br /> <br /> I expected a lot from this brief. The movie starts with a pretty good credit range and you soon realize that you see something with better production values ​​than the usual Portuguese short film. I don't know the budget for this movie, but to thank for the thank you note in the final credits, earnings to the production team should go for such good connections in a country where it is difficult to open doors for young filmmakers. <Br /> <br /> TIM WATCHER is a style, color and carefully selected exercise, combined with a fine count. That's all. There is nothing else. There is no plot. And it's a pity, because it feels like a waste of production values. Similarly, in the ordinary Portuguese, you can see so many different places and so many available extras to enrich a story. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the comparison is possible, I should mention the BMW shorts as a good example. of how to tell a good story in a very short movie that is heavily confronted with product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography.
