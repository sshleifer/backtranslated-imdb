How can a movie Ozzy Osbourne still suck? I just can't get it. Trick or Treat managed to do this. It sucks and likes it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of those movies I have to warn people about. It's a vomit-inducing dirty atrocity that just begs to be viewed so you can feel so much worse about yourself. Trick of Treat has no reasoning factors. <br /> <br /> For heavy metal movies, it doesn't seem to be heavy metal or it does represent it. This movie may look heavy metal, and it was in 1986, probably one of the strongest hours of heavy metal. This is quite an achievement, but negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat = so bad you will be angry with yourself because you watched it. This simple comparison will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless movie.
