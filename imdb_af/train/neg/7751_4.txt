First, the CGI in this movie was terrible. I watched it during a bad movie marathon on the sci-fi channel. At the end when the park owner was killed, it is probably one of the worst examples of CGI I have ever seen. Even the night of the living dead has better animation. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie had almost no plot. Why were they especially on that island? Well, it's not mentioned in the movie. And why would people still be in the cat's area? It does not make sense. <br /> <br /> One thing that stood out in this movie was pretty good acting. In what can be called a "B made for TV movie" movie, the play was very good. Parry Shen stands out. <br /> <br /> If you do absolutely nothing on a Saturday, watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes.
