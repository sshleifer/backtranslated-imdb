Can only be described as horrible. It is bad to start and then gets worse. When you start, you really have to see it, because it is impossible to believe it can get worse - but don't fear it. Another poorly written script for a donkey director for no talented progeny of previous movie stars. It's hard to decide if the writing is worse than acting or if the direction is worse than both. As far as the hero is concerned, he calls everyone up, including one scene where he strikes the living daylight out of the difficult slap by opening the wardrobe and hitting him against the window. And in another scene, he is thrown through a window and trapped 20ft on concrete - not even shining - then immediately gets up and gets stuck in the bad things. It's a very ridiculous movie. Lucky it only costs me $ 1 to rent.
