I really had to catch another movie from the rest of the commentators on this site, because on the performance of the movie last night the audience was so lost by the dialogue I half way out. Shown as the filmmaker thought he was approaching a daring new territory by presenting a homosexual aging story, the movie uses David Lynch-inspired visual with Fassbinder-inspired acting. The performances in this film are so boring and bored that I figured out that one of the actors is going to pass by how uninspired they seem to be through the writing. What's worse is that it is colored like a Miami Vice episode. I don't know who this director thinks he is; Perhaps he has biased the surrealists such as Bunuel, Jordowsky, and so on. But the problem is that all formerly mentioned directors show a level of erudite sensitivity that is lacking here. I could understand the meaning of this film about ten years ago, but if we have masterpieces like Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, it's hard to do with this movie? There is nothing new to see here.
