The supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment, this time as guardian angel for an unfairly accused female policeman. Standard stalk and slash photo, but well behaved and directed. This makes it strangely interesting and viewable, although the violence is not bad (especially the director's track originally given an "NC-17" rating). <Br /> <br /> * 1/2 off ****
