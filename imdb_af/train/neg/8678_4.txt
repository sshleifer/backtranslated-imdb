After watching the "Bodyguard" last night, I was forced to write a review of it. <br /> <br /> It could have been a nice, fine movie if it wasn't for the awful camera work. It was unpleasant. The corners were wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the battle. The close-ups were even horrible. <br /> <br /> The story named Sonny Chiba as bodyguard as someone willing to lead him to the top of a drug addiction. He is approached by Judy Lee, who is never quite straight with Chiba. Lee's involvement with the drug is deeper than Chiba thought, as the mob and another gang of boyfriends are at her. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, and despite terrible doubles, it could have been a good movie. Given better direction and editing, I'm sure it would have been a classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it's more like another movie from another 70's. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening order has a quote to 'Pulp Fiction' fans, and then goes to a karate school in Times Square which is in no way related to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
