It must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember remembering this year when it first came out on the video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like an idiot, I ran out to buy the DVD as soon as it was released. What a tragic mistake! I won't even bother going into the plot because it's so transparent that you can see anyway. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to cheesy gore effects and bad acting, but these people take it on a whole different level. It's almost as if they were deliberately trying to make the worst movie humanly possible ... if that was their purpose, they succeeded. If they were going to make a movie that had to scare you or make you believe, shape or shape it really, they failed ... MISERABLY! Avoid this movie ... read the plot synopsis and you've seen it!
