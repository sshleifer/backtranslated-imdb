Just okay film about a woman who has twins who endanger her sister's visions in the house. She then returned home to find that everything was not good and that she had to find out what had happened to her sister and why. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that almost works, but not quite. I can't really get my finger on why it didn't work, but it was good enough that I wanted it to be better, or at least got the little things done - like having the girls playing the twins in the flashbacks closer in size. Maybe I think it's wrong with that. There are many small things that are just wrong.
