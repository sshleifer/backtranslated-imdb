It had to be one of the most divine wrestlemanias ever and is only saved by 2 games. The hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete exchange and to be honest, I almost fell asleep. It was so actionless. The match was not worthy of the Undertaker to appear there and the match between the Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke. If you really are a big fan of the WWE and missed the early days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you will probably love it. But I found that this Wrestlemania left much to be desired.
