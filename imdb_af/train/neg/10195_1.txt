Of course, the author / director of this movie knows nothing about film. I think the DP on this project is tied up and replaced with a monkey, because each one is too dark or has the hotter places than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the characters were very one dimensional. For someone who said this movie was made for poker fans and not movie fans, it was someone who made themselves (it was probably the author / director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. Going into a casino and playing a few hands doesn't give you the experience of writing poker. Keep your day working. And if it plays poker, you have to be hurt.
