Enough is enough ... sometimes they just stop making movies based on a long-dead concept. The first Tremors movie was wonderful. The second one was ridiculous. The third was misleading. The TV show was terribly horrible. And this movie just drives the game deeper. <br /> <br /> Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppet shows, now we have the series in the Wild West in the 1800s, and they fight graboids. Like a rehash of the first one, they have to learn how to skip them again. Seems amusingly I suppose. Otherwise, this straight-to-video release, just like Tremors 2 and 3, is just too far. Oh, and I wonder how never any record of these events occurs ... did they just forget to record this unprecedented event? I think such a thing would make history so our parents in the first movie wouldn't be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Movies like this that make the original downfall just make me crazy. Avoid this garbage.
