I would like to say that, unlike many of the people who did not like this movie and understood it impossible, I could fully understand. It's a very incoherent attempt to make a plot line. <br /> <br /> I don't like to throw this word, but in this case it fits very well. Firstly, the director offers the material in an extremely arrogant way and worse, extremely incoherent. It is incoherent in that it suggests the material in a messy loosened sequence, which makes us think the director was too drunk to remember what scenes were coming for the first time, and arrogant about expecting us for 2 hours, the viewer the end. from that. <br /> <br /> I respect surreal theater for what it is. (creating a story about a real-world world that is not real-life). But there is nothing surrealistic about the fact that a story is being placed in ordinary modern times, and a contemporary earth-setting, which is most not capable of engaging the audience but further, just a disrupted series of events that barely rally. The most accurate way to describe the experience of reading this movie is to view a story; perhaps even a very good story, as it is based on a book, but frustrated by the fact that the camera does not capture the necessary moments and connects any form of coherence. <br /> <br /> Let's compare stylistic theater. Compare Gaspar Noe's Seul contre tous here. He gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually deep story. This film does not offer any intellectual study, and although it is very quiet in the fragmented presentation, the director has finally told the essential art of good narration, and all we have left is a mess of events that hardly collapses. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is possible to make sense of things .... to a point. But as I said earlier, the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say, "Who cares." It plays out like watching a dull worldly story from a man to a supermarket and buying groceries in unprecedented order. Even with murders, it is completely uninteresting and unrelenting. Too many people nowadays will give high marks to something they cannot understand or make sense, just for fear of looking foolish, and in every way this film tries to make the viewer foolish. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time on your hands, please look at this movie, considering what I said about it. This is a story based on a book that could be presented in a much more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning.
