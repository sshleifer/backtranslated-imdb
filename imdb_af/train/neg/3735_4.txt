The actress Patty Duke wrote an insightful, funny book about her career as an actress, her love-loving love life, and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts that immediately give her away for good. With this rich material to draw from (and Patty plays herself in the final act), one would think of a cracked TV director like Gilbert Cates can bring it all on film, but "Call Me Anna" is a light shadow of Duke's autobiography. For those who have not read the book, the sketchy story (leap forward in time) is not absorbent, we should never wear our bearings as it happens, and the production seems to be bumpy with a low budget. The actors are scandalous, and the value of Duke finally showing up doesn't pay off. The film's bad reality is so thick at this stage that Patty can't bring stability to the scenario. The producers seem to be sincere (and conscious) sending the film to Duke's ultimate diagnosis and spiritual freedom, but they have left many dramatic opportunities in the process.
