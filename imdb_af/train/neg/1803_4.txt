Here is one of those educational short films made to teach the unknown people out there about facts of life. This time the target audience is preteen girls, the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, made by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently has some sponsorships from Kotex. <br /> <br /> It starts with explaining how hormones grow and develop you. Using animation and a female narrator we show how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why it all leads to menstruation. It's almost amazing, the comic note here is how to avoid the subject of sex. Even the word is never mentioned, although "elevated" will succeed once. I don't really know why I saw it, but since it is one of those rare short films that can give an impression of an innocent time, you can try it.
