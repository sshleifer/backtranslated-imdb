About the worst movie in distribution now! I love zombie movies and saw it in the used shelf, so I thought why? Oh my god, a shame for zombie movies and fans after the genre! Whoever made this movie should remove your camcorder and go to the film school! There are so many gore dogs out there that have put time and effort into their movies and they have something that this movie does not have dignity. I know what it takes to make movies and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time to make meat market, but nothing of that money and time has come to make it good. You need actors, a screenplay, a real camera, invest in some books on how to make independent films. I don't know how you got a DVD edition, but whoever did it is either a very good friend or head. In gore movies this quality is not quantity, the effects are poor! I was so angry that it was actually in stores and that I couldn't get my money back. If you've seen this movie, please write here and end. I know I'm very hard, I only had 10 lines, so I'm trying to get to the point.
