First of all, I must admit that both movies I have seen by this director have seen me without titles and possibly missed the points. My Czech is not bad, but I haven't even tried to learn when I put two of his films. Samotari is too cool. Way too cool. It's about ten different story lines that come together and weave. It's not as deeply unusual in a town that is the size of Prague (small, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30 years old. They did work and only one study. The best character is the young Balkan girl. Her sentiments are broadcast here every day by immigrants. It's about it. The only great character. Everyone else makes their own lives hell on their own. How can I sympathize with such a clear incompetence? Maybe there are interesting pieces with Japanese tourists, but do I still need a stereotype in film? If you like good music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at others' stupidity, see this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, an original Jarmusch does not see any imitation. And under no circumstances see Henry's movie, Septej (Whisper.) This is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes.
