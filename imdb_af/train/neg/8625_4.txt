In the unlikely event that some prospective directors read this comment, I'd like to give advice (for free!) From the viewpoint of the viewer. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to make a ghost of exotic adventure movies, go ahead. Don't try to make both at the same time, but it doesn't work. For example, with a goofy "comic relief" character who killed and beheaded and followed it with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal's head, it just seems you have no idea what kind of movie you wanted to make. This one is boring, winding, cheap, racist .... you get the picture. A few smart moments and some shiny nudity of Kathy Douche (far too expensive here) are hardly worth it. There is a reason everyone forgot about the existence of this movie. (* 1/2)
