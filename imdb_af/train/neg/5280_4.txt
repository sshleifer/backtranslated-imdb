Chris, an adopted son of a moral family, a loser who works with Kate (Christine Lakin) at the school newspaper, from the terribly struggling "step by step" show of the now fortunate ABC's TGIF setup) , find out that he only inherited a porn rich from his biological parents. He sees what true friendship and love is and blows some other nonsense. He is also dealing with an uncle who wants control over the family business and a shifty lawyer (or are they?) A little under the average teenage comedy stealing from better teenage comedies (the opening alone is HIGH American Pie-esquire) , fall on the head with the moral chance and get the only star talent he has. (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if I really stretch the star word, Martin Starr of "Freaks and Geeks", and Justin Berfield of "Malcolm in the Middle"). It's not bad, but it's far from good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Some extras are topless <br /> <br /> My Degree: C- <br /> <br /> Where I see it: Starz on Demand (available until 29 September)
