I can hardly believe that this inactive, turgid and bad play is by a filmmaker's other works I really enjoyed. The experience to keep the LADY AND THE DUKE (and no other word but "will do it") left me in a dirty light, relieved a state only by the IMDb user's comment by ali-112 reading. Not only did Rohmer attempt to (successfully) show the world through the genre art of the 18th century France, but as already pointed out, it (at the expense of the alienation of its audience) has the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution that inspired it through the eyes of an unlikely elitist woman of her time. The director reached unprecedented difficulty, but I was asking if it was worth doing - or seeing the dull results of his work.
