If this movie had a budget of 20 million, I just want to know where the money went. A monkey can make better CGI effects, then it was 3 hours on this horrible piece of scrap, although I have to admit the machines and the martians would really have looked at an original gaming station 1 game and early computer games from the center 90's as a game ever made. What puzzles are where the money went? Pendragon movies could have made a good movie with good old models and computer-controlled cameras a la George Lucas about 1975-83, and actors who actually seem to care about what they do (or ruin in this case) for about the same 20 million . This is probably the worst movie ever made! I'd rather go through a 24-hour recap of Ishtar than watch this movie again. I totally hated it! I regress. I say this is the WORST movie ever made, because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus, the Martians conquer, it's so bad movies that you have a special place in your heart. There is no love for this movie and no place in my DVD library for that. I sold it to a man for a dollar. I bet the money for the movie to spit and other vices for the cast and crew. Shame your Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
