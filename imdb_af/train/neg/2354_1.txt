I don't even want to call this thing a movie - it's a movie that has won no awards. The acting was terrible, just like the stupid scenarios. It is exactly the kind of movie that so many people think, fits into an NRI audience, but is actually chased off abroad for its discomfort and the overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that so many actors familiar with the English language do such a difficult time convincingly for the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all the English phrase awards in a movie, in Hindi and in cool local movies. There are few Indian movies in which the English looks really real. Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a good movie, it was a good movie and the language didn't seem to fit. <br /> <br /> I feel ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semi-enjoyable parts of this litter were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. Other than that, your time doesn't even waste this movie.
