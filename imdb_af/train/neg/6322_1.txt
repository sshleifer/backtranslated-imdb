It was one of the best and foremost anti-nuke films of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a child and a basketball player can change the world is fairly conquered, given how much <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union A TOTAL nuclear disarmament will be accepted because some apparatchik children have learned from the "silent protest" the West is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> What ended the Cold War? America's tough, dare I say "Reaganesque" attitude and the internal failures of socialism. It was NOT the peace marches, the "inputs" or movies like "Amazing Grace & Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Testament".
