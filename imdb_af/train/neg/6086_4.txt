For some reason, in the late 70's and early 80's, the local CBS affiliated station in New York has been in the late night slot for a few years, usually at 2:00 or so. played on Friday or Saturday night. This is a suitable movie for that time slot as it is very difficult to follow and very strange (see other reviews for specific story information). Anyway, after I have had it many times just before the cable TV (And even after it hit, but before they offered a lot of night programming), I caught this little stranger. After not seeing it for many years, I decided to see if I could find it on DVD. Well, it's just available (from every search I've done anyway) in a nice, ugly, grainy print on the budget sign "Brentwood Video" as part of a 4-pack movie (4 movies on 2 double-sided discs) Alien Worlds "if anyone is interested. It's usually available for about $ 10, but even less when shopping. The other 3 movies on this set are readily available in many other public domain movie collections, so don't have to comment on this But I didn't see "Eyes" where other places are available, although hardly a "restored" version in any way, this print is exactly 92 minutes, so for once the set time of IMDb's 90 minutes is incorrect Even with the 92 minutes running, it's not uncommon for a movie in English to be plugged in from another language to cut off the running time, which seems to be a common budget-conscience practice sometimes save money by not having a few plays If they are not considered important to the story, they will not fail. Will a longer version make any less confusing form? Who really knows - unless you've seen it in his native language ... Incidentally, my efforts to see it work during the day and I just end up switching it off. There is something to see in the middle of the night that fits this movie. Or maybe it's just my past experiences, who knows?
