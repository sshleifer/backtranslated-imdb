Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who does everything to make his wife look young and beautiful. For this purpose drugs drug during their wedding ceremonies to make it appear dead, so he can steal their bodies. I'm not quite sure what he's doing with the bodies. I don't remember it ever being fully explained. All I know is that he withdraws something from them and injects them into his wife. (I'll just guess it's spinal fluid. Spinal fluid was all the rage of crazy scientists in the 40's.) You can save the rest from here. <br /> <br /> There are a few (well, really more than a few, but I'll just write about two) of the issues I have with this movie. One is the way Bela is used. Certainly, he does a decent job in his own persuasive kind of way (VAT, the rest of the cast is simply abysmal). But hiding him in the back of a hearse or letting him crawl into the bedroom of the female reporter to do nothing, is just stupid. Also, why did he beat and / or kill every grandchild he had? Is it to make him look angry? Well, someone who is uprooting brides shouldn't really be more angry. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​drinking brides. Why brides? Will any woman under the age of 20? To look, Bela goes through these giros to get his victims. I am reminded of the idiotic Visser. I still know what you did last Saturday. In any case, it seems easier to reach your goal than to use a seemingly impossible plan that is far too much dependent on circumstances beyond your control. (VAT, an alternative title for this movie is The Case of the Missing Brides. I think it explains the need for 'brides' in part.)
