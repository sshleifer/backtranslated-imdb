This is one of the most horrible rewrites I've ever seen. If they want to make a movie with a lousy story, keep it from giving it a good book. There is hardly a connection between Wolfe's book and this movie except the title. I don't mind changing it if they help a story on the screen. At least, the changes should not hurt the final product. The last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. Those actors are in the wrong. Of course, the director and / or screenwriter cannot decide whether a lame comedy is made or preaching an unconvincing sermon. <br /> <br /> If you saw this movie and didn't like it, try the book. If you saw this movie and liked it, read the book.
