"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another 'feel-goody', so-called 'heart warming' and out-of-the-box show that ABC had the time to put together. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems these families are having. I'm sorry for that. But don't you think it will take four plasma-screen televisions with big screens, three flat-screen computers, a built-in pool, and half a backyard? And cushions full of expensive designer clothes are a BIT too exorbitant for any family? Sure, these families are very busy. Sure, they deserve better things than they had before. <br /> <br /> But frankly, the stuff Ty Pennington and his crew have put into these homes is enough to suit a whole environment. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really annoys me about this show is how Ty and his crew always have something to say about every thing related to the family or the family's condition. To tell a wheelchair-bound person that he or she is so "strong" or "very brave" really gets old after a while. It may be rude, but believe me; Look at this show and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> All in all, this view was overestimated. If you want to see it, continue. This comment is just a cup for what you want to watch.
