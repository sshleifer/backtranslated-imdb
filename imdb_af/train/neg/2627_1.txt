This bomb is just one 'explosion' after another, without humor and just absurd situations. Really, piracy to the limit. Reality is not one of its strengths. I gave it a 1 out of 10. I would have made it a zero, but that option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we all need money. And I still repeat that Tim Burton farce about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit it was a turkey. But if it was a turkey, this movie is not even a mustache. I wish I could say, "Give my money back". You can bet I want if I can. But this is the problem with premium services, the subscription variety.
