Mercifully, there is no video of this wannabe western that is a resident car for Big Frank at a time when his career was on the verge. The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big rifle brother and who comes out of the bad guys is just to return to get his residents reassured. He must be written by a backroom writer. All in all, this show stinks. The story is basically boring, poorly understood and so naive that it can insult your intelligence. I have to go all the way from the other reviewer who found it "underestimated ..." The critics hit it at the time and it was fair. You need to catch it on the last show, if you get up late and sleepless. But if you can put it through, you have more strength than most of my movie buff friends.
