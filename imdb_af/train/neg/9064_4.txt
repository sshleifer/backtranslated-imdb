In fact, Marc Blitzstein's off-Broadway adaptation of "Threepenny" was not as "bowdlerised" as commonly considered. <br /> <br /> (I have a special interest in "Threepenny"; my dad was part of the first full production in the US; You at Illlinois Theater Guild did it at the end of World War II. was so nearly successful in suppressing the play they had to rebuild and the recordings in two different languages, not English, German adherent's writing and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not a "translation" - which gave full approval to Lotte did not have Lenya - believed much closer to the original than general. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the version most people know about is the MGM recording (recently available on Polygram on CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur (like Lucy, the "big full girl"). and I can't see her hands on the hips and shoulders thrown back on that line - Bea was a big babe in the 50's, Paul Dooley and John Astin were heavily censored by Mike Curb, head of MGM Records - I mean, 17 (I think it was) "Goddamn's just cut." <br /> <br /> (At one time, MGM also offered a 2-LP set of * full * games, undoubtedly such a heavy censor.)
