Quite a foolish attempt at a Hitchcock-type mysterious stuff, which is unlikely to exchange spies for archeology and based on the Robin Cook novel; Incidentally, I recently received another update of his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Widmark. For the record, director Schaffner only made THE BOYS OF BRAZIL (1978) - a similar surprising but much more surprising means of suspending, and unfortunately SPHINX was a false step from which to recover such an impressive career. <br /> <br /> Despite its size and fairly decent throw, this one proved a critical and commercial flop - mainly because the story is not very exciting: in fact, it's pretty uncomfortable (poor efforts to abomination - the archaeologist's heroine to indulge in entombment, decaying bodies in general, and even an attack by a flurry of bats - despite that. Lesley Anne-Down is the lovely front lady who falls on a lost treasure. It has actually been hidden by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, which has given much of the country's legacy (under the pretext of culture) for far too long. Mr. John Gielgud appeared in an ungrateful manner early on as the antique dealer who sat down on the road and paid for these "performance proceedings" with his life. <br /> <br /> It usually occurs. that some characters are the opposite of what they claim - so that apparent allies (such as Maurice Ronet) are ultimately exposed as villains, while an ambiguous figure (Frank Langella, whom I saw in London in early 2007 in a West End show) from Frost / Nixon, who has now become a film) from Down's antagonist to her lover and back, as he decides to keep the wealth of Egyptian high priest Menephta a national treasure.
