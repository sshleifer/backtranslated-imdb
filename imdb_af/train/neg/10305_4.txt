As an engineer, I have to say the first season of this show has been very promising. Most of the applied mathematics was somewhat credible, and the relationships between the Eppes brothers and dad gave the show an interesting look. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show began to seriously degrade. Most of the maths and technologies used in crime resolution are now extremely gibberish and highly laughable to all people involved in science and technology. The involvement of the actors still feels good and I can imagine a fair picture. How much money is still going on every episode, but eventually it reduced to a very unpleasant tasting dish, which is a mix of a Grade C action thriller and CSI-style cop show. <br /> <br /> If you're going to watch it, just go for the first season and possibly parts of the second. Then I won't waste my time. I presented the show halfway through season 3. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 Star Season 2 - 5 Star Season 3 - 3 Stars <br /> <br /> Let's get it up to 4 stars. Since Charlie doesn't know his math anymore, I won't worry about my correctness either.
