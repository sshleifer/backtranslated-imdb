The original show was so much better. They had to leave on a good note. This movie killed the whole idea. It was boring, overly dramatic and the funny parts were too far in the middle to make up for the slack. This movie really seemed to be too hard to be serious, and it certainly wasn't what I wanted from this sequel. Not to mention, it was the same thing over and over again for a long time. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder next time. This movie is just as dull, and not so funny. Sorry. It's 4/10 stars. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
