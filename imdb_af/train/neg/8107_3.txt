This movie is rather boring. There are bits of naked meat being chased around to keep the viewer awake, but they fail. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin - she does a masterly job. character, but Day-Lewis slammed most of his lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufman clearly had no idea how to roll it. The irregularities in the reflection between domestic household / marriage issues and political crises are very similar. Character attitudes change throughout without explanation. Poorly deviating.
