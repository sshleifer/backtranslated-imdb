After a fairly long, partially pixelated naked shower scene, we are racing for this "Blair Witch Project" query horror movie about three girlfriends blowing to an abandoned cabin deep in the forest to get away from their hectic lives for a girl's weekend out and smoking pot. They meet two guys who look kind enough, so they drink and tell ghost stories, until late in the movie some of them are counted down. <br /> <br /> It is a fairly slow movie, with unnecessarily pulled out tension Screens, the bad play cannot carry the crowd of scenes where nothing happens, but ceaseless banter, and the movie as a whole is a dud, a deadly boring dud on it. Nothing happens until the last half hour and when it did, I really loved to care. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ashley Totin shows T&A; Evy Lutzky briefly becomes topless; and Jennifer Hart shows her rights titled <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
