A painfully protracted, maudlin and predictable drama, is filed with my twenty-fifth Sidney Lumet movie, Garbo Talks, on the low quality end of my quest. <br /> <br /> The movie documents a young workman Gilbert (Ron Silver), a son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, fine and especially obsessive fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle is afflicted with a brain tumor, her son decides to do an obsessive quest of his own: trace Greta Garbo and bring her to his mother. <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft is abundant, Cold-Scenic Tannie-Mama mode here, that kind of festive girl who loves the movie, where she comes out to people, and stands for her ideals, and ends always in jail. She stands outside the film as a clear artificial construction, and every scene with her is yuk-yuk paralyzed; every note that is striking. The rest of the characters are equally one-dimensional, but much less interesting. Ron Silver is flat as it can be, and his attempted love triangle is as telegraph as anything else in the film: He is in progress with affluent Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but joins the oddball co-worker Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks) and I called every scene three scenes before it happened. <br /> <br /> This is the other problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are placed in an intriguing and engaging story, but there is simply nothing here. The film's pace is glowing, exciting with strange material that doesn't reinforce anything at all, and when the movie begins to follow a linear plot, it's both plowing and uninteresting. There are many guest stars, so to speak, including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker (think so) in yet another very important scene. <br /> <br /> Late in the film, it aims for a half-way statement about the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but by that time none of the characters exists as real people , and the movie has bored me in submission, so it functions as a case of far too little, late. The movie is my twenty-fifth Lumet-directed film, which makes it easy for me as my most worried director, but beyond some egregious misses (a stranger among us, someone?), Doesn't have the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talk. <br /> <br /> {Grade: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (of 24) 1984 / # 23 of 25 Lumet Movies}
