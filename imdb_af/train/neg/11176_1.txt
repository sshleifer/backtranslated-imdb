Seen this movie in an early preview, and I can't stress enough how bad I thought this movie was. From the beginning, the audience greeted Pacino's terrible southern accent. Poor Al really looked really good, and I can't decide if it was deliberately part of his role as a drug addict publisher, or maybe he just didn't sleep before he came to the set. Much worse than Pacino's close ups, however, is the miserable excuse for a plot. Early in the film, indications are given that Pacino's character is gay, and I suspect that is what the scriptwriter originally meant. Later, however, we have to suspend our unbelief, and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both sleeping in sleep) are delighted with this elderly, half-killing, slightly man with the ridiculous accent. The worst part was the main plot, which had to do with some corporate espionage that was never completely explained and we would never mind the least. Because it was a preview, I will keep my final judgment, due to the possibility of shooting and editing, but you can bet I won't pay a cent to see it in theaters.
