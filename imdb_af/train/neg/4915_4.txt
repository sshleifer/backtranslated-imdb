One of the previous judges wrote that there was no ground for Love Story's opinion; one loved or hated it. But there seems to be a remarkable disagreement over the scale of 1 to 10. For me, this movie got four. There are some beautiful scenes and locations, and Ray Milland is in a wonderful job as Oliver's dad. But the film did not do a particularly compelling work to tell his story, and the story was not so unique to justify multiple views, at least not to me. I can be a bit snobbish, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal. I haven't seen Barry Lyndon yet, because most of them, but not all, are destroyed by my presence. The only exception is What's Up, Doc ?, in which his straight show is the perfect underline for Barbra Streisand's goofball protagonist - and by no means does he take a shot at Love Story! McGraw and O'Neal tend to repent, rather than act. <br /> <br /> This movie is known for the start of a good career: it was Tommy Lee Jones' first movie.
