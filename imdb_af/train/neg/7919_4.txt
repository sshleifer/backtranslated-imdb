I got very caught up in this movie, at least in the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic !! But that's where it ends. I look very good at finding out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie can scare me off completely, but I feel out and about lying, leading in one direction all the time and then suddenly deciding completely different go, they didn't struggle at all, it didn't mislead so much wrong writing and planning, someone didn't even think! <br /> <br /> I felt the movie would have been much better if they held onto the plot that they were leading you, they didn't answer anything, why did Jane (Maria) burn the professor's home. <br /> <br /> It's a pity as I feel it started out as a relatively good movie.
