I still can't believe Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of crap. This movie is worse than "Deadly Friend". The plot is stupid, the play is mediocre and the movie is deadly boring. I don't know why Wes Craven hates his debut, "Last House on the Left", an absolute masterpiece of the genre, and probably (of) this turkey. Don't get me wrong, I love his movies a lot, but it was a real torture that watched this.
