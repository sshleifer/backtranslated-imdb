I am a BIG Adam Sandler fan, and one day I watched the Cast & Crew selection on one of his DVDs and saw 'Going Overboard' and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with some friends and hired it. We switched it on and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler who hasn't hit puberty yet. He looked like he was 12 when this movie came out. I couldn't even watch this crap for 30 minutes, I didn't laugh, chuck or even cut this movie. Actually, I was the only time I sat down when I saw how terrible this movie was. I couldn't believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie ... and it didn't work once. Although I saw some of the terribly horrible camera angles and heard the disgusting writing, I realized why I had never heard of this movie, because it sucks more than anything that has ever sucked. This movie, in my opinion, was the WORST movie ever made, EVER!
