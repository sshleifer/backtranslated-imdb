Phew - I don't know what to say. It's a movie that can be really good with a lot of stoned viewers. Some of the actors reminded me of John Waters' early offers. Perhaps I should take it back - I do not want to insult Waters' ability as a director / storyteller. <br /> <br /> I especially loved the lawyer about the "full faith and credibility" clause. It is "full of faith and credit", incidentally! <br /> <br /> It also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys", where the main actor is also the author, director, film editor, and so on. Multi-engaging businesses like this are probably the best for many sophisticated professional film staff who have the technical capability (though it may be a stunt, some might say) to pull off that.
