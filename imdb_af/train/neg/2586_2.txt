Let's cut off: this movie is soft porn porn that is marketed to the masses under the name that the studio milk every last penny from the American Pie teat. Period. <br /> <br /> The whole plot (and it doesn't imply that there is much to go around) serves as a vehicle to show the audience more boobs and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you are a Tween man and you are too crazy to buy real porn, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, the movie doesn't have much to offer. <br /> <br /> The acting is sub-par, the character development is virtually non-existent, and the story is a nonsensical crack of nudity and pranks (none of which is especially memorable). <br /> <br /> Buy real porn if it's what you want to see, and if not, watch a good movie. Animal House, Kids, or even the original American Pie are all the major movie works, and all contain heavy alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "That's not how much, that's how you use it"
