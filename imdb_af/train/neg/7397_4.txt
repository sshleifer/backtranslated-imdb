I have seen this movie several times in a variety of short film festivals and it always gives me the impression that I have seen a movie cart! <br /> <br /> For a school movie, very well produced and targeted, but the story ... well, it needs something different to be a bigger and interesting movie. The character called Tim Watcher needs some in-depth approach. This is something missing in some Portuguese short films - the writing is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I chose this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (congratulations!)
