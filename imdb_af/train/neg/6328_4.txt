Why does this movie fall well below the standards? Finally, the answer lies in the poor, humorous writing. A slender / average looking Travolta (with a LARGE mole), and both with a HUGE mole, and Gross both play very well like two young-ish-smoothing ', but nevertheless New Yorkers are challenged for their own nightclub open. Other than that, the rest of the movie is just boring to watch. It's so boring that it's really not worth knowing what happens in the climax at any level. Kelly Preston obviously makes sexual appeal and the sexually charged dance with her man-to-be Travolta is one of the movie's few pleasures. Charles Martin Smith is delighted to see how KGB honcho "Bob Smith" is struggling. Personally, I think the movie would have been better if the plot had changed a bit so that the institutions didn't change from NY to 'Indian Springs, Nebraska' (which is in the former Soviet Union?) - you will understand if you see the movie ... Apparently this movie was filmed in 1986, ready for a 1987 edition. I suspect Paramount was holding on to release the movie until January 1989 due to the incredible plot. They were reported to regard it as "unspeakable". Nonetheless, this $ 6 million film received a bit of $ 163,000 embarrassment, as it was only released in places like Texas and Colorado before heading straight for video. This is proof of the overall bath quality of this movie.
