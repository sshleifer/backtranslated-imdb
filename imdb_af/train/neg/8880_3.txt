This movie was but it could have been much better. There are a few spooky moments, but there aren't enough of them to show me, this movie wants to see again. There are a few scenes that you can move forward and miss nothing. The biggest mistake is that it is so predictable, and that's why I rated it so low. It's vigilant, but don't expect anything great.
