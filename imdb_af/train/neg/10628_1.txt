This so-called "documentary" is trying to say that the US has fallen into the moon landing. Year right. <br /> <br /> Anyone who actually studied the matter knows otherwise. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is definitely evidence. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought back many MRI rocks from the moon - for geological studies. This true spread across the world to hundreds of laboratories, which they tested. And they all came to the conclusion that they came from the same planet, not the earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements differ from those found on earth, but similar to those calculated on the moon. That is, the conspiracy theorists never study anything: they just take the thing that fits in their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another unlawful claim to them is that their wind was in the hangar where they shot the moon, moving the flag. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so it moved. And what proves it: Well, if the conspiracy theories even studied the footage, they would see the flag never move after the astronaut left it. IU The conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they cannot study a subject properly, or just study it until they have what they came for, so they can make a lie and make a profit (IE this so-called "documentary") . <br /> <br /> A claim says it's not possible to film it on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different light sources, the artificial lighting from the studio. Again, the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in the night desert, without light sources. But I doubt any conspiracy theorists were ever outside their grandmother's cellar, for more than many days a Star Treck convention is being held. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They just see what they want to see. So they make all these lies look important - that's a fact.
