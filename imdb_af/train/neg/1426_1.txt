One question: Why? First, the point of departure is not funny or scary. They use programmed interviews, and take the sound to create it with animals speaking the parts. First, the interviews are not funny or entertaining to start with, and even though they were sure they would be much more entertaining, as they were original, without being changed into cartoons. How to add it? I turned on CBS's Monday night sitcom setup (which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful Monday working days) and found it. Of course, the sitcom would reflect the line-up anyway, summer, but to see these episodes again would have been more entertaining. I tried to give "CC" a chance. I really did. When it started, I thought, well, maybe it will be funny. Nope. And then it continued. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there was a goal, if the interviews were shown in their entirety and they pointed out. But no, it was just one line cut, cut and paste really fast. It was like a terribly horrible version of Cartoon Network's "Robot Chicken." I was not a fan of CBS's now-canceled sitcom "The Class." While it was on, it was half an hour from the series I would struggle with. But if I decide to decide for a whole season of those or three episodes of "Creatures", let's just say I'll take the class. Since it's been a few hours since it was broadcast, and I'm coming here to see that I'm the first to comment. I think it's a good sign that no one has watched it and that it will no longer last. Cartoon roadkill.
