I can't believe the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, worst and poorly composed movies I have ever seen. And the plot was completely ridiculous (sp?). She started climbing with him while tied to the chair? Puh-lease. The worst part was that it wasn't even in a good, laughable way. Just awful - I couldn't figure out why they even bothered to show it to HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously stupid - very unbelievable as an "eccentric" hit. idk, i can go on - again, i'm shocked at the positive reviews. The only thing that made me look is that it is fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the end has not disappointed in his soul too! "Live by the sword, die by the sword ..." ridiculous.
