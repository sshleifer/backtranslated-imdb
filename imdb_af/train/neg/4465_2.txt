Following the over-estimated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish Horror Movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies. The result is everything in films such as El Segundo Nombre, a badly written TV-like production but acted and directed. I didn't read the Ramsey Campbell book, but I'm sure The Doll Who Ate's author doesn't have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at all costs, unless you're looking for a quiet, sleepy night in a new kiosk. 10/02
