What a poor image of professional police officers is shown on television in watching this alleged reality court. One can only hope that the real reasonable presumption that leads to a possible cause leading to the total of circumstances involved in making a "stop" then the "Pat Down" on the outside of his clothes, then to articulate why The officer went into someone's pocket and got smuggled out of the screens. If that is not the case, the arrest will be thrown in most places if they have even passed a supervisor. A report of a radio warrant does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person who sent the original has handled the original warrant. If the transmitter of a computer printout reads, it is good enough for an arrest, but it does not necessarily mean that the warrant is still in operation. Since I haven't seen a Dis-claimant from CBS (I may have missed it), CBS can be in trouble.
