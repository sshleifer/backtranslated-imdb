I'm watching it now on the Sci-Fi channel. It's so terrible I can't stop watching it! I'm a Videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this movie. Some of the camera work is good. Most are very doubtful. There are some decent actors in the movie. Too bad they were surrounded by what the director's family had to be. It's the only way they can be qualified to be in a movie! Music was a little better than the acting. If you come around to watch it, I hope it's because there was absolutely no other option! The sequel (yes successor) is now underway. I think I'll beat it! Jason
