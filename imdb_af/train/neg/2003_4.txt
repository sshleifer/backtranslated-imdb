For all his visual delicacies, how much better Renaissance would have been in live action. The animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, much like the story and style of this movie. With real actors, the movie world might not have been so lifeless. There is much to admire here, but in the end I found that all I could do was admired. I didn't enjoy much of the movie, and it explains something I haven't seen before: that the visual elements can be the decisive positive aspect of a movie, but without a good story and strong characters, it can do it all be nothing for nothing. I will not go so far as to say that this movie does not come to anything, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love Dark sci-fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two movies I thought were great. But Blade Runner had his tragic villain and Dark City had his thoughtful storybook. Renaissance has shade and light, but little else. I wish I could enjoy this movie more, but the bad story and the empty characters stood by. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life. How ironic then, that one of the darkest and lifeless movies I saw this year, takes its title from the Renaissance.
