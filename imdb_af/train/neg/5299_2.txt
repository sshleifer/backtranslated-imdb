I really like slasher movies, but this one is really awful. The acting is lame, the script is bad, and the atmosphere doesn't exist. The plot is as follows: a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett kills people in a small American town. That's right. This is the plot. Very original, eh! "The night brings Charlie" is not even enough. If the film doesn't get scary, they should at least make it light. Run this cheap piece of garbage. at all costs. If you want to see some good bracts, check out Madman, The Burning, The Prowler, Just Before Dawn or Humongous. Don't waste your precious time with this worthless one. piece of garbage.
