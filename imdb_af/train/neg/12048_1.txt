I walked out of about 6 movies all my life. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't know how I sat there for an hour. I had to be in a coma that night. I saw it in the theater when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember the name, but I knew Penelope Ann Miller had played in it. It really got me going to waste my time telling me about it today. Yech! Testimony! Barf!
