My dad is a fan of Columbo and I haven't kept the show. I always call my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he continues to look at it. It's his right as an American I think. But my senses were set in the series when I found out Spielberg was the leading episode. Then I was grateful that my dad bought this show that I really couldn't stand. I went through his DVD collection and plucked this thing in when I got home for a visit from college. My opinion on the series as a whole has not been sworn, but I have gained respect for Spielberg because he knew he started as most lower level managers. And it makes a small dribble until the big fish get together (get the pun, HA, HA like Spielberg did. It's like Jesus before he became a man. At least that's what I think it will feel like. from Columbo as you probably would like it, though it does not contain much of Peter Falk.I attributed this to the fact that it is the beginning of the series and no one knew where it was going. the crime instead of Columbo's investigation, as many later would do episodes.
