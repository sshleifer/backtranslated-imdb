After being bitten in a cave by a bat, undergo a doctor named John Beck an accelerated transformation into a man-creature. His wife assured him that there was nothing wrong with him, it's all just because of rabies or the anti-rabies drugs he is the local police believe John is responsible for several gruesome murders. "The Bat People" Jerry Jameson is a hell of a horrible film. The writing is deadly dull and there is no gore or nudity. This grim piece of crap is so boring boring that you scratch your head in a disbelief after you have suffered through it. Even the design of man-bat of a young Stan Winston is quite pathetic and powerless. Enter this stinker like plaag.2 out of 10.
