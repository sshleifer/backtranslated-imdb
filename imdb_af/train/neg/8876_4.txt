Types of Family Parody Blend "An Officer And a Master", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and no doubt other movies I can't remember) in a rather dull movie, with some bright spots . The gags are always there where you will expect them, and Damon Wayans' lines are well predictable. As I said, unfortunately, this movie never surprised you ...
