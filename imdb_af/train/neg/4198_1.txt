I caught this Cuban movie at an arthouse movie club. It appeared shortly after the magistrates in 1935 Silly Symphony cartoon reconciling the island of Symphony with the Jazz Island. Placed by gypsum dressing motors, recent deaths of Ruben Gonzalez by speakers in this ancient cinema and Cuban flag, set the scene for an exciting celebration of filmed film shows and synchronized sissies at the Helms-Burton idiots. But then the movie started. And the theater's peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the unashamed mess on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas's storyline promises a lot. Carla is a bored envelope punch at a Cuban post office. Her only escape from a completely humdrum existence is to write letters and rewrite them, transforming basic interpersonal grunts into Brontanan outbursts of breathless emotion. Call on many photographs of photogenic Cubans who are busy with joy, sadness, pity, terror and the like. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the simplicity of the story strikes through endless outings in film schooling, latino caricature, Marx brothers and even - during a particularly overwhelming editing trick - the celluloid scraping on a character's face . <br /> <br /> Unidimensional characters flow. Cunda, the boss at the post office, is a humorous dominatrix nosferatu. Her boss-old accomplice, Concha, points to different points of fingers, tapping and screaming. Cesar, the metalhead hidden and romantic interest, reveals hidden writing talent when Carla leaves for Miami. A chase scene (in oh-so-hilarious fast-forward) is well thrown in. All this will be good in a Mortadello and Filemon cartoon, but in a black-and-white zero-FX movie with high-picture, ahem. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas seeks to stile somewhere between the 'eternal heroine-match-aliens of Amelie and the' poetry-as-great-savior 'theme of Il Postino. Like Amelie, his protagonist is an eccentric single-white woman who combats the impending spider's cage by bringing magic into the lives of strangers. And like Il Postino, the movie doesn't flash out of persistent poems and a postman on a bike does not take a romantic lead. Unfortunately, Nada Mas fails to capture the luxury and transcendence of any movie. <br /> <br /> There are two things that will make it possible to watch this movie in a late-night TV jam. The first is the opening overhead shot of Carla on a check floor that cuts the crossword puzzle she is working on. The second is to see Nada Mas as a warning example: our post Buena Vista Social Club obsession with Cuban artistic output can often blink to accept any foam containing a bongo on the soundtrack. This movie should not earn a worldwide release - movies like Waiting List and Guantanamera cover, similar to thematic territory, are much more successful.
