I don't know why, but after all the hype on NPR I thought it was a new movie ..... all the best footage was used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects you saw when you were interested in nature programs. .. it's repackaged with juicy narrative and exaggerated dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day.

James Earl Jones speaks, but I was hoping for a groundbreaking movie , taking into account the new camera technology used in making this film ...... it is purified for a child hearing, so one can actually see better footage on YouTube. I feel that we are due to something like the groundbreaking like Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is definitely not
