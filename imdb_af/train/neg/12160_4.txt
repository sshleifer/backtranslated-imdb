I went to this movie on a rainy Sunday and intend to change something else. Out of curiosity I found the comment here and found that I had looked at it to the end. I didn't really do it with intention - it was one of those movies where you were fascinated, and watched it for another few minutes until you finally just look at the end. And their charge in most of these comments made it more fascinating to see. The one comment that the person really liked, seems to be merely due to Ladd and Spano, and their earlier roles. But there is nothing here to find here - story, performances, and especially the absurd courtroom hi-jinks. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr has passed the 300 lb mark), and Ben Matlock, gets a void in cavorting around the courtroom, rather than being annoying to a reader. And Matlock is especially privileged to go to exhibitions, often by simply going to the jury and showing it, before the judge and the prosecutor have even been informed or shown. No real judge or prosecutor will stand for this. <br /> <br /> Both Perry and Ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession from the right killer. In fact, Perry almost did it, but Matlock would often give overwhelming evidence of the true culprit, expressing it "reasonable doubt," and then left to the police and prosecutors to go against the guilty party - sometimes on camera, sometimes the end of the show. <br /> <br /> But it said, Holland Taylor's histrionics and the amount of space she gave in the courtroom section of this story, the actions of Matlock / Mason more like the slow, often tedious details seen on Court TV and in the right courtroom. <br /> <br /> Each character in this presentation was either unsatisfactory, impersonal, stupid, boring, unlikely - or a combination of two or more of these. <br /> <br /> The end was the most banal, absurd, even stupid conclusion possible - but again fascinating as a result. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals, and so on. Movies will be their best forts - probably the best in 2nd lead (probably better than 3rd) roles, even in this place. Taylor can be thrown as the aunt or mother of one of them. Give this one 1 star for the story / performances, and 3 additional for the fascination factor.
