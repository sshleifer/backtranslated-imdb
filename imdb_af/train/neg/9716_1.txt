This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is so full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like reading for the first time directly from the manuscript. Worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as he was in the "Police Academy" - the same foolish women - and it is not suitable for a leading man who would be an excitement. <br /> <br /> It is very hard to believe that Hanson would make "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague ...
