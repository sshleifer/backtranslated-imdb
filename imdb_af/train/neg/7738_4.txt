The movie was "OK". Not bad, not good, just OK. If there was anything else in the theater, it would be skipped by far. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 also hit, but I'd rather see it as FF2. :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk, it will be a "cute" movie for you. Personally I want to wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
