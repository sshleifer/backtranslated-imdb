I can say catogoricaly and unambiguously that in all my 51 years on this planet it has been the worse (supposedly children) movie I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three big kids to see it and even they struggled to get a smile during the 90 minutes. I will leave the sexual indulgence for another day, but they were as tasteless as the movie. They have to pay YOU to see it, not you pay them. It's really awful, there's no other way to describe it. The people who made this film should be used to make money under false pretenses. <br /> <br /> Aplogise for my spelling mistakes, but I am so upset that it spoils the time I spent with my grandchildren.
