Please, someone stops Ben Stiller to act in any movie. Write the studios, hell, even write your local congressman. I laughed more, went to a funeral, I watch ANY Stiller movie. Jack Black is trying to make something about a comedy about the disappearance of dogshack, and Christopher Walken, perhaps of the greatest actors of his generation, just seems ashamed to be there. Quieter she is unfunny herself, but now even with someone to bail him, he proves that he is a way to be overestimated as a cartoon. It's no wonder why this movie was badly thought out and was available from the dollar movie theaters only a few weeks ago. I warn you, and you have to warn your friends, don't see this movie, it's just awful, worst than Gothika (personally, I never thought I'd say it), the worst the Plan 9, the worst Ishtar, the worst than the golden child. Please, Hollywood, keep Ben Stiller in your movies, he's not funny, he's a god horrible actor, and he brings others with him. The next movie is ranked 1 because no negative scores are allowed, so while the board says one, I'll give it a zero.
