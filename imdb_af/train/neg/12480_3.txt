... Or, exactly, so bad you will have the time of your life laughing at your ass when you see it! James Sbardellati's "Deathstalker" of 1983 is certainly one of the most horrible productions the Sword & Sorcery subgenre brought, but it is very amusing. The play is horrible, the plot is pure shit, and the effects and photography can no longer be amateur. But this is the bad play, the casein effects and the many mistakes that make this movie so hilarious. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AED - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is a very strong and skilled fighter. One day he took a good witch to unite the three powers of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet, and a wedge, to free the land of his brutal ruler, the evil king and sorcerer Munkar. The acquisition of the sword is fairly easy, but the amulet and the calyx are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately, the evil king organized a tournament in which the country's most skilled warriors fought each other to death. The winner is then the king's place. Of course, the king does not want anyone to take his place, so he plans to kill the winner (instead of arranging the tournament in the first place). Deathstalker is not just about to acquire the three powers of creation, but also to save the good old king's beautiful daughter (Barbi Benton) from the clutches of the evil Munkar. Fortunately, he is not bored on the way to the tournament, as he has allowed the wonderful female fighter Kaira (Lana Clarkson) in the meantime ... <br /> <br /> The movie has very large, incredibly stupid and funny scenes . Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker manages a bad man with his sword. The head that falls, however, is not the old man's head. The falling head has red goats, while the man decapitated by Deathstalker, has dark hair and no beard. <br /> <br /> - When the character of female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) is introduced, she is first seen in a black cloak, hiding her face and body. Deathstalker's traveling companion Oghris (Richard Brooker) fights her, and during the sword she is fighting her garment (of which she is obviously topless), with her breasts exposed. Her breasts are the first thing we see from Lana Clarkson, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The last fighter Deathstalker must fight in the tournament, is a giant man with the body of a man and the head of a pig. <br /> <br /> - Boss Munkar closed an ugly little animal in a chest. He feeds those small creatures human eyeballs and fingers. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other unintentionally funny, hilarious and big scenes. The play is horrible, but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are eye-catching, and although I described this movie as inadvertently funny, I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crazy the movie is. There is a fair amount of gore, and very feminine nudity to entertain the viewer. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly horrible movie, but I still strongly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives!
