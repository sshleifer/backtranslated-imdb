As a long-term fan of the Star Trek series, I found it a disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashbacks" with Will Riker's exploitation, positive (and especially romantic) and negative (a lot of pain and a crewmate's death was a money-saving device, just like many of their "bottle programs" (episodes in which all scenes on the business take place). Princess Muldaur (who also appeared on the original series at least twice) deserves a better final look than her character, dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the Star Trek world, is there any other kind?) Also briefly. This was the last episode of the second season; So the season ended "not with a bang" but with "a throat."
