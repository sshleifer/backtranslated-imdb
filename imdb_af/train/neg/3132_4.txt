I haven't seen such a fantastic rating on IMDb, but I've seen it anyway, because I'm a big fan of Bible-related material. The first thing that bothered me was a bit too much Indiana Jones wannabe movie, but it also seemed that Casper Van Dien hadn't seen those Jones movies (but he should). I believe he tried his best, but the writing just bumped. Music has also become a good Jones style. Great work, but for such a movie it seems to be too much work, as the video part hasn't earned that good music. Robert Wagner did his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script failed. "Grappe" is old school, somewhere 20 years old; they only brought cynical smile to my face. There are some very bad camera angels, SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea about the story (in my opinion, but I love such stories), but things didn't work out eventually. Maybe he should put it on a paper if it's still fresh in his head. When I saw in the first minutes that the movie would be one of those 'low budget films', I was hoping to hear at least a good story, but sometimes disappointing movies.
