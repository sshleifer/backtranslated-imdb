I am definitely in the minority opinion on this one. "The Hurt Locker" won more awards for the best photos of critics this year than any other film. Nonetheless, I didn't like it, I found it hard to go through. <br /> <br /> There is minimal plot and small character development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm more bombs. This is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing was that the camera never stopped moving and shaking. It's a recent film production film and it's supposed to make it look more real, as it has a cheap, documentary look at it. The camera shook so much that it led me to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> I usually don't care for war movies and "The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you don't have to take my word for it, because the critics like it.
