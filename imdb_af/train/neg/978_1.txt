I watched this movie recently with my sister who likes Sophia Loren's performances. I am a person who calls them a Cultural Barbarian. I hate art in any shape or form. Rambo is more my kind of movie, action, death, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this, avoid this movie like the plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing of the kind. Let me give you a summary in a few sentences. It starts with 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda. Every Italian in a housing block lives a parade in honor of Hitler, except for a housewife, an anti-fascist and a caretaker. The housewife deceived by her husband meets the anti-fascist. She falls in love with him, wants to love him, but the anti-fascist is gay. Despite this, they make love with each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book of her gay lover, and the man himself is deported by agents. The end. You want a shorter summary? USE ... It's so short enough? The man had to use his rifle in the beginning of this movie and shoot him to save the audience from this cruelty. On a lace note my sister loved this movie. As I said, I'm a cultural barbarian ...
