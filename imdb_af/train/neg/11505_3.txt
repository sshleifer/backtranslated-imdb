This photo reminds me of a Keneth More photo of 1957 called The Admirable Crighton "while on the boat, he was a servant and on the island he became the master and after being rescued, returned to the servant. Madonna did one thing in some movies, not burning, so if there is a picture showing that Madonna can't act, it's the one. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if it's a subtle copy of The Admirable Crighton was, but it certainly seems to like it and if that is the case, Hollywood has to run out of ideas and it is sad to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and fail in every angle and detail. <br /> <br /> The plot is loose and the play is mediocre, the writing must be placed by the shredder before it is taken in. Although many here ceased Madoona for all her plays, think I like that in movies like my own legend was very good and nice and "Who's That Girl" has an owner Madonna's style not shown before or after. Other Madonna movies are not that nice and I would like a Madonna Animation series to feature the character of "Who's That Girl". I love the music from these two movies, but "swept away" at the bottom of the stack and will stay that way. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a bomb right?
