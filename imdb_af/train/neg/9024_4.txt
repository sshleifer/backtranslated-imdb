"Shinobi" is one of those movies that think the mere act of killing a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, for the audience to really see people die, you have to develop the characters, because all you have is a lot of random acts of violence. The problem is especially aggravated when you have TONS characters, all of whom die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you can't be bothered to make the characters unforgettable or sympathetic, at least make the reasons why they've probably gone, right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with no way really knowing why they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet, even after it became clear that the emperor wanted to kill ALL of them, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. It's not stubborn ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, good! There is no character development, and the plot offers no reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die in cool action scenes, right? Again, NO! In fact, many of the battles are not even battles: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort to die suddenly (and lame, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, "Lalala, I walk along and I- * are cut neck *." THE END for that character. Not even halfway through the movie I threw my hands in frustration about its ridicule.
