How Irish critics rave about this movie is outside me. Dominated by the ordinary band of Irish actors dragged on every Irish film. Terrible script, with forced character issues (the brown sauce). Romantic everything bad about Dublin. The attitude of 'ah, it's a dump but surely it's not the same.' Many netbits purify for American audiences (the supermarket boss and his terribly forced catchphrase). And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney's character. A big actor forced this part to play that could have been by a five year old. Cringeworthy stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's bad when you say it. Well, at least he wasn't on his terrible American accent. International audiences are warned: stay home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You will have a better time. Intermission is a walk-outside
