This sword and magic story of a terrifyingly brutal and fearless "hero" disappearing from an evil king is worthless in almost every detail. The acting is terrible because it leads to the supporting roles. The teaching, gloating glee with which the director shows the hero to lubricate blood, is absolutely disgusting; And it is not redeemed by any justice for his cause, as he is as bad as the people he is fighting. Z-movie editing is plentiful, including a scene where a character "dies" of a sword shot that has completely disappeared! <br /> <br /> The film sounds clear on the charms of female leaders, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who are mostly naked through the film. As a 20-year-old man, I would not pretend that the female flesh on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so humiliating and the sex scene is so comfortable and joyful that I can't enjoy this aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> At least some of these era movie films are at least somewhat redeemed by a lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek feel (the successor is better in this respect), but DEATHSTALKER looks himself quite serious as heroic . Not at all! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 out of ****.
