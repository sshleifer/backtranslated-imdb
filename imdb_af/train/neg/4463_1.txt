This is one of those movies that makes you want the time you spent watching it back, and some, like the time you spent accidentally, the time you spent going to the video store , etc. <br /> <br /> First, the appearance: It's granular, it's low budget. Now it doesn't make a bad movie in itself. But the way it is filmed makes the action look unnatural, so it's a bit distracting. <br /> <br /> Then, the story. 3 Gals go away from the guys on a gal's weekend. Of course, as everyone does when they go on a camping trip, they stop to get earrings. When they arrive at the area where they are staying, they are sent by Mr. Ranger Sir. They scold them to throw a light cigarette out of the car during the fire season, and then drive them wherever they go (a remote cabin). Of course, 2 "cute guys" are wandering in their neighborhood, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are beaten immediately, but Bambi is apparently beaten with anything with two legs. Mady is quite disappointed with this development as she looks forward to a weekend of forgetting her ex, by looking at her bald pigs. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot, there is an average old hermit who lives like this, maybe someone doesn't strangle, and the area and cabin they live in has some kind of "reputation". So of course, sooner or later (unfortunately, much later) some of our weekend forest visitors start dying and find several booby traps (although some of them are actually slightly hit) and of course the remaining campers are understandably upset. No cellphone reception of course (who would have a chance to receive their phone for reception in a movie?). Mr. Ranger Sir stops at strange times and his behavior seems a bit strange, but he said he would get help. <br /> <br /> If you are still awake, there is a fantastic twist that you don't want to miss. Pray that you wake up to an empty screen. <br /> <br /> The acting in this is awful, the production values ​​are terrible and the whole business is just lame and I find it wonderful. It's even released. Avoid at all costs 1 out of 10.
