Straight, damn, the MooCow will reluctantly admit the truth: I like this cheap, cute 70 parody. The idea that big hordes of killer tomatoes destroy the US is a good idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie offers some decent chuckles, and especially the terrible extras that come away from large, naturally-fake tomatoes. This film, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the earlier attempts to make spoofs, which became so popular in the 80s and 90s. Thank you to Airplane! This one, like a beautiful pool, is pretty poor. Many attempts to make humor are unfortunate failures, and will cause much groaning. But the attack of the Killer Tomatoes, thanks to the naked tomato hordes, the unpleasant "Puberty Love" song, and the incredible helicopter accident scene, do offer goods, though largely for the wrong reasons. There are sooooo many things wrong with this movie ... and so right, it's hard to explain. Enough people should also enjoy it, as the Tomatoes made a return to 2 moors and a cartoon series !! Large pieces of time taken from the tomatoes are pretty dull. And dig the 70's clothes, old !! ; = 8) This tomato is tough and cheesy, but worth a good or two; the MooCow says grab a pizza and pop in the tomatoes! : ??
