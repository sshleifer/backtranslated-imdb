A film about a bunch of kind of filmmakers who want to make a documentary about a new kind of surfing in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of movies, including some kind of evil animals or monsters, I thought it might be my kind of movie ... it wasn't !!! It should be more of a guideline for how not to do it! It has a lot of casual humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke. In the final scene it goes to the main characters * role *, the feet are naturally in the air! It looks ridiculous! Good for a laugh though. If it were just for the lack of talent between the actors, the frightening stupid dialog and the hilariously stupid crocodile, it would at least be worth laughing, but it gets worse: I'll guess, the people in charge of this movie noticed how bad it was, so they've already got the old idea of ​​"sex selling" ... completely, i mean TOTAL without any reasons, one of the main actresses showing her breasts to the animal. And somewhere after the start there is a kind of meaningless "makeout". This is the last ingredient that makes the movie absolutely for me. It's amazing how people actually spend time producing such junk! If you are looking for a real waste of time, watch this movie !!!
