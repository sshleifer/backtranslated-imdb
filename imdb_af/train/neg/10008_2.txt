The movie is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is poor and outdated, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what a "walker" is or will really care about. I felt like I was a movie from the 70's. The subject was just not credible for the year 2007, even in DC. I think it was true for everyone who also watched it, because the applause was low and fast at the end. Most also did not stay for the Q&A. <br /> <br /> I don't think Schrader really thought about the movie before. Many of the scenes were cut short as if they were never finished, or he didn't know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and find out or guess what was going on. I didn't really get Woody's (Carter) private life or boyfriend really. What were all the "artistic" male slavery and torture (of Iraqi prisons)? What did he think? I think it was his very poor attempt to create this dark private subculture for Woody's character (Car). It didn't work. It didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) without mistakes. You really had a good sense of what a "walker" might have been (say twenty years ago). He was wonderful and will probably never be recognized for it. <br /> <br /> Like Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Drilling. <br /> <br /> Don't see it! This is painful! Unless you're a real Harrelson fan.
