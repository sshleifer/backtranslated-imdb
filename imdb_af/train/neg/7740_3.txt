This movie actually drives ceaseless enjoyment for 2/3 of the trip. Unfortunately, the film ends up being 'confused'. Knowing some of the plot, controversy is standard of 'buddy cop' movies I got after the characters brilliantly blast, but ultimately the movie is too much on pursuits as a crutch and I lose interest. /> <br /> The filmmakers did a good job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we saw who they were and identified with both policemen. We have formed our own opinion instead of being a view of them through a constant refinement. <br /> <br /> In the end there is too much going on and it reflects a lot of what a pleasant piece of escapism could have been. . Here's what about Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate operations 2. His relationship with a radio-psychic 3. He is being investigated by internal issues. 4. The murder investigation <br /> <br /> If you add to Casey's concerns, you have an actor and revenge. his father's death. Now some of these things come together and come together well, but all the plotting elements come amidst this fake chase that is so long and pathetic that I barely have time to break my hand and give a little about what just happens. The impressive script-acrobatics can't overcome the bad movie story. <br /> <br /> As if a ridiculous sequel wasn't bad enough, one who had four separate divisions and could have been close to half an hour, wasn't bad enough, Joe Gavilan called fields for his property deal while chase the perpetrator with a gun. All these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely useless if the criminal is caught or not. We have already forgotten or no longer cared for the murder teapot at this point, because several plot lines and eyebrows of the hunters have brought us past. Although I could continue the race and how they ruin a decent story, I will not. It could have been a very pleasing formula film, but it has become far too big for its britches and it has turned into a residual waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did very well and a small appearance by Gladys Knight is remarkable. Unfortunately, none of the actors can help this hopelessly deceptive movie to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> While it's likely to be better than "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II" it doesn't make movie good. I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed that it was just movies that ehh thought to make money, I don't know if it was true or not. What is true is to get a big box, for which you don't need a good movie or a good actor. This film also doesn't have its lead role. My advice to Harrison Ford would be to stay with Indiana Jones because at least you can still run.
