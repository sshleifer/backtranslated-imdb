Let it serve as a warning to anyone who wants to put themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a loved and respected, not to say reverent author, to draw attention to their home movies on DVD. <br /> <br /> Hyped by the clouds by its obvious talented makers, actually lied to just being revealed, finally, as ridiculously improper in every department, the supporters of Wells and his book were the blood of his writer manufacturer director since it appeared on DVD. <br /> <br /> Very good points were made by the other commenters on this page. Especially the one about using this as a teaching tool for Film School students, as this "movie" does not even use the basic grammar of mini-dissertation, editing, continuity, direction in its entire 3-hour running time. The director may have turned up for the shooting. Certainly no one was there who even knew at a distance what they had done. <br /> <br /> An on-going thread continues to evolve on this IMDb page, which should at least provide viewers with this white-run drive with a few laughs for their $ 9.00 edition. <br /> <br /> Many are promised. Absolutely nothing was delivered. Besides the fact that Monty Python meets the "World War" with all the humor that has been taken out. <br /> <br /> Incredible trash. Just incredible. <br /> <br /> There are REAL independent movie makers out there who are really trying to work to a high standard instead of slamming their gums about how big their movie will be. People can do worse than watch British filmmakers. For example, Jake West's "Evil Aliens".
