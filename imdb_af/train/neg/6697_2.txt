Crazed Shotgun toting incest powered revenge search truck drivers and obsessive control disorder "Dad raped me when I was 12" handcuff, all the latex wearing prostitutes are just some of the characters you will be introduced to in this full shame of a movie . It can easily be viewed on Sunday evenings at 4am on any cable TV station (IE: Skinemax). (And yes, I know it was a whole sentence, but with my people, it's a lengthy review for a short, inexorable movie.) <br /> <br /> Filmed in "somewhere" Canada, with almost no budget, the plot for this freak show is thin, the police in it never heard of the "state competence" because they both end Miya (Hookers) and Trent (idiot, anal retention, generic, uncertain college student ) the USA (and I thought that only the FBI could do that). The camera is shaky, the sex scene is mediocre and the acting is so bad that it can actually cause unintended acid flashes to movies like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> As far as the Skin Scenes go (which is the only reason to even rent this movie, don't even think about buying it) there are two of them. The first one is the only one worth looking at, but what is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____ (insert unknown actor here, of course he didn't notice anything else) in a seedy, disgusting The motel room (the type with the drilled zinc dripping and the soda machine outside has only blue tonic water left in it). It's all S&M (row crops, handcuffs, hot laundry and lingerie licks) people and eventually he gets left in a motel room, without money and police waiting at his door (it's going to show your guys, don't let a hooker get you in a "mid-of-nowhere" motel room). Unfortunately, Kari unfortunately does not show any skin to remember, and it can only cause profound traumatic experiences for some men, so it is definitely a downer for this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, * Snicker * Snicker * I know you wouldn't mind if I made it known to you, but I won't, you should spend your hard earned money for that one. All in all, I give it a 1/5 for action, a 3/5 for Skin (See last paragraph) and a 0/0 for acting, character development or intricate plot twists. <br /> <br /> - Laughing Man
