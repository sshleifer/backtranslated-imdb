From what was she thinking? file: Whoopi Goldberg will in future play a police spokesman who is teamed up with a talk dinosaur (!) for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice age. Straight-to-tape strangeness is embarrassing and ridiculous, a high concept in search of self. Apparently it was a labor of love for his author-director, Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); Unfortunately, the end results are anemic, to be charity. Goldberg's mere on-screen presence can often produce good will and happiness, no matter how poor the script is, but here she is drowned and you can see the unfavorable results. NO stars from ****
