It was a painful experience. The whole story is actually there, so I'm not going into it, but the scene was terrible. There is this part in the beginning when the scientific brother goes to work, he actually wears a white dress before he leaves. To work, I thought to work with biohazard material which means wearing sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the laboratory itself looks like a school laboratory. There is this monitor on top of a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene. to technically make the place look like a scientist actually eats breakfast in the laboratory and next to him is a biohazard label bottle and his boss walks on him and doesn't even tell him anything ... not called bad acting. Very bad can't be worse than my advice doesn't look and I thought nothing could be worse than the home of death. Joui Boll's movies look like classic Shakespeare in comparison!
