I didn't think it could be done, but something came together and replaced Open House. A low budget horror about someone killing about the high price of property investment - as the worst movie I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet. life. <br /> <br /> It has been voted Best Movie in Montreal's most recent film festival. This leads me to believe that every other entry should consist of empty wallpapers, accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was like a little bit of hell. It comes from Austria, and strives to stumble in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet screens over various characters living in a suburban area with a dark abdomen. There is the dog owner and his virgin wife who is spreading for him, the shiny divorce whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child, the uber-annoying women's lady who calls the top ten lists. The list goes on. Forever. Much like the two hours plus I got in that theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters vary, but not in a clever or interesting or even appropriate way. I couldn't tell if they were good as actors, as they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of "You are so lame!" They certainly didn't have to learn much, because everyone repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene. <br /> <br /> It's not a Gummo, or any of the aforementioned movies. There is no art to discover, and nothing to live on, except perhaps whether you should change your "never run out of a movie" policy (which is quite a few older couples during a random orgy scene done - and if it does eat well, it is not, unless you are one of the mines who does not get the idea that your parents have sex - and with a few local middle-aged couples, to take off). <br /> <br /> This movie was offensive to me. Not the flabby nudity, not the crank-inducing soundtrack, not the shocking scenes that include guns. I was offended that someone actually spent money doing it when there were suitable authors and filmmakers looking for finance. I was offended that someone from outside town could go to see Dog Days and find out if it was the best we could find Montrealers. Most of all, I was offended that somehow the people involved in the festival had been forced to believe that the emperor had a beautiful and stunning new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was just as naked as the maid who did a striptease. <br /> <br />
