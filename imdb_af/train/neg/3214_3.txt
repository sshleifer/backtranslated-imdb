First of all, I want to tell you that I'm in cartoons, anime, animation and such things. It is true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I'll be objective. To start with the story - it's good. Follow the story line of the comic books as far as I know it. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they didn't try to mimic the anime style and adhere to the original cartoon style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare messy effects like fire and lightning, you can tell that the movie was made about 10 years ago and even more. Look a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. For example, look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a lot better! In addition, the voice talents do nothing remarkable, the music is nothing special. So everything, it has no atmosphere. I watched it, but I can't say I really enjoyed it. It doesn't just take you fast. There is a lot of blood and violence, but it doesn't impress me at all. Maybe it will be shocking to someone who has never watched more adult-oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), But I don't think it's the audience for this movie. So they can add a little nudity and spices to it. The chicks around Lucifer were pretty nice, and hell, we got Lady Death myself! There is little sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all, the movie isn't that bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi's fire and ice or wizards. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Blood Loss
