This is a low budget Roger Corman horror / creature flick. A DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. An unstructured crocodile first strikes one's own and gets the taste of man and becomes a fast growing terror after escape. None of the characters have depth, but then it's not the focal point. We only get a few summaries of the great two-edged dinosaur descendant and the best "kill" scenes in a small budget movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a moronic character trying to use a three. bone dog for bait and crocodile itself. Nothing left on the pier, but only top feet. With no real striking roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Most pathetic are Matt Borlenghi and a great professional hooker Costas Mandylor. I was very impressed with the handsome Joanna Pacula as the respectable, dreaded dr. P. DINOCROC, which is a biscuit of pickles.
