I made it my personal mission to go to those responsible for this movie. I even got the rental company to give back my money because I argued they were doing false advertising. <br /> <br /> It's not enough that the movie itself is a p.o. is not, but the cover art is what sold me. I've done better makeup effects on my kids on Halloween than the movie actually prescribes to cover art. Can you say "Raccoon eyes?" <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste my time anymore by using the full details, but come on, the main character of the movie is an LA police born and raised in Alabama - but have a German accent!?! It's outrageous.
