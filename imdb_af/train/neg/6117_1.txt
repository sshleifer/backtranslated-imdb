I can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but personally I think so, because when it was originally released in the theaters, the first buzz was positive enough that my friend insisted we would see it, and we actually STORE IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only "serious" movie I remember where the audience at some point began to sob and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way. Once we have reached the infamous (and interminable) snake fighting scene, I think everyone has given up. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can recognize is the lush location that shoots. Oh, and there are also Bo's breasts, though her acting is so timid that the nudity is unrotic and not much more than a Playboy picture. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic tension" in this movie is between Bo's horrible acting and her husband's horrible direction. The snake battle must be one of the most incompetent "action" rumors ever filmed. However, this is one of those movies that is bad enough, it may be worth looking at the level of unintentional humor. Definitely the worst movie I've ever paid to watch.
