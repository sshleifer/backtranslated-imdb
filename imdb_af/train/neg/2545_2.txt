There's a laugh in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he was funny (before deciding he was a serious actor). But what bothered me so much about this movie is how unlikely virtually all the characters are. Unlike the head two, everyone is a while. I mean, these little town losers are about as rude as you can get. You just look and think, man, these losers must be unemployed. In addition, the American factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slumber. It made me wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh yes, in the end everyone comes together as one, but I just didn't enjoy the trip to get there.
