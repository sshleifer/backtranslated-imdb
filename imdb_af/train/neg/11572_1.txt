Slow, boring, very repetitive. No wonder the Weinstein company didn't buy it. This Spurlock needs to eat more McDonalds while filming and ceasing to produce. There is no way you can see and enjoy it. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can't make a 2 minute movie with this idea a feature. I'm sorry I rented this movie. I will never look at anything called Spurlock about it. It's completely rubbish. Filmmakers like this should be on YouTube and never be granted a distribution agreement. The film states that US consumers and their purchases are blamed for the current depression when shopping and buying products, and making money distributed in the system is the basis of a healthy economy.
