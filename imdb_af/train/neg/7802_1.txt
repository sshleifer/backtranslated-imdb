A chemical waste is to change people into zombies. It is up to two doctors to survive the epidemic. This is an Andreas Schnaas movie, so you know what the par will be for the course. Bad acting, terribly terrible special effects, and no budget to speak of. The dubbing is ridiculous with a capital R and the heartfelt thing is that I feel compelled to write one word about this piece, much less the ten lines that are mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by IMDb . My original one-word review: Crap wouldn't fly, so I have to review it and more to the extent of it's bad. But I don't know if I can, so .. wait I think I have enough words, or lines rather to make this review succeed. What's cool, I think. In summary: This movie sucks balls, don't see it. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
