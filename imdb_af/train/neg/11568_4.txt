This British pot boiler has one thing to do: the young men are uniformly beautiful. The older men were judged, right-wing Thatcherites, whose behavior brought back all the horrors of the Reagan / Thatcher years. Young or old, however, moral things in this three-part mini-series are universally suspicious and nobody comes out especially good. <br /> <br /> Nick is an attractive young gay man, fresh from Oxford. It's not critical to the story, but it has an exceptionally beautiful head that makes it look much easier. Nick comes to London with a friend, whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician, and babysits his sister Cat while the family riots in southern France. They fail to inform him that Cat, when upset, cuts herself with a variety of knives and other kitchen aids. Nick mistake their self-controling 'gratitude' for love and move in, to find out, just how much they despise and deceive him. Inexplicably Nick lives in this house for four years, but since the plot depends on this point, it is best not to question it. <br /> <br /> While Nick is most pleasant to look at, he is unbearably pursued. His mad submission to the rich soon made me climb the walls. Thick off except for Cat (she guesses his big secret), he does just like a little anonymous sex so we know he's actually gay. Although it is almost impossible, Nick takes a lover who is even more devoted to him. <br /> <br /> Superb Tories despise and insult the two blacks in the movie, so think the poison emerging when Nick's sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid. Gerald, in true Tory fashion, has become involved in various personal and financial scandals, so the revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment. This gives Gerald a final opportunity to throw the fearless boy around. <br /> <br /> Except for a brief moment of indignation, Nick is abusing him in silence and silent agreement. Denial, self-rejection, naive or ignorance? You decide, if you manage to go through this whole thing without throwing anything at the set.
