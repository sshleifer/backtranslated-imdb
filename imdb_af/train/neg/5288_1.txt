My God, was it the "Run, Lola, Run" adaptation of persuasion? It was terrible. Bad enough that the "writer" (and I use the term very much) cut and paste the dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context and hating the story. But Anne Elliott runs from place to place in the quest for Wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination! Austen must turn into her grave. No respectable young woman would have acted in such a horrible way. And the actress Maria played? Abominations. Needless to say, if the rest of the Austen remake is so bad, they will turn a new generation of viewers off. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an impeccable version of this (otherwise) wonderful novel, get the targeted version of Roger Michell in 1995 starring Amanda Root (whose expressions can only speak volumes) and Ciaran Hinds . It is wonderful.
