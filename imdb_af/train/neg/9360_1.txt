My score for this crap: 1/10 1 for technical alone. All the others are very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that doesn't make sense. Clearly, creating a good movie or television script is almost impossible. <br /> <br /> Although it's easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they're one of the greatest liars on the planet. It's hard to understand how to make movies so pathetic. <br /> <br /> We have to believe that people are taken for morale. Perhaps this was reason to believe, as 99% of the movies are crazy. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> Looking at the price we give Oscars, we better understand why we continue to make movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And oddly enough, such nonsense was always true. But it wasn't for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to these s ** t, press Super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
