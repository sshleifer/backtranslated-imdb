Just another movie that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity; terribly acting, plus, the love shows are the most sexy I've ever seen (and it's not about me the idea of ​​two young men making love because I'm gay). <br /> <br /> Again, as in Mil nubes de paz, Julian Hernandez made an incredibly pretentious movie with a story that made enough argument for a short movie of about five minutes, but managed to make a Make 2 hours of movie with it. And this time, there's not even the issue of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community to talk about! Gracious God, have mercy on us!
