"It seems that many critics find the idea of ​​a Woody Allen drama unpleasant." And for good reason: they are unbearably wood and pretentious counterfeit Bergman. And let's not kid ourselves: critics were mostly supportive of Allen's Bergman predictions, Allen's miserable accusations in the opposite. What I don't get is this: why was Allen generally shut down for his originality to follow Bergman, but the eternal Brian DePalma was voiced to snatch Hitchcock in his suspense / horror movies? In Robin Wood's view, this is a strange form of cultural snobbery. I will agree.
