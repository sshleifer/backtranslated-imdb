A slavery, humiliation, S&M show, and not much else. The plot is flat, actually just a banal setup for the stylish hidden set pieces. The host of the aforementioned show, a foolish little man who spits while walking around the stage in dresses, was almost as painful distracting as the attempts at artificial editing. The dream-like finite feel tackled. However, for the film's credit, Aya Sugimoto was pretty convincing as the tortured chief. Flower and Snake are compared to Eyes Wide Shut, but Kubrick's is easily the more layered, artistic and atmospheric picture.
