Judging by this film and the strong man, who made the same year, I wouldn't place Harry Langdon on the top of the big screen shots. There simply isn't enough there. Perhaps he was on his way to developing his style, but sabotaging himself by taking his first big successes too seriously. Anyway, all his tricks remind of the bigger funny men, but he doesn't have the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the wonderful ingenuity of Lloyd. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking as Chaplin's tramp character. His brands are childlike innocence, anxiety of approach and a tendency to respond under disaster by looking surprised, batting his eyes or touching his lips with the tip of his forefinger. The comedy in Langdon's movies is the result of the fate that throws various obstacles into his path trying to overcome wimpy or naive ways or with a minimum of physical nature, such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado drive it away and a collapsing building with a two-for-four or dodging rocks by lifting a leg so they roll under it. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross-country hiking trail to publish a competitive company's shoes, he can win with great success. There's nothing here that the Big Three didn't do much better.
