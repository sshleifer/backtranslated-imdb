* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> With a title like "Bleed", you know the creative juices were not well-informed when this puppy got pregnant. The movie is your basic low-budget running slideshow movie. Oh yes, it tries to be creative with the premise of the "murder club", but we learn it was just a joke anyway. Well, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that the new girl in town will challenge her co-worker. He invites her to his circle of friends and at a party they tell her how they have a "murder club" and they kill people, blah blah. Well, we learn it's all a joke, but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage. Now the murder club members are killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win and the movie ends on a downer. By that time you will not really care. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense. The motivation for the murder in the beginning of the movie is never explained. I would say it was a way for the director to shoot the movie, but on the DVD there were screens removed! I'm not sure why anyone wants to see more than the feature-length version of "Bleed", but apparently the people behind the DVD thought the viewers would cling to more. On the box, it says there are Easter eggs, but why the hell I want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is outside me. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie, and "Bleed" was delivered in front. However, this was not a funny bad movie. Everyone looks good in the movie, and there is a lot of nudity, but the acting is just awful. My least favorite character is the man who is ultimately the killer ... I think he's supposed to be funny and amusing, but he just ends up as an instrument. I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the woman in the parking garage, in a hilariously unconvincing death. Heroine kicks the women into the parking lot of the parking garage, and the woman seems to be barely hitting the thing, and she spits out a mouthful of blood and dies. <br /> <br /> For those who think filming is a complicated, creative process done by professionals, look at "Bleed". This will change your mind and you will notice that a movie can be made. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don't waste your time or money on it.
