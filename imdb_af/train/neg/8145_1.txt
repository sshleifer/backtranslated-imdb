This movie is so bad I can't believe it's actually shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you crazy? Did we really watch the same movie? Or the same sh ** I have to say. Everything is bad in this movie. The story (is there a story?) Nowhere completely incoherent, the acting (some dialogues are simply ridiculous), the music score (what the **** is that?), The editing, and especially the artistic direction , a pure disaster. Remind Me the Old Macist Movies ... To give you an example of the amateurism of the production, the mermaid's costume is a sleeping bag with spangles placed on it. I'm not joking, that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the big mistakes we find here: you see in a scene an extra, a fat woman of about 200 pounds, talking about her mobile phone. The next shot, which is in a completely different place, you can see the same woman, still talking on her phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> A big, big waste of money. Useless.
