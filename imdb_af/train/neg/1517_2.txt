In the title I write that the story is ridiculous. Below I will elaborate on you and tell you why in my humble opinion this film is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Gears and Danes are doing their job, and although it's not their best job, it's pretty good. However, the rest of the role play is a very poor job. Note, this is not quite the actor error. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones who have characters that even have the smallest room in the movie to give depth. All other characters have too little room in the movie to create any depth, or the character is such a cliché that doesn't matter how hard the actors try. <br /> <br /> The director has a bit of a Se7en complex, but just look at the direction, I think he does an OK job. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. First of all, it's a bad movie script. The characters are shallow (except Geres and Danes characters), the villains are clichés and the characters' actions are absolutely incredible. In addition, the authors must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics for hundreds of years. It's the kind of movie that says some criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they've paid the price that society has given them. It is also the kind of film that says, even if only between lines, that every form of sexual disorder should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to the movie, all that is not sex in the missionary position of a married couple is a sexual disorder. <br /> <br /> So, if you go to the film school and an example of a bad writing, or if you write scripts yourself and want an ego boost. See it. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
