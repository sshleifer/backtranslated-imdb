I rented it by accident. I thought after a brief examination of the box it was a time series / scientific story. Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I think it's pretty typical. If you sell on the message, you will probably have the inconvenience of the plot / acting / etc. Overlooked but I found it painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I am bothered by the rewriting of history in this story. It paints the 1890s as a kind of paradise of family values ​​and morality (a character is confused that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), But it looks at very improper sides of this "highly moral" society (rigid races , sexual and social discrimination was widespread, for example). And at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that are no different from the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent WSJ). Overall, I think this is the kind of thing you want if you like this kind of thing, and it's definitely healthy ...
