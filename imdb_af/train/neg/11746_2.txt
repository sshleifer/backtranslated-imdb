Well, this movie definitely had a meager amount of hype; From the buzz at the Toronto Film Festival to reviews on CBC Radio. A refreshing, wacky, hilarious indie movie apparently. I've been looking forward to it for months. <br /> <br /> How can I simply suggest it? It sucked in a very big way. An exercise in cinematic lameness that Adam Sandler looks like a comic genius. <br /> <br /> At best, it was generously amusing and, in the worst case, causing the coma to induce. An American writing that is badly edited and rudely edited in a ramshackle debris. <br /> <br /> And what was the music 500db harder than the rest of the soundtrack? It was about the only really strange thing about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny, bizarre movie with strangers, try Repoman. There is no comparison!
