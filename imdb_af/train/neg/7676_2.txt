I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad I could hardly believe what I saw. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes that wander and murder. The scale of the character development was to give each character a name and occupation, and that is about it. There was no real plot and no characters had any motivation. In fact, many action scenes have just begun on their own, coming from nowhere with a terrifying techno track. While watching this movie, I still asked, "Where is this happening? What's going on?" The acting was high school drama quality, with solid woodwork, as if the actors had read the cue cards without understanding their lines. Their line-of-sight problems have been made even more evident by the terrible sound design. ADR sounds like it's been recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taken for granted to score their points. They almost watched robot in their movements. So, these lousy autonomists are struck by a series of careless and confusing scenarios, often without the benefit of the transition zone. They were here, now they are there. It happened, now it happens. Random scenes with little rhythm or reason. I had lots of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine dollars.
