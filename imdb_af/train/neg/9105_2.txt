What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say I will see this movie again if I am tied to a chair and open my eyes. Orange style. <br /> <br /> The movie 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him), whose horrible impression of Ryan Phillipe made me throughout. In a case of terrible casting, Dunne (and failure) tries to go down with an attractive charismatic, charmer. Since the actor is not attractive, not charismatic or beautiful, the character becomes totally unbelievable. Amy Adams (once in a buffy episode) is trying to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar stopped and brought Schathering Katherine to life. However, Adams is not as good as an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion, often she or his reading cards just look outside the camera. However, there were two good actors in the film, but Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers) made very good and entertaining performances as Sebastian and Katherine's parents and is the only reason why I The movie is considered a 2, not a 1. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a poor version of the original, with so lows as copies of dialogue and imitating scenes that lack the originality of the previous movie. <br /> <br /> I think it might have worked as a TV program, but it was recreated with people who could actually act in the chapters.
