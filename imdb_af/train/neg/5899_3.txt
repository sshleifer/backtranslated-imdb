Through all the favning people did about Miike and his work. I sat this movie tonight. I thought, if it's half as good as Ringu, as I have accepted from this comment, it might be, if it's worth my time. <br /> <br /> No luck. <br /> <br /> It's all about finding the next big director (or writer), but I don't think Miike is the one. I don't have a NYU Masters of Fine Arts, but I know so much: a horror movie should have pacing. It should also give the viewer more credibility than this movie does. <br /> <br /> This movie's pacing shook my head. Some of the screens near the end dragged so badly, I went to the fridge and lay there while Kou Shibasaki looked at the camera for seemingly minutes at the end, eyes wide and mouth agape. A famous director once made the claim and I paraphrase, a movie can be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and rolling it. Chewing is not a good actress to make that job. She stares paralyzed at the mischievous girl for more scenes than I remember. And she's not the only one who makes a personalization of a deer in headlights; Other role players apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance. The writing gives them a little room to do too much of the time. <br /> <br /> I like Asian theater. Hong Kong action movie of the past 30 years, Korean horror like 'Phone' and 'Koma', Ang Lee's work, some of the trashy but fun-Filipino movies with free sex and fighting, as well as others. Chakushin Ari I could have done without.
