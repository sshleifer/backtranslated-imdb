Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film. <br /> <br /> There is a good story here about the bait that coal is trying to use for the coming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we go with a so-called bungling Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> The real kudos go to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As with her unforgettable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner, "For whom the Bell Tolle", Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary, but this time she is a double cross-over for the pro-Franco group. She is very malicious here, especially when she throws a 14-year-old child out of the window. She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
