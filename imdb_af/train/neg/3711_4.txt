I didn't see the movie car when I watched the movie, but I based my judgments on a friend's opinion. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat on his face. <br /> <br /> During the movie, Rock makes some funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie is missing in the comedy. The film looks as if both are laughing and integrating love into one, and what it does try to fail. The love story in the movie is straight forward, but it makes too much of the movie by making Rock serious. The film is, after all, a comedy, where the laugh must be the primary concern. Not much of it in the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is also quite uninteresting as a whole. Some parts were completely discontinuous. If the supporting role was meant to be funny, they certainly didn't do a good job. The few angels from heaven tried to make a few jokes, which were dry and dull. Rock's first incarnation's few mutuals were also slim. If there is one thing they did right, however, they made Rock look like it was comparable.
