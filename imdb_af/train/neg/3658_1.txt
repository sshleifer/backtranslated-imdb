In spite of some spectacular peculiarities in the screenplay and film's overall curiosity, Fury of the Wolfman emerges as a boring, uninteresting outing to Lycantropy, rescued only by the static presence of villain Perla Cristal. The rest of the players, including the hammy Naschy, are a complete write-off (though by no means are often abominable dubbing). Although the screenplay comes in enough variations on werewolf / Frankenstein / Dr Moreau themes to whistle out a dozen movies, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterization so poor and the dialogue so surprisingly ridiculous (at least in the English version) , that any latent interest in the harsh proceedings will be scrapped soon. <br /> <br /> Zabalza's direction looks stout, even amateurish. His actions are clumsy and ineffective. He is not helped by Villasenor's excessive lighting. Even promising sets are so immovably photographed that the director's few attempts to frighten the audience are blessed in advance. <br /> <br /> Other credits fall into a similar pattern of ingratitude, although the dramatic overstated music party and the legally rugged, completely primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
