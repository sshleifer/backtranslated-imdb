Wow, not only is this movie a "new lesson in real bad taste," but also a lesson in a real bad movie. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of 'Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence, but at the same time, one must realize when a movie is terrible. If you missed the storyline, the plot of 'Zombie' 90 'is about a government aircraft containing poisonous chemicals that fall into the desert, causing the chemicals to spill. The next thing you know is zombies everywhere in the city to eat people alive, while a goofies doctor and a government agent try to eat the disease these people make - hence the name "Extreme Pestilence." From then on, everything we see is zombies with a field day at every local sight - nothing but extreme and sickly disembowelments and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and gore. Since it is a German movie, the film must be dubbed in English. If you do not laugh at the feeding females of the zombies, the voice-cute is also hilarious and entertaining. As a user called UnratedX * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the movie that crosses the line between what is acceptable and not acceptable, hence the scene in which a woman carrying her baby baby is all around her. wheelchair by some man and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them. One zombie grabs the baby and rips it in pieces, eats its organs while you hear the baby crying. Wow, this is a new lesson in REALLLLLLLYLY bad taste. Horrific I tell you, horrible.
