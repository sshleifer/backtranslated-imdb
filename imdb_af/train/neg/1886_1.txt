I once promised to never walk out of any movie (a personal policy that caused me through the most different types of liquor, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a very terrible experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that East Africans are a miserable, pathetic lot of delays. It shows a world where love and humanity does not exist, a world where people for one reason or another have humbled one another - to derive from their own misery. By choosing a documentary style with non-professional actors (most of them look straight from the imagination of the Austrian shock cartoonist Deix) director, Seidl we believe this is the real life in Austrian (European? Western?) Suburb is. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex organs, violence against women and disabled people, madness and decline. But this is not social criticism. It's just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad movies. If someone needs such a film to realize that things are wrong in our society, this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it seems to people in a disapprovingly derogatory way. It shows ugly people - that's not why I hate it. But it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And so this film is really despicable.
