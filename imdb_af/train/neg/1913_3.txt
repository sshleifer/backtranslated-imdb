"Welcome to Collinwood" is kind of a disaster. Taking into account the people involved, it had to be better several times. <br /> <br /> To see this, if you are at least anything attached to the belief that it will be better, will make you cry. It's one of those movies that had potential, but was robbed of this potential, thanks to a horrible script and some bad acting, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character and the man who told me Richard Dreyfuss remembers, but about whom I care so little that I don't even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of the movie is the strange vocabulary it introduces. I thought myself thinking about it again and again that I had looked at more criminals. That's the only reason I gave the movie a 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily offensive and highly unlikely. They are in a constant state of disturbing stress and they are so annoying that I celebrated their obstacles. They scream each other and swear thinly. The dialogue is at best and insultingly stupid at its lows. <br /> <br /> I think Steven "Traffic" is guilty of Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney. They must be tried for war crimes, if someone remembers this shit long enough to care.
