Eight Academy Nominations? It is out of faith. I just think it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards. With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leaders I would probably have swallowed the bait and anyway watched it, but the Oscar nominations really did sell it to me, and I feel clearly cheated. <br /> <br /> So is this a black comedy? Can someone tell me where the humor is in Prizzi's Honor? It is definitely tasteless (the shootings in the head of a policeman's wife are just another accidental comic intervention in this planned farce about mafia life), but with the exception of a joke about "your favorite Mexican cigars" (what I think is an old joke for Americans officially forbidden to buy anything Cuban for the past 50 years), I have seen nothing of a comic nature - and I tried. There are many Mafia cliches, but clich√© does not make humor in my book. <br /> <br /> Is it a romantic comedy of sorts? Never. The characters and their relationships are so incredible and level that they are on par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is this a smart design parody about the Mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is just senselessly absurd, rather than comically absurd, and it usually only has the feel of a very bad (and inexpensive) Mafia movie. It feels more like a tribute than a parody. <br /> <br /> With one-dimensional characters and little humor written for them, actors dodgy accents and faces are drawn. Well, that's not enough; even when the face is drawn by the master of the comic facial expression, Jack Nicholson (repleat with accumulated upper lip ... now that means it is a parody of Brando's stuffed jowls in The Godfather? ... Oh! Who caring? ... all I know is not funny. <br /> <br /> Throw a little slow, plowing (this movie goes on for 2 hours), some hopelessly handsome and clicked dialogue like; "You remember the Camora? Well, we're much bigger, we'll find you wherever you go," and rocky ways, and you'll reach that quick button before you can say "capiche". Prizzi's Honor is far from Huston's "masterpiece" and is rather a very bad work. It's definitely one job in the big director's canon that needs a concrete overcoat and is thrown into the Hudson River.
