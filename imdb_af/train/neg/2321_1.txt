I can't believe this show still rated a 9 out of 10. I could see if the voices were in the first two seasons, but what would someone take to judge them from now on? I was a big fan of the 1st season. I was addicted - all the mystery, tension, inexplicable events. You never knew what was going to happen next. By season 2 I still looked faithfully, but I was a little frustrated that some basic things had not yet been explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it was just more questions. I like excitement, but sometimes you have to throw a leg to make them look. <br /> <br /> Now I can't even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in season 2 I've had enough. I'm not a big fan of appointment visits - and you can't miss an episode to stop going. So it wasn't worth me anymore. <br /> <br /> It's a pity they couldn't be a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it looks like ABC just got yellow and decided to see how long they could stretch this exhibition. Don't realize they will eventually lose more fans than they possibly can.
