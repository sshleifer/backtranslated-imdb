It was surely the stupidest, cruelest, most repulsive movie I've seen for some time. I was tempted to turn off the video recorder, but, as in the fascination of a terrible car accident, I literally found it in all possible respects COMPULSORY HATEABLE and dragged it to the end. I am by no means a prude objection to the comic depiction of sexual crimes on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, there's something about Maria, both American Pie movies, and even the infamous Freddy Got Fingered. I found very pleasant on their own rough terms. Mamie Van Doren's paddling pool is the frightening appearance of a naked geriatrician since The Shining. Improperly edited and shot, with incredibly boring performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the movie ended without even making me giggle. The only useful purpose for the movie is as a handbook example of how not to make a brutal picture. Oh, and it will also serve as a grassman.
