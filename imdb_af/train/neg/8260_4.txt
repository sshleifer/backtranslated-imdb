First, I want to point out that while I'm not an expert, the way the trial was handled will offend your intelligence. First, the prosecution never proved that "facilitated learning" really works. Irresponsible to both the prosecution (because they can appeal) and the defense not to deal with it. As another commentator said, facilitated learning was untrue. Second, they use Terry as the translator who has personal interest, and even testifies, in the trial that is just stupid. If the court allowed him to testify so, they would have brought someone neutral, otherwise they would just ask for appeal. Third, this child was never asked for specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution (birth, details of the event, etc.) And even when asked by the defense specific questions such as when it started, he could not answer. If it is not reasonable, I do not know what is and a competent lawyer would have been acquitted. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, it's starting to get crowded with being the parent of a child with autism, but the trial makes this movie absolutely incredible.
