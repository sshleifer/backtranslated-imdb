It's easily the worst Ridley Scott movie. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both mistaken in an exaggerated film about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there is never one scene that is convincing in any way. It's not really hard to make a movie like this. Everything the crew did could be an idea of ​​just someone. The writers also didn't have much inspiration; very foolish dialogues that didn't make sense at all; and some brainless action. I strongly recommend staying away from this junk. I hope the many talented people involved in this project realize this type of film, don't deserve their attention, and that they will work in the future for more honorable and intelligent movies than this useless mess.
