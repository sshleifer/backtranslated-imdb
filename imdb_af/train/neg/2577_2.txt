This story had a different angle that irrigated me, enough to buy a previously viewed VHS eyes. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In what was a very nice story - about badly disabled people in a hospital, and their different personalities - they quickly turned into a very profane soap operation with untouchable characters. /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe) the stereotypical racist white person who says the f-word every other sentence and is so contemptible that they did not give him a first name in the movie. He is very fun to be around. Then there is 'Raymond Hill' (Wesley Snipes), a fast-paced female woman. Snipes had to keep from the fast "hip" arrogant roles because he played in a number of them, as in "White Men Can not Jump." Then there is sweet Helen Hunt who plays a wonderful, caring, loving person with an adulterous relationship with the premier character in the movie, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). Anna <br /> <br /> Yup, these are heart-warming, feel-good things. It just makes my heart melt looking at these beautiful people. But, if you are one of those who love lovely characters, portrayed by messy people in this messy movie, you really can! Add Hollywood political correctness to a dose and go there! What more can anyone have?
