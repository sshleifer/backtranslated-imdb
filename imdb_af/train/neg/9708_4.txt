When the theater workers find an old film, they decide to show it during the night of Night of the Living Dead, as this is an old role model. Unfortunately, this is actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that changes the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombies. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the hate for this movie. This is a low budget independent production with lots of camp, but it doesn't earn a "1.1" here on IMDb. It's just as much fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies, and they have created an entertaining tribute to them with references and tributes to a variety of them. It has the feel of things like Night of the Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness and several others. <br /> <br /> I like the explanation of how the zombies, although I really just hypnotize to think they are zombies, actually come up with the physical attributes of the living death, but perhaps I appreciate the efforts of the authors to explain it. The gore effects were decent for the budget, the acting was right, and the story was entertaining. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
