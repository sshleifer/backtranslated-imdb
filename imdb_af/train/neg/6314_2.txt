I love Seth Green. His appearances on the 70-year-old show are always worth watching, but I needed the show last night to repeat it. Four single young guys are plotting an apartment in New York, most of whom would die. The grandmother had to be an heir to have such a place in the first place. So I felt that the need for realism should be brought forth. Anyway, the plot of four best friends to get this apartment was not credible. I would have been excited if they had to join one of their parents, who would have provided good humor and dysfunctional about the show. There wasn't much humor in it. I just watch it because it falls before My Name Earl is on a winning Thursday night. I think they should go back, delete this series, and start again. We need more family-related series. How about Seth and his friends moving with their brother parents in the suburbs after a fire burned their place. Dabney Coleman can play the father and Christine Estabrook, play the mother and dysfunctional brothers and sisters. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network blows it.
