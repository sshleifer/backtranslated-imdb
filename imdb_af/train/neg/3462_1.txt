Slash flicks came a few days away, so when I heard about Cut, I had great hope and good news. The good things I heard were all wrong. Very wrong! This movie is bad and I mean BAD. It's just stupid. Everything about it. Especially the killer's origins and how he lives and how he is cared for. There is nothing original or outstanding about this movie. Just another treasure chest with the "hip", "self aware." "Movie savvy" characters. I'm so sick of that crap. Someone does something else because the move genre needs new blood, literally.
