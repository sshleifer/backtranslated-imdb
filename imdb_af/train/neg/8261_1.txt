I then looked forward to watching this movie and then realized that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was overtaken by the unnecessary curse. Now I'm by no means a prude, but shouting at each other doesn't make a good movie. Ewan Bremner is probably one of the worst actors in the world at this time (witnessing his performance in the godly life of things) and his "Cockney" accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many more of these movies, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" should suffer before the filmmakers realize that the f-word, the c-word, and so on. Not replacing the right dialogue.
