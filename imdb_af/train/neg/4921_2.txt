Blame on executive producer Wes Craven and financiers, the Weinsteins, for this huge budget debacle: a drop metal update from Dracula, with a judgmental verbal jab at Bram Stoker (who probably doesn't want his name in this thing ) and nothing for the rest of us, except the keys and gore. Christopher Plummer looks like Van Helsing in today's winds - not just a descendant of Van Helsing, but the right thing; He kept himself with loose drapes of Count Dracula's body, which was unearthed from his chest after being stolen from Van Helsing's safe and flown to New Orleans. It's just what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well-produced, but without a single original idea (except for multi-racial victims), is repulsive and lazy, and after about an hour begins repeating itself. * of ****
