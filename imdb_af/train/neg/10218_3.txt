** Spoilers included ** <br /> <br /> I heard from several sources that this film was controversial and that the end was particularly terrible. What I didn't expect was the total change in the branch by about twenty minutes to go. What starts when a typical cowboy / Indian western suddenly falls into a very dim romantic 'comedy' about Honus (Soldier Blue of Peter Strauss's title) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who escapes a cavalry attack by the Cheyenne. The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people, hence the romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance then comes up and deprives them both for no real apparent reason. They then escape and become (separately) on the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. As Cresta was previously married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs, she escaped the cavalry base and joined them. So far so ordinary. Then comes the end. After an hour of bad acting involving a cut, they / they will not be taken together. The film then changes into the top exploitation that causes a hood and a child in the back of the head. Agreements can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the movie, but Wild Bunch has kept the same tone throughout and has not resorted to extreme free violence. Soldier Blue reminds me in some respects of Frank Perry's last summer, which has also changed completely for a shock that ends. I didn't hate Soldier Blue, and didn't find the end very disturbing, but just found it to be pretty boring with an unnecessary violent ending. If you want to see a movie with a really disturbing blow from the innocent, I would recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See.
