Corridors of time. The movie you can watch if you are looking for a sophisticated way of suicide. Some use rifles, ropes or gas, but you want to ruin your brain? Don't wait any longer! Corridors of time are probably one of the biggest possible mistakes: think Christian Clavier is able to act and bring you fun. I don't miss the 45 francs. This poor thing costs me. Sometimes one has to review his evaluation system and look at the absolute zero. This movie deserves 2/10, but that's just because I love Jean Reno. Too bad for him, he also dies in Ronin. I think I'm not going to love him ...
