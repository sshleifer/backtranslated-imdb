Wow. Some movies just leave me speechless. It was undoubtedly one of those movies. When I left the theater, there was no single word in my mouth. All I had was an incredible urge to relax my head against the theater wall to help me forget the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. The humor was at the first level, at best, the acting was too stupid, and the plot was far-fetched astronomically. I hear the promise never to see another movie with Chris Kattan or any other SNL player.
