There is no drop of sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's only ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the writing of his play (which is unreasonable), compares the age with irrational behavior - and, worse, clumsy, galloping, moderate irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is mercilessly on us to play an older vaudeville exporter who spoke to former comedian George Burns for a television specialist. It is said that they were a team for 43 years, asking the question "how long has vaudeville lasted anyway?"). Burns, who has won a supporting Oscar, has the accident to come to the film about thirty minutes, after which Matthau has blown the material to hell and back. The noise the film becomes, the less tolerant and viewable it is. Director Herbert Ross did just solid work when he was not connected to one of Neil Simon's screens; Here, Ross sets up gags like an angry amateur, scaring him off with non-paid war routines (like semi-disjointed Matthau appearing on a car garage to audition a TV commercial). At this stage Matthau was still too young for this role, and he compensated too much by grinding and hollering. It was to Ross and Simon to show the character, to renew his temper to give "The Sunshine Boys" some health, but Walter continues to project as if we were all deaf. The picture looks terribly dead and crawls with a spiritual fit; one loses hope early. * 1/2 of ****
