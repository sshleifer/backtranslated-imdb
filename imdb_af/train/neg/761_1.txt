Absolute garbage. The reason why it is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The alleged star did nothing to solve the case - nor anyone else - it was just routine police work. Completely boring. <br /> <br /> You were sitting right until the end was waiting - and nothing but a great sense of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There was as much as possible to have a relative in apparent kidnapping. Can the Lt's personal involvement ultimately cloud? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were that a stranger did. But a genius like Lt C, through constant conversation with the wrong man, will gradually discover a fiery plot with a tape recorder playing in the shower room, while a masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle clues . It could have been good. It was a total waste of time.
