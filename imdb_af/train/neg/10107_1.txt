Last weekend I bought this 'zombie movie' from the bargain and watched some friends think it would be a budget version of 'Land of the Dead'. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br /> They seem to spend a good portion of their budget on cover art, which is very misleading for fans of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> We looked at the point where the zombie chicks get alive and get into the car with the yuppie, talking in the middle of nowhere on a cell phone. They actually talk to the man before one of the girls kills him; but as soon as they were driving the car, I could no longer suspend my unbelief. Some people actually consider it a "so bad, it's good" movie, they are liars. I didn't finish the movie, but one of the other reviews mentions that they have somehow become police officers at the end of the movie. It makes me glad I didn't look at it all the time. <br /> <br /> This is even worse than "Zombiez", DO NOT WATCH!
