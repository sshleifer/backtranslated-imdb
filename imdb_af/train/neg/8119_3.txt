First, there was nothing in this movie that really grabbed me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie I said "Well, it was nothing special" after I saw it. There were probably drama and things, but it simply didn't grab me, but sowed more. As I said in the head, it sowed very cheaply in a way. The quality of the movie itself (the images) has stuck to a low quality and reminds me of some cheap made for TV movie as a respected English movie maker. The camera angles and shots were, according to me, very amateur. Didn't really have any close-ups or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. I didn't see many English movies and the one I saw didn't really impress me and they were similar to camera work, colors and something like that. "Game" tried to be more cool, hip & smart (see my review of "Lola Rennt" about it if you like), but also failed me. Overall just a little indifferent movie that wasn't something special (at best, I'm scared) and basically wasted in two hours.
