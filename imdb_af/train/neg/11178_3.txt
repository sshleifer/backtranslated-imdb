First, I have to admit it is not a good movie. And I'll never see this movie if Pacino wasn't in it. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a public's strange 24 hours. And he's overworked, dizzy, sick and sometimes regretted. I do not like the character. It's really boring, after 20 minutes you can fall asleep. And I don't understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this horrible movie. Just because of money or what? <br /> <br /> Since I'm a keen Pacino fan, I bought this 2002 movie. People I know. If you haven't bought it yet, don't even think about it, it's just a waste of time.
