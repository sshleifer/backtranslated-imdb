There may be something closer in the eyes of dentists. They seem to be doing this arid, really horrible movie, but they also cause the audience to experience pain from the non-dental variety. If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, babies, sick children, very long, long-term cans, a dead woman and a worried man: this is all here for you. Drilling, longitudinally, stands out as one of the examples that exclaims: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes there is. There is a short scene of Nabucco, with some good singing. Save your money, or if it's on TV or cable, save your time. You can always read a book or make an omelette.
