This piece of dirt is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crazy, the picture quality goes from bad to worse, to good again bad! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear. Was the director during his production of a massive brain injury? <br /> <br /> Poor movie sets aside, the story is just as sick, angry. If you like rape, murder and self-harm, it's right on your alley. And if simulated murder scenes aren't enough, you can enjoy clips of real people being performed. I almost watched everything, but had to turn off after I blew out someone's brain. Never before have I seen a movie that made me feel so shy and dirty.
