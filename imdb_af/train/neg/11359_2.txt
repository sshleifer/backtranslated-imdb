While the 3-D animation (the highlight of the show) did well, most other elements fell flat. It was as if the filmmakers thought "Well, it's going to be 3-D, so we don't have to work so hard on the plot or character development." And the fact that it is a children's film is absolutely no excuse. The audience is drawn on three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad), as much as they are drawn to three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that any of the main characters showed was two-dimensional scooter that occasionally turned the plot, with its compulsion to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? Buzz Aldrin's appearance in the end (after a very robotic cartoon version of the same historic figure for an hour and a half) looks at the screen and ruins everyone's good time by calling the movie's main characters "pollution" and announcing the situation is On the screen was actually impossible. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Do you just want to tell the kids that the Easter bunny and Santa Claus don't exist while you're there?
