How Rick Sloane is allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold merger. This film is absolutely criminal. Before I watched this movie, I thought Manos: Hands of Fate was the worse piece of shit I had ever seen, but at least Manos moved so slowly that you could fall asleep and save your eyes from the pain it will suffer. The biggest tragedy of this movie is that the old man who "holds" the Hobgoblins makes it to the final scene. The time I followed this movie was an absolute waste of my life.
