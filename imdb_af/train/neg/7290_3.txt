What a long, stretchy, senseless movie. I'm sure this film is historically suitable, but as it is entertained, it just doesn't make it the grade. Ralph Fiennes is in some fantastic movies, the English patient, Schindler's List, but this one was such a discount. It doesn't seem to go completely over. His character at the beginning was so shallow and urgent, it surprised me that his "sister" was ever interested. Don't pay to rent this movie, buy yourself a copy of the English Patient instead.
