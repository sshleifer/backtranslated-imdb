In addition to the wonderful cinematography by the wonderful James Wong Courts in the battle tones, this movie is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie I've seen recently by Alexander Korda. The first was Charles Laughton's Rembrandt. It was so common that I turned it off. This one I fear is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps her performance as the virgin queen was good for 1937 standards, but if you compare it to that of a Helen Mirren, it's absolutely no match. Robots set Robson her lines in the robot. Her message to the English troops is so bold in the spirit. <br /> <br /> Even a bustling Laurence Olivier can't save this whole boredom. <br /> <br /> Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn't really care about this. To think, that Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It is a pity that history with the Spanish Armada is so boring in this movie.
