One is the highest score I have given to this movie, since zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee yew, a useless mess of a movie with many wasted b-list actors who did better work, wrote and directed by a guy with the mentality of a twelve-year-old who craves dumb wishes and giggles. For example, Gene Stapelton's character (Ding-Bat of everything in the family) that tells Marilu Henner's character that she had sexually swung was a cheap attempt at humor that indicates the general clumsiness of the movie. You want good, brutal humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (only one part), Old School of Office Space.
