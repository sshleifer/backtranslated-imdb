I saw nothing so bad, because I ran out of the James Bond movie "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to put Tilda Swinton through the whole one, but there was nothing she could do to save this animal. <br /> <br /> As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron", this movie failed in every aspect of the movie. The characters were cardboard and could not call any sympathy. The plot was absolutely incredible. The acting was, with the exception of Swinton, an amateur. The computer graphics were worse than in "Tron." Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I can go on, but what's the point. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why an actress of her caliber agreed to appear in such a dud, but she is probably bothering it now. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money or your time on this stinker. There is nothing worth seeing here.
