So the other night I decided to see Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or Power, Passion, Murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was in the lead and I thought it should say something about the quality. Unfortunately, it didn't. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot of the movie is really confusing. There are two story lines simultaneously during the movie. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the movie I'm waiting for these two story lines to come together so that the plot would be clear to me. But it has not yet. <br /> <br /> 2) The title of the movie says the movie is about Natica Jackson. Well, that is sometimes. As said, the film has two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. Such another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice. <br /> <br /> To conclude my story, I really recommend that you go this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store at a place no one can see. By doing so, you won't waste 90 minutes of your life, as I did.
