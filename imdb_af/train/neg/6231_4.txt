All the ingredients of a low-brow b-film cult theater. Topless (and bottomless) girls, Kung Fu chefs, slave traders, evil Germans with mustaches, Cameron Mitchell and sword-resistant zombies. <br /> <br /> And of course, the breasts of Camille Keaton, whose best-known show is in the feminist exploit classes I spit on your grave. We also call the jewelers Shepard, who plays a hooker in the recent movie The Cooler. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a pub in a bar. whorehouse, and on a boat load martial artists on their way to a zombie island where bad martial artists die or something. <br /> <br /> Boots and bottoms come easily and regularly when travelers are well-lubricated, thanks to the boat owner. <br /> <br /> Then the disaster strikes when their boat is destroyed and their land on the zombie island where masmonke young girls offer to the celebrity artists to bring them back. <br /> Just when you thought it all, piranhas are in the water. Yum Yum A great fat German for dinner. <br /> <br /> Just the thing for your next zombie party.
