There is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this "movie". The original said it all and kept quiet. Also read the book or research the story, and you will realize that these remakes are ridiculous. Eric Roberts like Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! After Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story takes place, the sets and places don't look like Kansas. The original is sounding, from the place filming to the use of real participants, weapons and victims possessions. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad Hall ... The original is now available on widescreen DVD. Let this turkey die quickly.
