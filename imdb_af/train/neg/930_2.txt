Some children walk in the mountains, and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discover some old mummified gladiators. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is just as pointless, it's crazy. Here's a short list of things that don't make sense: <br /> <br /> 1) A man and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The man goes out to investigate and finds another walker outside. Then he heard his girlfriend screaming so that they would return to the tent the next morning?! He was just 50 feet away! <br /> <br /> 2) These two thunderheads then hear another girl screaming (What, 100 feet away?), But do not investigate because they are afraid they will get lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another guy and a girl walks around, and in about their 10th scene, the girl tells the man that because of the circumstances protocol no longer requires him to become her professor. don't speak. I mean, what the ...? First, it's just a very stupid thing to say. Second, he never mentioned her professor in the first nine scenes they were together. <br /> <br /> 4) An injured girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her and tells her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yes, we noticed she was wounded and not dead because she got up and walked around. But thank you for the little information. <br /> <br /> 5) One girl is tied up in Demonicus' lair, and if someone tries to free her, she instructs the person to get help. Oh, look, idiot, if she releases you, which takes about 5 seconds, you won't need to get help. <br /> <br /> And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots who are lost in the forest, then they fight, then they bump a tent and ignore the crooks of their friends, then wander around. It's just as damn boring and useless that I turn the DVD halfway through. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are sympathetic, especially those that get the most from screen time. Demonicus made me laugh aloud every time I saw him - he looked like a kid in a Halloween costume, and scorched his face to look angry. He walks, or I have to turn scamppers around like he's gay. The special effects are comedies, the acting is usually terrible and nothing makes sense. Overall, this concept could have made a nice camping movie if they took more time and effort. getting rid of ridiculous dialogue, creating characters with really similar personalities, having a kind of logical flow to action, and perhaps even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit. But no, instead we get this senseless hope of nonsense that will bring you to death.
