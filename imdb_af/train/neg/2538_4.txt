Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century Fox had a bunch of Mr. Moto films made. By the end of the series, however, it was clear that the studio had jumped the "shark". This phrase suggests that a television program has succeeded its lead and managers in charge have decided to renew the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with 'The Brady Bunch' they launched the annoying 'Cousin Oliver' and with 'Family Stakes' they introduced a freak baby who grew up in six years in just one season! With the Moto movies they jumped the shark by setting up comic relief because they thought these intelligent movies had to be reflected again. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And in this movie the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief, because you were hoping someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to shut him down! Although he is supposed to work for the famous Scotland garden, he shows all the intelligence and intelligence of a brain-damaged turnip. His plays were repeatedly unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looked painful while standing there looking at this buffoon "act". It's so bad that it really destroys, which could be one of the better Moto movies due to its clever plot. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, the Queen of Saba's crown is discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he was originally, is about to protect the precious item from theft. In a big twist, try several thieves to steal the crown independently. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is viewable, but it is also sufficient evidence that the Moto series must end here. As World War II approached, the films could not survive much longer, as a sympathetic Japanese main character simply would not be accepted in the US or in allied countries.
