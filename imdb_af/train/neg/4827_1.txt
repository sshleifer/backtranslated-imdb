If this film, as intended to discourage people from doing drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them. I waited for something to happen and nothing really did. This movie is not horror or drama. It's just the paranoia of meth users. This movie can win an award for using the "F" word so many times and so useless. It was not well said, but I felt they had Meth to replace Meth, who was guilty of someone. Hector just got worse and more paranoid when the movie went on and the girl just got more hopeless. The end really made no sense. The movie didn't make sense, unless it just showed how annoying it was, in a middle-of-the-world home with no-head. I based on the other feedback when I decided to watch this movie and the rating on this movie should be a much lower average.
