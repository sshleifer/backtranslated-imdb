Absolutely unimportant. The "twists" are all pretty predictable, if you've seen any movies over the past ten years, and the few somewhat interesting parts (in which someone uses context to make a decision) are few and do not have much punch, since the " secret '' has already been shown before these clues are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoilers, sorta) <br /> <br /> The acting is decent enough. The story is simply not very interesting. The whole "awake" premise is destroyed by the astral projection (not joke). <br /> <br /> The surgery scene is initially tense, a bit uncomfortable, but then becomes completely banal. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, but not memorable. Terrence Howard's least interesting role to date, as far as I have seen. <br /> <br /> Kind of boring, overall.
