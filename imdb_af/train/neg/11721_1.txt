This movie was terrible. The writing is completely unrealistic, but it is written to be placed in the real world. The editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in the film school. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone: A) Know any details about the world of police or covered operations. B) knows any detail about making movies or appreciation. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to the average or below average thought. I think it would be nice if I was a stupid. If you have to watch this movie on a full mind, I recommend getting a little inbreeding. <br /> <br /> It's a total waste of what small production value it has.
