John Huston's Wise Blood was a more horrible misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could imagine. Of the utterly terrible appearances (and you don't, "Oh, it was deliberate, you don't get it!")! At the musical score more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this movie was riotous. Initially I saw it with no bad view, and it actually expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculous fraudulent southern pull to the lilting, comical way in which their faith is portrayed, was inexcusable. Up to the end, which was completely without any character sentiment, it failed in every place that O'Connor's book shone and resonated. The actors depicting the "southern" policemen can also eat braised hot dogs from NYC street teeth and quote Godfather. The one performing performance was Ned Beatty's lively and lethal representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious artist who hears Moates hearing the Church of Christ without Christ and seeing dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is best known for his terrible, religious undercurrent that offends the seemingly lifeless cadaver of "Faith". Mr. Huston's film is a disgraceful mockery of the author's intentions, as they are understood by me and most of her supporters, if I can be so brave to say so. While acknowledging that I cannot know exactly what the author wants to convey, I have enough love for her and her works to desire to remain a fan. If I regarded Wise Blood as Mr. Huston believed, I'd have thrown it in the trash. For the sake of Flannery and me, I forgive you, John Huston. It forgets .... it will take time.
