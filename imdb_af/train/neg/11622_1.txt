Dave goes through a divorce and his thoughts go back to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I must say he fixate on the past girlfriend. He remembers the day the relationship ended. The dream sequence lacks only the turbulent transitions. He remembers their favorite songs and places they went to. I'm not a counselor, but maybe it has something to do with the failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets with a lady half of his age group (also divorced) who is interested in him instead of being "turned off" by his creepiness. Did I mention how spectacular Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He does not move his arms as he walks. It's just strange. To make a long story short, Dave plans to hunt Maria (the old gay friend) and kill her. Err ... I mean to confront her. He does it. It was very creepy. He believes she must be married, but he still flies halfway across the country to meet her. He stuck out her house to make sure she was alone before falling on her. He has an uncomfortable conversation with her that ends with his share of the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comic value. I am still entertaining the woman with my Dave impressions .... "I heard another Dave & Mary song!"
