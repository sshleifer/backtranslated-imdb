I must admit that this "re-imagination" of the original 1968 movie was a great disappointment. Especially when considering that it is a Tim Burton movie. He is indeed one of the most original and I can say, cool directors who produced Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I'm personally a big fan of his work, but something went wrong with his latest movie, The Planet of the Monkeys. I really enjoyed the original movie. When it first came out, people only expected another cheezie 70's science fiction movie, but a very surprising ending proved the theory wrong. It did indeed have a clear cut message. A preliminary anti-war message. Fear of the cold war, where it took the world and fear of using nuclear weapons, played a major role in the minds of the filmmakers. Those reasons have elevated the film beyond all expectations and it has become a direct classic. Although the new movie, the "reproduction" or whatever, leaves us nothing. No message, no ideas behind it. It's just another money-based summer blocker. <br /> <br /> Visually, Tim Burton doesn't let you down. The dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the makeup was great. <br /> <br /> It's obviously not enough to keep people interested in a movie. There must be an exciting plot or storyline. In this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely poorly thought. The writing is very lame and it is full of gaps. This movie seems to be written in a big hurry. The explanation for why the monkeys were true and why the ruling planet was indeed very stupid and proved the ignorance of the writers. <br /> <br /> It raised many questions, which had no reasonable answers. <br /> <br /> For example; Why did the monkeys speak English? Why were there other apes species like chimpanzees on the planet (since there were only chimpanzees in the spaceship that collided with the planet) Where did hell come from? How can a few chimpanzees develop in a large scale of all kinds of monkeys in a few thousand years. (I mean it took a few million years to evolve from monkey to man!) <br /> <br /> And finally, the bad surprise end was just flat. It's probably just thrown in because the original movie had such an end, then they felt the audience was expecting the same kind of termination. The end also raises many questions, which I KNOW, do not have intelligent answers. Did Theid learn to work the spaceship? What was powerless, and learned to fly back in time and take over the one-handed hand? And what did he do to all the women? And we can say that this would happen, I doubt that history will remain the same, as Washington would be built exactly as it is today! (I mean there's not a big banana instead of the memorial?) <br /> <br /> Just saying something positive about the movie. Some of the role-play was wonderful. Helen Bonham Carter's character was interesting and well-behaved, as for Tim Roth as Theid. He was very good, a little exaggerated on some points of the film. Michael Clark Duncan was also good. I wasn't happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not much of an actor, and here plays a very macho color-less character. Very unbielevable and is nothing compared to Horses' character in the original. And the main female character had no reason or place in the film. She was just thrown for the look. I almost said a word throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Well, I think in the future when people think about the planet of the monkeys, they'll think about the original. The latest will soon be forgotten.
