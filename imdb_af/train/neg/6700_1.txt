Is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmental movement? Making an emerging young socialist entry into the circus must be as intimidating as joining a real circus. Although such people usually outsource their brains to Hollywood for these important issues, the teachings of Hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of enviro mentalism. <br /> <br /> Here you will learn the art of leaving your finger in the face of someone without losing your brand loss. You will learn how to shake off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that doesn't interest you by identifying it as the gateway to the planet Armageddon. <br /> <br /> In addition to learning how to lie with a straight face, you also learn how to accuse accusations of your way, no matter how much a hypocrite you are. You will be able to use as much energy as Al Gore while treating people as if you were Amish. <br /> <br /> In the second season even more useful was because we could visit other Hollywood gods. , be holy your names, and audit - that is, judge - their way of life. PLEASE NOTE: This is the only time it is necessary for an enviro-fascist to judge another because it gives the victim the opportunity to buy all kinds of expensive and trendy eco-toys so that they can venture into the faces of others . <br /> <br /> What did Ed have in store for us in season three? Perhaps he teaches us how to be discreet while sleeping!
