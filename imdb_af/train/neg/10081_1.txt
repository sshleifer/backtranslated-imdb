I read some of the comments about this movie and can only suspect some people are easily entertained. This movie is nothing. It is so written, directed and acted that it hardly makes an impression. The characters speak in a dialogue-oriented dialogue and the situations are totally unreasonable. While it might make this camp and fun, it doesn't mean everything is so lifeless, the movie is boring. It is as if Lee Rose has decided to write a drama about a woman who is struggling with her sexuality, but then she was not allowed to do the story a real life or did not have the cojones no. This movie can be a bad life-long movie in the encyclopedia as the standard issue.
