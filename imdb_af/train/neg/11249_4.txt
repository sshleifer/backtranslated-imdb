Visually amazing? Definitely. I saw some movies look so good in a while. Sky Captain and Tomorrow's World use eye-catching cinematography, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically known, but something fresh. The period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s. The film tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and so on for inexplicable reasons. Also, mysterious disappearance of relevant scientific thoughts coincides. Who can stop them and save the world? Well, it doesn't take a leap of faith to know this is the Sky Captain itself with its wisecracking reporter's girlfriend always warming for a head start, and in the wings its trustworthy, thoroughly capable sidekick. What Sky Captain has in the atmosphere and graphics he doesn't have in storytelling and characterization. The plot for this movie is ridiculous. It is said, the film is going for a series-like sense of film series last year. They had quite a distance from stories and bad acting - but none of them, and I didn't mean any of them, had the budget and big names that this movie had. Two academically-acclaimed achievers and Jude Law could hold a movie on the flank but one would think, but Sky Captain is unhappy. Despite his fantastic dark appearance, I found myself filming would just end and I could go on with my life. I had little interest in a story that had little interest. I didn't care about any of the glib images. Paltrow was just terrible. Jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance. The law cannot bear the one-lining tradition entirely on its limited shoulders. I mean, let's see, he's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that it kept so much promise, but still yielded so little. I was bored for ten minutes in the movie - waiting for something to hook my interest - and it never came.
