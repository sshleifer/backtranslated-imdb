Well, there's not a real plot to talk about, it's just an excuse to show scenes of extreme violence and free sex (which can sometimes be fun, but it's not in this case). What else can I say about this ...? The action, when it happens, is resourceful and there is a cool scene where two characters fall from a skyscraper (one that must be a few miles high), but overall there is not much to recommend "kite" . Watch it if you want, but you don't miss much if you hit this one ...
