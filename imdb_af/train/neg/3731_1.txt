I was raised in a "very Christian" household since birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to see it in a youth group at my church. This movie was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and had nightmares for years. I was awake in bed listening to the sounds of my mother's footsteps above. If I hadn't heard her footsteps, I'd sneak up on the floor to make sure she wasn't stuck away. I prayed so hard every night for salvation because I was afraid of Jesus to forget me. This is definitely not something I will show my children until they are much older. It took me years to shake the fear this movie gave me.
