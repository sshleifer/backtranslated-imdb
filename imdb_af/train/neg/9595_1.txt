In the recent movement to bring Asian movies to America, it is the LAST film to be released here. To be a big fan of Asian movies from all genres, I looked at the internet and got this song to be released in the US market again, so I decided to pre-investigate it at a local video shop for rent. <br /> <br /> Trust me ... the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey have blown this movie out of the water. Jet Li would fall asleep and look at the battles. If you are looking for martial arts entertainment, your time will be better with a Jackie Chan movie! <br /> <br /> Moreover ... you think you'll watch a martial arts with a girl devoured in vengeance for her parents' death, but surprised! A good hour of this movie in the middle is filled with dialogue, an absence of action, the lack of a tangent plot, not much to do with the premise we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy party in which the producer / director has not devoted time to elbaorating and yet has donated a portion of the film. It would have been much better if they just cut that whole hour and developed the story by itself through another movie and focused on the martial arts aspect. <br /> <br /> What I'm really not talking about Iron Monkey's choreographer, the action series in Princess Blade did. I was totally offended by the regular use of slow motion and fast camera changes to portray the assassins' physical speed. I just didn't buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you not to waste your time / money on this movie. The point of departure is intriguing and the trailer may even request you, but I am positive that this movie is NOT suitable for the public (perhaps in Japan but not in the states) and will be the worst movie to the Asian movie states transferred to industry.
