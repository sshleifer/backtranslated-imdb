My husband is a great Robin Williams fan. I also love him, but generally found that he should "stick to what he does best" and focus on comedy roles. My thoughts were confirmed with this movie. I was completely bored with the whole movie. The story was predictable. I realize it's inspired by a real story. But my guess is that there might be some tension or intrigue, even though the truth has been maintained in the story. None of the characters were well developed. There was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could be further investigated. More importantly, would be a deeper examination of the mother of the "boy". Her psychological profile would have been interesting for immersion. Of course she has a long history that has not been touched, except in the superficial way. If my husband wasn't such a big Williams fan, we would have left it for 20 minutes. Sorry, I can't get back $ 20 or 2 hours.
