This kind of movie has already become an old hat, isn't it? The whole thing is syrupy nostalgia that itself turned into a kind of feedback loop. <br /> <br /> It surely sounds like a good idea: a great ensemble throw, some good gags and a human drama about what could have / could have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that binds them all together, as in "The Big Chill", one of those main films that copycat films like this one created. You end up seeing more of one or two particular people instead of getting short, taking everyone. The superficiality it creates is not only annoying, it is angry. The below average script doesn't help.
