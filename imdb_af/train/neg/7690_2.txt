Anyone who gives this movie a good review should of course have something to do with his creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. The acting is stiff, the stock generic soundtrack is laughing, the direction is vague and strange of all, the teacher is not really that attractive (the student's blatant progress becomes all the more uncomfortable). The creative thoughts behind this trash should be dissolved and disseminated to prevent further displays of such concentrated crabs. I'm sure some hungry African children could have spent the money wasted on this project. Hell, the funds would also have seen a more enlightened goal burning an addicted addict; At least someone will get entertainment. For the only reason it didn't give me a terminal illness, I give this movie a two.
