This movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> It's trying to copy effects borrowed from a creative director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but that's too much. The dialogues are pretty bad, some of the worst I've ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I hardly ever found him convincingly), his dad in the movie plays very badly, the story is stupid, the end is .. I think I don't like much of a movie, as Christophe Gans' le pacte des loups (and I watch / see about 80-100 movies a year), but the movie has at least some action and many good actors. <br /> <br /> I've never commented here (just graded), and when I saw the rating and comment, I thought I had to write something down. <br /> <br /> I don't think we'll have trouble selling the DVD we've offered: not such a bad movie in our (big) collection! <br /> <br /> I am open-minded (I look at SF, westerns, drama, comedies, silence, horror, fantasy ... movies!), but this movie was so boring that I felt like I was one hour and lost half.
