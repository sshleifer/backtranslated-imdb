<br /> <br /> How this movie ever has a 6-star average is beyond me. The writing is so banal, and frankly an insult to whose life it is based. The cinematography comes straight from the fine world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott must be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, shows no one a surprise by participating in this movie, if one looks at her playlist. All in all, a "high concept" style movie that will even be shy of Don Simpson.
