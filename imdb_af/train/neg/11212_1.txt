The performance of this movie was decent enough, but with sub-pairing it was only dull and dull. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The movie does not work because of the nature of death, it happened to be, so it was a murder. It wasn't like the man wanted to do it. Also, through some flashbacks, there is a secret that is revealed, which makes the events such as justice to some extent. There is no emotion in this movie. The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With a little polishing, and better acting, it could have been pretty good.
