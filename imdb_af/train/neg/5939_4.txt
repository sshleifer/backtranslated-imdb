I thought the movie was OK, but very disappointed that they didn't capture the true image of his life. I expected his mother to be a real Jamaica, that made me crazy. Just looking at the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. Whatever I lost interest in, just a matter of seconds from the start of the movie. I'm very disappointed, it's like watching a biography story about Mark Anthony and playing Arnold. I don't know what the writer misses a valuable piece of the movie, and I'm sure his mom played a big part in his life. I will say the movie was OK except the big Fla !!!!!!
