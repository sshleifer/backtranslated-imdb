Well, how do you rate a movie like this one? Does it even have real film value? It's a movie that's trying to be as close to a sneak movie as possible. Basically, the whole movie purifies a lot of guys torturing a young girl. Not very attractive and also not realistic. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the movie was as realistic and shocking as possible. But the movie is just too fake because it works out as intended. The bang and stump are all soft and false, as well as sounds. They often just kick in the floor, rather than in the girl. Also, the way the girl responds to all the pains is pretty tame. I mean if it really was, she would certainly have shouted it. However, there is more groaning than screaming in this one. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is a low budget and it is a brave effort to make something shocking and realistic, as well as original and challenging, with very limited resources. Don't really think this movie had much impact when it was released, although it had to do something good, as a total of six successors were released to this one. <br /> <br /> Fans of shock and Gore will probably be disappointed by this movie, although there are a few more fetish people who will get a kick from this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
