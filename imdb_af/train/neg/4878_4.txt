If you want to make such a movie, the threat must be. Don't surround yourself with a lot of Bonzos. There is no credibility here. The plot is dull and incredible. The acting is even worse. I thought I had watched Arthur Lake (Dagwood) who was one of the worst actors in history when I saw the main character. Oh well, at some point he must face the music and get angry. I do not care. Do you? There are all these long scenes in this sturdy office (cardboard or masonite furniture). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most of the action takes place in a five-minute sequence. Then it's over. Don't bother.
