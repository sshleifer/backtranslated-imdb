Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is a cliché ride piece of junk. A high school comedy set up in a military training camp. I'm sorry, I had to give this one star that didn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> IT MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Everything is totally forced, unconvincing and unrealistic. The HEPO (military police) will not come to you if you do not make your appearance, especially on your wedding day. The actors were barely embarrassed during this scene, because the scene didn't work, as it was so highly unlikely. You can understand it in their voices. Even if they weren't so bad actors, they couldn't save the scene. <br /> <br /> Next, the man should practice in his wedding dress. No, there wasn't time to get him a uniform first. Man, that's great cinematography! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are also GIRLS in the camp - exciting - one of them is even a model, although it doesn't look that good - and the worst actress I've ever seen. In Hollywood I doubt they will allow her a single line in a B-movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes girls in the army! Now it's fun. The girls are even placed on the same floor so that we can sneak into their room at night! In fact, they will be placed in another building a quarter of an hour, separated by two fencing with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> There are tanks available that we can use for a fun ride in our spare time, of which we have enough. No, the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the sound of the engine, especially at night. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of sex scenes and referrals and everyone is under the waste line. We need them, so the sexually obsessed Germans will also keep the movie. Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film. Well done! <br /> <br /> One sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Certainly, none of the facilities were ever closed. The military routines are as sloppy as they can get. <br /> <br /> At the end of the brainless movie, the mafia hits men about revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him! Because he left his fiancee! Sure I buy it, the Italians are so - a jealous bunch (not). <br /> <br /> The bad guys try to do it in open day with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not rising in the dark at night. Once again, military training grounds (where live ammunition is shot) are open to the public, anyone can ride or walk freely there. There are no such things as guards or fences. <br /> <br /> The deed is prevented by the good captain who starts a rocket in the Italian car. The blast knocked the hits and the furious fiancé off their feet. No one in the distance of 40 meters is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens. It's a comedy, remember. <br /> <br /> Good. It's a comedy, I got it, and I can live with it. No realism needed. Filmmakers can easily touch it when it is hilarious, funny, or entertaining, interesting, challenging. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. It's just embarrassing. A rip-off of mindless American comedies. The latter is at least professional, without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It's pretty boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who are sitting all over the movie, as I did sadly. To yawn.
