Frank Tashlin's 'The Home Front' is one of the more lifeless Private Snafu shorts, a series of cartoons made as military instructional games. Instead of taking some disastrous advisory acts, Snafu focuses on Home loved ones at home and how much they have to offer to the war effort. Snafu realizes he was wrong when he thought they had it easy. This is a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead Tashlin plays the risqu√© card more heavily, extensive jokes with strippers and dancers who barely dressed instead of very effective comic relief. The result is a well-meaning short, which still has little relevance or level of entertainment as a historical artefact.
