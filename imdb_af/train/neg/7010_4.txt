I know nobody cares, but I do. This movie is somehow historical. It is the unit of two heroes from two major seventy sci-fi films. Well, one is wonderful, and one is very bad. The big one is really big, in fact it's the best. The bad is really bad, it's actually the worst. Of course, of the big, I refer to Star Wars and his star Mark Hamill, also known as Luke Skywalker, who is the hero of this movie about a child who gets his fat, and then goes to Las Vegas and after a whole bunch adventures, eventually restore it. (As he fixes cars, I think you can call him "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold, ending with a character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the seventies scientific film "Laserblast", as I mentioned earlier. , the worst scientific film ever made. Milford plays the headquarters where Hamill has to steal his car back. I realize no one cares about this encounter with two great sci-fi heroes, but I do. And I must also say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time. Mark Hamill's acting needs the power, the plot needs extensive Jedi training, and the character of the hooker played by Annie Potts is perhaps the worst character of all time, ever, in any movie I've ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch a weekend day, or a weekday, late at night, very late. It's one of those films that sway, look for something, but without getting it right, and yet it's on its own, just like free-form jazz, just as it is. And do it. And it's not that good, but you can't say it's not entertaining, because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off, but you won't feel cheated. So turn your mind off, relax, and enjoy this bruised gem without any expectation, and the power may always be with you.
