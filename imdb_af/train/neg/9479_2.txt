This movie seemed to be better than it was at last. The movie is good, the play looks solid, the dialogue is not too tight. But about twenty minutes this long scene with a doctor you know is actually a patient at the asylum and pretends to be a doctor. It just goes south from there. <br /> <br /> In addition, the devil is watching the silly list, as the Godzilla appearance is in the curse of the demon. There are also some strange demon worshipers wearing masks that look like the explosive teens from the start of Logan's Run. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie can't save this movie. Despite some pretty solid performances by the actors, the story goes nowhere. I think "Hellbored" would have been a better title for that.
