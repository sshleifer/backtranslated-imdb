Must I say - it's a stinker! (I gave it a score of 2). <br /> <br /> Just look at it if you suffer from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of scenery that is cold and hammering, but not much else. This movie. There is no tension, no deep, shocking secrets revealed, no real threat to the heroine's well-being. A few differences of opinion, slight increase in votes - it's pretty much it. The secret is nothing that cannot happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in the film is totally predictable. The plot, as it is, revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist hired to paint a series of murals in a large ballroom in a large mansion by a very, very rich older widow woman and a growing mother / daughter type relationship that the older woman longs for with her. <br /> <br /> It seems that the older woman's daughter, Cassandra, is dead. You can fit the rest of the pieces together well. <br /> <br /> Even the scene with the mysterious man threatening our heroine does not come to the point where you are really scared of her safety, perhaps maybe a second or two. Why is he still hanging on Cassandra's death for years, a good question. <br /> <br /> There is also the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant, a faithful butler who looks everything - cooking, cleaning, serving the meal, answering the door, etc. Everything except closing the door - that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walked into a room where Faith is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that grabs your chair arms and leans forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no "buildup" tension in this movie - just dull, pathetic revelations that from time to time time is thrown out. <br /> <br />
