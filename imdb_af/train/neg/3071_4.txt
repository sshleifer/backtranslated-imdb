I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (grateful), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets for free at the preview, but it wasn't worth my time or my girlfriend. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying old people have a past before they get old (don't joke). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation, not better than the next, to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best they could with a cripple story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review to counter the positive reviews that are present, which unfortunately convinced me to try this movie.
