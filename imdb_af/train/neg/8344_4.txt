After reading all the rave reviews on this movie and some that give it a so-so. I finally decided to throw in my no cents. I agree with the most point that if it wasn't Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry, it would have been a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch where all the right talent fled south 77 years ago, at least as far as a tank would allow. I got a joke from judges who subtly claim that they taste a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without any confusion. This pious story by the Brothers Crook is like an old record with a ship in it. As an American, I understand the problems facing Indians. A trip to Romania would surely delete the budget. Let's see that this whole movie was a loop from Claire in the petrol station, Claire on the side of the road, Claire among the bleachers, Claire in the house, Claire in the grain field, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire there. It became almost monotonous and would have been if she wasn't the best actor in the movie. Josh and Jeff have to make a living, but don't write a two-page script and turn it in an hour, twenty flick. Before you write another dream spiral script, watch a ghost or two episode of Ghost Whisperer or something and get some background. All the cast except the above and some others were involved in their first and last movie. There is also an appearance by co-director Jeff as he is in all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing that the film is about is that the cameraman has a fixation on Lauren Lewis's derriere. Well, with all the sarcasm I'm happy with now, I still recommend the movie for the horror buff, just to see this young actress in the shaping time of her career (I hope) and that Chris Ferry him as a considered villain worth watching.
