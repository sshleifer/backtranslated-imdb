I can't recommend this movie as a date movie. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical life report living in a South East London estate is a violent Beckettian version of one of Dante's circles of hell. In the middle is Ray Winstone, who did this kind of character before, but never so good. The film opens with him ordering drinks at a bar - that's all - and you are already gripped by the feeling of frustration, self-rejection and barbarism he exhibits in various ways during the film. It is an acting master class. <br /> <br /> Of course, the stymied and uncovered a mace in a drama like this needs and Winstone is adapted by Kathy Burke as his long-suffering wife. He absorbs and eventually rejects his unbearable behavior. . Charlie Creed-Miles makes a capable turn as the druggy boy Billy, but he sometimes had to wonder exactly what he left himself. Gary Oldman immediately leads the actors, maximizing the claustrophobia of their counseling. 10/04
