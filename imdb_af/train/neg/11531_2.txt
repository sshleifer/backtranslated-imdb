The plot is so manipulative, counting on the most unreasonable and unthinkable adult decisions in every parenting decision. The kids are super as far as the charm and delivery of the lines, but as I say, the whole plot depends on every adult who is full of idiots and therefore makes more sense from their actions (and at the same time the only way the boys explain the actions of total distrust). Why would lovely little boys take a baby off the beach? How did the baby come to the beach while taking responsibility for being the LAST place to be sought? Why should the two boys NEVER be informed of a baby at the same time, no one gives a fig tree around them with food and diapers with all the uprising going on and literally every other place it was looking for? There is no justification for asking the audience to believe it. To believe that it will do for the trial (even the informal environment) is too insulting to bald.
