When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I went so wrong. This movie was exactly like any other horror movie. It's a virus, zombies, etc. Exactly as Resident Evil and many, many other films. But the difference with this and other movies is that the story is very week. These are bad actors and boring music. The photo is OK, but the rest is total crap. Don't watch this horror movie, watch the Ring 2 or any other movie that is much more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies that have a virus and spread the virus and make people zombies. We saw enough of that. The only good thing in the movie is when they stand on a roof and shoot famous celebrities.
