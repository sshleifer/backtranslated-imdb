Another venture into the kingdom of teenage coarse comedy, sitting at a college campus with a nerd's search for coolness, and how he decides to express a trio of popular jocks to let him down get the girl. All this has been done before, and it has all been done in a much more satisfactory way. The ferocious humor that made teenage spikes such as "American Pie" and "Dude! Where's my Car" so popular is completely out of context in this installment, which seems so random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove. The film is badly written, and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly portable. I won't even appreciate this horrific picture by telling you, because it's a waste of my time and yours. At best, Slackers never succeeds in entertaining or causing laughter, and in the worst case it is ominously bad and sometimes quite unshakable. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who impressed in his Rushmore debut, humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end in the toilet. Please avoid, please. Save your money.
