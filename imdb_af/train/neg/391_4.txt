For the first few seasons, I thought the apprentice was a very interesting and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week work interview was innovative, and the show manufacturers managed to keep the show relevant and not too "out there". <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business. In the early seasons, they put much more emphasis on business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where participants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show (this means lies, garbage cans, backstabbing, etc.). ). The management room can be entertaining to watch, but it is entertaining at the low point. Sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old Jerry Springer episode. The shows at the show are very boring and mostly a showcase for the companies that are stupid enough to pay NBC for the publicity. And what is the deal about half of the participants living in tents in season 6? It's just stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life. <br /> <br /> I have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season, they all seem to me idiots. In early seasons, some of the participants had at least some integrity, and the participants seem to be killing their own mother to keep up with the show. It also looks as if Donald Trump's massive ego is getting bigger and bigger for each passing season and to be honest, I can't see why anyone with a common sense wants to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom doesn't make sense at all, and sometimes he just wants to get people dirty for what it's worth. <br /> <br /> R.I.P The Apprentice. NBC, please, for the welfare of God, the search is as soon as possible from the air. It's just too shy to look. The Apprentice was once a big TV show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
