As someone who was on the incredible visual art of "Hero", I was anxious to see this movie turned in the same way, but better. It also has an actress I love: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was both disappointed. I chose the DVD of this movie, and it was a mistake. It wasn't any better. <br /> <br /> I realize these flying martial arts are purely fantasy, but this story has so far been beyond belief anywhere. It just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief. A blind woman who defeats hundreds of opponents? Sorry, it's going a bit far. Also, the main male character 'Jin' (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialogue, stupid looking at his face and stupid, that he also destroyed the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes, this story - for me - just didn't have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning. This movie is not a "hero" of mine!
