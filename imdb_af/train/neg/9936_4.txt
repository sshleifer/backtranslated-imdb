It chose 50 cents at the flea market. It was very excited. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating for 15 minutes, just repeatedly and boring. <br /> <br /> It's neat to see. Mick and the gang in their head, I wish there was not so much about the duplication of dialogue so I could hear what was said and played there. <br /> <br /> The sketch is politically dated and incredibly naive and simple, kind of poorly written Monty Python on acid. I spent more time on the late 60's England backdrops, rather than what actually happens in crazy sketches. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great reminder that times are really changing, and what's important is getting stupid. Good song, but it is now played by this DVD.
