Apparently when you give an actor enough money, they will do anything. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves has, but most of the money he made must go to his fans as an excuse to even be associated with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse due to the B-movie of the 1950s and the actions of the rest of the role were even worse. How bad the acting was, I thought, gave the second best performance. The English was terribly accentuated and I think no one could even even speak English. They just remembered how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character 'vibrant'.
