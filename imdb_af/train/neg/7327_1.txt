Heavy moralism. Authors use characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves. Predictable plot points (say five times fast). A Child's Imitation of Britney Spears. This film has all the judgments of a Lifetime Special Rejection. I honestly believe that Jesus challenged Nebot and Julia Montejo to create a formidable, emotional movie on a difficult subject, exploring the notion that things are not always black and white, the one by definition a criminal, is not necessarily a bad person, and that there may be circumstances, especially if a child's welfare takes place. But their seriousness ends up being channeled into preaching dialogue and planting situations to move the plot together. The decent production values ​​and interesting use of documentary style cameras are not enough to reach their goal when the writing and acting become flat. <br /> <br /> Logic is often compromised to create tension: So first try to challenge Pablo to participate in her documentary documentation in exchange for helping them escape. In the same breath, he basically tells him not to trust her because she doesn't help them out of altruism. Well, duh. And for a man on the run, Pablo is much too swirling with a temper tantrum. Cristina's well-being is so important to him that he flees for imprisonment and imprisonment for her, but he is prepared to venture to saturate her if she does not want to go to Mexico. Right. Talk about over-permissive parenting. Third, if Pablo's employer Charlie gives the phone to Detective Bright, she is remarkably unprofessional, especially given his seniority. Did she really think she was convincing? Oh yes, I would have turned myself on. CCH Pounder's detective Wims was able to wipe the floor with her. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I would like to list the things I would like to list. Um, I like the midget. And I like the fact that the little girl is called Sexy. There is cross decoration, always a plus; youthful cross decoration, no less! Harry is infinitely better than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the movie should be if Cristina kicks the detective not-so-clear. I also find it interesting that the black character threw the racist one into a heavy minority (which I greatly appreciate). It was just thrown there and not investigated further. <br /> <br /> There is a distinct, unconventional count, but it is generally context-specific, and does not improve mood or tension in any scene, except the pathetic, anxious complaint each time the main character is Anxiety is, as if they think his acting is not enough: "If you are not sure, he is upset and we have the musical clues to prove it." <br /> <br /> Stilted, clichéd dialogue leads to a depressing shortage of subtext; everything has to be spelled out in dialogue, even when the body language has acted until it is only properly communicated. For example, every passionate speech, Pablo, makes, and Mrs. Knight's grief that her child won't be crawling with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> "Papi, tell me again about Mama" - that shameless, blatant exposition that introduces the generic dead woman! (She is always the most beautiful woman the widow ever saw, the best he ever met. Why can't we see a man crying about a woman like Shakespeare? She can be fat, ugly, stupid, but she love for her is deep like oceans? Now it's a story that would move me.) <br /> <br /> Police are always literally one step behind them, giving many scenes the out-of-place feeling of A French farus. The most boring foot ever chases - Bright and Lightning is so out-of-shape and easily staggering (he's certainly not fast like lightning, and she, well, I don't feel the need to spell things out). Some guys, along with a little kid driving a cyclist, complete with a motorcyclist who chooses a fight, but then caught by a child? To get Margaret Cho, it's so sad. Would we ever see it on 'Cops'? <br /> <br /> Hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina: As an employer you wouldn't really check his green card just because he was the author of the Inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk. <br /> <br /> Plus, several scenes, including the above, threaten to fall into porn: "Well, I'll do this favor for you as long as you do something I ..." I can almost get the bowm-chicka bowm tree. <br /> <br /> When the parents see the picture of Pablo's remorse, the sad mother's freak-out is the right one to feel the movie. Unfortunately, it is reduced by the fact that she is completely swung through his emotional speech until she goes ballistic. A more ambivalent appearance would be more convincing here. <br /> <br /> I am in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of the plot: keep a convenience store without a mask, visit the dead girl's grave. And why didn't the mother recognize his face when she saw him before driving off?! "You look terribly familiar ..." <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of that completely unnecessary, somewhat free play with Soid and the artificially improved bartender? Character development? Tch. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary features that have never gone, Detective Lightning's skeptical detective Bright must be a Scorpio, no matter how much he really knows about the occult. And I don't think the belief qualifies as a voodoo mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> In the end, when Bright Pablo likes to die - wait, why is she giving up now? Her character is so inconsistent with Soid's. What should she shoot him just because she said "Stop or I'll shoot"? (She is so accompanied by her integrity so far.) He was unarmed. There was no essential lethal force. What is wrong to shoot him in the leg to immobilize him? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina's childlike acceptance of her mother's death gives dr. Knight's peace over his daughter's death - so forced. And the gift of the family whose child is killed has become Cristina's new family. It makes me feel like she could be a "replacement" for their little girl. It is also unrealistic that a white couple will bring in the Latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter. I am not saying there is no generosity to love people who would. I'm just saying that the characters here never developed far enough to believe me they would. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another IMDb adjudicator said it was a woman she moved. through the juicy scenes. I am a woman who maintains my emotional movements for moments that have not been sentimental in a fashionable way. <br /> <br /> Co-author, co-director Nebot said he was wearing too much caution during this production. Too many cooks can spoil the sauce, but one visit alone can eventually make an aftercare school. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie's title has less to do with the story and more about the feelings of regret, helplessness and loss that bring the revelation that you will never see your money again.
