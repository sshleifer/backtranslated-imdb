I watched this movie by hoping to find a nice and interesting story, but the story line was not good at all. The act of the actors was no better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Shahrukh Khan was there, but he wasn't enough to make this movie credible and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that this movie is based on Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary", but I didn't see it. It compares to the Indian mentality. In general, we buy movie to dream and a good time, not to waste our time and change our mood in worse. I just can't understand how it can get such a "high" voice with an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you have to run away and ignore, because there is nothing to appreciate. in it! You will only waste your time unless you want a "dark movie" with "strange and non-sense story".
