Stilted, staggy, strange and opaque, as visually striking ... a wannabe erotic fantasy. Really boring, too much male nudity (including father-son incest), and just a kind of shameless futility. However, I would confess that certain parts of dialogue, which are taken in their own terms, have a rumbling, haunting quality.
