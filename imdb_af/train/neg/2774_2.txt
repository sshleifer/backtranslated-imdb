It's just a bad movie. With what seemed to be a good budget, it had the potential to be much better. It was almost. With the heroine pretty much like Salma Hayek, hero almost fights like Jackie Chan, fights and twins almost like in Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like in, say, Conan ... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just boring and it's hard to find something interesting in it. Perhaps apart from John Rhys-Davies who flies in duel like the warriors in Hero or formerly called Crouching Tiger ... I'm very ashamed of the poor old John. He is definitely a good actor and deserves much better. So like you - so if you have another chance, just look something else.
