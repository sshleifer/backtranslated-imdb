I recently watched the first Guinea movie, The Devil's Experiment, and I have to admit I'm disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie is always included in any list of "nastiest" movies and maybe I expected more from the hype. The truth is, however, I don't see it. <br /> <br /> If I looked at it, I believe the opening text is true ("I found this bond ..."), I could have been a little disturbed by it, thinking it was real. Even without the benefit of knowing that this is not, I think I would have figured out that it wasn't. <br /> <br /> The girl's reactions to what is done to her is throughout the film. just is not what they should be. She must scream like a banshee in pain. The fact that she does not mean that of course is not real. I don't want to see it if it really was, but if she were more in the scene, the movie would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then there are the notorious scenes: nothing touched me until the shackle in the hand. The hot oil, virgins and the inside just didn't bother me. I'm not saying I'm "hard"; just that I couldn't suspend my unbelief, partly because of the girl's inability. <br /> <br /> The shell made me falter, but the hammer just made the hand look rubber. And the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing, but nothing more. I didn't want to look away and didn't feel like me either. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the movie is twenty years old, or maybe I'm just loaded. The truth is, I didn't upset this movie at all. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing you can expect to play on as a modern art installation and as an exercise to pull characters away. , story alike. and just leaving the torture, it works on some levels. However, as a disturbing piece of film, it didn't work for me at least. <br /> <br /> I watched Ginekoek with my wife, which is about the "it's just a movie" and she wondered what everything was up to. We have to discuss why I watch these movies and my reasons are many, but include a desire to be touched by a movie. She said she didn't think any movie would be so convincing to disturb her and challenged me to do it exactly. I played her the fire extinguisher scene of Irreversible and she was indeed disturbed. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure I have a point except that we were both more disturbed by a scene in a non-abominable genre movie than any movie that's been disturbed so far.
