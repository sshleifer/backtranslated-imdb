After looking at about half of it, I was ready to give up and shut down, but I endured to the end. It's a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is poor --- much worse than the acting in the 80's T&A movies. <br /> <br /> There are several attempts at humor that fail and the film is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager, this movie will appeal, but for those who have seen many movies, you will know how the movie comes out after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent waiting for the end credits to roll. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time seeing it.
