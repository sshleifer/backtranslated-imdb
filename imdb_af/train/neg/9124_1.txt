This may not be the worst movie Peter Sellers ever did (I think the laurel goes to "The Prisoner of Zenda"), but it is certainly the most depressed. Sellers, especially Sans Makeup like Nayland Smith, seem to have just undergone chemotherapy. As Fu Manchu he barely looks better and spends most of the film (with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he is afflicted with electric currents) on the brink of experience under the weight of all the makeup. The supporting players also look tired and run, and Sid Caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to "Chinks!" (One bright spot: it would be one of the last times that a large movie would portray Asians so insulting ... or, if that matter, a non-Asian as one!). The film looks surprisingly cheap, with supple photography and deadly sets. Even the Elvis number in the end looks like the cut rate. Just the beautiful Helen Mirren and the long, thin, nervous man who gets his pants wet, add some sparks of life to this sad relationship. All in all, this film gives an ominous lead to a great comic's death, and even worse documentation of his death.
