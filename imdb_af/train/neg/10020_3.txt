Vijay Krishna Acharya's 'Tashan' is an overheated, stylized product. Surely this is one of the most beautiful films, but if it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why? The movie script is as an amateur as a 2 year old baby. Script is king, without a good script, even the greatest director of all time can do nothing. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars featured in it. But nothing on earth can save you if your script is vague. Thumbs off! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor is a veteran actor. But how can he play such a role? Akshay Kumar is a good actor, in fact he is the only saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks beautiful and leaves you, everyone stands up. Saif Ali Khan doesn't get his payment here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring movie. The movies fail at the box office, you have to stay away.
