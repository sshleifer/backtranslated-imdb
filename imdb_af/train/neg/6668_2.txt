The longer this film went - and it was annoying to keep going - the more irritated I became so honest, which was a waste of time through this total nonsense. How on earth do people get such movies, or do they get finance for such junk? Don't be fooled by the relatively high ratings on IMDb, as it just proves you can mislead people all the time. And in this photo, the main players have an obsession with guns, so it's not hard to figure out how this movie will eventually unfold. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds bizarre how the US society has such an obscene and deadly 'rifle culture'. <br /> <br /> Anyway: <br /> <br /> The main actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world to be a cowboy in an urban outburst. He comes across a family with two spoiled children, a teenage girl and son; cared for by a strict single-parent father who can hardly handle. The cowboy is granted by the teenage girl or vice versa, and the impressive boy is apparently overtaken by the lunatic of the loser. <br /> <br /> The cowboy spends all the time in a state of unreality and depression. A total loser who prefers to go to the beach then works for life and then breaks into his family because he is too lazy to make money right. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Whoever wants to have a sad failed loser in a fantasy world who likes a death wish, or even sees a poor family who in effect doesn't is better than white trash? <br /> <br /> This movie is drowned out in vain. <br /> <br /> It only saves on making the lowest point possible through half-listening music: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
