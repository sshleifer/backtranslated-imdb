Last night at the Midnight Slam of the film du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie is clearly overestimated by IMDb fans. The acting was only regular. The director made nothing new or interesting. The plot lacks significantly: the movie is about those college degrees and the game they play makes prank calls (7 Five 5ive). And you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like prank calls and an ax shooter that jumps you only once or twice during the whole movie, you may like it. If you don't, this movie is not worth it.
