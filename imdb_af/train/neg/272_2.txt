When I was younger, I really enjoyed watching bad television. We've been guilty of it for some time, but my excuse to watch things like Buck Rogers in the 25th century and Silver spoons is: I was young and naive; Ignorance of what makes a show really worth it. <br /> <br /> Thanks, I appreciate the good things now. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12-year-old I will love every hackneyed bit, every line of stylized dialogue, every piece of unnecessary technobabble. The writing is beyond satisfactory; so tiring and uninspired, it makes one miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me think of the worst Trek show, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> The movie Stargate is a wonderful culprit, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score, and cool sci-fi ideas . With the exception of some of the original music, none of the film-making shows appeared in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver look and Legend interesting, looks like he's sleeping most episodes in half. <br /> <br /> The budget had to be very low, because the sets sometimes look like someone's basement. The cinematography is not much better than vanilla and dull as the scripts. It surprised me that the performances with a much more style (such as Farscape) and substance (such as the Reimagined Battlestar Galactica) have smaller, less racial fanbases than this porridge. It just doesn't deserve it.
