"New Best Friend" is another entry in the subgenre of another woman's life. of which the best is Single White Female and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle; the worse you can catch an afternoon on the canal. For some reason, this kind of identity theft happens exclusively to women. <br /> <br /> There are only two basic ways to play this type of story. You can make the woman angry at the beginning and let the audience consciously look out and implement her evil scheme. Or you use mismanagement to make her a good person, as a seemingly unplanned series of events in her favor breaks until she is revealed to be angry in the climate. Unfortunately, the makers of the "New Best Friend" could not decide how they wanted to play it and things started to break early. We first meet Alicia (Mia Kirshner) the college's financial aid office for scholarship fees. We now know that she is a bad person and will see all her subsequent activities with suspicion. But the director and editor obviously forgot that this revelation was made and spent the next 50 minutes deceiving us to let Alicia be a good person. It is the only element of tension known, not about whether she is angry, but about when the director and editor will show and stop wasting our time with transparent misdirection. <br /> <br /> "New Best Friend" suffers more than most of the teenage movie curse of a role too old to portray undergraduate students. There are actually only two major parts, Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirshner). They were 31 and 26 respectively at the production. It almost works for 26-year-old Kirshner when she plays the murky version of Alicia, but it gets sharp when she is turned into Alicia's glossy version. Monroe's decisive thing is simply a joke, about Nicholette Sheridan trying to succeed as a classmate on "Lizzie McGwire". She looks much closer to a middle life crisis than to a futures paper. <br /> <br /> Producers needed many favors because this age issue spans most supporting characters. Taye Diggs who plays the town clerk is younger than most students. <br /> <br /> The basic set-up is that Hadley and two other rich party girls (played by Dominque Swain age 21 and Rachel True age 35) are undergraduate roommates at college. They share (as their student residence) a cottage that is nicer and better furnished than the home at Real World-New Orleans (a premium that is more credible than soccer mom playing students). Alicia moves into the house and begins to take over Hadley's life. At least in this way, Swain eventually gets a roommate from her own generation so that the two can have a lesbian scene. Swain's supporting performance is the only good thing about "New Best Friend" and her love show with Kirshner is fantastic, so cool and artificial that it doesn't fit any of the other segments, maybe it's sold out to a good director and cinematographer . <br /> <br /> The inadvertently hilarious story is presented in a series of troubled flashbacks of turbulent sex and nonstop parties. Each is continued by shooting a comatose Alicia in a hospital bed. About half of Kirshner's screen time is spent motionless with a tube in her mouth. Not a good career move Mia. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
