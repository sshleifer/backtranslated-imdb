This is one of the worst movies ever. I like casey movies, but it's just awful. Where are the images in the movie on the box? I think more money was spent on the DVD box illustrations than on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why would a company release a DVD that the cover is so misleading? I feel like such an idiot to rent this movie based on the box. As much as I explore IMDb, I had to do some research and make a list before visiting my local video rental store. I have no one but to blame myself. I want my money and time back. <br /> <br /> DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity motivates you, you should rather look straight into the eyes of your eyes. It will be much nicer. You have been warned!
