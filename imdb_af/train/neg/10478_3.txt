I consider this movie as another poor attempt by Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie is a bit funny, but if they change their role in society (men do what women usually do and women do men usually do) the movie falls. Be boring and not funny at all. They predict many things without explanation and the end of the movie. I didn't like the way a Roberto Angel played his character and his little one. I went to the cinema theater and hoped to see a good job, but I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie.
