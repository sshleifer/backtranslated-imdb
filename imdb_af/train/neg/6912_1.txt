The only reason I even gave it 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it out of 10 is not allowed. It was the biggest waste of time I ever endured. For about 75 minutes you are subject to the WORST acting (and this does not mean in a good way as in KILLER NERD, which was very awful) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but absolutely nothing to do with a massacre. The reason I even rented this piece of crap was because it has a bloodbath in the title. It was said, there was only one murder in the whole movie and it was pretty lame. You spend more time watching the kids do boxing and yard work than anything. With the children, the baby actor probably talks about the most annoying child actor since Bob left home at the cemetery. Did I mention that it was also shot on video? If you want to throw money and more than an hour of your life, you should surely see it. But if you enjoy your hard-earned dollars and time, then disappear as far as possible.
