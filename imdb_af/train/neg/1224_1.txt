Who in their right mind does anything as silly as this movie? <br /> <br /> Accidental murder of a security guard ... characters that are so two-dimensional that a two-year-old can paint them ... and better ... <br /> <br /> a Red toolbox of death? Please .... <br /> <br /> Hypothermic poor thugs ... <br /> <br /> Working from hell ... <br /> <br /> Stylistically, this movie moves between teen comedy, thriller , voyeurism and ... female ... (uhm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Unbelievable and this is an insult to any thinker. Don't watch, walk away, it's more horrible than you can imagine. <br /> <br /> And above all, try to be hip by being graphical in the violence ... <br /> <Mrs Montford: Shooting 'Em Up was fun and funny, it's just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
