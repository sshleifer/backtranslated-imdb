To be honest I knew what to expect before I watched this movie, and I have to say it has the worst acting thing I have ever seen. It has its moments, and at a comedy level it is very entertaining, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity is taken to a new level. There are many unnecessary gores, and the plot is across the place. I have no idea why the strangers were angry, and why did they even come to this remote part of Wales (I mean who would go there anyway)? But I didn't mind because I was amused by the costumes and the bad CGI. As far as B movies are concerned, it deserves the title "so bad, it's good" and kudos for the filmmakers, because they probably knew what they were doing. Long may these movies continue ...
