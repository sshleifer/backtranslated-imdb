A group of us watched this movie was really disgusting. We were prepared to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo was not (it's not like the writers / producers could do about it). The writing was poor, the writing was sub-par. What really annoyed us: 1. When the two parents realized that they were both Natalie, they didn't just leave, but they had the dumb (and eventually humiliating) game - just because they were macho-competing guys, not because they really didn't want Natalie. 2. Despite not being able to choose between the two guys before reunification, Natalie suddenly decides that she is really one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no hint that he was really a better guy, it was as if the authors had dropped a coin and flushed it just at a convenient point in the film). 3. Blair makes a point of talking about how she doesn't want children and then suddenly when her husband says he wants children, she'll be happy with him.
