I'm a big fan of the Batman comics and I was disappointed when I couldn't find Batman anymore: The Animated Series on TV. I was excited to learn that there would be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I watched the first episode on the day it suggested and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is very poor. It looks like a cheap, crazy Japanese anime. Then again, just about every contemporary cartoon is like that. <br /> <br /> The character designs are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk, Penguin is a Kung Fu master. Mr. Freeze is an evil thing with an iceberg on its head, and the Riddler is a Gothic Marilyn Manson look-like (which is funny because I don't expect people who are obsessed with puzzles and puzzles to be Gothic). The worst character design is that of the Joker. They're in a monkey / demented Bob Marley / Kung-Fu fighter! The Joker must be Batman's deadliest enemy, but in this show he barely makes a threat because his crimes are so stupid and useless. In one episode, his plan was to put his Joker poison in dog food! Oh, how bad! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is being chased by the death of his parents, and therefore he is fighting crime. This version of Batman does not look like the death of his parents and is not interesting at all. He is also not a detective, just a fighter. If there is an enemy he cannot defeat, he will not study the enemy to determine their weaknesses as a detective would. He'll just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them. Many times this performance doesn't even feel like a Batman show, but a brainless anime. This is nothing but futile battles. <br /> <br /> What I hate most about this show is what they did to the villains. They took away everything that made them enjoyable and related and turned bad guys into stereotypical evil. Man-Bat is the biggest example. In the comics he is a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. When he experimented on himself, he accidentally changed himself into a giant bat. In this performance, he is a crazy scientist who deliberately transforms himself into a gigantic bat without a covert reason. Likewise, all the villains are so; None of them, with the exception of about one or two, have a real motive for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In the comics, Freeze was just a crazy scientist until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote the BASS episode "Heart of Ice". It gave Freeze a new origin that made it a more tragic, three-dimensional and similar villain. The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as their true origin and even used in comics as their origin. Even that crappy movie Batman & Robin used it as its origin. In this show he is a little jewel thief before he gets mr. Become Freeze. After you mr. Freeze has become, guess what? He is another little jewel thief! Great origin. No wonder they used it on the one that Dini created. <br /> <br /> As a Batman fan, I don't like this show, just because it's not like the comics, because I also have BTAS, the Batman cartoons come after, Tim Burton's Batman Films, and of course, the beautiful Christopher Nolan Batman movies. None of them was 100% true to the comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this show is not that it's not exactly like the comics or the BTAS, as it has a depth that makes other Batman media so popular. <br /> <br /> I've given this show so many chances. But the more I look, the more I find it disappointing. I miss the good old days back when Batman was cartoons that everyone could enjoy.
