The earlier part of the movie was pretty nice, but by the end it became harsh. Although Turturro is an actor I usually like, Luzhin often seemed a bad Rain Man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. Generally speaking, this film seems to be trying hard and finally looking pompous, despite mostly fine performances.
