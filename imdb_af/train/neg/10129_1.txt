I can hardly find the words to express how terribly this movie is. I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft, which usually make for an entertaining action movie. I can honestly say that I would rather stick out with a sundowner than seeing this movie again. The acting was so terrible that it was almost funny. The story was insanely weak, with plot holes so wide that you could fly an F117 through them. The writing was so poor, if I find out that a 10-year-old wrote it, I shouldn't be surprised at all. The direction and production is such an amateur, I won't even hire these people to shoot my worst enemy wedding video. Extremely brave. Those responsible for making this movie have made the art cheap, and they must be ashamed. Steven Segal should never show his face again in public, I can't imagine what made him do in these stars, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.
