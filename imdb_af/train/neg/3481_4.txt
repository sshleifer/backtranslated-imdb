This may contain spoilage. <br /> <br /> I say this, but someone enough to read can probably find out that each plot is right from the start. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie I liked. I didn't hate it in the way of some movies that insulted your intelligence, but it felt all too predictable on its troop to the required happy ending. There were funny pieces along the way to be sure, but little was original. At least it didn't go for the gutter. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature. Everyone else is a cardboard cutout, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who made it a favor to anyone. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a harmless but not inspiring 90 minute.
