I think this movie is based on some kind of truth. It's about two young girls who molest an adult man for 48 hours. I don't see where the terror comes into play here. There are some "strange" and "surreal" rows in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh now) play the role of two psychotherapists at stake ... they do a good job (although some of them are just a little over it) . The movie isn't good, and it's not terrible, it's just really dating! I mean this thing drips with the 70's .... It's not really bad if you want that kind of thing ... you know ... that thing?
