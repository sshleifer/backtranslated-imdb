This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I watched it mainly from a morbid curiosity, since I loved the novel, and I wish I didn't. I turned it off for a little less than an hour, but I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I wish I had. It ignores the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors. Unless the film managed to settle itself in the last 50 minutes (which would be impossible), I would not recommend it at all. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I don't think, as many say it is, that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily unfilmable, but this particular version could be done without it. I would almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can justify it.
