I had to change my mind on the worst movie in the world that this one just saw. THIS IS THIS! <br /> <br /> Make no mistake This movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> Hopeless storyline (despite being based on a real story). Terribly acting (what was Judge Reinhold thinking) Incredibly bad stunts. Childlike dialogue. Non-existent continuity. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Get the picture <br /> <br />
