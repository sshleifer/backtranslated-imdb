I know that slashers must always be bad, but come on now, what's the hell? It's like a lot of ten-year-olds who save their money and started filming it by the end of their week. <br /> <Anyway, six young people all go to the same house to kill off the screen. We have the brainy, the slut, the other slut, the black man, the killer, stereotypes like that. After someone is shaking a boat, the other is all knocked by a guy wearing a mask. The people in the poor box were rejected. There is a pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle, but then it is once again bored, and especially more fake fright. Strongly, we actually know it cannot be the killer if one is attacked because the man wants to enjoy his lovely time for everything. <br /> <br /> After every character you expected to die, the standard ugly blonde chick and her boyfriend are eventually caught by the killer (they get like, pushed and then faint) and the killer reveal himself. I think the authors of this movie just took a blindfold and a pen and placed it somewhere on the character list. The motive is just lame and doesn't even make me secret on the damn. Of course, the murderer takes the time too much to explain everything (and then about ten minutes extra in which he cut off his own arm for some reason) and eventually been attacked by a man with a gun. Very, not fair! <br /> <br /> Really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can enjoy myself more by watching a Lindsay Lohan movie, I swear. I'm sure most of the 80 slashers also sucked, but at least they threw in T&A. nothing goes for it.
