I didn't like that much at all. It wasn't really funny and in some cases it was just stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely a very talented individual and while his play was fine in it, it just seemed like a real waste to die into. I think there were parts that were cute and somewhat humorous in a cute way, but that's about it. The only thing that really got my attention during this whole trial of the top jokes was that there were a few very nice women and I am not the only one to watch a movie, but in this case it was the only corner where even the slightest case of salvation could be found. All in all, it was some kerfies under an average movie! <br /> <br /> Final inquiry: <br /> <br /> Theaters: So glad I didn't spend too much money on this. <Br /> <br /> DVD Purchase: Ummm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Rent: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor, why not.
