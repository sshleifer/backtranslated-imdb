As a fan of cheese-like horror movies, I saw it in my video store and thought I'd try it. Now that I've seen it, I wish it no living soul on the planet. I get my movie rental free of charge, and I don't feel worth my money. I saw some bad horror movies in my time, hell, I'm a fan of them, but it was just an insult.
