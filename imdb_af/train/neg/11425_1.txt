I don't know what it was about this movie that made me so complicated. Perhaps it was the characters that were so unlikely and insufficient to care. Maybe it was the disorganized story. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner. Maybe it was because they were breaking out at some point in the movie. Maybe it was because the 1980s were never those 80's. Maybe it was because everything was a critical hyperbola. Maybe it was because a character pumped his fist while driving off the camera during a blur. I don't know what made me hate, but if that means trying to look it up again, I'm not prepared to find out.
