How can anyone say this movie is a comedy? If I didn't go along, I'd have been sleeping and asking for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was as if she was on the wrong set. I like most chicks, but I hate this one. It's the only time I've seen so much clevage and haven't been turned on. Those outfits were very exaggerated. No one speaks so much and I don't think they did it then. The dancing part was terrible. Me later told me ... "Didn't you like that? Didn't you think it was sensual?" I just said yes to saving her feelings. Now I know why we are never married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
