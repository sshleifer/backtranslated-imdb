It's funny. I saw a lot of Fassbinder movies and I found that some were extremely creative and interesting, while others were repulsive and self-indulgent knives - like this movie. For me it ranges from big to crap - without much in the middle. I know he has many fans under the "sophistication", but I can't help but think much of his appeal is a pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I will get many negative ratings for this), he made too many movies too fast and was too self-sufficient. His gay or bend movies (like this one) tend to be really bad - dormant, sometimes quite boring (like QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OR PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes just gross (like this movie). Can't his message of accepting a person's sexual confusion be better handled than to have him beat or to see if cows are being abducted? Shows some sensitivity to the subject and makes your characters more human and sympathetic - then, maybe, I would care about the movies. <br /> <br /> I'm frankly on the lookout for watching this movie, I can't wrestle with Fassbinder movies anymore - the bad ones seem to weigh good.
