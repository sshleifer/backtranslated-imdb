Anyone who saw 'Shine', Scott Hicks movie of the heartbreaking but eventually joyful life of pianist David Helfgotts; I will be sure that "SOLOIST" is very poor in comparison. It's as slow as a lullaby (I have five breaks answered e-mails just to wake up). The portrayal of the homeless area over the top and extremely self-sufficient. To some extent, I fear with the horrible beach game in Joe Wrights' other disaster. .J Fox show was a very bad example of acting and did not have the credibility of the offset. Downey on the other hand; Although he is struggling with a bad movie, he still manages to charm. Is it me or is he on George Clooney in more ways than one?). However, to compare both of these well-known so-called "STAR" factors is unnecessary, as the light that is the brightest as far as acting, it must be of "Shine's" Geoeffry Rush whose brilliant performance is certainly much better in my air. With both 'Attonment' and 'The Soloist' the written word gets much more prizes for empathy of subject. Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD to be in the box soon.
