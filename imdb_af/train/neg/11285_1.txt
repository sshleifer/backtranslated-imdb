I read James Hawes's book. It was pretty neat, not big, but enough. Without reading the book, I would not have had the slightest idea, and that was another stretch of that knowledge. <br /> <br /> Literally every element of this movie is uncomfortable in ways I don't do. Have the ability to describe. Half-digested fish could have made a better movie with matches and dagglo lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before or since a movie have I felt so angry. The mattress sequence came closest, but even they never reached such depths of utterly stupid fright that this lens did. Being 90 minutes from my life, seeing this plague humanly, I can't even look at any book by James Hawes without feeling angry. This is the depth of hatred I have for this piece. No, it's unfair. Let me apologize for all faecal matters to compare you to the global evil that Rancid Aluminum is. <br /> <br /> Plain and simply a cancer on the world of theater.
