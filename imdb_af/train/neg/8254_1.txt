I've seen better production quality on YouTube! I'm sorry for the actors, as the writing was terrible and the direction was shocking, not sure how they could get the lines. I really doubt that any actor could save this movie, no matter how good it was. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot that just seemed nowhere. This is a pity, as the assumption for the movie was good and with better production quality, direction and script it could have been a decent movie. It was definitely not a comedy, unless you laugh aloud at the dubbing - which was amateurish, even the English actors sounded strange.
