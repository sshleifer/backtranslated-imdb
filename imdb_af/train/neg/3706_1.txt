I thought the whole joke of the movie would be to see a rich white man acting like Chris Rock and then seeing Chris Rock respond to people's reactions. Instead, you just see Chris Rock being himself and not understanding him. There may be 2 screens throughout the movie where they use their mopeds. It should have been much better.
