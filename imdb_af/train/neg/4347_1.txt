Wow ... what can I say ... First IMDb says it's in the late 60's ... which means Carlito would be very close to jail. He came out in 75 and said he was in 5 years. They used a bunch of nobody actors, and a story that didn't even make sense. They bring back only one actor, Guzman, and hes plays a very different man. Why did it end up with him and this Puerto Rican chick? Where's Gale? He said he was previously in love with her. Which Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You would think he would have been in this one. And if that makes sense, where is Rocco and the black man in the first one? It was all just silly ... It's an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
