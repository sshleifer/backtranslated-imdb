*** SLIGHT SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> A hackback 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and eventually has sex for the first time. After the act, he lay with her in bed and didn't touch her. The next day he came to the conclusion that he didn't want much sex and didn't want to try it for at least a few years. <br /> <br /> This is apparently a fine opening for a phone call on a boy who discovers homosexuality. or perhaps a medical drama about a post-pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency. <br /> <br /> But as the plot emerges that emerges, a story of a 15-year-old father is supported and encouraged. by his excessive mother. <br /> <br /> At one point, his mother preaches to her co-workers who aren't as wise as they may be. "Every step of the way in this, my son is wonderful. I have never been more proud of him ..." <br /> <br /> The young father's older sister, who is otherwise cold to her brother, take pride in her brother or sister, "You were cool about it," because she gives him an encouraging warm hug. <br /> <br /> The 15-year-old father wants to be a father. He wants to be a parent. <br /> <br /> Why not? We see the "new" baby a few minutes after birth - it seems to be a healthy, happy 4 month old baby. Just like babies were born on TV in the 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> After the young father was a parent, he found happiness. He insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper. We see that the 15-year-old father is sincerely happy to keep his baby while the teenager's busy body mat is pushing over his shoulder. Blur to black.
