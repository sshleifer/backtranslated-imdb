If you hate redheads, you will hate this movie. And to make it even worse, you see Patrick Swayze, I tried to be a redneck. I really can't stand redneck accent. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what is Lonnie Earl's name? How many more hitches can this movie get? The storyline was stupid. I'm usually not this condemnation of movies, but I couldn't stand this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, check out Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... figures ... I think I'll upload it and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. It may just be that I can't usually stand redneck, or that I can't stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze wasn't in it. I didn't laugh at the movie once. I usually laugh at anything. If they showed a few fingers broke, I might laugh. people's fingers are accidentally messed up, always make me laugh.
