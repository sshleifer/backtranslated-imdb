There is simply no use to glorify any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It was straight on trash. In the beginning you might think that you are in a visually stunning piece of cinematography ... and then shortly afterwards you are missed with a huge bag (bugs)! The battles are barely martial, the acting is at the edge of the par, and the music is not worth describing. There's just enough of a story to make an excuse for the movie that was made. The decisions that make the characters and the way they handle the situations are weak and frustrated nothing but me. I think the only reason this movie came about was to be a little fan service by using Yumiko Shaku.
