Canadians are too polite to captivate, but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival has mutilated the theater to rate this movie 0 or 1 on their voices. The premise is that a modern filmmaker plays a 17th-century factory about the love of shepherds and shepherds who were in the distant past, when Druids were the spiritual leaders. Working in three periods offers many opportunities to import anachronisms, including stupid and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rituals that really involve bad poetry. Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross-links and different advanced situations arise. The film could be hilaries like a Monty Python piece, which looks too tight, but Rohmer's effort is falling flat. The audience laughed at the viscera, but had a slow tempo. The end is all in a hurry and is really terrible. It's a trivial movie and a waste of your movie.
