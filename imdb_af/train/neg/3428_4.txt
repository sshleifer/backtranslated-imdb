Well, if it wasn't for Ethel Waters and a 7 year old Sammy Davis, Jr. (Here without the photograph photographed), Rufus Jones would be one of the worst representations of African American stereotypes for president. seen from the early talkie era and would not have been worth seeing. Mrs Waters is excellent here singing "Am I Blue?" and "Under our Harlem Moon" while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared for his superstar status as an adult. He is such a nice tap dance here that I thought for a while he was a small person with decades of experience. So if you are willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones should provide good pleasure to the president. P.S. This is the fourth time I saw and heard the song today, "I'll be happy if you're dead, you Rascal You" on the scene, this time by Davis. Must have been a very popular song over this time.
