I was hoping for the best in this movie. I like war music in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball played good work with their roles; But the authors gave them dull dialogue. The love interest between the two of them did not give any real growth; Suddenly it was there. I didn't think much about the music; the best number was the piece we heard from Spike Jones with "Der Fuhrer's Face". The one complete number that Spike Jones did had little of his great musical comedy; nice easy things, even with the monkey. Bert Lahr's comedy sketch was inevitable. <br /> <br /> There were parts to enjoy: Lucille Ball was quite a viewer, and there was a good choice of little players who earned more time on the screen.
