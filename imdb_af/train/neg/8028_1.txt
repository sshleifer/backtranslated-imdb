Please! Don't waste any money on this movie. It's really nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school children. I couldn't finish it, and usually I like to watch all kinds of B movies. How on earth can they find a distributor? Funny, however: Look at Wikipedia for "dark area". The man who wrote the entry should be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got a lot of money from the producers. Money spent on actors, camera and editing. Even this would not have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this movie. Unfortunately, "dark area" has already received too much attention. Please, director, producer and writer of this movie, STOP to make movies like this ... you don't do yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
