I just finished 'Dark Chamber' and also 'Under Surveillance' and I'm amazed. Stunned, not by the movie, but by some of the rave reviews I've reviewed that influenced me. The story is so devastated by plotting holes and the majority of actors are so flat to categorize it as a comedy. I shook my head and laughed at the devastation while enduring this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin left home at home with a pain killer-addict mother to go with his father-in-law despite Mom's warnings that Dad was not good. When a young woman is murdered, Justin becomes suspicious of the tenants living in the adjacent apartments. With the help of a few pals, he installed secret cameras to keep tabs on these people. As truth begins to unravel, Justin remembers an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> One positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would have liked an extra star or two. She cooled a little, but not so lucky. It would have been the film's potential saving grace. Eric Conley played Justin very well, I thought, and I won't be surprised to see more of him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general depiction of the movie, although plagued by complaints, might have worked if it wasn't for the ridiculous hollow "performances" of key roles, especially Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (Justin's dad). The horror! (forgive the pun) <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low-budget movies. Indeed, I believe independent film is our only hope for decent film production in the coming days. I'll make low-budget movies pretty slack when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical score and overall image quality. However, I do not give grants for stick figures and a Swiss cheese lover's writing. There are a large number of skilled low budget movies out there. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can't help but suspect that at least some of the judges who praised the "Dark Room" are somehow associated with its production.
