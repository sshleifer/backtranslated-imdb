Well, TiVo recorded it because of Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It was promising. It went fast. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of overworking, even from Angelina. She is about 20 and plays a 16-year-old. There are three characters that are supposed to be Italian. Everyone else is Italian-American. The indigenous Italian accent was good, I thought. The young male head is cute, says my wife. Everyone else in this movie is a fat Italian woman. Even the men. <br /> <br /> I should have known when Dick Van Patten was thrown as a curvy doctor, it was a bad sign. The two couples who drove their children around are like the four Italian Stooges. <br /> <br /> My wife won't let go of the remote. Hopefully she didn't use makeup, clothing or decorating tips. It was a sick and twisted combination of horrible and curly. It was reverent. <br /> <br /> To cut off my left ventricle was not enough to distract from the pain of watching this movie. If this movie appears on your TV, do yourself a favor and ram your head through the TV screen. You'll be glad you did. The only movie I've ever seen was worse than it was "Hamburger: The Movie". Or maybe 'Lethal Friend'.
