This movie was long and boring. Surprised that it was chosen for Cannes, although they tend to be pretentious. The point is that Guernsey feels completely void of conflict with other Dutch stars of the artist genre such as Kerkhof and Kruishoop. Even more, it doesn't have a movie at all. A long opening shot doesn't mean cinematic depth, it's just a long boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters have problems I couldn't identify at all. The actors did not suddenly shine under her direction and sometimes acted. Leopold tried, but she wasn't the talent I hoped she'd be. Where is Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really made a few waves in the Dutch cinema. Leopold just made another attempt.
