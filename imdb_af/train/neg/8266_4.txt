What the * shouts * is this movie? Couldn't they see a better script? All in all, it's a nice movie, but ... it's done more than once. To the end I thought it was good, but ... the return to the previous part ... * barf * SO Corny ... Was waiting for the fairy godmother to appear ... but wow, it didn't happen not ... what is good. <br /> <br /> I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but to see such a movie in a new form with another kid who wanted him / her older / bigger; it's just as easy as it looks <br /> <br /> Just watch it come out on TV. Don't get me wrong, but it's not all
