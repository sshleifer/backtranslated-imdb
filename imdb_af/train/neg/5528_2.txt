With this movie running just 61 minutes and nothing so good on television, I decided to post the revolt of the Zombies in the DVD to pass the time. Even though the era it came from was realizing I was very disappointed. It started with the peculiar constructive quality of the opening count (what - no breeding music?) And then the fairly slow moving opening series. Gosh, I figured out a movie about zombies - even from the 1930s - if there were a few chills (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi definitely has it), but it had nothing. Zero. It was barely even dramatic (except for the few moments with the burning eyes placed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone). Like the equally dull King of the Zombies, this movie can be an interesting curiosity to possess, but nothing more.
