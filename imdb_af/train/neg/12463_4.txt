OK Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> Of course I lie because it is. I am a conservative but politics I will release from the movie in my opinion. This movie was anti-forest, anti-Middle East, anti-big oil propaganda, but that's not why it was bad. <br /> <br /> Fist off I'll give credit where credit is due. I saw this movie last night because I like these movies and am a political science in collage. The cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as I could tell very well. <br /> <br /> My plot was impossible for me to decipher. I was tested and got an IQ of 138, but no matter how hard I tried there, I couldn't take the story of the movie and what characters were doing there. <br /> <br /> The story and scene sequence were completely incoherent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless one of those movies is meant to look many times to get the story, which may be very good, I have no idea exactly what is going on. <br /> <br /> What makes sense, because if you want to make a political argument and get no criticism, make your argument impossible to criticize! If you can't blind them with shine, they stick with Bull S.
