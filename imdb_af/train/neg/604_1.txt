I was so scared by this movie, I felt compelled to warn others. This movie has no story, plot or hint of purpose. The movie begins after the standard "frightening" movie intro, which has now become used to every filmmaker. So we can completely ignore the beginning. We will soon be introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to everything you just wasted your hard-earned time and would be better off looking static. (Unless you've seen white sound - EEK), it's a DANGER and everyone has to return to the travel pantomime where they came from. In addition, even the best actors in the world would struggle to see this movie remotely. Their poor performances only contribute to the disaster. Senseless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another scanty "eccentric" writer, probably considered an artist, led to a movie that will test your patience. It was only after my co-viewer turned to me and said, "We looked at it for 45 minutes." Did I realize that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Obviously something is missing and unfortunately it was not the audience. Rather than missing the movie, let me tell you what it has: Dumb Blonde, Victims, Bad-monster-man-thing, about 2 minutes of storyline stretching over hours, days, weeks, months ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit boring in some of the scenes, but expects her to see her face for the rest of the movie!
