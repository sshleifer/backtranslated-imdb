I love this movie a lot. If you've read the Puzo's books, or at least the first two movies (especially the first one) looked very well, you're going to agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Corleone saga presented by Puzo's novel, the screenplay of this movie is sometimes ridiculous. The characters and the relationships among them are distorted. The story ends nowhere, though it looks like the movie. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that different times of the Corleone saga in the 90s are expected and that we will not go find things as they were before. But on the other hand, I don't know why they had to copy some of the other movies, in contexts when they didn't fit. Why this? It sounds like the bad sequels just trying to copy the original movie's features. <br /> <br /> What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino came together to make it. A man who directs pieces like Apocalypse now and Godfather must be forgiven for almost anything he does in the theater until he dies. So does Al Pacino, because he is the actor. But Mario Puzo shouldn't have written it. Why? He damaged all his previous work. What a shame, my friend. The Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 90's story about the gang, and it's great. We can never tell the same about the plot for Godfather III.
