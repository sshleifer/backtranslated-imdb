Some news reporters and their military escorts are trying to tell the truth about an epidemic of zombies, despite the 'government controlling the media'. The filming of the film does not understand that the George Romero zombie films just worked because he kept his politics subtle in the background of most of his films (Land of the Dead). This satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more applied to this scenario. What is subversive or subtle about the view of a military man masturbating to death and destruction? Anything new about the various ads that were cut with the movie? Nope. Furthermore, the play is uniformly horrible, the characters thoroughly unlikely and the plot. Add all this and you have the worst, most incompetent zombie film since, "C.H.U.D. 2" raised his spectacular head. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
