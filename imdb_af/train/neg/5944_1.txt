Not really my genre, this live-to-DVD street battle action is one I just experienced because of a friend who's been on it while we had a few beers. I'm relatively open-minded, and quite a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I'm sitting right again to enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, an ex-con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons that eventually unfold when the film progresses. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> What a boring movie. I understand that movies like this don't rely heavily on plot, but should they be in such a stupid, predictable, and completely stupid story? It may not be important, but it is irritating to me by wave glue. Better no plot and pure action as a colored fleabag mongrel of a story. It is the film-like equivalent of a thin-bodied turkey stuffed with rotten inside. I should probably mention this point which is obviously the sign of the movie: the battles. Even the battles are quite poor. Bone manages well-established solid street fighters in single booths (a big or two are the filmmakers' laudable attempt to rectify this contradiction); fighters who never seem to fall for one are a fool. Even it is repetitive and stupid, arms broken and faces kicked with a steady perseverance that we see and see again and again. <br /> <br /> A run of the movie, movie-by-numbers movie that earns its full earnings straight to DVD status, does absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen time and time again. And not even very well.
