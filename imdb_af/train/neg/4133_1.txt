A few months ago, I watched this movie with some friends, and I still laugh at some foolishness today. The first few scenes alone were hilarious. I won't spoil anything for those who want to see it, I don't want to spoil the laugh. Needless to say the whole time I watched this movie, I was trying to figure out exactly the point of anything the characters in this movie did. By the end, however, we all got bored, as the initial hilarious and shocking movie that these random people carried. There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting. The characters are about as well developed as those in a nursery school "Learn to read" book. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting.
