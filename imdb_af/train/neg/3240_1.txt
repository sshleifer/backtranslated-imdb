This is the first Guinea Pig film from Japan and it is the sickest, in my opinion. A lot of guys torture a girl for a few days before finally killing her. And at this point, I'll say these movies aren't really! They are caught horror movies that are as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scenes are diseases but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they kick the girl in the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and kick the floor near the girl! And how silly it looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other screens include the thumb that was thrown on the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, the fingernails, worms placed on the wound in the girl's body, piercing the eye and maiming in horrible detail and something like that. Very sick and temperate film and has absolutely nothing valuable or film significant. This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, Flowers of Meat and Blood, which try to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Garmin: Devil's Experiment is perhaps the worst thing I've seen and the closest thing to being snuff there. It's still (of course) faked s (n / t) uff, the only difference to real "snuff movie" is that nobody dies or hurts for real in this movie. I cannot recommend it to anyone, as it is so **** and repulsive. Those who consider it are a great horror movie, understand nothing about the theater and its real meaning. I saw it as a curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant it is. They only work at shock level and this is not too valuable movie performance. Devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest movie I've seen and the Mermaid in a manhole (Guinea Pig 4) may be the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. So it's pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
