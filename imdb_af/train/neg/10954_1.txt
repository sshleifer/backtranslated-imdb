If there was a 0 star score, I would like to give it to this absolutely terrible hope. The fact that the actual summary is perfectly good and that if it is made different, it could be brilliant, just makes it worse. The basic task of closing a group of people in an experiment room is good, but WHY IS THE EXPERIMENT? All I see is a lot of inexorable surfers and blondes talking about music and culture. I don't know or want to know about ... The challenges are pathetic and stupid. The whole point of reality TV is to show REALITY. Setting a 'challenge' doesn't allow them to play in 'Friday night games' with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements. make them a real challenge. And if it earns money, it's good if they really deserve it! These people are nuts. If they just made the show better, the real idea would be glorious. But that won't happen!
