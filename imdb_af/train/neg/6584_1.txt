As the only film I could see at this year's "Nordic Film" in LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered as an everyday layer for me. <br /> <br /> This movie, which is an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece of crap! Excuse the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First, the actors aren't the best. But even better actors would not have saved the movie. Eg The plot: after the first 15 minutes it was clear that John was sick, the neighbors girls were not really and he had killed his first friend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flows for me, has nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately it wasn't the only disgusting images to be shown. All others were copied by other directors such as Lynch, but of course without their genius. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize the whole movie and save other viewers time and money: man loses girlfriend, girlfriend returns home, husband dead girlfriend and then gets angry, man warms up, but crazy neighbors girls, man has very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in the end he realizes he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover are in his apartment all the time. bad story, bad actors, photos, that make you vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point for realizing how well you can understand Norwegian if you learned Swedish - for least one advantage of the evening - and you can't choose 0 points here).
