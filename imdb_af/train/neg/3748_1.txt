... but it just doesn't work and I'm surprised to see how many people consider it good. On what grounds? There are some loose tips here and there, but the whole material is self-sufficient and unconvincing. Lynch's movies are generally interesting because they get confused and yet very playful when they do. There are some visuals, there are some subplots, characters, ideas, etc. But it is boring and yes, meaningless. Because everything you need to explore is either too small or too far-fetched, or you can tell it better in a better way. It's just Lynch who is investigating DV, nothing more, so it should be treated like that. 10/01
