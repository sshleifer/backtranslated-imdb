Actually, a movie that predicts the upcoming trends in British popular music is wrong on so many fronts that it is laughable. Tommy fast? The Honeycombs? The movie DOES includes a song by the Spencer Davis group, two by the Animals, and one beaten on the live movie of the Beatles makes their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But all, an uncomfortable performance of British music circa 1964. O, and Herman's Hermits.
