I searched everywhere in the video store to find this movie, the great Elvis fan I am, and I found it a great disappointment. Kurt Russel put most of the Elvis movements down and the voice imitation was great, but the so-called Elvis singing voice just didn't work for me. the voice did not always speak with the Russel's mouth, and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable. There were also so many freaking inconsistencies in the film, people who don't know much about Elvis will probably think they are facts. songs were previously sung by him as he recorded in real life. The time he got his first guitar was wrong, I'm pretty sure his brother, jesse Garron, was buried in an unmarked grave, not one with a big tombstone that JESSE GARRON had read. I know it's just a TV movie, but they have skipped important events, such as the return special, and have taken a few scenes for too long. if you want to see a good movie that Elvis sees in his first rental, THAT IS AWAY, or another Elvis concert. hear and see the true Elvis preform is the only way to really see his talent. (brilliant statement I know, but still ... going out and renting a good Elvis movie.)
