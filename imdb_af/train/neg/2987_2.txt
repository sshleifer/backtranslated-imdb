The dubbing / translation in this movie is straightforward hilarious and offers the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and distracted zombie girl. I didn't laugh so hard in my life as I just watched Zombi 3 (and I saw some very bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, the filmmakers can change this movie again and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. It's just as funny. <br /> <br /> But ... If you're laughing from your sofa to dubbing in a Fulci zombie movie, it's not your cup of tea, then avoid it at all costs.
