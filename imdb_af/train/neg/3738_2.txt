That is what the title should be anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie combines rifles, explosives and relentless killing to make one flop of an "action" movie. Let me put my point in a series of questions: response type agreement. <br /> <br /> What happens in the movie? People die. <br /> <br /> Is this it? Yes. <br /> <br /> What is the plot about? What plot? <br /> <br /> What is the point of the movie? Murder is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What do the characters look like? Extremely flawed and contradictory to their own personalities. <br /> <br /> Is there something good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras to film it. <br /> <br /> If you like constant murder and greed, watch the movie. If you are discouraged with such low standard "entertainment" then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, the plot line stinks, the characters are not worth it, the storyline is completely resistant, and nothing fits together. <br /> <br /> It proves one thing: the actors, directors and anyone who helped to make this movie check is not "Made".
