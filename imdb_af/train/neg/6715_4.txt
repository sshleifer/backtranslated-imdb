I entered the theater to entertain a pleasant 90 minutes if it was not relieved. I didn't leave or relieved. This movie can't lose sight of what it wants and doesn't end much of anything. There are some funny lines and some amazing pretentious movie references (The 400 Blows - for this character? Come on!). Although none of the characters are treated with much respect, the more than thirty gay men get the worst of it: all raptors, fat, sad, slobs. If you're in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships, look out Party, Longtime Companion, Trick, All about Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. You will thank me. <br /> <br />
