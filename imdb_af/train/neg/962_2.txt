Chances are, I watched it again, I can become physically ill, the film is so annoying ..... unless you believe in psychic, reincarnation and the other focus that greatly promotes it. The circulation of souls, they call it here. Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has been done several times before with such films as "Heaven Can Wait." It's also done much better. They had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> At least it's a pretty easy movie, linguistically. It's about the only redeeming quality of this movie.
