Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we care. However, there are some real problems with the story here, we see no real motivation for the behavior of the evil brother, and the timeline is rolled up. Assuming that it was introduced in 1963, the music was late in the 60's / early 70's. The references and dialogue are 70s / 80s. The potential for a powerful climax presents itself, and Penn lets it fly away. But even with all these problems, it is worth the watch, but not big.
