Believe me, I wanted to keep "Spirit". The idiotic remarks made by people at the time of their release on how beautiful it was to see formerly hand-drawn animation again, as if the last pencil-animated cartoon was released twenty years ago, and the even more idiotic comment on how computers now old techniques have become obsolete, got my blood ... but then the abusive, tasteless banality that I endured in the first ten minutes of "Spirit" increased my blood even more. <br /> <br /> The character designs are generic, the animation (partly due to it) just skillful, the art as a whole so tedious, annoyingly ludicrous that you wonder how it could have originated (we know about "The Prince or Egypt "and" The Road to El Dorado ", that there are talented artists at Dreamworks), and the sophisticated use of CGI is in any case indiscriminate. (Why do they bother?) There is no single thing worth looking at. In an animated cartoon it's deadly. <br /> <br /> But it gets worse ... <br /> <br /> The horses can't talk, but they are much more anthropomorphic and unconvincing than the deer in "Bambi", which can. And the horses seem to be able to talk in some way. Spirit itself delivers the prologue (sounds to the whole world as a 21st-century actor pronounced from a California shopping center) and from then on she's definitely unbeaten story absent from the soundtrack, though never once . tell us anything we didn't already know, or give a feel that the artwork, though poor, couldn't print twice. Those prologues, incidentally: (a) contain information that the Spirit, who we later discovered, knew to know; (b) expresses ideas that the Spirit might have the power to express, even if he could speak; (c) Includes new age junk like: "This story may not be true, but that's what I remember"; and (d) will give countless children (the production is over, I suppose, at the age of six) the impression that horses are indigenous to North America, which is so true, in that the common ancestor of local horses, zebra etc. was native to North America - but all equine species on the continent were extinct long before the first humans arrived, and the Mustangs of Geese (which are supposedly here as the buffalo grass) originate from horses introduced by Europeans. <br /> <br /> So, the prologue rather irritated me. <br /> <br /> As often as Spirit speaks, Bryan Adams sings, sounds as usual as if he has a bad throat infection - and that's not so. He sings or even how he sings, it's WHAT he sings: maudlin narrative ballads that contribute even less than Spirit's spoken narrative, and which sounds like they all have exactly the same voice (though I pay a lot of attention and were able to distinguish what they probably did not). If only Bryan Adams and the old handicap-to-a-horse could stay for a minute or two for a few minutes, the movie could have been its true form: mediocre and derivative, rather than jaw bad.
