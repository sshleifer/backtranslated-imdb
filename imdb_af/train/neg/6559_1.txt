My friend chose this one; As a southern born and educated African American, I found this movie's plot and tenet completely without credibility. To believe that class and racial prejudice will be so easy and easily suspended, comes only from someone who is totally unfamiliar with the antiblock south. Totally absurd !!! I wonder how they have a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who knows southern better) to take part in this crap
