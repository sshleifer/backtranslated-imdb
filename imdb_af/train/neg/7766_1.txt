<br /> <br /> As with the other episodes in this TV series that extend to the many adventures of the sea legend, Horatio Hornblower's super human infallibility prevents every chance of tension. <br /> <br /> So little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of THE FOLLOWING GENERATION, Horatio Hornblower invariably beats any situation. Every clever solution necessarily comes from the lips of Horatio Hornblower. Immeasurably superior, Hornblower's main problem in this film series, seems to be to endure the very wrong characters above and below him in the command chain. A perfect creature tells dull stories. So superior is our hero, that even those who try to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless Hornblower is there to manage and control them every move. <br /> <br /> What is the sense of telling a story about any person who can't do wrong and will win every time repeatedly? What is the point of looking at such a story?
