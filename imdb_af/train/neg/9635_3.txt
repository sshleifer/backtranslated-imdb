WOW! Pleasant terrible things. The Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor roadshow land in Sardinia and joins artist director Joseph Losey for this remarkably weak pregnant Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow who holds fort over her minions on an island where she dictates her memoirs out loud to an incredible patient secretary. When Scoundrel Burton appears to be a closer and old friend, Taylor realizes her time is up. Ludicrious in the extreme --- it's hard to tell if Taylor and Burton are acting badly or if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so unattractive. If so, then the play is brilliant! Burton muttered his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor shouted at her. She's really awful. So is Noel Coward as Taylor's catty confidant, the "Witch of Capri." <br /> <br /> Probably, BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves â€” two standard Williams themes, but it's so wrong by Losey, that Taylor and Burton don't spell it out for the audience do not have. they mostly unpleasant monologues, any substance that the film has, would be completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has wonderful photography --- the camera had to be out of focus to screw up the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting role-player contains Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's inventive doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard ... both he and his dogs do a number on Burton!
