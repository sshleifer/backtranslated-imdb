Director Ron Atkins is certifying insane. This ultra-low budget film chronicle a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a note-work that a Rubberneck doll receives from his bitch friend. He began taking orders from the doll to take large amounts of drugs, rape and death, not always in that order. What starts out as a ball-to-wall exploitation movie stays that way, but it gets very repetitive very quickly. I lean more towards the certifiable insane. It's hard to forget once seen though. Just like Tom Green ever did a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My Degree: F <br /> <br /> Eyebrows: Laurie Farwell gets completely naked; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush <br /> <br /> ANTI-eye candy: sees John completely naked
