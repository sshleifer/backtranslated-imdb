This movie went to me. The title might have been the biggest idea I've heard. I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over, tie together the United States and a group of survivors and plan to take out the zombies. DEATH TRAFFIC! It's about a psycho-cop with a weakness to kill his female arrests, coming to him when a pack of zombie women get out of their graves to get proper revenge. As you can see, there is nothing about the nation or a particular province. Where to start with the seriousness this nation has caused our nation. <br /> <br /> First, the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with a dark eyeliner and a light face. What are zombies, but sensible, debatable intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that eat because of their primitive most basic needs? These zombie women run like street walkers and landing models, they talk like they are in a poor movie noir movie and don't act like real zombies. Certainly, eating and killing is there, but where is the mind and the terrible disinfection? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of the genre and asks the question, "Why can't zombies be beautiful vixen killers?" I would say that this movie would be considered a very bad indie movie produced and manufactured by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who likes too much zombie genres, it is an insult and just as scary.
