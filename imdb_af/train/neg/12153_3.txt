Feeding The Masses was just another movie trying to make some money off the zombie craze, mostly due to the popularity of movies like Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts at a television station guarded by the army and reports that the Lazarus virus (zombies) is close to conservation and the city is soon free to do their business again. The problem is, it's totally untrue. Zombies run run and only a small minority of people are aware. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), the camera man, Sherry (Rachael Morris), the chief anchor wife (who is played for some reason as Shelly on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort. Torch and Sherry were laid against the people, but the station is run by secret service (or any other government agency) and they are very censored. <br /> <br /> This movie gives itself a pat on the back on the box cover says, "We keep the mass at a higher level than any of the three" of the dead films by George A. Rombero The source of the quote has lost ALL credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me just say this movie is BAD, I don't mean bad as I expected (I was, of course), but I Believe it is bad because I could not find any standalone qualities in the movie, the play in all parts is either finished or timber. Did anyone remember their lines or read them off tickets? I can't even think of the best Part of the movie was either the best actor / actress - there really wasn't one - if I had to nod someone I would say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character, but it doesn't really say much. /> <br /> I would have to recommend to accompany this movie, despite the box cover, looks pretty good (it originally made me in the movie). 10/03
