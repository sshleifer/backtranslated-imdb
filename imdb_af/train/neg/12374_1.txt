I don't remember seeing another murder / mystery movie as bad as it is. This movie, about a medical investigator investigating his friend's mysterious death in a car accident, has the complete receipt for a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of tension, poor humor and no drama. I remember seeing this movie at PAX, a TV station remarkable for making low-budget and campy-made-for-TV movies like this one. Of course, TV movies do not have the edge factor or the voltage of the big screen movies. But this movie has probably tasted the taste. The makers of this movie missed out on an opportunity to make 'Receipe for Murder' a great TV movie; The title offers some degree of tension. <br /> <br /> So, if you want a good recipe, don't see this movie. This movie alone can kill your TV appetite. <br /> <br /> Grade F
