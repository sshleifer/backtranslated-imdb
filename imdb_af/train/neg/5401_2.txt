Would be better enhanced by making it a <br /> <br /> 50 minute episode of the Outer Limits. Too much redundant material and stuff like the head bad guy who seems to have escaped from the Phantom of the Opera didn't help. The whole Night of the Living Dead series was extremely stupid and unnecessary. If the dead had to punish anyone for their sins, do I remember exactly who killed everyone again?
