I give this pretentious piece of garbage one simply because I don't believe there is a worse movie in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie, I hate acting, dialogue, set, writing and directing. I hope everyone involved in this movie burns and rocks in the darkest circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Condemn this disgusting waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day that this movie is just an imagination of my imagination. I pray that I dreamed the movie and that I would never see it at <br /> <br /> again. My local video store. <br /> <br /> BURN IN HELL
