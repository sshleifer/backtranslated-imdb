I thought it was one of the most depressing holiday flies I've ever seen - the other being the Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three movies are about death. If you would like to be thoroughly depressed, be sure to watch this movie or any of the others. In this movie, the play is good and some of the scenery (except when people die) is nice. But, I'm worried that a clinically depressed person may accidentally see the movie and do it! Despite a "happy ever" end, most of this movie is a terrible disaster after another. And, for some crazy reason, I don't want to be printed if I look at a Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy. After all, it's not your eyes, and unfortunately it feels like the holidays are going.) ). <br /> <br /> For a more uplifting viewing experience, try the forgotten home without a Christmas tree, George C. Scott's Christmas CAROL or a Christmas STORY instead, unless of course you feel unhappy.
