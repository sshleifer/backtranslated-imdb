I, like many people, saw this movie in the theater when it first came out in '97. It was indeed an under-average movie, certainly not the "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fanboys like to make. First, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter how you see it. People just love him because of his appearance. His acting "skills" consist mainly of many casey lines and try to act sexy. Secondly, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: girl falls in love with the guy, the ship they sink on, very crazy love scenes. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize it's in no way ingenious. It's not original either. Plus, the director felt the need to drag it out for 3+ hours. I can compress it in a one-hour block without losing any of the plots. Finally, "Titanic" is the most overestimated movie to date. Why it has so much attention and money is beyond me.
