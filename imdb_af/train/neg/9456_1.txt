The sun didn't shine, it was too wet to play, so I went to the cold, cold, wet date. <br /> <br /> The cat in the hat was the name of the movie, and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played the cat, his humor was lame and kids didn't need it. The humor was not soft. <br /> <br /> the movie was like drinking milk from a rabid cow, so having fun is fun, but the filmmakers didn't know how. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is frightening. The play was bad, the plot was overloaded, and the humor was surprisingly rough. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, a line breaker and a future sheriff. When their mother has to go to work, she gets married. Kwan to babysitting. Perhaps the only funny role in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan looks at a Taiwan court court, a la C team. She soon falls asleep, and here comes the cat. <br /> <br /> The movie is beginning to become spiralless. The cat came to try to give the kids fun. He has Thing 1 and Thing 2, which suddenly begins to house. He improvised a TV Infomercial, and accidentally cut his tail. And when the cat is full of Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Perhaps his only funny disguise is a hippie activist. And there is a fish that the kids try to warn the cat. <br /> <br /> Too bad, he didn't warn us. This movie is as much fun as sour milk, or your tail shaved. <br /> <br /> Soon, the kids are out looking for the family dog, which has the key to a crate on its collar. If the crate doesn't close soon, their home will be home to the Kat universe. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, the acting is terrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of inexorable Austin Powers humor to the cat, says things like "You dirty ho" and presents himself as a woman for the rest of his life after he hit the testicles while being a pinata . Spencer Breslin is great if Conrad and Dakota Fanning are cute like Sally, although they alone aren't enough to save this terrible Aortic Dissection, and wait to kill John Ritter. Alec Baldwin's smart and noisy Lawrence Quinn is disgusting and tries to woo the children's mother, played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr Humberfloob's mother's boss and is also the voice of the fish. The latter three are also slim. <br /> <br /> Overall, if I was a parent, I wouldn't take my kids in humorous humor, because there's a lot of it and more. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. As late-sized Dr Seuss once said, <br /> <br /> It's fun to have fun, but you need to know how. Really, Universal, stop! Theodore has already been turned into his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mom always says, "Curiousity killed the Cat" .- The Cat In The Hat * out of *****
