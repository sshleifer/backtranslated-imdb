Somewhere between the Food Court and Zip's, the mall in this movie has <br /> <br /> an explosives store. This is the only place where the title character <br /> <br /> can buy the bomb he's in the mall in the dull final plant. <br /> <br /> A fictional town has a new shopping center built on some land. it was <br /> <br /> condemned. Cute girl (I didn't catch her name) gets a job as <br /> <br /> waitress there. She lost her boyfriend in a fire on the site where the <br /> <br /> mall is. The rogue mall owner rents the firefighter <br /> <br /> for the fire as a security guard after his first security <br /> <br /> has died. Rob Estes, eons for "Silk Stalkings," is a <br /> <br /> photographer / reporter trying to find a story. He's jumping with Cute Girl, <br /> <br /> and their mutual "funny" friend Pauly Shore, trying to find out if Eric <br /> <br /> is still alive. He lives in the mall basement (?) And travels through the air tubes and offers various people upset by his former girlfriend, including the arson. Eventually he kidnapped her <br /> <br /> and the final entailed the bomb and all ran out of the <br /> <br /> scene before the big kabloei. Morgan Fairchild is together for the <br /> <br /> ride as mayor ... yes, she is the mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course, you probably don't need a plot sketch, as the whole <br /> <br /> story is in the title. Someone named Eric takes revenge on <br /> <br /> people as a ghost of a mall. It also means that there is no <br /> <br /> voltage. We know Eric is behind this, but we still have to see. Estes and Cute Girl are investigating the movements of a stupid. <br /> <br /> See as Fairchild, who we know was with the owner of the <br /> <br /> mall owner, pulling a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of <br / > <br /> A busy party, but no one says a word like she is leading them to her <br /> <br /> office and her ultimate death. The fictional town is big, but another policeman has ever been called, all relying on mall security for ordering. Eric has been hiding since the mall was built, but I'm not sure <br /> <br /> where. He seems to be in a basement, but you would think <br /> <br /> A construction worker would have found him. He also provided <br /> <br /> his love place quite well and got some outlets as he <br /> <br /> has electricity. It can be nicer than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Pauly Shore fans, both, notice. He pushes a security guard <br /> <br /> from his stand through the camera to moan. Yes, stop shame <br /> <br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl, that's where you'll see a grainy <br /> <br /> black and white shot of Pauly's southern coast, though no whey. <Br /> <br /> It's just junk and proving positively that I just want to rent something at the video store at <br /> <br /> to stay in the horror section. This <br /> <br /> movie is not Eric's revenge, it's the filmmaker's revenge for me. <br /> <br /> It's stupid enough to see it. Here's my revenge: I don't <br /> <br /> recommend it. It'll show it! <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for physical violence, gun violence, gore, <br /> <br /> a curse, a female nudity, a short male nudity, and a couple <br /> <br /> sexual content.
