This movie is unworthy of the Omen title. It's so bad that it actually damaged the classic nature of the first three. It should never have been done, they had to change the title. <br /> <br /> They don't even play Damien Thorn's NAME right !! And there are no daggers, the main element of all the Omen films. Pull it out of the shelves and burn it.
