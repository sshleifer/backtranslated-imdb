Some people think it was the worst movie they ever saw, and I understand where they came from, but I really saw it worse. <br /> <br /> It is said, the movies I can remember (that is, those I didn't block) that was worse than that, were so bad that they were physically tormented for every sentence involved watching the movie. The movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to stretch your eyes or hide sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from another piece of your soul that is torn away by your horror. <Br /> <br /> War Games: The Dead Code is not that bad, but it comes pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but no I didn't expect miracles from this one. Let's look at the original was not really that nice of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a champion 80-year-old romance movie with some geek appeal. <br /> <br /> This is all I hoped for, something bad, but it can go to my geek strings. Was it too much to ask? Isn't it really possible to do better than the original War Games, even for a straight to video release? It was clear that it was too much to ask. Stay away from this movie. At first it's just bad, like "Oh yes, it's bad, but I enjoy it, maybe the end will be good as in the original." And then it just gets worse and worse, and in the end, trust me, you will wish you didn't see this movie.
