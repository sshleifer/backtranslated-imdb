Guys who even think to watch this movie have had some disturbance from their heads. This movie has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper, because you think it's his other B, I mean a lot of E-Grade movie. of horny teens in certain sex scenes are watched just before they splash their spleen on a nearby tree. It is not scary, funny or amusing. If you really feel a bit like a stingy little thing, look at Cabin Fever, at least the director didn't fall asleep halfway through this crap. Just look at it if you have nothing in life and the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey crying on the TV set.
