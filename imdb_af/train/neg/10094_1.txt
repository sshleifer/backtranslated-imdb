My little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We saw just about ALL, especially zombie flicks. Now, we've seen very good zombie movies, and very bad people. This RELATED is the WORST movie I've ever seen in my life. Not only was the play terrible, but the special effects, graphic and ever "zombie" make-up were the worst I saw. If you can even call the make-up (black eye shadow), it's absolutely certain that you should never judge a book. Because the cover of the movie is the only favorite thing. do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so indulgent about this movie. I went so far to give a sticker inside the movie before I returned it to the movie that said, "This movie sucks, don't waste your time, come back now. Hahahhaa, I don't want to not someone else to waste a good movie weekend on this POS movie! I don't even know how it has the ratings it did, t should be negative
