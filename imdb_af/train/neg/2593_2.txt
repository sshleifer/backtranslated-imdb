American Pie: Beta House is kind of a limbo between genres. On the one hand, it is a plot without plot and little really clever jokes. On the other hand, it's porn that is a bit too soft to actually turn on any viewers. In essence, Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, others have just made efforts to humor - with a few thin plots in an effort to make them coherent. The characters are barely even two-dimensional. Most of the development is based on knowledge of Naked Mile, and the "important" plottonele are so far apart that you wonder why the authors even felt the need for a story. <br /> <br /> In all fairness I didn't go into this movie without expectations. I liked the original three American Pie movies, and thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rents. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released into theaters, and when I saw some of the same characters returning to Beta House, I was excited to see this installment. I was aware that there would be many scenes of disruption and sexual humiliation in various forms. And it was good because in the past these scenes were backed up by the story and it was well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it is almost as if the authors have forgotten why the formula worked in other AP movies. They spent too much energy in the nudity they forgot to actually write a story. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one-dollar rental. The jokes are lame, the story doesn't exist, and the porno aspect is too tame if it's all you really care about.
