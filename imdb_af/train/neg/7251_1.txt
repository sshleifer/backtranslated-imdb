Great Westerns I hear you all say! Brilliant first attempt! Well, I'm not sure which movie you all watched, but it had to be another one than the one I saw. Great Western or indeed good movies of any genre have characters with which you can believe and this movie has nothing! The acting was weak to say the least and I couldn't give any of any characters, and made the whole movie meaningless. the story was too big for the makers and maybe they should try their hand at making straight to TV low budget rubbish, as you can see on the "FACT OF FICTION" programs on sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Please look elsewhere if you're looking for a good movie, a great western or even just a pleasant half hour.
