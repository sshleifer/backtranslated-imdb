Hey HULU.com plays the Elvira late-night horror show on their website and this movie is under the name Monsteroid, nice to see Elvira on this Crappy movie ... Fun with bad movies. Anyway, this movie really has very little value than seeing how bad the 70s were for horror flicks Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just bad movie making. Avoid it unless you want to laugh at it. While at HULU check out the other movies they are now there are 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch many of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection.
