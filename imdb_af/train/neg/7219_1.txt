I still find it hard to understand that a movie can be made as bad as it is in Hollywood. The acting and story are simply pathetic and the direction is terrible. I don't see a logic behind this trash, except that the director did nothing good. I took ten minutes to realize that I had wasted my precious thirty rupees. It filled me with dismay that I was going to waste a little more time on my life on this shit. I'm sure the movie was made in less than a day. I do not know which category it falls into. Please, avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, knock your head against walls, but don't go for this movie.
