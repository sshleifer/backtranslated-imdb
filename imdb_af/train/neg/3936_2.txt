Wow. I thought it might be unsatisfactory, but it was even worse than I thought! Sometimes I like to see a good "car accident" movie: those who are so bad you can't look away because you want to see how bad they can get. It's really the only reason I could leave the television unmanned fascination. It wasn't so much the play, which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect, but the foreground and the plot that should never have seen the day. The writing is also green-inducing. Regarding the movies, anyone else realized that they had used a "curtain drawing" sighting device, such as in an old 50's TV show ... but without irony? At first I thought they should be sheep, but the movie took itself too seriously to use it on a tongue-in-the-cheek. Don't even ask me about the score ... the only high point is the final song, by Morcheeba. I think they wanted to leave people with something for their $ 8 ... glad I saw it on TV !!!!! Not stupid! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton is struggling to find a lot of work recently? I think if you don't expect much, and want to watch a sensible thriller, it would be better than spending an evening rocking your toenails and therefore deserving a 2.
