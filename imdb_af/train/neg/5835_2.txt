Ag WINTER KILLS, based on the novel by Richard Condon, which deals with a conspiracy murdered by the United States president 20 years ago. I knew that Condon also wrote the MANSE CANDIDATE that had a similar theme and was looking forward to an intelligent thriller. <br /> <br /> WINTER KILLS left me cold. It's not a thrill - it's a piece of worthless crazy, possibly the worst movie I've seen this month and boy I saw very bad movies in June. The problem lies in both the direction and the writing and since William Richert was responsible for both, he must be completely guilty of this unfulfilled farce. <br /> <br /> There are two things wrong with this movie. First, the way everything is presented in the best way possible. It's not like OTT like such a James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but everything has a big advantage. It might have been justified if there was entertainment value for the movie, but there is nothing. As a satire it is very stupid, so stupid that it almost becomes unshakable. Second, it looks as if the screens are cut so that they are rendered senseless. Take, for example, a scene where the hero confronts a nice military leader, Dawson. Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds, then cut it to the hero to be on board an aircraft. The screens start and end with no drive or reason. <br /> <br /> A terrifying film that is a trial to go through
