Two films are useful for scaring people to God, this and 'Event Horizon'. One has a significant and gripping message, the other one can get one-dimensional like a religious movie. Too bad, Paul Anderson went on with the cursed Resident Evil movies. He really did something. <br /> <br /> Thief in the night is obstructed by many obvious independent film features (acting, storytelling, dialogue and persuasion) and it is clear what the intentions of the film are from the beginning. The Christian movie industry did not learn from the failures of this, so we are stuck with the Omega code behind, and the other Tribulation movies. Their underlying element is that they are so concerned about selling their message: "Get saved, people!" that everything else becomes second to beating the audience with a Bible. <br /> Overall, I can't believe I even write so much about a movie that is ineffective. Turn it over completely and go back to Sam Neil, who dries his eyeball. 1 out of 5.
