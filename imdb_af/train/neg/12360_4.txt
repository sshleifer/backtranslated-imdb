Why would a person go back to someone who kicks them in the teeth, not once, twice, but over and over. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us to find love, we must accept abuse (not just forgive but fully accept it). Wow! No wonder my first relationship lasted just ten years. Of course I didn't embrace my inner masochis. <br /> <br /> As Bucatinsky's writing bolt, there are many wonderful aspects of this movie; To justify the reunification of Eli and Tom, however, more character development would be helpful. We are never familiar with Eli's masochism. We are led to believe he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very clear.
