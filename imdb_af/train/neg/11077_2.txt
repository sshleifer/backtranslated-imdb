The only reason I chose to give this movie was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is that it was the biggest waste of a good actor ever set to film. As far as I could tell, Borgnine was the only actor in it. The other performances were so uniformly horrible, I am surprised that a studio would actually pay the performers. Link this level of talent into the acting department with a story so puzzled and insipid that I thought my eyes were bleeding by the time the credits rolled, and you had a perfect movie cat. Clearly, the film was made to address a children's audience, and it was better than most original programs on the Disney Channel and similar kids-focused networks. But honestly it doesn't say much.
