This movie was crazy about a capital "C." The opening scene showed promise. But the "promise" is broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot goes. <br /> <br /> And the woody image, Morty, which was rather creepy in the original movie, simply looks goofy in this one. It was so obviously just a man in a cheap plastic costume. (And by the way, who else thinks "Morty" is one of the most indifferent names on planet earth? It is quite there with "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to horror value. Or why not just the name the wood law Henry-freakin'-Kissinger. "Run, this is Dr Kissinger!" It will be as scary as "Morty." <br /> <br /> And then there is a scene where the "hero" hits his dad You can guess the tombstone with a "sledge hammer?" - a two-and-four-one can venture in. No, he makes his father's tombstone with a bill with a bill. characters leave, tombstone inexplicably and inexplicably oh brother! <br /> <br /> There is also a native American man living with the main characters' grandparents, but apparently nothing except Morty interview. - legends, warn those who mock and even fix Morty's arm when damaged during a childish prank, but for all his respect and tenderness to Morty Morty gives t's hairy behind? No. <br /> <br /> The movie is up, and eventually people die in ways that match their worst fears (kind). This movie is a real yawner. Don't rent it.
