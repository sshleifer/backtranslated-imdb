I can't believe so much comparing this movie to Argento's. His work is far more imaginative and fierce - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply does not have the ability to build true tension. The murder scenes - and let's face it, that's what this genre is about - isn't interesting. It wasn't hard to guess who the murderer was, and I really didn't care when it was revealed. The cinematography is not unforgettable, and the beloved Gothic atmosphere of the 19th century has just not moved me. Several of the actors are pretty good (especially the lead singer and the sadistic girl who thinks about the younger students), but there is very little to do. Yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but unbelievably they add very little spice or tension. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
