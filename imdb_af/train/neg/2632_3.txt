It makes me sad to see a movie featuring many of my favorite actors, venues and genres, ie Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and political thriller, but 'The Sentinel' really gets low. It was as if they had a good idea, had the right role and had some big city shots and then took a holiday to improvise the rest of the team. And I wish I could still blame it on a mere show by Basinger (I don't just feel she is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I steamed more than a decade later that she was the only one, and definitely that just bad actor in the movie, to win an acting Oscar for LA Confidential. But she wasn't the only problem. Sutherland, whom I love as Jack Bauer on '24 'is playing Jack again. I miss his old 'A Time to Kill' or some good man days. Douglas has definitely given a boost to act and call it. Plot: Someone, a certain secret betrayer, wants the president to die and Douglas is (randomly) introduced. Will anyone believe him? Actually, no spoiler here: as soon as they get halfway through that subplot, it's over before you know it. And why did anyone (s) die the president? Has it been revealed in the future? Too many plot holes, too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable 'The Sentinel'. If you only see one movie per year, you may not know who the mole is, but someone who is familiar with these types of movies or has just seen one "Law & Order" episode that you will get in the first few frames know. Was it terrible? Not really, the movies were good and in spite of Sutherland what Jack is playing again, he still has it.
