I read the novel Jane Eyre for the first time in 1986. It was then that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and much like the book. Years later I laid this version and was shocked. William Hurt is completely disgusted as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character, where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. It's a story of love and passion, but I couldn't see it in this version. No, back to the BBC version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.
