I loved the original Scary Movie *. I'm a big fan of parody - it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes considered the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys grabbed the concept perfectly in the original movie, and it temporarily forgot when they made the sequel. I think the Wayans are a family of comic geniuses. Oh, even geniuses make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with promise. I like the "Exorcist" parody, especially the "come out, ma" gag. Now, this is Wayans quality material. But otherwise I can only think of two other times: 1) When Tori Spelling is seduced by a spirit in the middle of the night, he becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he says, "It was just a foreign call!" It was a little funny. 2) The "Save The Last Dance" parody where the Cindy character accidentally dropped a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the short-lived giggles aren't a side-splitting game for the first Scary Movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap exchange gags. Jokes from the first movie, subtle or implied, are enlarged and exaggerated. For example, in Scary Movie I several are made innocently to imply that the character is Ray gay. It was hilarious. But, in Scary Movie II, the entire penis strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was sensible and incredibly unfriendly. This is the pattern of the whole movie. Shock humor * alone * does not take a movie very far. Unfortunately, this was a trend in 2000 and 2001. <br /> As much as my pain to downgrade a Wayans movie, I have to give this one out of 10.
