It's not so much that SPONTANEOUS IMPROVEMENT has little potential. Indeed, the under-researched title phenomenon is quite interesting and for at least the first half, this Tobe Hooper promises to entertain only in a way. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's weather and weather show and the excessively complicated plot, this thriller will lose its way. <br /> <br /> Dourif, who appeared here before piling up his built-in horror fan base, is the average old Sam. Of course, average parents do not stay long in horror movies, so after a well-written sketch of origin, we begin to see Sam's different body parts start to light. Soon he also touched other people on the dismay of gall pal Lisa, unusually played by Cynthia Bain. <br /> <br /> While the title of the movie implies a fire-free monster on release, Hooper decided to make Sam an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film an extra human depth that would otherwise be lacking, but it also prevents us from really fearing the human flame worker. We wonder if it would have been better than a sincere villain versus all-attempt all NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. <br /> <br /> SPONTANEOUS IMPROVEMENT is a beautiful nominal effort when everything is said and done. It will be initial appeal for Dourif's fans and those who can't get enough of 1990's horror, be good, bad or in between, but only on a slow night.
