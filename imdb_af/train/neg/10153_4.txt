SLASHERS (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Not really a very good movie ... but I thought about it ... and the filmmakers made it look good considering the small budget what they have. had to work. The movie is apparently an episode of a lively Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a closed "danger zone" and has three costumes sent to them to kill them. The survivor, if there is one, wins fame and happiness ... everyone else just gets killed. The main drawback to this movie is that the play is pretty bad. None of the "real" people really look. The actors playing the killers are a bit of fun ... because they portray stockings and top caricatures of popular modern horror movies ... and that's exactly how it would be done if it were a real show. The movie suggests that everything is done at once. There is one cameraman who follows the participants around the "danger zone" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights keep flashing on and off constantly (hiding the "slices" from one to another, I'd suggest myself.
