The orange tone of everything was just yucky. Oh yeah, the main character lives in a ghetto that is all orange toned with orange-toned people. Meanwhile, in order to escape spiritually from this terrible poverty of the body, she plays a full-immersion video game (which is struggling with no rules and no logic at stake). She apparently earns an income that plays the game, but she is revealed not to be an employee of the gaming company. Many of the non-speaking breaks later drag the story slowly. She uses a slippery orange computer interface with an operating interface that is so visually annoying and I can only suspect a future Microsoft release. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I ask the viewer why she wastes her precious time. some moronic game when she barely has the necessity of life? Oh yes, playing games are fun, but what is the point when you're almost hungry? As she pushes her life away, playing a fun, even-more-orange-colored, lame-full-immersion video game, runs her dog (probably looking for an owner who at least takes a moment's attention and feeds it regularly) ) or is it stolen from the woman (while ignoring her lousy orange-tinted reality). <br /> <br /> In the meantime, his obsessions about a game have lost her game play team to the whole uninteresting movie. To yawn. So she wants the best of the best, they get Ash Catchem (we all have to bear). Golly, this main character also sucks as a human being and has no detached attributes except her physical beauty (which she could somehow exchange to wipe her poverty). <br /> <br /> So she reaches the "Real" level and at least it doesn't bother terribly and she is sent to kill a former comedian teammate who lives spiritually in the "Real" level. Finally, the sucky boring, shiny orange-colored movie is no longer a boring choir to watch, but has the potential to say something about the lines: "The main character is trapped in imaginary computer-generated poverty and she is actually into the real world ". Maybe she'll do the murder and live in the real world now? Well, she killed the man and he disappeared into a digital effect. Wow! Thank you idiotic director. You suck, you suck so much, director. <br /> <br /> Here, the director had a chance to loosen himself by burying this lousy lame moronic cruddy movie with a philosophical twist. <br /> <The director could have said, "The real world is there and if you live in it and contribute to making it better, it won't be a rough orange toned poverty country." A clever way to make this suck-tacular movie a painfully slow lesson on basic civil pride (for the 1% of viewers who have found nothing that is actually entertaining at this stage, or is movie masochist ). <br /> <br /> No, director. The director had to screw it all up by throwing in a rough digital effect and wasting all chances of salvation for this terribly lousy movie, which was a waste of money, a waste of time and a waste of viewer confidence. <br /> <br /> Then it ends. Good riddance. I hope the director gets drunk about it. I put this HACK on my "avoid at all cost" list for any other films whose name is attached to.
