What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean, first of all, I love Seagal. I love all his movies until the mid-2000s. His early stuff is the best in the genre. However, it is not his excellent name. Attack Force (with starring Marshall Lawson {Seagal)) is expected to be a mindless action game with Seagal in typical one-liner ass kicking form. But what we get is a crime mystery, on the side of a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in the shade because of its weight. I couldn't follow this story. There are people who mutate to superhuman when using a drug. What happened in this movie. The doubling of Seagal is a shame, a shambles and a shame. Why, the man? The story is terrible. It got a 2/10 of me because of the scene where Seagal is asking for backups, despite having an army, and a hilarious battle scene where seagal swings its hands like a girl holding the camera face! "Revenge is a two-way street" seagal says in this movie ... revenge forgives Steven, you need salvation!
