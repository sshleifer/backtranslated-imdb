This movie starts with some kind of original idea, but later became a big frustration. What is the deal to start originally if the rest of the movie has done little to avoid a clich√© plot? The movie itself is very incredible. I want to know how exactly someone enters a clinic, gets a nurse outfit, kills a doctor, takes a patient in her bed, puts in his Chevy bakkie and leaves? I don't think anyone can answer this question, so they just jumped to the other scene and hid these little details. The performances are just bad. The villain is just another "annoying crazy antagonist", no deep, completely linear character. After 20 minutes of the movie, most scenes were incredible, they seemed just out there for the sake of the 90 minutes because they were completely unnecessary. A doctor clearly sees a woman under strong medication, is refused to examine her, kicked out of the house and remains silent. The final scene made me erupt, just Mickey Mouse can make it more out of reality. I give it 2 out of 10 because the first time says 10 minutes movie.
