On the way back in 1967, a certain director had no idea of ​​a galaxy, far or near. He tried to complete a movie titled THX etc. This short is a remanufactured history of a certain George. I'm sorry it's just sweet to defend it. It's just an ad promo for the director, actors, et. al. This has little intrinsic artistic value. This is a brochure. The starring of George is very good, just like the Leia character, and the ersatz Darth character. All others are ordinary commercial dross. What a waste. Yet it did the job, I think. The rest of the movie is just going to kill water that I think. only a brochure.
