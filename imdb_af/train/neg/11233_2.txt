As far as I can tell you, despite previous comments posted by other commentators, this movie is currently available on DVD. I did it just a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's on the value DVD label and I paid the total of 98 cents plus tax. I found it at a store of 98 cents under shelves of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Now you don't have people who have signed out beau coup bucks for the super-duper Swedish import limited edition version like you did ??? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This movie was worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I might start arguing with you. But clearly the value of 98 cents. And remember the saying about what you pay. For slasher movie mavens only.
