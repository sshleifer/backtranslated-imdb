(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about heroic women in German Nazi time. But it is too long, it doesn't touch and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichés and not enough good acting. <br /> <br /> The storytelling (storyline) is bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic, an old woman remembers the events of her life. Well, now we have a point of view. Then another woman was introduced who did the same. Confusion is that they both remind others of the lives of other people! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of the basic storytelling. For example, how can Riemann know about the fate of the girl's mother and her questioning? <br /> <br /> The scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, the scene when Riemann suggests Fabian. When did it happen? The scene looks like it was set up in the Twenties. <br /> <br /> Of course, Riemann's character is a talented pianist, well, she's even a Baroness! Wow. Her brother returns from the Eastern Front, he received a "Ritterkreuz" which he shows in some scenes. He is therefore a war hero and still a good man who has kept his conscience. And he learned about massacres committed by the Germans. He even made photos! And so it goes, cliché after cliché accumulates and that's why the movie doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Basically, von Trotta made a chick flick of something that could be a decent movie. And in the end it's very simple. Riemann finds a way to get Goebbels in bed and - take it! - Everyone is free. What is not a historical fact, but pure imagination, despite the actual story claim at the beginning. Like "Sass" it is vaguely based on a true event. <br /> <br /> It's sad but true, it's this typical German movie. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
