The Underground Comedy movie may be one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I had to know it would be bad if the box wrote the phrase "guaranteed to insult". This means that the filmmakers will concentrate more on enlarging you than making you laugh. <br /> <br /> This movie is an amateur jumble of childish sketches, bad characters, and worse jokes ... from the pathetic Bat-Man sketch to the painfully-petty Arnold Shvollen pecker skit, they're just not not funny. The few sketches that are a bit funny are few and far between - look at Micheal Clark Duncan, for example, a gay virgin, but even they go too long and are devastated by Vince Offer's clumsiness in comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep the Underground Comedy Movie underground ... bury it!
