It happened to Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened to The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it has happened to another classic from the 80's Wargames ... :( Why, oh why, oh, why would Hollywood never don't let them alone ... They can't be made again! They suck .... We all hate them ....! <br /> <br /> Those of you who didn't see the original not 1983 version with Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy, rent / buy it now .... The hardware may look dated, the special effects are not the new millennium, but it still beats these rubbish hands. <br /> < br /> For those of us who lived in the 80s when hacking was sexy, the internet was somewhat mysterious and your disks came as an 8 "floppy variety. Well, we now have the wisdom to make this movie a termonuclear avoid war! <br /> <br /> Never before has a "nice game of chess" seemed to be the better option.
