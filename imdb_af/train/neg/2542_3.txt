... not all Disney movies are garbage. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" and absolutely loved the movie. When I heard it had 2 persecutors, I was ecstatic. I finally got a copy of this and watched it one night. I don't see how they can make a G-rated successor of a horror movie. The original is a film / documentary about the Fauke Monster, and can scare anyone. "Return" is for children and should not be viewed by anyone. I don't remember the plot too well because it was quite a while since I watched it and I won't see it again, but ... It's about these hunters going to the village and they are going to kill Bigfoot. Three little children cut out of the house to stop them. A great monsoon comes through. The hunters are hurt, saved by the children. Then they all jump into a boat with a big sail on top and try to wait out the storm. Then suddenly Bigfoot comes and does something really sick. I don't want to ruin any of yas, but it's not scary. Well ....
