It was a better than average movie I thought, because it was on the cable. I expected something in the line of cheesy melodrama and the bad special effects in such classics as Christmas Rush or First Daughter / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> <br /> seen. The cast was well chosen ... I especially liked Ron Livingston as the heavily hit SWAT Commander. It is good to see him reviewing the same material he was so lucky in Band of Brothers. The manufacturers and designers did their homework because all the screens and shots look like they did on that day back in 1997. <br /> <br /> So, if you get a chance to watch this movie, and I'm sure you'll have been recovering 50 times since FX ... take 2 hours and enjoy it.
