Feb. This movie started out in an interesting way, but quickly ran into the confusion of the menu. The confusing parts mostly occurred at the beginning, where the cutting scenes are so much that it's hard to tell just what's going on for the first twenty minutes or so. The dim comes later, with a low romance between the two living people (both pus). The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most vibrant person in the film, who is sad. If the rest of the cast was at her caliber, the movie might have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the storyline has become very interesting for a while, because it looks as if the mad priestess mother of the dead sixteen-year-old girl is trying to raise her daughter from the dead, with the definite unfortunate side effect that all the other dead return , take on a solid human form, and probably start killing everyone. A kind of Japanese mystical Night of the Living Dead type thing. But it does not occur. Although this hairy, unwashed priest tied his head to a small basket, the uninteresting young people tell that it will happen if the priestess completes her ritual, she does just that and the only dead person revealing her daughter is. No mass emergence of the dead, no running army of bodies, nothing. The priest just returns the girl's spirit to the land of the dead, takes the crop of a boyfriend with her, because she has crushed his spine like peanut butter (at that time I was tempted to brave aloud, since This idiot has gone to kiss and love the dead girl, "ewwww !!!). The Robitans suck, spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the town for the last time, and that No real horror, no real creepiness, which the Japanese tend to do much better than American filmmakers, with their emphasis on exaggerated casey facials, no shouting mimic, and I was very disappointed.
