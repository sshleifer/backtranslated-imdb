Darkman 3: The Darkman It is directed by Bradford May, the same man who made the first Darkman successor. Darkman 3 is worse than Darkman 2, and in my opinion nothing special. Larry Drake is no more than a big villain, now played by great Jeff Fahey, whose character wants Darkman's work again and this time creates some strong people to get the leadership of the whole city. The movie is about the same in plot and performance as Darkman 2, but I was mostly irritated by the presence of many scenes from Darkman 2. These sequels were made in short time and with little money, so these kind of decisions had to be made. Few screens are pretty attractive and exciting, but it's quite a tired film and often also annoyingly silly. The characters scream and laugh too much and it is very annoying. There is no philosophical depth in the movie, and it's like a remake of Darkman 2 that still can't level it. Darkman 2 had great scenes and stylish camera work, and Larry Drake's ability to play big villain. Darkman 3 offers just some nice scenes and moments, but mostly this movie is tired and full of cliches. The few positive things in this movie are flashback modifications (Westlake's nightmares) and some really surprising plot turns and tricks. And worth mentioning, is also a nice nasty image of the main villain who was a pretty comic book like and inventive without any gore. Much more important than the death of the main cork in Part Two. <br /> <br /> Darkman 3 is the worst in the entire series, and we must remember that these two successors were made directly on video and not near Raimi's original Darkman with Liam Neeson. Darkman 2 was okay with very big scenes and tensions, but this last (?) Entry is tired and often silly and boring. It has some merit as mentioned, but overall feeling is that it should not be made in the first place. May is talented director so hopefully he can get even more notable projects in the future. <br /> <br /> 3/10
