Gwoemul (The Host) - Due to pollution in the Han River, a mutated animal goes to the disaster. The youngest member of the Park family is hit by the animal, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her before becoming the last animal of the animal. <br /> <br /> First of all, I like monster movies: mutated carriers, excessive alligators, bundles of ravaging Komodo dragons, the whole lot. Creation features are my favorite type of Horror movie. So, I really wanted The Host, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> There were three major issues with this: <br /> <br /> The first can be seen with a quick look at the IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> Too many damn genres. It took him too seriously to be a comedy, and yet it was too light to have a real message (although apparently trying to make some kind of statement. Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government) . The drama is misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after the initial monster attack, nothing happens for almost the entire movie. The central family is wandering about looking for one of their own, while the governments of Korea and America seem to be doing nothing. And that's it, they just wander over, and sometimes they hit each other, presumably for some comedy relief. This lack of action has distracted my attention, and it apparently did the same for the director, as whole plot tricks become unresolved (a mystery species invented by evil Americans is completely forgotten and never resolved). <br /> And finally, the movie is clumsy politics. It increases the Americans as stupid and angry, but does not give us more American characters with more depth than a cartoon abuse. The opening scene has the obvious stupid American vs wise Korean moment. With a Korean victim assistant, she asks boss, the shoulder, not to throw chemicals into the Han River. The American sheds everything, but maniacally, as he advises the assistant to continue. Apart from being racist, it's lazy movie making and there's no excuse for it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the monster is good, a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are pretty cool, and the initial monster hunting by the park is fun. There are also some good shots in the movie. Some of these remind me strangely of the way Firefly was filmed (cameras shooting, out of focus shots, etc.). There is also a beautiful scene at the end where the hero and a little boy he saved resided in the family. mobile food stall. It's night and snow falling, the street lamp gives a cold light, but the food stall has a hot glow coming from it. <br /> Overall, I was really disappointed with this movie. I was looking for a decent headache, and instead I get some pseudo-political, horror comedy. Looking at the comments on IMDb, I can't help but think that if it was a US production, it would be eliminated. Just because it's a strange movie doesn't mean it's good. There have been some good movies from Korea over the past year (the revenge trilogy and brotherhood, for example), but it is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> For once I am in favor of a remake. Encourage directing, improving the dissertation and it could have been a nice movie. As it is, it's not a couple of hours.
