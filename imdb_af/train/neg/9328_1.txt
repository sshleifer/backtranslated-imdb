Lucky me! I had a sneak peek at this pathetic little shoot-in-Texas 'horror' flick of Artisan Entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and I told you ... I rarely laughed so hard in my life as what I watched this horrible megabomb fly off the railings and steal the title of 'worst-ever killer clown movie ever made' from the insatiable stupid Full Moon fiasco KILLJOY (I'm sure many of our horror fans suffered !) From all indications it is shot at DV, and it doesn't really look that bad for digital, but boy ever succeeds in failing in any other area where it counts! <br /> <br /> The story (slightly CEO (Ken Hebert, who also accompanied the director) takes skeptical co-worker Tracy (Amanda Watson) and a very married couple Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) on a weekend outing to a (cape) secluded cabin "12 miles" from the nearest town, heading for a bitchy butcher (Melissa Bale) in a bar and ending at their destination, where a narrative tale of a murderous clone bumping the same wooded area, becomes apparent when each of the profanity-yackin, pot-smokin? friends disappears one-on-one, with only mutilated pop-parts left behind to tell the story of their destiny. <br /> <br /> The killer-fool is not even appearing in the movie until near the end and it doesn't look like the demonic depiction of it on the video box (except that it is morbidly obese) It actually spends an hour walking around in the woods, chopping wood and nurseries too m. I can't say enough bad things about the movie, especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick, who either deliver their incessant dialogue with minimal enthusiasm or excessive on the most inappropriate times. Doesn't really help the scripture to be completely and completely without tension, originality, intelligence, common sense, or humor. I can go on for days on how inconsiderate this movie is, how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is, but I'll just nod off by pointing out that the whole package is an uproar in the Boy-This-Struggle. a little. <br /> <br /> Also note that the movie released here in the US as SICK (SERIAL INSANE CLOWN KILLER). It is currently cataloged under the original title of GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
