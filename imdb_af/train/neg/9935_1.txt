It totally reminds me of why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a good example of his dissatisfaction as a filmmaker and an "intellectual" policeman. It's hard to admit that Godard actually believed that Marxist and Maoist side. Anyone with half a brain can work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they have destroyed, even as Godard made his films to support them. As a movie maker, ask yourself: would you hear boring political judges at you, and then, if you couldn't think of anything else, download another voice-over to the first voice-over that made the listeners first Lost 100 words anyway? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! What Godard insists on making a movie with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; would you not? It was the only guarantee that such mindless rubbish was seen in the first place: the genius of the Stones who obscured a talented and babbling political idiot released a camera. The bookshop scene was not worthy of even the worst front theater, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children used to playing - as it could easily be seen. By arguing by friendly critics claiming that all this artificial crap was a satire on mainstream filmmaking, it is just a safe outcome to provide those who clearly see Godard's poverty of mind and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic that Godard's one-time good friend Truffaut, along with Nuit Americain, made the best film about making movies ever, and Godard made the best with Le Mepris! By the way, Godard did not choose the Stones' path of sympathy with the devil. It was just the track they were working on when shooting the movie at Barnes Olympic Studios.
