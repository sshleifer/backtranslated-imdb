This is indeed the strange film. Firstly, we have an old gymnast who tries to turn actor (or something) and it seems the only role he ever had (which I know anyway) for good reason. While pulling the roll well enough to hold interest, it is a fairly bare and flat display. Secondly, we NEVER use the WORST sound effects ever in a movie! I'm not joking. It alone makes the movie extremely comical, but in that annoying way. hehe And third, while we have a generally decent acting supporting role (including the required hot chick!), a really non-so-bad story, and some cool figurines; The dialogue, fight scenes related to gymnastics (hilarious!), and the overall performance of the plot is poor. This movie would hardly have been better than a network TV movie (too bad Fox wasn't in 1985). It's one of those movies that's just bad, but you can't resist watching, and even enjoy it as you get used to it, especially now that it's the perfect everlasting home on TV and cable last night.
