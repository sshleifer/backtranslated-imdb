Since I am not a blood and brave fan, I found the rogue totally unnecessary (you play it) and too real to my liking, if you are the kind of person who puts their stones on internet decapitations or snuff movies say it goes, beggars believe what kind of person this sick dream, however, dreams. <br /> <br /> In addition, it had the potential to be a good movie, the music was also top class (by the movie and especially the end credits). However, some parts were a bit incredible, as you have just been found by your girlfriend's confidence to wait torture and death and all that you do is tell her what happened and how you got there (why did he didn't ask her if she had any wipes or even an air accelerator or a piece of gum while he was there?), come on, most will probably just scream. "Skim and leave me and let the f *** come from here. Quick!" where were the flies, virgins etc, and when the girl accidentally came over the place, the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded some alarm bells! I would only recommend this movie to friends of Dennis Niellson and the like. I'm sure a video like these would make sick, have a very happy Christmas.
