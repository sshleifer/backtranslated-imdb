To smell this film apart is to shoot fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I'm impressed with the special effects. It really seemed as if Marlon Wayans's head was attached to the body of a small person. I never doubted it for a moment. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I loved the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer and his versions of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were invaluable. John Witherspoon, who happened to have played Grier's father in 1992's Boomerang (if he remembers, he "compiled" the mushroom ring with the mushroom jacket) plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So it was nice. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is about as credible as White Chicks. How stupid is it even when the doctor can't tell it's a 40-year-old man and not a baby? He has a full set of teeth !!! How is it possible that no one seems to be a baby? Little Man is so bad that there is a Rob Schneider cameo. And if you're dumb enough to waste $ 8 on this movie, at least make me a favor and don't bring your kids. This movie is too sexual for small children (lots of jokes and innuendo about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt ashamed of the parents who brought their children to the show I had to be forced to endure . If you insist on seeing an idiotic movie, your kids save the pain and suffering.
