Wowwww, about an hour ago I finally watched this horrible movie !!! I wanted to switch it off within the first 10 minutes, but I thought I'd give it a chance because it just had to be better. Or at least some redeeming features, as I thought at the very least, it would make you think type of movie, or as very intelligent, or very well filmed or something ... Needless to say, it wasn't not the case and I'm wasting over half an hour of my life. I'm not even going to wonder why it's terrible because it's a waste of time to explain that it may contain "spoilers" ... IMDb, you need to rest on the decay and pay more attention to make sure that the people who rate the movies and comments are not paid to write good reviews or somehow in the movie or anything else. I thought it would be humorous after this horrible movie to see how bad the rating would be and I was very shocked to see the fairly high ratings. All ratings with about 7-10 stars should be clear about some completely different movie ... I'm still a big IMDb fan, but reconsider this rating process seriously, because this movie should not be higher than mowing as a 3 no.
