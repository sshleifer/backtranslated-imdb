I'm sure people at the Texas / Louisiana border had a good laugh or two when Paramount's B imagery publicly charged this one at war. Just the area along the Sabine River where the film opens, is cotton land, just like the rest of the deepest south or at least the deepest south, after the civil war. No big cattle are driving there, they are much further west in Texas, beyond Richard Dix and Preston Foster to set up their empire. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the two partners in a river boat. And when Leo Carrillo tries to steal their services by not paying for his cattle, they keep the cattle. And this is the beginning of the great Ponderosa like the farm they start. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Foster married Dix's sister who played Frances Gifford and played with his much smaller neighbors. They also went a little further with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> Anyway, our oriental people like westerners don't usually bother with geographic colors and it's still a good western of the production mill of Harry Sherman who all made. those Hopalong Cassidy westerns for Paramount. The climax is a burning, and I mean literally, rifle battle that might have been used on an A production. <br /> <br /> But I wouldn't, but Western fans look at it.
