This movie has many disadvantages and that's all I could see. it is painfully long and terribly targeted. I could see the whole audience getting impatient and waiting to end it. Running time is over 3 hours that could be edited to less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The transition between stories is average. most people admitted that they were seated and expected something better to come out. <br /> <br /> It's just funny in bags. ambitious project and a subordinate execution. Govinda does a fair job, Anil Kapoor disappointed me, resting us as expected. If you expect something close to Babylon or actually love it, it's not that close.
