I chose it at the videoback because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you don't like it, go for yourself!") On the box it looks like a luxury endorsement .... I've expected something little more like "Death Proof" ... not much real violence in this one tho, or plot, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. That's all there. Stunts, and rock. This goes back and forth. A week or so in the life of an LA band showing a crappy magic show on a level you might see in one of the smaller casinos of the Strip, and an Aussie stuntman walking in the city looking ... They work, they meet girls, their party. End of the story. <br /> <br /> Of course, the group needs all those things because they are honest second level and play a style dated back in 1978. It should be said that the stunt bites in the film are really spinning - that Aussie fellow is really something, and the movie is largely motivated by love and respect for "art". I hung it there to see what crazy thing he was going to do. Just wanted him to have found a better vehicle.
