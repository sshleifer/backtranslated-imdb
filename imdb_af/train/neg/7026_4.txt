On his birthday, a little boy tells his mother that he is not her son and that he wants to go home with his real mother. <br /> <br /> In some ways Comedy Die L'Innocence comes out like another time of movies, perhaps the 60's or 70's. Certainly it reminded me of Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), which both deal with loss, grief and relationships between parents and "lost children" (oddly both films star Mia Farrow). <Br /> <br /> All three films are populated with impersonal characters acting in strange and inexplicable ways. All three films have a cold feeling, both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-to-child relationships, and eventually all three films ask, "What is really, what is imagined?" <br /> <br /> Beautiful but flawed, it offers no easy answers and leaves much to be desired, inexplicable and strange.
