It was just awful the plot was just OK, but the rest of the laundry was bad. I mean, come on puppet and then they even tried to make the movie and it made it even worse! Normally I would have liked a low-budget movie, but it was just a waste of time and promptly returned. I have about ten low-budget movies that are like 6-8 movies on them, and I'll have to say it's the worse movie from everyone. The wording is also turned off and they use a false plastic machine that doesn't even look like a real one. They can look like someone who is even a little close to a real one, so save your time and money and don't look at this horrible movie.
