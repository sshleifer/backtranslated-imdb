The original film, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. A lady and the tramp storyline in two senses - rich girl / poor boy, and ability against bloodline. The successor, however, is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original, but also a ridiculous, remaining Disney-diseased rubble that is best summed up as Rambo Meets the Black Stallion. Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero comes back from a 3-year absence, and suddenly he is on the horse. In the original, good movie he was real and credible, but unfortunately in a caricature reduced in the successor. I was hardly disappointed in a movie, and at times this thing made me very angry - they almost missed a clich√©. Brazen hearing manipulation - do studio heads think that everything you have to do with a horse-loving audience is beautiful horses in front of them to make them happy? A mess of a movie.
