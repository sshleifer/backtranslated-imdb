It's a decent quest, but the man who wrote the screenplay seems to be a little in the dark about what makes a zombie movie cool. No, it is not CGI errors and software companies. Actually, I'm not sure if it was a software company - I saw it without captions, so I had to guess what they were talking about. Anyway, my point was - instead of wasting your time making a dumb ass, why not throw in more zombies and more action. 2/3 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins, bugs, some guys shouting about something. And to make matters worse (more boring) most of the deaths occur on the screen. I realize this is too common for non-budget movies, but then there were some impressive effects (which were my kind) that surprised me why the director (or author, whatever) preferred to focus on how the epidemic started - It's a short, no one is going to care.
