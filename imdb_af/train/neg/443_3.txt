Overall a very disappointing picture. Very, very slow, build up to the basic story. The role of Maria Schrader in search of her family's secret past. (Every recording seems to be forever.) There is really no rhythm in the movie. *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth is saved by the Nazis, by a German woman, played by Katja Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is so one-dimensional, so stereotypical. *** SPOILERS END *** The film cuts back and forth between the current day New York and Berlin and Berlin 40s. If you do, please. The audience is an indication of how time exactly the story takes place. There is never a clear indication of time? very irritating. The worst part is the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole show and jabber about the Jews who are so terribly tormented, just by a bureaucratic accident! Give me a chance. So did the Jews come from the Rosen Strasse? The question of who freed the Jews is never answered. What is Goebels who freed them? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice, the film won an acting award for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Should the Jewish Theme Be?
