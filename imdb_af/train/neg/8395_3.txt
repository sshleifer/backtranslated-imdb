- A film crew shoots a horror movie in an old, suspectedly cursed house where seven people have been mysteriously dead over the years. One of the crews finds an old book of play and it seems perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie. It is argued that the play in the book is better written than the writing they use. But as the book is read, the cemetery suddenly comes to life. Now the team and the team are in real danger. <br /> <br /> - IMDb lists a 90 minute run time. Nothing happens for the first 60 of those minutes. Too much time is spent in the movie in a movie. Should we be scared of the horror movie they shoot? We already know their movie is not "really". This scares just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> - There are very few things to enjoy at The House of Seven Corps. The play is horrible. Most of these "actors" will struggle to make a primary school game. The score is terrible. It reminds a lot of a 70-TV series and offers no atmosphere. To speak of atmosphere, except for a few moments at the end of the movie, there is no one to talk about. Character logic is anything but non-existent. Even in a movie, you expect characters to act in a certain way. Here I do not think I remember one scene where a character did not choose the most illogical lane for them. And lastly, there is the first 60 minutes of the movie I've already mentioned. Can you say USE? <br /> <br /> - I didn't evaluate The House of Seven Corpses, due to cases where the movie (probably by accident) really works. My two favorite is the beginning and the end. The opening title series kills seven previous owners and can be the highlight of the movie. And the end tones on the massive staircase as the zombie threatens the movie staff are somewhat effective (which is a ringing endorsement). Overall, these moments are not enough to make it a good movie.
