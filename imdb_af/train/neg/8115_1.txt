This movie was the most horrible movie I've ever experienced, and what's worse is the fact that I had to watch it and didn't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! Admittedly, the storyline was decent ... but I found the play terribly! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only highlight without her, I doubt I could see the movie. Every time I hear somebody say "ditling", I cry! The other day I almost attacked a client because they "said it". It remembered me one of the worst one and a half hours of my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if someone offends it, I just give my opinion)
