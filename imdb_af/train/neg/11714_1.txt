The US seems to be running the British police, all of whom are running around the teeth and knowing that CID officials are changing uniform when they stop working and go to the bar! It must be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of the "real" British police ever carried on the unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr. Snipes might have needed the money to pay his tax bill, but what the good actor like Charles Dance did in it is a mystery. <br /> <br /> Worse than the worse low budget "B" movie of the 50's. One hour and a half of suicide and time I will never return. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the real pest.
