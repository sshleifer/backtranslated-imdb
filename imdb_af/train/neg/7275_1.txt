"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst film ever made, even outdated the whiteless "Plan 9 from outer space". The Lampoon movie arranges in three separate and unlinked vignettes, each with different artists. The only general thread is the total lack of any redeeming properties. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there's one. Another reviewer on this site said the fleeting nude shots are beautiful and he is right. Miss Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets partially, respectively, one and two. But unfortunately, their glamorous exhibits have been wasted. The directors apparently forgot that even T&A needed a credible story to surround it, and no one was in sight. <br /> <br /> The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this movie. Benson plays a beleaguered cup-young policeman, reporting for his first day of service, ready to eradicate the streets of evil. He is linked to an old, cynical cop played by Widmark. And when these oil and water partners came out on their first patrol, we felt a possible release of the film's previous failures. Perhaps, perhaps, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's solid sense of duty and loyalty. Maybe everything will finish smoothly. But this movie goes straight to the toilet, without redemption, no happy ending, no coherent story of any kind. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon goes to the movies," I thought I had seen The worst shock that Hollywood might point out. Unfortunately I didn't see half of it. <br /> <br />
