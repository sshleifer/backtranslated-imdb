Storyline: The 4-year-old movie covers the events in the Kargil sector near the LOC in 1999 when Pakistani infiltrators crossed the LOC and came deep into the Indian territory and Indian retaliation. To know more about the story, I suggest readers read the news about Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: If one looks for a formula story in this movie, you can be sure it is absent. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and many and many bullets and blood. The movie room I saw this movie was full of whistles and chases when the movie Indian Bravery shows. The movie was similar to Public as in an Indian vs Pak cricket match. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie as a tribute to the army's sacrifice and for the characterization of the real war heroes (4 PVC-honored heroes) who sacrificed their lives so that we could see today. The film made a brilliant depiction of the army, having struggled all the chances in rough weather. The film's negative is that it is stretching and the songs are extremely boring.
