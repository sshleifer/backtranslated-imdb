You believe in God or you do not. You believe in Jesus or you do not. You believe that He is the Son of God or you. The choice is yours. <br /> <br /> Director Denys Arcand really did everything he could to bring Jesus back to a mere historical figure, social worker, son of two people, instead of the Son of God, the Holy Spirit and Mary, who opened heaven for us again. To encourage the Great Bang, comes a world of evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film portrays a theologian who brings a "modern finding" to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play, which they love to include in his play. <br /> <br /> The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the Passion Play was performed in Montreal has a sexual relationship with one of the female players of the Passion Play rather than showing his love for God through celibacy . The director's aversion to the church is often visible. <br /> <br /> The director tried to make a parallel between Jesus' life and the life of the Passion Play actor. This is an admirable effort, but the resurrection of the Passion Play actors' organs in other bodies shows how the director of Jesus is thinking. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I do not want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when they stand before Jesus' throne.
