With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> It is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about shipwreck Shecky (Sandler) who wants to be a comedian on the ship. First, there is not one funny or clever line in the whole film honestly. It's so unique that it's pathetic. There is not surprisingly much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is very low, and it also destroys the film. It takes place on a ship, but it looks like they only had money to rent a small boat and only applies to 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are housed fairly and it's just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone who sees it will hate it too. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. rated R for Language.
