The worst and full of people who really need to know better (the role players have six Oscars between them). It is in 'contemporary' Africa (it was made in 1979), and deals with the slave trade. It is frighteningly written and performed (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden achieve a career low in this one), and completely lacking in excitement, no matter what moral focus it is. It's also ridiculously plotted. You don't believe for a moment that any of the characters would act like they do under these circumstances. Richard Fleischer regulates, but you get the impression that it's over the phone. It's as bad as it gets.
