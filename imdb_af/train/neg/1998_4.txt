My roommate has the No, No, Nanette soundtrack as a dub on a band and she continued to listen to it. After it finally ruined me, I found the songs irresistible, especially the well-known one, I want to be happy, but I can't be happy. But from the rough track I had no idea what the movie was over. So I got a copy the other day at the videoback and I rented what was supposed to be a long-lost version of the movie. I thought it would be great, because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I loved were nowhere to be found in the video I saw. Now I have never seen the 1930s musical, but this version was unfortunately disappointing because there was very little song and almost no dance and besides, the sound was really bad and you couldn't really understand what people A lot of the time. Actually, the only highlights of this movie were the scandalous 1940s. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that protrude like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre feather sleeve that she holds on her forearm and then wrapped herself in this mesh. The one dance series is a bit strange also with Nanette who does this strange ballet game with a pink girl image placed on top of her. Actually, another brightest spot in the film was artist Guillespe who dreams of being a good artist, but is currently being condemned for drawing the girls for money. I love how Guillespe likes it old school and it's Nanette when his masterpiece, the piece that made his career, is sold by Nanette for a mere $ 5250. Doesn't she know that piece was his immortality? Dull rabbit / girl with your prehase ears on your hat. When will you learn? Why doesn't he just have a pencil in a cigarette before the advertising men take the job away?
