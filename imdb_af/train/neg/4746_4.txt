There are several things wrong with this movie - Brenda Song's character is one of them. I don't believe the girl is a turbulent actor. I'm not honest. I believe she gets bad lines. She's just supposed to be, "that vain, rich girl", and while it's funny in the TV shows she plays, it can't even be a dry laugh here. <br /> <br /> Or, I really had to know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't that terrible ... initially. Wendy's reaction to Shen was quite natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man claiming to be a reincarnate monk followed you to command you to carry a medal and insist that you needed to fight the great evil and the save world? This brings me to another point. I know this movie is completely fiction, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. All the "warriors" seem to be women in Wendy's family line. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt the monks will be just as good. Sure, maybe they could have worked it out somehow, but they didn't give any explanation. In doing so, they have only contributed to the many cute attempts at female empowerment made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> Remember, but let's continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the movie is underway. Yes, she's a teenager, and it's almost coming home. I mean, who wants to fight evil during homecoming? The problem is, when "evil" manifests itself, Wendy doesn't look as horrible as she should be. She is extremely indifferent, even to someone like her. She didn't care about her training. I'll use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you don't win this battle, the evil will take over and everything that goes well will be." Wendy: "Who's talking about pressure. Well, we're talking about something else." Yes, let's get Wendy. Let's also dance when you have to give lawful training. Of course, Shen leaves her, but his character has an excuse. Better that he works with her than he does, and she doesn't end up at all and gets them both dead. <br /> <br /> Talk about what. Shen also told Wendy that it was his fate that he had to die for her in battle, as he had for her great-grandmother (I take that part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable. <br /> <br /> As the scriptwriter would get it, Wendy's homecoming and this "big battle" are exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy is doing? Do you even guess? Yes, she ends with the fight, because when she tries to go home, the monks, (who caught Shen in the body of her coach and teachers because she fought an old man strangely) Shen fought alone, so she goes to save him. <br /> <br /> Initially we see half a decent fight, which is actually entertaining. Finally, the great evil comes from the body of Wendy's rival, creating the actual embodiment of himself from the pieces of the bodies of his old warriors. <br /> <br /> Don't ask. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy gets everything "panicky." Then Shen goes and defends her from this man. Forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name - and succeed in killing himself. <br /> <br /> Wendy catches Shen as he makes his long descent to uncomfortably high in the air. <br /> <br /> She shouts out the title of that article. <br /> <br /> Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy got powerfully far, too fast. No, I won't excuse it because it was her "fate" and she had the power in her. <br /> <br /> However, when did she learn healing? No, the worst ... since when can she raise people? So Shen was raised from the dead. Then, Wendy and he are fighting the man. <br /> <br /> He is easily lost. The worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time and he is banned forever. Then the monks praise Wendy for her sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: Don't the author and director know a battle needs a little more "finesse"? # 2: What sacrifice? The fact that she didn't come home? Because the girl didn't tear or even bleed a sweat. I mean, come on, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see someone hurt. <br /> <br /> Oh-him ... move on. <br /> <br /> I know it might sound like I should have given the movie a one, based on my comment. Sharing criticism, you need to know, is a thing to break. You are not necessarily looking for the bad, but if it is there, pay attention to it. This movie is very bad, but something funny happens if you never really expect something to be too big in the first place. <br /> <br /> So, I think it was right. Not that I didn't say it wasn't right, no one would refrain from viewing it.
