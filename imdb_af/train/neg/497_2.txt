It's a very silly movie. It can be nice with the cute strangers and the rural environment, but it is just not. <br /> <br /> Some aliens hear the World War War when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill people, but instead of killing, they make people slaves and do them foolishly. The cover of the film shows these strangers driving surfboard drivers in space ... not really what they do. These are not party strangers, they are stupidly animated idiots with annoyingly highly rated modulated voices. The stranger with the most tolerant voice also appears to be the Jack Nicholson ripe alien who always wears his sunglasses. Unlike the strangers, the play is terrible. The script is of course intended for children, because each character is written like a child. <br /> <br /> This is a silly movie, which will only appreciate children, maybe. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 minutes. PG for soft language.
