This movie was almost unbearable to go through. I can pass the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to stretch over weeks, but the characters don't even change outfits, but the play has the 4th wall cut me. I saw better in a 4th-class play. In addition, the plot is unrealistic. If the man suspected the man, he would have turned him on. I was also very disappointed that all the murders were done with a gun, what kind of gore is it. It's not a copycat the Zodiac didn't kill with just a gun. The authorities would have known it wasn't him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4. This is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disease. Overall, I think this movie is not the kind of movie that can be done with a low budget, at least not as low as they had, or they could have made sure they had better actors or more. Many people went the low budget route without using horrible actors. Look at Easy Rider who had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
