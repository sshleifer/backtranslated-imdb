"Horrible People" should be the caption of this horrible movie. If you want to see ordinary people do ordinary things, look out of your window at real life. But if you want unpleasant people to do dull things, you should see this horrible movie by Mike Leigh. The characters speak long, but can never actually communicate with each other. Why not? Presumably because Leigh is what we all are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and he wants the real life movie. But we are not, and he failed.
