This review may include some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The redesign of the classic 1974 pursuit movie Gone in 60 Seconds is starting well. Actually, it's well behaved and the plot moves pretty well. But even a huge Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more credible. For those who do not know, the original plot worked the thieves as insurance inspectors. Who will suspect them. But even with a change to almost every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74 version that made it good. The one in this version is watered down, only 10 minutes, and it culminates in a sample special effect that takes all credibility out of the way. Where the original chase was very credible, the star was a stunt driver who had done his own stunt. The remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car hunt movie, refine the original in the bargain at your local rental and stay away from the new remake.
