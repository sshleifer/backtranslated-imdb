Woman with wig, who paint her hair in the middle of the film, (= barrel of wig) apparently does not see what the audience can see from miles: <br /> <br /> *** starts spoiler warning * * * that her hubby has a relationship with her best friend and they are trying to get rid of her. *** End of spoiler warning *** <br /> <br /> And what a spoiler it was: the title already gives it away or not? Bad acting, bad writing: waste of time Oh yeah, at last she lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, you'll really love "Cannibal women in the Avocado Jungle of Death" ....
