I don't believe they made this movie. Completely unnecessary. The first movie was okay. But there wasn't a sequel needed, certainly not a television series that was already a successor to the first movie. This movie feels like a soap opera. The writing is so bad, it's quite simple. The jokes do not occur, the acting is flat, it is shot like a soap, it has no direction. The first movie had a good emotional backbone behind it. Every character had a little bow. It was very simple, but somehow it worked and I could see the merits of that movie. But this time there is no coherent story line. The characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: the Brazilian boy playing Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well thrown. This was their one moment of creative success on this movie. I hear they have already shot a second television series as a successor to 'Team Spirit 2', but thank God, don't let them make a third function delivery ...
