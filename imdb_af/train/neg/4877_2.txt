Frank Capra's creativity really only had to spend when he made this film. Although it has some beautiful moments, and many wonderful artists, Capra's straight recycle is not just the screenplay, but also considerable footage of his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934). It is understandable that he will re-use visual material from the climax, which is exciting. But he uses overall dialogue scenes with minor actors, then brings those actors back and expects us not to see, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's last appearances, skip one and look at Broadway Bill.
