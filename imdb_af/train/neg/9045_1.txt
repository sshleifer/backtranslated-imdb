This movie started off with a plot of plot, then left for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to stay engaged with this movie. This movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some with animation skills, but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling. It's a shockingly bad effort coming out of a big studio. Clearly, there are moral and moral problems with Disney, and not a complete lack of oversight and quality control. That management allowed this movie to see the light of day, talking volumes about their incompetence and despair. This movie joins my very short "worst movie of all time" list.
