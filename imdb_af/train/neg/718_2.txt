The main reason why people still care about "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O." is that it contains Peter Sellers in a second invoice. But watching this movie to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sellers play Amfibulos, a vague reptile premier of the dirty-poor island nation of Gaillardia, formerly a British colony, now offering many Russian. diggers during the Cold War. Amphibulos wants to play both the UK and Soviet interests against each other for easy profit, "all very friendly and all our cards under the table". Terry-Thomas is the title character, a lazy British diplomat who is anxious to show Gaillardia that Britain has not forgotten them, all the appearances about it. <br /> <br /> A positive review says: "The reason this movie is considered average because the comedy was underestimated." I would argue that the reason "Carlton-Browne" is considered below average is because the comedy does not exist. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening that sets the film's only two strengths, sympathetic Terry-Thomas and John Addison's full-fledged larky score, things are quickly delayed in a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes. The low opinion of Carlton-Browne by his boss and the darkness of Gaillardia (which no one can find on a map) is milked to death. By the time we actually reach the island, expectations are pretty low. After a laborious series of flying jokes, it's still too high. <br /> <br /> However, they are still too high. The island itself, which appears to exist in Latin America or the Mediterranean, is so pathetic that its honorary movement is at the airport and the review stands apart in the middle of a parade. The army is apparently still drawn horses, which is allowed for another lame hearing by a highly accessible announcer: "In the war, the army uses a lot of horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers never take the middle stage, even when we 're on his character's island. Instead, the plot is taken over by Ian Bannen as King Loris, who inherits Gaillardia's throne after his father's murder. Ties are boring and play its role as straight as it is written. Normally, it would make him the likely target for salespeople to work, but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy mustache. Sellers is just a threat to those of us who remember him more happily in two other films made the same year. The mouse that ran out "and" I'm all right, Jack. "Strange that this movie, like Jack, was a Boulting Brothers production, with Roy Boulting here as co-director next to Jeffrey Dell. Usually Boulting movies combine bad social satire with anything-going comedy, but here's just one or some way to make jabs in every direction. Amphibulos works its mutilated English atmosphere for all its value ("This man is like, how do you say, the bull in the Chinese ship"), while Carlton-Browne generally through his Majority attacked as he apparently deserves. <br /> <br /> The worst and most elaborate feature of the film is the young Loris romance with Ilyena, text one point played by surprising Luciana Paluzzi, one for the fact that they are apparently cousins, never addressed. <br /> <br /> The movie is excited with an even scene revolution, whose surprise resolution will not surprise anyone, and a last-minute action by Carlton-Browne which literally suffers the lid on his coffin k. Apparently he is still alive for a day, but the movie of the same name is strictly DOA.
