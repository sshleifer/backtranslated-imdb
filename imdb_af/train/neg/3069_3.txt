Bah! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well-directed story of a man who was already dead and moving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And it had a bare chick on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version looks like something that a producer bought the rights and then dropped out of interest. A group of individuals seem to have deliberately decided to adapt it in the 1990s and change ethnic and gender generations just to be cute. The film is not about a burnout to commit suicide in a last act of resistance. It's about a man trying to go to a hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason why this movie was made different than to make me angry.
