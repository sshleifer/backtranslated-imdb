Strummer's hippie was a revelation, but overall it felt like it was a khaki. Campfire stories work best for the intimacy of a campfire. There were just too many semi-boring old friends anecdotes and too much stuffing stock material. I love The Clash and Joe for the reunification and sale of their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this document fell in love with me for more relationships. The use of campfire tellers without proper explanation of who the anecdotes tell, alienates the viewer to some extent. They had to be interviewed. Even with Strummer's 'radio DJ voice', the film doesn't glue at the same time. And can anyone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes? After the incredible "filth and rage" I hoped the temple could save. A Joe Strummer dock deserves better.
