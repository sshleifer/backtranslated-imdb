When I saw this movie cover, the first thing I thought was that it was made for video. The second thing that happened was how similar it looked to another horrible movie "Darkness Falls", the story of this stupid fool who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was the greatest masterpiece compared to this stack of garbage, and this movie was not to be made. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a small back story for the witch, or, more like a useless launch of two little ones who will meet the dental festival in the hope that they will give them a shiny new bike for them tooth. The opening is badly filmed, and like the rest of the movie, it's definitely not scary. In the present time, the film is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter's is renting his home, and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West), and her daughter Cole stays there. Cole meets a neighborhood kid, and they talk about the Tooth, and how you shouldn't lose your tooth, or she'll come to you. Unfortunately seconds later, the Tooth Festival seems to steal her bike and emit her tooth (How ironic). Will Cole survive the wrath of the Dental Festival, and her mother and Peter will be able to save her and restore their romance ... this is a bad movie, you can probably find out. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this idiotic movie is how undefined the Dental Festival is. They say she'll kill you if you lose your tooth, but not. She is more like a serial killer who kills at random, and if you lose your tooth, you will definitely go. She steals a bike, so apparently she is also a thief. I used to say that the idea for this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the Tooth Fairy look? Let's look. She looked like a burnt offering, and she slept around the area earlier. Hmmm ... it's almost like she's an exact rip-off of Freddy Krueger's "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies. And that's not the worst part of this terrible mess, the climax is. This movie can have the most laughable climax (Not literally laughable, because I found it more sickly than funny) I've ever seen. Don't see it. <br /> <br /> Just a little trivia. Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, and they were both in this, so apparently Scary Movie stars were forced to end their career with bad and terrible movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 80 minutes. R for violence.
