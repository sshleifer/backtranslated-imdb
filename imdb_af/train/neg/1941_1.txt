I can't believe I wasted five hours of my life on this garbage. The previous five-day presentation by this author was very enjoyable and I see it very much. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit because she mumbled or gabbled her lines, but most of the other role-players followed her example. Remarkable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old stewards whose verdict was exemplary. Should producers not listen to productions before they are broadcast to make sure that the dialogue is audible? As a result, I assumed that I had come across some of the things that were going on, and since the original plot line metamorphosed into the standard and us thing between Muslims and the rest, I quickly lost interest. The end was a complete anti-climax. A complete dud.
