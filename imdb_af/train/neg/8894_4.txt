This movie is mysterious, a straight 11/10 on the real scale. The fitness of the accents as well as the density of the jersey spandex pants is just amazing. Yanks, although the right Scotland might be as colorful as you ever go there, don't expect you to get much of a chance to dance out with locals. Also, don't try to silence local opinion by the otherwise fine art of tap dancing. <br /> <br /> There are some infectious song and dance scenes, but the plot is too exaggerated and linear. The dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt whether someone in a temporary Scottish village in the Boondocks, rather than gay New York City, wants to get stuck. Maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for the priest to leave Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of the dump. <br /> <br /> Look at the fine alternative-reality view of what a Christopher Streed Day parade in Scotland will look like on LSD. Other than that, I would only recommend it to Hollywood music success.
