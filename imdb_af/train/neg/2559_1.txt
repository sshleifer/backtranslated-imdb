Well, that might just be the worst movie I've ever seen. They tried this 666-year-old Satan's son to run the anti-Christ-kinda movies about 1000 times, and none of them is good, and that might be the worst of them. They think it's going to be better film, because they use the false blood more. This movie has no idea about it, actors and filming are just awful. Can even make that 10 line minium from this movie. Actually nothing to tell, but it's just awful. How they can make movies in their right mind just can't understand it. It can't be a Hollywood movie, is it? Just don't look, use your money wiser.
