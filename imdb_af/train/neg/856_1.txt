These writings write about the end of the plot, so don't read it if you haven't seen this garbage. <br /> <br /> I found this garbage film in the horror section that made me think it would be an abomination. . If I own a video store, I'll place it in the BORGE department. This movie is so junk, it will make you feel like you've lost your socks. <br /> <br /> This movie contains endless shots of people driving as if it were scary. Well, I drive almost every day at work and back (and sometimes at the shop or to visit my cats) and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some driving. Even the small child does it too. Around and around he goes and he never stops. What is so frightening about driving an hour for a bike? I don't think anything and if you see it, you won't even think so. <br /> <br /> The family in the car comes to a large castle and they get a tour that just walks around to the kitchen. Then the man walks around an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you can see, it's messy.
