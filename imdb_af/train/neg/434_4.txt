Already his first claim, those desires are always artificial, is completely misleading. <br /> <br /> When a Jehovah's Witness rejects, does his own documentary come to movies? or something for that matter - it's time for someone to get their own. Although far, much wiser than, say, Paris Hilton (I don't know too hard), Zizek's mouth injects just as much as her, just another kind. He combines the worst of both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are notorious for providing the expert with a very easy way to create unbiased theories without starting or ending, and banning concepts almost randomly. In the process, the English language is abused by a semantic jumble just to love a mother. For example, there are three main Marx brothers, thus a "good" idea to connect them to three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego, and the super-ego. I'm surprised he didn't play a clip of Snowhite and made an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (Muslim hell). It's like the foreground of Schumacher's "The Number 23": playing long enough with numbers, and you can link any kind of cockamy theories you want, even to Ancient Greeks with Princess Di's death. <br /> <br /> However, there is an entertainment element for TPGTC: looking at a cheeky sweat like a pig, while the exchange of despair schemes masked as intellectual analysis can be a lot of fun. Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other Madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching an amusing train wreck. Of course he is almost funny at one or two occasions. <br /> <br /> I've always been mystified by people who are desperately trying to make film in an elevated intellectual social science. Giving idiotic movies like "Birds" this very thought, hence this lot of credit, probably laughed his thick creator in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and those who have a little intelligence do not need a shrink-worn philosopher to draw a card to understand them ?? unless one is a complete idiot. Zizek sees low and low meaning in the most banal movies. Hallucinogenic drugs nowadays must be quite popular and cheap in Slovenia. <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed the bath hole in the "Psycho" scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain life out of stars just like the bath hole in Janet Leigh's blood sucks. Or perhaps he said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing in it, rather than out (as in menstruation), which represents a kind of "clever (Zizekian) irony. Regarding the true irony, if Hitchcock had so much thought in every scene (and the writing) so many thoughts, his movies would not have been the illogical, far-fetched shit they often have. The point of this badgat analogy was to show how easy it is to improvise on "hidden, deep meanings". And if you add Zizek's fanciful terminology of philosophy and psychology, these terms are put on top of these analogies such as wedding cake decorations, and you get an obstacle that can instantly impress the uneducated ones - ie, the easily impressable and the gullible. <br /> <Zizek speaks out a number of (unintentionally) funny things, one of the most absurd ideas is when he associates Anthony Perkins's cleansing of the carnage with a job well done, from a well done job. be. Don't Laugh ... Neither Hitchcock nor the author of "Psycho" could ever even vaguely entertain this idea that Perkins can enjoy a good job - clearing a blood-stained toilet - while understanding / directing it. Talk about words in the mouth of death, but in the context of misinterpretation the director had to say. <br /> <br /> I love Zizek's initial thoughts on Tarkovsky's tremendous Solaris, but then he has to destroy a bad good impression by dragging in "anti-feminism" and other nonsense into his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog to his plastic leg. "I just want to play all day!" Logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped - at least not in public - by him like him. He seems to consider logic, evidence, common sense and reason as enemies or mere throw away toys; concepts that should be avoided, turned to fit the end goal, or simply destroyed. Zizek is the LSD expansive hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal 2001. <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek is focusing on two of the most overlooked directors - and those whose films are often LACK intelligence , as something - such as Hitchcock and Lynch - only reduces its already low credibility. I was surprised De Palma did not appear prominent anymore; it's another lame director writing inactive scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible "Lost Highway". There are just as many interpretations of the movie as there are people who watched it. <br /> <br /> Zizek's remark that the viewer conveniently made von Trier's ridiculous, "groundbreaking" physical setup in Dogville I snicker. <br /> <br /> But Zizek not only makes things as he goes along, he also gives strong prominence in the "bledin". Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), he turns his very solid "observations" into articulation (if spit) and sometimes complex blankets of language. After all, sociology functions exactly the same: it makes us believe that we hear something new, because that is what we all already know, but in an eloquent way - which makes the more incessant listener foolish. <br /> <br /> I was half-expected for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and tuck him into a lion suit. <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek: soon as a stalker in a child's park near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
