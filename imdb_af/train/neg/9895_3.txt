If this book remained true to the book, we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history. Mark Anthony never died of injuries that were fought in the fight as depicted. He died a coward's death by committing suicide and even then he asked his slave to do it for him. The slave chose to kill himself. Mark Anthony was in the true story ashamed of the slave's great bravery and decided to copy him. But even in death, Mark Anthony was a drunk failure and failed his own suicide attempt. He called out Cleopatra and took her, bleeding. She pulled his rubbish on ropes and Mark Anthony died for a while. If you want history, don't look at this movie. If you want a romantic dream, you will probably enjoy it!
