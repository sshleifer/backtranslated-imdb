I had some high expectations for that, because I love Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. A few years ago I loved the Ang Lee The Hulk, so I thought it would be more of it. First, I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. He looked as if his eyebrows had been formed again. His performance was not convincing. He wasn't as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The Gama thing doesn't really match the original story line I don't think. I think the best part of the movie was the end. It had some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not so long, but sometimes it has become a bit boring. I remember some time ago when Walmart really had this movie for sale cheap and I always wondered why. Now I know. I was hoping to be blown away, but I wasn't.
