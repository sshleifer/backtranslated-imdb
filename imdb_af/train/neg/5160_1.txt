You get a gift. It is beautifully wrapped. The box in which it is made is handmade from the best wood and shows skill to the smallest detail. It is then wrapped in beautiful paper, hand-crafted and hand-painted by the most talented artists. The whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made of fine silk. It's an eye to see. <br /> <br /> Then cut the ribbon, rip off the paper, open the box and find ... nothing. It's TOYS. You also enjoy the packaging or forget it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not without its purpose and purpose: War is not a good thing. Well, it's not original! The moral is so obvious that it is almost imperative to even highlight it. And even that poor insight is suppressed by a story in which especially the elements of warcraft toys are definitely a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the movie simulates a war with innocent toys. It's like someone preaching a strict, condescending sermon just to end by saying, "Just joke." <br /> <br /> But even as an empty box, the movie is not checked. Yes, it is a sight to see with some remarkable, striking images. The sets are imaginative and cinematography captures the colorful scenes with skill. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. Like the screenplay, the look of the movie is joyful and sometimes aesthetically bare and surreal. It's a movie that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, but show it's creations of a world that is empty and cold. The film strives to be funny, in a morose way, but the humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as the besieged heir to a toy manufacturing empire, throws in his ad lib shitick, which is only strange in the bizarre, cold-structured world he inhabits. Indeed, the current references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered everywhere are in contradiction with the childlike fable. The film is vaguely trying to be. For this movie to work, or make sense, it must be set in its own universe, an Oz far removed from Kansas. Every time the jokes come back into reality, the toyland of the movie is becoming more and more clear. <br /> <br /> It's said it was director Barry Levinson's pet project, one he tried to make for ten years. Unfortunately, it is clear that he had trouble supporting. Like most pet projects that are eventually made (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: AARTH are good examples), it seems a blind spot in the film maker's vision field. Perhaps Levinson had so often pointed in his head that he had no fresh vision for it when he finally came to the soundtrack. He has already brought it to an end. <br /> <br /> Many of the toys featured in the movie are clumsy, mechanical, exciting monsters. So is the movie itself.
