I almost drowned in CHEES look at this movie. In fact, I couldn't even finish it. I want my money back. One of Hollywood's poor attempts to create a new idea. Good thing, I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They had to get a hat and a bull sweep from Nic Cage. Swashbucklin. Leaving cage in Raising Arizona or Las Vegas saves this "lemon". People who are completely and completely marketed (and most of them) should love this movie. If this movie is animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I'd rather pay to see a completely silly movie that didn't try to hide it. It was, in my opinion, an incredibly stupid movie and it made an even more incredible effort to try and hide that fact. <br /> <br /> All the SHEEP seems to already love it.
