The prospect of this anticipated successor was really good and after the great success of the remake I really expected it. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inactive. The situations are stupid and beyond reason and the acting is really terrible. <br /> <br /> This time there are no nice characters or violets other than the remake. Even the gore is not that big and when it does, it's really bad. <br /> <br /> The violence is minimal and it is a pity because there are many arguments that make you think there is room for heavy violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team hunting a family of cannibal mutants. You probably expect something different! When I watched it on the movies, I wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a clear example of how rushed movies are a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects. <br /> <br /> A mess that the fans of the remake like I dropped. Therefore, persecutions are never welcomed; at least this movie is not as horrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.
