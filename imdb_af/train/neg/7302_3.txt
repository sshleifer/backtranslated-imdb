The first five minutes of this movie showed potential. Then it went straight for something decent for some illegal comedy. The best part is that I can't stop thinking about Supertroopers, thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for the mere fact of learning how not to make a movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that make one stop and wonder if the whole cast and crew stopped caring at one stage. The thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it cost $ 22m in the box and only about $ 1.5m to make. Congratulations to Lion's Gate for deducting that one.
