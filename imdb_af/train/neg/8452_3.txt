This is the first time I've been talking to a movie because I felt like the right person was reading it, they could wake up and do something about it. Over the past few months, the ABC family has begun to present a new movie format. I saw the last three and enjoyed it. They were tempting and did the trick. My wife likes these movies. I look forward to seeing "See Jane Date". The trailers sounded and sounded. Unfortunately, this is a film where the book should be light years ahead of the efforts of the authors and musicians involved in this project. The year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as a lift ride in a department store. It was intrusive and didn't add any emotional content to the movie. It worked through it. I work in the business of film and television. I enjoy being entertained. This is one case where I thought it might get worse. The writing had lines of another decade and I know these women can act, but you won't know about this movie. To add to the overall experience, the end made me shake my head. An Advice to Drivers at Disney, ABC, ABC Family and Producers: Under no circumstances should you hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future movies. They lost their contact and understood what the word "contemporary", "contemporary" and "current" means when describing a romantic comedy. There is a world that passes you by. All in all, a huge disappointment from people at Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
