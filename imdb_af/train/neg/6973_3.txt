I never even knew that this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy, hidden deep in my dusty horror case. The title on the box said "Insect" and the illustrations on the back made it just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie. They can certainly be fun, of course, as long as you don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you are not irritated by seeing a huge amount of cheesy makeup effects. Almost every important aspect worthy of a horror movie is here in the "Blue Monkey" substandard! The plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal, the acting actions are painful to observe and there is a total lack of tension. Following the popular trend of "big-bug" movies, "Blue Monkey" treats a new and unknown insect species that deletes the doctors and patients from a remote hospital. The makers could no longer evade the true origin of this giant bulldozer! All we know is that it is not out of space and initially crept out of a tropical plant. Other than that, there is absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect comes from! As I said, don't get your hopes on an intelligent script. The first half of the film is entertaining enough, with some pretty gore and the introduction of some confused characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!), But the second half (when the whole hospital is quarantined is very boring. It is also near the end that the "Blue Monkey" started exaggerating older (and better) movies. To approach the climax, they also apparently ran out of budget as the lighting became very poor and the man in the sample pack was no longer camouflaged. "Blue Monkey" is worth a look if you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made. Fans of B-cinema can recognize John Vernon ("Killer Klowns from Outer Space", "Curtains") in the small and meaningless role of Roger, in charge of the clinic.
