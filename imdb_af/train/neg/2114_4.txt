Just look at the sets, setup and editing, it's easy to say this project didn't have a proper budget. Perhaps Bela Lugosi intends thinking of such things. Young brides fall dead on the altar after saying "I do". Their bodies are stolen by a well-known horticulturist dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and some of his freaky minions as his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) must be injections of the glandular liquids of the young virgins to stay young forever ... beautifully. An avid local cub reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that every missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar; an orchid in which dr. Lorenz will be most knowledgeable. A typical horror movie storm brewing visit to the Lorenz estate a bit spooky; especially with a dwarf and a slumbering hunchback on the premises. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Kis, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
