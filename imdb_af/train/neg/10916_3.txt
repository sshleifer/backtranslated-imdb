For household audiences, I can see how they will applaud this movie. For outsiders, with no established interests, it didn't make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent and the Russians as heroes. The so-called romantic corner was superfluous and a distraction. How a young woman could love the lieutenant to just smile at him was nonsense. How she could never marry, as mentioned at the end of the movie, just because this imagination was outside me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots and it was suggested in the hunt in the marsh. Several hundred German troops have progressed and pushed the Russians into the swamp. So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and just stood there listening. I think they didn't want to water their boots, but I'm sure an officer ordered 20 or 30 men in the water to look for the swamp. But that would end the story. The Germans also entered the shed where the Russians hid in the cage and did not set fire to the roof. At worst, a soldier would have thrown a grenade into the cage and not climbed a ladder. <br /> <br /> I saw some reviewers saying they were crying at the end. I wonder why? You knew this little group would perish and there was nothing in the heart.
