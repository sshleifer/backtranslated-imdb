. . . And this is a bad thing, because at least if it was a Troma movie, it would have had unwavering violence and a greater sense of anarchic surrender that might have made my rating slightly worse. <br /> <br /> So What We Instead Have A Very Easy (graded PG), barely lukewarm, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director who later stayed unknown.) Gremlins (1984 / Critters (1986) -wannabe with almost exclusively humorous logic that made Gremlins so good - fantasy logic or not, no tension, no sense of adventure, and no violence or nudity to care for it. <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure some of the movie's problems are inherent in writing. Let's see it, no one can deliver these jokes so they'll be funny. It seems as if the biggest debt in the lap of director, Bettina Hirsch, should fall. In more capable hands, Munchies could be entertaining. <br /> <br /> It starts out like many great adventure movies. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are archaeological in Peru. Simon is a bit of an arrogant archaeologist who always dreams of the connections between old places and strange civilizations. For example, he thinks he sees evidence of laser cutting on ancient brickwork. So they are at Machu Picchu looking for more evidence of Simon's theories when they happen to be in a secret room. Inside, they quickly find the animal they later call "Arnold", one of the titular munchies. <br /> <br /> They take Arnold back home to their small California desert town. Simon, who believes that Arnold is probably a stranger, should go to a colleague's lecture, and he plans to tell the colleague that he has a foreign concept. Paul and his extremely sweet friend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde) are left in control of Arnold, but because they have not seen each other long ago, they leave Arnold unattended while jumping into the bag. <Br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Simon's brother Cecil (also played by Korman in a dual role), owner of a successful fast food company, eager to buy Simon's home and land - they are adjacent to his own . Simon didn't want to sell, so Cecil hit a scheme to steal Arnold. Things are gradually getting out of control and the munchies, which have a significant streak to go with their cravings for litter, are beginning to cross the town. <br /> <br /> It reads better in a summary than it plays the screen. The best shots in the movie are those with natural landscapes in the background, such as when characters ride on the outskirts of the desert city. Interiors, with the exception of Cecil's house, tend to look like poorly decorated, inexpensive sets, and more importantly, they tend to show that Hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting shots. Strangely, given the scarcity of the production design overall, Cecil's home is quite a jewel, as in the remaining 1980s to the smallest details, and Cecil's stepson, Dude (Jon Stafford), was a surprising counterpart. It is a pity, then he is so quick from the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Korman is a fun actor, but he comes here much better here than Simon and Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up for most of the movie. Cecil, physically differentiated with a ridiculous wig and facial hair, is not just the "evil capitalist" of the film, he is one of Korman's classic inconsiderate, drill characters - one of his specialties, "Carol Burnett Show" (1967) sketches. Unlike the Carol Burnett Show, which tended to succeed, directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a studied way to push the sketches just on the brink of chaos, Hirsch Korman remembers too far, and the Cecil character just doesn't work as needed. <br /> <br /> There are many other direct-related issues, the least of which is haunting pacing and editing, completely juiceing any potential strain or compelling dramatic impact of the movie. Even plays that had to be cleared to strengthen the drama - such as when the munchies hit an old lady on the road - are too much uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> There are also serious logical issues with the story as it stands. Where did the munchie come from in the room at Machu Picchu? The movie's trailer looks like an answer, but it has been edited from the final track. A more serious problem is that unlike gremlins, there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute, cuddly balls to threatening monsters. It just doesn't happen. Furthermore, since Munchies PG was held, and the violence remains toned, when the creatures are in their monster phase, they are never very threatened. They are also sent easily, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> However, the core of the film is not tension, horror, compelling drama or any of those other things, but humor. It's more like a ghost of Gremlins and the many rip-offs in its aftermath. The only problem with this is that the film is just not funny, although I have been visiting several times. A surprisingly high percentage of jokes are blatant cliches. Too much of the remaining material consists of non-successors. Given Hirsch's bad timing, it just fell flat. There was a potential to make a film that was both horrific and frightening, hilarious and disturbing, cheesy and exciting, both at the same time, Ala Killer Klowns of the Outer Space (1988). It's a pity, then, that Munchies doesn't get anywhere near anywhere.
