Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska, and some of the modern psycho billy, the live performances are the only worthy look. This movie has tons and tons of tape comos, along with Troma's president, Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-important role, and many goofy death scenes. Sounds good, right? Well, death remains, and repeatedly to many different groups of the Warp Tour and fans at the event. Some of the deaths are stylish, but then they are repeatedly reclaimed, to the point of being completely repetitive. Almost everyone dies from the fact that their head has broken, or guts are pulled out of their stomachs. The gore looks as if it were Andreas Schnaas' "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence"; with this the "rinsed-up type of blood", but now the movie is really decent, and offers humor-something that this movie is terribly lacking. Sure, the movie was made by Doug Sakmann of Troma. It has a great low budget potential, and it tries ... just too hard. Everything is meant to be funny in this movie, and that's what it brings. Everything is trying to be comical and goofy, using deliberate bad acting, over-exploitation of useless deaths and the same thing ... over and over again. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chair of the Board", or any movie you've made with your friends: it's funny for those who made it, and it's about it. <br /> <br /> Great potential, good idea, great use of effects - but that's the same thing ... over and over: playing a band, dying a bond, supporters die. Everyone dies, everywhere blood is sprayed everywhere. The process is repeated. <br /> <br /> The question is for these types of movies - which are actually a bad stick - are they trying too hard or not at all?
