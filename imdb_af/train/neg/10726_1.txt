I agree with the previous comment, the start of the movie is pretty good, and you get lost about what is coming ....... What is nothing. All open story lines remain open; Two characters that initially seemed to be of any interest are left out of the picture, except for 1 or 2 very short scenes. I wander if Ilya didn't do better to leave them altogether. As far as one remaining character is concerned, nothing was done with her either. She will only visit a few divine places, and suddenly the movie is no longer about her, but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making bread from bread, drinking homemade vodka, and apparently flashing each other. Some may say the movie is good for crumbling a society, like the judges of the IFFR, but for me it's just bad taste, bad camera work, a lousy script and terribly bad direction. That's why I can't be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to rating: 1!
