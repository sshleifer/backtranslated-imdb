As we all know Hollywood enjoys changing historical events for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywoodized films. For example, the bankers never returned to the bank when they started shooting at the LAPD, but in the movie we'll see them coming back twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers shot near the end of the film, far from the truth! But of course, Hollywood must have a good bloody end so they * add even more blood and intestines. Some events have been combined and many of the lead players have played several different people, but that's what Hollywood always did, why complain? I think the only sad part is that I watched documentary programs about the North Hollywood shootings on TLC that were much better than that!
