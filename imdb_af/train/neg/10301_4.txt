It's a bit odd that a story that is part of Oslo, where a very high percentage of locals are from an Asian background, is NOT ONE ASIAN or AFRICAN, even as an extra , do not show. That fact probably describes Norwegian racial bonds in general. - But. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - ONLY A SHORT INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION: <br /> <br /> Buddy depicts four young people living in an apartment in Oslo. The protagonist is two young men who cannot regulate their lives in any serious way, and one can say that the film can be indecisive and avoidable responsibility - a kind of fear of growing up. The story is about typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle models. Completely the clich√©. Although the story is gently funny, the play is good and as a "young person" one can identify with the characters "crazy" situations and intricate love affairs, I do not find the story or the characters very credible. To be polished and lacking in depth. This movie makes use of all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining movie that has so much intellectual depth as "Friends" (yes, that shows on television). <br /> <br /> Finally, Norwegian film found its identity: Public pleasers in familiar American style. <br /> <br /> What about Lukas Moodysson's Tillssam (Saam) look.
