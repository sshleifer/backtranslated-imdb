Whatever Guy Ritchie owned to regain Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. There was another person in the audience when I saw it, and she left about an hour there. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed to the end was because I had never walked from a movie. <br /> <br /> But I put this piece of garbage on, and Madonna and Ritchie actually thought they made a good movie. The dialogue is laughing, the play is horrible and the only good thing in this movie is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's film and adjusted it to another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> It's a movie you won't even waste time watching Cinemax late at night. Time is too precious to waste in such a way.
