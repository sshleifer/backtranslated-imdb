This film represents a whole series of characters and their relationships in the first half hour. Neither of them generates any interest or positive response. I waited for the plot to begin, hoping that things would get better and eventually stretch to the bitter end, but there was no reward to do so. <br /> <br /> If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. For me, the action is not worth telling. Not that the story was so bad, I think you can say I had problems with the writing - that is, I think. I thought it bumped. A look at the credits will show you that there is a pretty strong roll here, which has not been useful. Most of the old benefits in this movie do good work; of the actors I have not seen before, before I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger. It's about everything I can find good about saying this photo.
