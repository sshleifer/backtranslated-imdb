This film, despite its "independent" status, is a stupid hollywood version of a late-night mother-daughter relationship. It wasn't that bad, but somewhere in the course of the movie - about the time the girl goes with the guy, I think - it becomes a cheese mummy daughter bonding movie. I'm sorry, but I don't know about any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter. That's probably better.
