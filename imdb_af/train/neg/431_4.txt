Admittedly I find Al Pacino a guilty pleasure. He was a good actor to the scent of a woman, where he apparently had irreparably passed on himself. I was hoping this movie, of which I hardly heard anything, would be a nice jeweler. An overcoming, prosperous, intelligent and engaging city political thriller. It's not. City Hall is a movie that has its plot of clouds with so many characters, names and "realistic" global issues, which for a while you think is a plot in scope so broad and implicit, Once you find out the truth, it will make your mind out. In fact, these subplots and retrenchments eventually lead to fairly easy and well-known urban story brands such as corruption of power, bipartite politicians, mafia with police ties, and so on. And theoretically, this setup leaves tension, the fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything can happen! But again, it's really not. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only things happening are pretty predictable, and we are left with several monologues that are confession. It is intended as a whole for modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider's web of lies and coverings, the audience is usually treated with a somewhat satisfactory disclosure. I don't think we were left there in the city hall, and while it's a very full movie, I didn't find it quite rich.
