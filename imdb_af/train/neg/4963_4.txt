seems to be another failed attempt by the ridiculous sci-fi channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and played the poem, but I'm sure it was by a 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be great to have a crossbow in the movie. AAAAAAAH! When I saw that part, I lost all hope. Then ... they sat for heorot in a car that looked like Christopher Columbus had entered! When they reach Heorot (which is supposed to be a Norwegian Mead hall), the sci-fi group decided to make heorot like a big stone castle. when I saw that part. I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but sci-fi still has a good movie, so I don't know why I got my hope. Oh, and Grendel and his mother are stupid. (This comment is about the subject of "Grendel"). If someone from the sci-fi channel reads it, there is good advice. Not every movie you've made must be about a big monster that people can stop in half, that's not what science release is! AND ALSO STOP CASTING LOW-CRAFTS AS STEPHEN BALDWIN IS IN YOUR MOVIES! She doesn't help the movie, but makes it willing!
