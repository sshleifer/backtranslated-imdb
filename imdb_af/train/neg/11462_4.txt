I like monster movies, generally. Even if they are impeccable and stupid. But it's hard to keep this movie when it's so indescribable and stupid AND trying to take it seriously at the same time. Like in a very good kind of way. <br /> <br /> While the idea is somewhat factual, as Orcas is known for killing the Great White Sharks, it's really hard to find it scary when I can't help but just see an evil Shamoo destroys things. Especially that one scene where a building exploded caused the Orca to do so ... and while it exploded, the thing jumped out of the water and it felt like I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks. Plus they kill many of the scary moments before they even hint that they're going to happen. In addition, it takes a few jabs at JAWS. It's like "hey look, we're factual and we can BETTER reasons why the Orca attack". <br /> <br /> Of course, you ignore your outrageous **** ups in the logic. . But JAWS had one thing that your movie didn't do. It's scary. Yes, it is unreasonable. Yes, this is somewhat outrageous. But honestly, factually or not, a Killer Shark is not close to being as terrifying as a Great White. And the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts. Even JAWS the revenge is scarcer than that.
