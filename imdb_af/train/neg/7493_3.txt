I couldn't believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg on Dutch television yesterday. It starts very slowly, the backgrounds of the Nuremberg trials are becoming step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but then the audience suddenly gets the last few minutes of the first part of the series. shocking, horrific footage I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is important that people see such footage (although I totally disagree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this type of material), but in this movie it was totally ridiculous. It was purely intended to improve the impact of a regular TV show. It was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying out scenes, inspirational dialogue, or interesting points of view, the audience is tortured with horrendous images of skin and bone camp prisoners. It shows no respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I'm very angry.
