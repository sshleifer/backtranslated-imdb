My spouse and I found this movie very shocked. It started well, but quickly became incredible and ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, Abbie, who was really great. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and paralyzed - especially Gideon, the Angel. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she seems almost indifferent. Initially we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a horrible script. We love almost all the Hallmark movies and their heartwarming stories, but this movie doesn't rise for the chance to be one. There are so many big ones - don't waste your time with this terrible movie.
