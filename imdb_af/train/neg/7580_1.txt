It was a terrible movie. In fact, Jane March was a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible to US forces in South Korea. She becomes a girl for a US military family, they see her as Korean although she looks more white (I believe the actress is 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian, not Korean at all) and the teenager of the household started to hate her and ended up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the US army are portrayed in Korea is completely insane. Of course, the author writer and director were, of course, white men who have never spent a day in Korea for this movie and do not intend to give a real insight into life in Korea for Korean or American GIs and have just try to satisfy their pathetic Asiaphile fantasies without regard to how totally incredible it made the film. Anyone who ever was in Korea will know it is utter garbage. In the end, the North Korean honhy spy is being killed, in a clear "pay for her sins". Very bad movie with a TV made for it.
