I have never read the Bradbury novel on which this movie is based, but from what I have collected it will be interesting (when I last read it and I'll do it). My comments will only be based on the movie. When I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it and was so excited, but when I was finally there, I was so disappointed that it hurt. This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish. The actors were not thrown well (although Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). The child actors apparently just asked to show up, get in the characters' clothes, say the lines and make the faces. The set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised at the horror that I had to go online and see who made it right, just to see the kind of work he did. The editing was cut and pasted and the plot (script) was just as good (even if the author himself was involved, irony?). The build-up of tension, fear and tension was so mild that it was ineffective when the climax finally came. <br /> <br /> I've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe that people actually like It. What hurt most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. It had so much potential. Unfortunately, the movie was so technically bad, it took away from the brilliance of the story.
