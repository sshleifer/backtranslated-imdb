I can't believe Steven Segal's career has been so low that he has been reduced to making 4th-class films with 5th-class secondary actors. I looked at this shift that expected him to see what most of the people did as usual. When he is reduced to using a single judo hood between the shoulder blades to pull out an opponent and the man falls like a ton of bricks, something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is amazing as a movie, and even if you excuse the footage, and if you've read this story as a novel, you'll wonder why you even picked up the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal goes through the moves and looks like he's doing it just because he's under obligation. He shows no hassle and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he doesn't show at all. <br /> <br /> I hate to repeat other people's remarks, but using stock material for cuts and visuals The airplanes in flight are pathetic. The condition of those scenes that were cut in was shaky and plays themselves deteriorated over time. The zappruder film has some pressure. John F Kennedy is murdered, is slower and cleaner. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion is to tell you that you won't waste time watching this movie, it's not the standards of its work in glittering or exaggerated wounds. I read one review that said the movie had a budget of 12 million dollars (Segal paid 5 of them) and that the movie was still under budget. I have to agree. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder it's a direct DVD movie, as no conscientious theater owner will play this movie.
