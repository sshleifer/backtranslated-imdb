I saw the omen when I was 11 on television. I enjoyed the Trilogy. So when the chance to finally see one came to the cinema, I didn't convey it. I went to the cinema and knew that what I was about to watch was not a movie release, but made a TV movie. But I'm not a fan. But this Omen movie I saw at a midnight screen didn't cause chills, it laughed. Risible Dialogue such as "it is written that if a baby cries during baptism, reject them there". Some nonsense. No decent pieces. Faye Grant as well in v is messed with this scripture from hell. No surprises and no fun. But I laughed aloud a few times at our bad, it was. Completely Pathetic.1 out of 10
