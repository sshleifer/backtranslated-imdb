Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to break into serious television reports. When a job he begged for goes wrong, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girl (Elizabeth Hurley) also says Sayonara. With his home, Tim is discovering that his home is an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) of the planet Mars! To name him, Oom Martin, Tim will soon try to help his new friend navigate life on earth. But, Martin gets into trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the washroom and more. Beautiful Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees the opportunity to spend time with Tim, but the course of true love does not flow in this case either. Soon everyone in television is busy with Tim and hoping for a story about a real alien. What is a man to do? For those who love the old television program of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy to tie proverbial boots. It is truly undeniably terrific, with no plot and confidence on alleged special effects that also fall flat. Daniels are okay like the ground, but Lloyd is just as terrible as the stranger, who overshoots a storm. The rest of the cast is sufficient as well as the costumes, sets and production data. Even if your kids see and beg their cover for this movie, convince them to take out another movie at the video store. Be assured, kids and adults will find this movie a colossal drill, so choose an evening at the museum or around the world in 80 days.
