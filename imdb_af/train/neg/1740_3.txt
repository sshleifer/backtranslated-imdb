The movie was a big disappointment. Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such dull standards. Poor performance (almost nonexistent) and song songs with bad songs every minute and at the most strange times murdered what humor the movie can offer. some of the scenes were funny, but it probably only lasted 5 minutes of the duration. The editing was pathetic. Gloomy! In general, the film was disappointed as the lack of story was just too clear. In fact, only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval. <br /> <br /> You won't miss anything if you don't watch the movie. Not worth the money to spend on this movie. wait until it appears on TV ...
