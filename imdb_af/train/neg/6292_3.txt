I wonder how much this movie is actually dealing with the 1984 movie "Bachelor Party", starring Tom Hanks. Is this movie even an official successor? This movie is missing in every department and you are of course better off not watching. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this movie is simply not good or funny enough. It is mostly based on the character's stereotypical assessments, but the film actually contains some good, original and funny moments. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is also a very small story present and the movie naked chest as writing pages. You just wait for things to finally start. There is a main plot line somewhere, but one is so terribly original and is so poorly executed in the movie that it feels like it doesn't exist. I think there is even a message and moral story in it, but it is again so terribly inexplicable and bad in the movie that it simply doesn't work out. <br /> <br /> It's basically a typical teenage comedy, with lots of sex jokes and nudity, just without the teenage main characters, making the story all the more sad and tasteless. The movie makes some really wrong jokes, which is wrong for any kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to see it all. <br /> <br /> 3/10
