Can it ever be said that there are movies that do not have redeeming features at all? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After half of the scary 'House of the Dead' director, Uwe Boll now has his less talented eye toward another video game adaptation. Shouldn't these guys get it? For anyone who can't understand, it's here in capital letters for you: VIDEO GAMES MUST NOT BE GOOD FILMS! The acting here is, in the best case, substandard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which had terrifying moments), the movie had no threatening threat, no sense or danger. Tension and plot are confused and the paper on which the font is printed would be better used as toilet paper. The chief culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the mercy and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Hackneyed zoom, swoops and pans are split into the unpredictable moments throughout the cruel affair. It makes the audience distorted and bored. Why this man was ever seated near a movie set should first of all be one of the greatest secrets of modern theaters. Avoid at all costs.
