Don't get me wrong. If you need an insightful summary of everything wrong with the history of human civilization, as well as a flawless path to a better future for humanity, which would be better than a comedian and pop culture practitioner? If you need a healthy dose of solid matter, why do religion survive it, then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God's business? This is a good point in and of itself. Maher rejects our religious past as a neurological disorder. It's easy to ignore how his entire society, art and science are rooted in it. <br /> <br /> In this film, he relies heavily on his sharp-dog skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while looking erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his mind is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh, but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. For example, he responds to an interviewer's (and I use the term loosely as it was all the "ambitious") that the existence of Jesus is historical fact with a death span "No, it is not" followed by a long stare intended to despise contempt for the subject's naivety (a device unusable in this movie). The problem is that the person was correct and Maher's death was wrong in his claim that Jesus is only mentioned in what he regards as the historically-suspected gospels. I think Mr. Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But the masses will come to this pseudo-documentary role because they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they will braai aloud and guffaw (they certainly did at my show) . <br /> <br /> It is, however, a double point to say that the hardest and most mule-like braai has taken place at about 70% of the running time. anti-Christian tirade while the audience was completely dumb during the token 10% dedicated to criticizing the self-proclaimed religion of peace. Hmmm. Whether criticism of Islam is beyond the limits of the hip and liberal target audience or they were just scared to laugh. Much to tell, anyway ..
