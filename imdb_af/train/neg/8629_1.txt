Dear Richard, I know we all loved you with Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, do you have anything else to do except lame persecutors to Air Bud? I would have thought Tim could actually play you or even become his personal assistant. I know it looks ironic, but the payback benefits are much more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everyone will see you Tim and immediately think of Tool Time. You'll get even more roles with Bob Vila. Instead, you'll appear with a Golden Retriever for 10 minutes and smile. I know there wasn't much of a script, but you could have added to it. I mean, come on. Tim owes you one. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does nothing for the Air Bud line. On the contrary, the fake talks are more than seeing the dogs playing. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, know it more than anyone. <br /> <br /> This is a "F" movie.
