Bollywood fans hold Amitabh Bachan's Mard firmly, but I think it's much overstated. Manmohan Desai previously worked together on films such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie and I saw everyone I liked. I had very high expectations before I looked at Mard and was very disappointed. My biggest gripe on Mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony part 2, maybe Mr. Desai went out of ideas, he used the formula for years and years. 1. First, some members of the cast are repeated from AAA, for example, the police inspector who brings Amar, the Muslim who brings Akbar, Nirupa Roy and another, with them. 2. In AAA, Nirupa Roy loses her face, in Mard she loses her voice 3. In AAA there is the famous song (Shirdi wale sai baby). Well, in Mard we sing Amitabh, Maa Sherawali. I've seen more than 1000 times AAA. I noticed immediately. <br /> <br /> My other gripes are that some of the situations just look ridiculous. True Manmohan Desai closed your brain at the door, but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last gripe is that compared to songs in previous Manmohan Desai movies, I found the songs rather disappointing. I know it has many fans who swear it, but I didn't get one. It actually bothered me to write this review because I was such a big fan and loved his movies since I was a kid.
