By 1976, the Western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this movie knew it clearly. Yet, instead of shelving the project and saving us to see it, they continued and made it anyway. Apparently, an interesting thread needs to get the audience to see the movie, and decide to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch, so why not work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch has the benefit of a wonderful script, but The Last Hard Men's script is ordinary old-fashioned rubbish. <br /> <br /> It's hard to figure out what roles Charlton Heston and James Coburn have attracted them. Heston plays a retired lawyer who is led to an escaped group of convicts led by a violent ban (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the prisoners and subjected to sexual decline. <br /> <br /> It's a bloodthirsty movie in which everybody dies, the top detail. It is incredibly disappointing, because the starry sound is like a mouth-watering prospect. There is also no speed or urgency in the movie. It takes an eternity to go, but when the action finally comes, it is emphasized by the emphasis on nastiness. All in all, this is perhaps the worst movie Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he wants to include on his illustrious resume.
