While counting myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that launched the series is a bad start. Although many of the elements that will later expire and become more compelling in the series, the rate of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat insufficient and the plot confused. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. Although the rating chart shows that many fans are willing to ignore these issues, I remember The Gathering has almost turned me off, which has grown into a spectacular series soon.
