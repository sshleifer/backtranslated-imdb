Seeing Tom Hanks as a hit for the Irish mob is a bit like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a series rapist, but it doesn't work. I had a very hard time accepting it. Not that I don't think Tom can act, I can follow his career since Mazas and Monsters, but for some reason it has become flat for me. Perhaps because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at risk of sounding like a fanboy (the only form of life that is lower than a fanboy is a cockroach). The movie as a whole failed for me. The additions Jude Law, and The Deductions made me feel cold and over a little disappointed. I expected a big crime movie, more in the ear of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took the whole heart out of the story and left nothing but the bare bones. There are things to keep in this movie, but cinematography is awesome to fill the screen with beautiful images. Paul Newman is as usual excellent and I really enjoyed the score, but Tom as the angel of death, Sullivan, was completely flat.
