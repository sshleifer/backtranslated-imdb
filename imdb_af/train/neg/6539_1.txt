If it could be a 0, it would be. Of the horrible timber acting at the dull rate, the puerile exploitation and the sophomoric pseudolic titillation are purely for the sake of the sad viewers. It's a disaster of a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, from the beginning one is absolutely sure of what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will begin. From a boring, unforeseen start to a pathetic and dark end, every presence in this movie is wasted, and every scary talent is unearthed because this turkey is wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something so indifferent to much of the same childlike titulation, watch one of the Ilsa movies. At least they are unapologetic and in the forefront of what they are trying to do. How something that this horrible bad has ever managed to be above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or distinctive standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious purpose. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not scary. interesting and most importantly it is not in any sense of the word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; It is a crime that has ever been so horrendously offensive and incompetent and has been given to bring about the resources, and even more tragedy that is still being defended by some badly-wrong viewers. <br /> <br /> Not even, Elvira's cheerful personality and funny ways can soften the bladder that this horrible travesty of film is. Avoid it at all costs.
