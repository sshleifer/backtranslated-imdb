In the standard view it is a purely horrible movie. However, this is an almost perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale. I can think of some real comedies that made me laugh as hard as I watched this movie. Andy Griffith's ghost dressed in Native American clothing, sends me in hysteria every time. I won't flush the gas or energy that drives to the video industry, but if you are lying on the couch in the morning in the morning and coming on TV, watch it out.
