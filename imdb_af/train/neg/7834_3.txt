I don't usually write reviews, but I can't understand why it's so high and wanted to alert horror lovers as I can only assume that all the high ratings were given by average TV viewers. <br /> <br /> I just watched the first two episodes, but the two were so cliché, it wasn't even funny. The same old stories you've already seen / read a few times - living toys, evil things of other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are innovative, but they are also bad versions of the clichés. I prefer eg. "chucky" and "quiet hill" over those two episodes anytime. and don't even ask about the visual effects ... the one in the first episode is good, but the one in the second ... terrible. looks like a film student's project went wrong. blood ... or gore ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting for a 10-year-old child who probably hasn't already seen many scary stories (although I'd rather recommend "out of faith" - now that's what I see a decent mystery TV show call). but for an adult horror fan it is worthless. I just gave the 3 points because there is actually a beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some nice plays.
