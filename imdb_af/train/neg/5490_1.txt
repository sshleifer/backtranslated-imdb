When I was a kid, we were always babysitting, and we always rented a movie or watched a movie at the cinema. This is one of the movies we watched. This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I think it could even be a Walt Disney Pictures movie! A martian is dropped on earth, transformed into a human, befriended, and tried everything he could to get back home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the earth. The only good comment I can give is the selection of actors, Christopher Lloyd as martyr, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber's Jeff Daniels like Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But apart from that, it's a complete crap. Weak!
