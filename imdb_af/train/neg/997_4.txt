Having recently picked a "Lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, I backed it with "Descent", though I got more negative comments than other movie friends with so much like mine. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to contrast how the unique Rape Revenge film niche has developed over the past 32 years, from the full line of "I Spit On Your Grave" to the tawdry sensation of Lipstick. for the tasteful handling of the problem in "The Accused." But "Descent", although making some important points, never really offers something new to new meaning. No, "Descent" is so poor in terms of image and sound quality that detracts from any important message it can hope for - a message that, when scrutinized, is not so groundbreaking. <br /> <I knew pretty much that the plot was going. What I wanted to see was * the descent or degeneration of Dawson's character. As a big fan of Rosario's, I was anxious to see the layers being stripped and her psyche slowly turned ... you know, the kind of depiction DeNiro brings to "Taxi Driver." Unfortunately, the script and the director's / writer's choices do not offer a kind of credible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is the second act. It became clear what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club jumps, drug use and obsession with the big black stallion Adrian (every white boy's nightmare, tracking) from a Q&A on the DVD, but this outing to Dawson's character is never credible. delivered. We don't know exactly what hell is doing half the time, what she's after, or why she does. The poor quality of the audio / video doesn't help, but the order is just too damn long and useless. It destroys any momentum and investment in the main character created during the otherwise very well done first act. By the time we reach the final, our interest has already been reduced. <br /> <br /> One point of success that Dawson points out in the Q&A is that by the end "revenge" scene is being pumped for retribution, then realize just how exhausted and ugly the reality is. Although it is certainly valid, it does not make the scene more intriguing. <br /> <br /> If you have the DVD, check out the removed "classroom" scene. It is an excellent 8-minute plus rash that cracks with energy and provocation (though all verbally) and really gives Dawson's slow creaking, as she is wonderfully dividing poor Francie Swift's spicy, apostate dorm counselor. If more exponential scenes like this were added and more of the middle third cut, we could have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence. <br /> <br /> If the movie is in the final cut Although everything we get is what we've seen before, just in a more graphic version. Approximately?
