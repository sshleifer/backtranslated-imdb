Wow! I watched the trailer for this one and although 'nah, this one is not for me'. I watched my husband and our friend's faces during the trailer, and I knew it was a boy movie. I mean, hello! A lot of chickens who dance - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then I started looking, it didn't look so bad. So I continued to look. I looked it up to the end. what a wonderful movie. If it's something, it's a chick. These girls have attitude. It's really a good movie, and a bit of a love story. really give you a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story of a small town girl makes it big in the city, after passing through the usual big city c ** p. There are some of these, it's almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think about your life and what you have achieved. Well, anyway. I think that is because the whole work in a bar scenario is very familiar, not just to me, but to many people I know. Don't trust the trailers for this one - it is aimed at bringing in the men.
