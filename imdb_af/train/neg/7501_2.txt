I went to this movie and expect a concise film about the effect the Son of Sam had on society. I didn't expect Spike Lee to force me more rubbish on racial tension, mob justice or the inability of the ordinary citizen to make pressure on colleagues under pressure. Lee offered an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The whole movie could have been more effective than in a 90-min format with more focus, less tangential sub-graphs. <br /> <br /> Don't even rent the video unless you passionately enjoy Spike Lee; In such a case, the theater is worth it. This is not an escapist movie.
