As much as I like Rodney Dangerfield, it was a terrible movie. The plot was kind of a holistic finishing of several movies, but unfortunately they forgot to snatch any good jokes. In addition, it was irritating and boring and it was good. If you are looking for a good laugh, rent a copy of Private Parts.
