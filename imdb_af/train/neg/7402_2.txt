This is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips / ads trying to make their first full feature film. On the one hand, the images, camera, lighting, CGI and even the sound are highly polished and have a real "expensive" look. Even the actors show some potential - to the point where even the best play could not hide a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case, it is not a bad plot, but hardly a plot. br /> <br /> So 50% of the dialogue is "What was hell?", "What was it?" and "What was hell?". In neither case is any of the characters or the audience provided with the slightest hint of an answer. In most other dialogues one gets the feeling that there was never a form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise on a plot that was never explained to them. <br /> <br /> The only reason Skye Bennet's performance could be so good that her character as an autistic girl does not allow her to give her this tragic horrible dialogue the other actors had to do. In this way, she could only show her play that the rest of the role couldn't even get close to. I mean there is not one actor in the world who can form such a dialogue: <br /> <br /> Ben: Is it really, did he? Emily: Stop it. Ben: A mass psychosis, huh? Jon: Someone needs to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can't be controlled. Not by you, not by someone. Emily: neither by you. Ben: No <br /> <br /> Have me goosebumps. But not for horror, more for the terrible attempt. In some moments, I was ashamed of the actors adding it to their vita. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
