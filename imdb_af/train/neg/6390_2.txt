I saw about a thousand horror movies. (my favorite type) This movie is one of the worst. For me, an idea is a movie. So, even a poorly acted, cheaply made movie can be good. Something strange is definitely cheap. However, it has little to say. I still don't understand what the karate scene was about to do with the movie at first. Something Weird has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
