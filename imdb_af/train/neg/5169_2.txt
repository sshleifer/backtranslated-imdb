WARNING: I advise anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet to read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't see them all, The Hamiltons definitely made one low piece of entertainment, which didn't. amuse me smoothly !! I thought it was in common with the semi-bad acting, dumb plot scheme and the end of the movie, which was very delayed, sucking this movie! Oh yes, so offensive are people who eat other people. Yes ...... I said people are not people, not because they are not people, or wait I think they are, OH NO WAIT, They did not tell you !!!! Well, these people are cannibals, or are they imbreds, or what are they! I mean, maybe they're just "THINGS" that came here to see how people taste or are their cannibals who have eaten people for a long time, or maybe this movie is HORRIBLE! WHAT WAS! !!! So if you think The Hamiltons are good, I ask you, why, why, WHY, WHY, why was it so great, because for me it was just awful !!! One big BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons !!! Check out the Gravedancers, Tand & Spyker, or Borderland for an entertainment day !!!!!
