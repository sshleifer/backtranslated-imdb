To make any movie about the supposed end of the world, there must be facts and realism. We are never told why these people believe it. 2. Location is New Years Eve in Toronto Canada. PLEASE, PLEASE EVERYONE, SAY WHY HAVE IT BEING ABOUT AFTERNOON AND WHY (based on the costumes) HAVE IT AS SEPTEMBER NO <br /> <br /> 3. The act was in that neo-natural style, what a needed a director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. The individual story pieces were all sad and without any purpose. I can go on, but I don't want to make it as boring as the movie. <br /> <br /> rating * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on IMDB scale <br /> <br /> thank you is as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
