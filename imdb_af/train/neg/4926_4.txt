I saw this movie for 2 reasons - I love Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to wear a pretty silly movie. I like the notion that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, for it declares his contempt for all things Christian, but there was so much camp that this idea was not so much realized. I see this movie more than a way for talented Gerard Butler to pay for his deeds before being truly acknowledged and a way for legendary Christopher Plummer to get the public (me and the 5 other people who saw this movie) remembers that he still exists. I actually enjoyed the special features on the DVD as the movie itself.
