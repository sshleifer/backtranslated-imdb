I watched this movie while I was holding the plot, a group of strangers being held trying to find out how they are connected. <br /> <br /> Of course, the institution and premise were influenced by the first (and best) Saw movie and although there wasn't much action, the story moved at a relatively good pace. <br /> <br /> There were comedy relief ions, the shape of the two bickering "Alpha Males" and that was a welcome surprise. anyway) to see Melissa Joan Hart has not acted. <br /> <br /> A few things leave it to me personally. 1. The pedophile was far away so that he could switch on everything from children to bodies. <br /> <br /> 2. MJH's line about her police spokesman, "Get her in this" when he was in fact the least deserving person to be there. He did not know to contribute to the events that resulted. <br /> <br /> 3. The end ..... what kind of movie just ends in the middle of something going on? There was no resolution, no wreath pendant, no obvious end. It just doesn't end. <br /> <br /> For this alone, I dropped two stars from my rating. The first 2 points I would let go but not the end!
