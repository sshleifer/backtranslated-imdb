Some of the almost forgotten movies traveled through poverty in the 1930s. Raised by the magic of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Roles Universal player Lionel Atwill (often a supporting actor in several Frankenstein films) as a couple of twins involved in a murder racket. One kills the victims (stockbrokers involved in a scam) and asks witnesses for the exact time, while the other are deaf and proven to be innocent because he didn't speak to witnesses. <br /> <br /> Of course, where it falls apart, it is as if it were an innate folly, wouldn't they be deaf? Oh, well. <br /> <br /> Atwill does a good job here, and is deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no one else can really appreciate being a darn.
