A little obvious vibration-by-numbers, in which the only possible turn seems to be, is nothing to hide. I mainly looked for English language performance by Isabelle Huppert. It wasn't good, but then it was a strange role. I will not be surprised if half of her contribution to the dressing floor is left with some last minute papers. <br /> <br /> The acting is the least attractive thing about this movie. . Steve Guttenburg looks like he's trying to spot his role with the charm everyone told him he has. There is a sensational stupid sequence in which it is suggested that his sexual ability will help PTSD. This is an uninteresting show. Elizabeth McGovern is more of a sign with true charm and character, but it is a small consolation. 10/03
