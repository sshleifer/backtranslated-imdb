I just hired this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I haven't seen in any movies since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this movie was a big disappointment. The actions of all the parties were bad, except Mr. Lundgren, what was good. Kata Dob√≥ was something nice to watch, despite her ridiculous outfit and makeup. <br /> <br /> The plot is not smart at all, it's a million times repeated in different movies. The crooks were completely stereotypical, and Lundgren's character had no depth in it. I didn't really expect a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately it's not even decent action. Every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the incredible amount of unrealistic books and comics like characters have irritated me very quickly. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it for young children who want a little stripy action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the current average voice of 7.0 with 6 votes should be influenced by someone involved in making this movie)
