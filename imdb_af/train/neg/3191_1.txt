There are movies that are terrible, and there are movies that are so terrible that they are long forgotten and unshakable. Also, lots of violence and bad things (not just cheesy things, you know what I mean) also adds to the mix. What is the result of bad movies with such fast content? Why, "Final Justice," of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of the movie, and it was smelled by Joel and the Bots at "Mystery Science Theater 3000". "Now this time, with Mike taking Joel's place on the Satellite of Love (but with the same clash), the trio has MST3K's second Joe Don Baker movie," Final Justice. Of course, many of the naughty things I've mentioned have been removed for television publishers, but I also want to watch the episode (and "Mitchell") because what did Joe Don hate most? Why, no one but "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have a lot in the neighborhood, check out the store for the uncut band! LOL It happened to another user!
