I watched this movie last night and I am already struggling to remind you a lot about it. The story is about a group of criminals escaping from a space-penal colony. They fly to the Moon in a space-age rubbish bin; when there, they terrorize the rubbish bins that work on the Moon base. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that garbage with low-budget scientific films often involves desert planets or, like this movie, criminals escape from criminal colonies. Why this is, I have no idea. But I can say with certainty that such films are always diabolical. This one is really no exception. It starts out pretty well with a decent credit range and a half-way dance music soundtrack. It then degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller. So little of the result actually happens in this movie that I struggle to write a useful review. When you read it, I apologize for not being able to relieve you of the subtleties and nuances of the movie. For the record, I remember a boring bunch of bad things, a boring bunch of sweets, a few heads and a hologram of a naked woman. Other than that, I struggle. <br /> <br /> If you feel interested in the activities of cribs, then I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I would also recommend it to those who want to sleep their friends and steal their wallets.
