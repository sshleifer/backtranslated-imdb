Not to be confused with the above-average supernatural thriller "The Sentinel". The Sentinel was a great movie to me, and did not lead the consistent action, some critics vowed on the back. For me, it looked as if everyone was Half Fit, and just there to make quick cash because it felt like a TV movie. The Sentinel is a rehash of several better movies, such as "In The Line of Fire", it has no originality in it, and watching Michael Douglas run around, my child feels stupid. The main problem, besides it being the uninvited, had to be the poor fit. I often deduced while trying to view this movie while watching how much running time is over, more than once. Not just the miscarriage with Eva Longoria, who couldn't convince a lick. <br /> <br /> Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a trusted actor, of course, through the movements. He doesn't convince as a man on a run, or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also down. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is just OK, nothing more than that. He was trying to come across like a gruff, but he managed to be more, then anything else, and to be honest, he wasn't so interested. Eva Longoria Parker is fairly mediocre. She was not convinced in her role, and was pure eyecatcher. Kim Basinger is pretty horrible as the 1st lady. She is bored with tears, and her role is a throw-away, more than anything else. Martin Donovan eventually got a big deal, but not enough to make up for me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. The Sentinel is still, another political excitement, which betrayed me to make tears. It's too old, too tired, and most importantly the lack of effort sucked. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
