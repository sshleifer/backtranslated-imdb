not your typical vamp story, not bram stoker or other rice here. a truly original vampire story. These vampires are genetic mutants that do not bother sunlight. they are pure evil. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't perfect. many of the actors are clearly amateurs. the two leads that are playing hello and the rally the vampyre chick is pretty good though. the film is intensely violent which may disturb some people. It is also loaded with scientific detail that will be very difficult to understand and get bored. I was sold on the smart storyline and the couple had good performances. no tell how successful this movie could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution
