A good idea, poorly implemented. While it can count 99% of the SciFi channel's movies, it really does apply here. I like movies where a good story is slowly being unveiled, and I like action movies, and I like all the main actors, so it could have been good. Yet, despite some good acting, this movie fails because of Bill Platt's bad writing and directing. <br /> <br /> Another review made the point to know where you're going, so you can get there. This movie doesn't. It's put together in such a haphazard way that you don't know the words "second concept" in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one scene that is completely unnecessary and can be removed without anyone noticing it. This scene even starts and ends with those who drive a car so you can cut from one car to another and never miss the senseless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This movie also had a strange habit of explaining some details while explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the whole "plot" in front. It also had a habit of murdering early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. There are also some legally bad scenes where the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle with convenient placed "toxic glue" (serious, what * is * it?). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's OK. She breaks out of her "Roswell" persona a few times and makes for a good chick (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he has ever done since playing Q in ST: TNG. This is nothing new. <br /> <br /> Even though I gave this movie a 4/10 score.
