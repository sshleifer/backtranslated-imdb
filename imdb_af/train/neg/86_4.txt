As a Southern Baptist, it hurts me to give an underdated rating to an open Christian movie. There is definitely not so much that I want to discourage the filmmakers from a dissatisfied genre. Still, I must honestly say that "Love's Abiding Joy" is a typical low budget, low key, self-confident Christian movie. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I am friendly), and the editing horrible. As a TV movie, it may be slightly higher than the average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You must have a film about true Christians in you somewhere. May I suggest you go to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration?
