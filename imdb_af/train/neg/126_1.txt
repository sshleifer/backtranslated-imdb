"I'm curious: Yellow" is an exciting and pretentious steam stick. No matter what your political view is, this movie can hardly be taken at any level. As for the demand that the front male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that's not true. I saw R-rated movies with male nudity. Granted, they only offer a few fleeting views, but where are the R-rated movies with gaping vulva and fluttering labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for the crazy cable programs: sklongs swinging in the breeze, but not a clitoris in sight. And the pretentious indie films like The Brown Bunny, in which we are treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a pink trace that is visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before the wisdom of a double standard is cried (or implied) in the matter of nudity, the mental obstacle must take into account an inevitable anatomical difference between men and women. There are no genealogies when actresses look naked and it can't be said. for a man. In fact, you don't usually see female genitals in an American movie in anything other than pornography or explicit eroticism. This alleged double standard is less a dual standard than a well-known depressive ability to enter culturally with the inside of women's bodies.
