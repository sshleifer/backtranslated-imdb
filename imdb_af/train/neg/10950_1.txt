If I knew this movie was filmed in the surprising and accidental Dogma 95 style, I would never have rented it. Still, I took a dramamine for the sea sickness and shot it. I lasted a lot, very, very long forty minutes before I stopped. It's just boring, pretentious twaddle. <br /> <br /> The last French movie I saw was "Romance" and it was pretty good, but the camera was at least stable and didn't have the necks of the characters all the time. I am amazed at the continued popularity of Dogma 95 overseas - this will continue in America at the same time as the next major outbreak of leprosy. (This is called Dogme 95 because it is the average number of times the actors are caught in the eye by the camera.) <br /> <br />
