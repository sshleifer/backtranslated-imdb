This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I studied French at the college and therefore understood all the dialogue, so the language barrier was not a problem. I have to say it's really difficult to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie. There is only one professional actor in the cast and I do not recommend professional directors or writers. <br /> <br /> Although I rated it, 1 out of 10 probably didn't earn such a poor rating. It's just a useless attempt to lower its current overall score of 7.3 to something more realistic. Perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate rating because the movie is a real non-event that is 100 minutes or so long that you will never return. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that I'm sure some college students are breaking his nut and making a movie twice as good and half the length. However, if you want to join the bandwagon that seems to be around IMDb, you might as well go with "Lost Translation".
