This movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever. It is really surprising that something can be done so terribly terribly. But if you can stand the thought, character development and direction, you can get a kick out of the soundtrack that is so terrible that it's funny. The movie begins to become terrible and fast becoming unshakable. Someone needs to give someone involved in this movie some consolation because their career is likely to be ruined due to involvement with this movie. If you finally see this movie or have seen it (I feel your pain), then these words are too late. For anyone else, stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life. Then you can at least clean or watch something.
