I was a fan of Without A Trace from the premier episode. I can't really express my disappointment in the episode last week. This is a real problem that has treated too many African-American families and continues to deal with them. The lack of media coverage that is important in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study. Law enforcement, including local, state and federal, is also complicated. What was the purpose of advertising this topic and then ending it? It appears that television with virtually any subject, except RACE, can handle. It's shameful. Don't go it together or explore it the next time.
