To quote the movie, "It is better not to know. Better yet to forget. Best of all must be abandoned." Oh, the irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical refinements of a Hollywood horror movie, but a terrible bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie, and you feel preached to the sermon. the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's as if the authors cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop TV and a Jerry Springer show. Perhaps, for a movie like The Hitcher, not a horror movie in Russia. The result is that a potentially good environment and some potentially large gore scenes will spill and become silly, not scary or significant.
