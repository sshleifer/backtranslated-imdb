I had the pleasure of seeing this movie early and I thought it would be boring and wondering how they could ever improve on the 1984 version of the Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks, which I thought was pretty good. I was right ... I thought it might have been better ... Sure, there were a few funny moments, but I didn't seem to touch the point. The acting was OK and the storyline was very good. follow the original but i think it could have been so much better ... This movie I want to say is for teenagers and the young at heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex ... it's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over. 4/10 is my vote for this one.
