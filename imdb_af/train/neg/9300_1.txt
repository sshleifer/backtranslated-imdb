Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (without the heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and orgy ... come on!). The acting is ... and there is no play! <br /> <br /> There is a guy who is actually in the bush to look for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a thick, unsuitable clown who can't pass a tortoise. <br /> <br /> Every cast member is stupid and the director puts every click of slashers movies into the movie effortlessly. <br /> <br /> The end is so far the dumbest ever made. Think about it: The guy (ken haert) whose acting skill is about the same as his writing (he is the brain behind this flop) invites a colleague and two of his friends to the cabin for the weekend and kills them. .. Monday morning he goes back to his office, as nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr. H.bert tries to make us believe that this is a family relationship that is going on for generation (his uncle is the clown killer) <br /> <br /> Of course, no police will ask him after his co-worker is missing is not. <br /> <br /> WHAT. <br /> <br />
