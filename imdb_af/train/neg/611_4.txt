Ok, "enjoy" is a pretty relative term, but flexibility is fine when dealing with a James Glickenhaus movie maker's caliber. <br /> <br /> McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous, top-of-the-line movies I've ever seen, without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of unbelief about the film's heroic middle-aged commandos, but how about making a movie in the Philippines set in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact, the only distant character is a good example of 'Victor Argo' as the 'El Presidente'. Oh yes, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso too much like a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying all over this amusing pope to the glory of American imperialism.
