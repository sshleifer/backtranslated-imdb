Much of death happens in nature. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out! But should this be the focus of a nature documentary? What's with this fascination with the gruesome death? Do we really need to see an adult elephant torn by a pack of hungry lions? Or, a cheetah that moves slowly in the passage is no longer! I thought it would be a family-friendly movie! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show the horrific violence in the movie trailers? Were the filmmakers afraid to lose money? <br /> <br /> Then we come in the typical, comical enlightenment mode to see the beautiful Birds of Paradise mating rituals to the most boring and stupid story that is humanly possible. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers believed they were just getting a big first and second scraper on a school holiday! Wow! From the middle to the moronic in a heartbeat! <br /> <br /> If there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings to read this movie review, why not focus on: Animals that actually copy; giving birth; lay eggs; bath; sleep; cleaning each other; socialization; play; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behavior, such as a mouth that breeds; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species call people culture); communication skills; parenting, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or obscuring beauty and why not much more rounded - and rather focus on joy and inspiration.
