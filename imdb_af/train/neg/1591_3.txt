After reading many of the "Next Action Star" reality, TV eps TiVo has tackled these gawd-terrific trips. For a bizarre reason - and I just blamed myself - I watched the whole thing, hoping there would be something * unique in the whole movie. After so much hype about Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" with action lashes, he wants to make him bones on his alchemy. <br /> <br /> First, the only redeeming value of the whole movie was Billy Zane, and even he couldn't write the sliphole out of the scratch. In addition, Zane's performance drops about 2/3 of the way, because he doesn't even seem to do anything other than look. <br /> <br /> Can't make him guilty. The writing honestly sucked. Let's take ideas of "Rat Race", "Enemy of the State", "Terminator", "Midnight Run" and any bad gambling movie you can think of and just repeat. And whose brilliant idea was to have TWO bridges in a row? <br /> <br /> Sean Carrigan, the "Man of the Hour" of "The Next Action Star", shows all the strengths and weaknesses of the decisive directors throughout the series. A one-note, Johnny, Sean plays the stupid, good jock very well, but struggles to weigh the weight of the movie. Honestly, we never really seem to care if he is about halfway through or dying, because Carrigan fails to give a reason for the audience to like him. His stupid-but-happy routine gets old, because there's nothing of the character to root for. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream in comparison with the wood, rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine tell her to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the movie? I do not think so. I expected her to quote Arnie. Her character "performance" can only be compared to the dramatic depths of "Freddy Got Fingered," though not so well developed. The camera loves her in dark, shadow limousines, but in the harsh light of the day, her imagination sucks all the energy from the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five-minute bit than Corinne showed on any part of her screen-time. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Sean has a good look to give a good lead in an ensemble role, but shouldn't be left to do this one solo. It was simply too big of a job for him. "Next Action Star" colleague Jared Elliot may or may not have been happier with some more dynamic characterization, but it's hard to tell what Jeff Welch's lame script did. Someone has to take Welch's iMac away from him before he or she hurts himself or anyone else. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot is easily classified and out of reach, even for the complete safe. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver must be ashamed.
