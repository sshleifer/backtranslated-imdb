I really didn't like this movie because it didn't really convey the messages and ideas that L'Engle brought in her novel. We read the novel in our English class and I absolutely loved it, I'm afraid I can't say the same for the movie. There were some serious differences between the novel and the modified version and it just made no credit to the imaginative genius Madeleine L'Engle is! That is why I gave it such a poor rating. Don't see this movie if you're a big fan of L'Engle's lyrics, because you'll be very disappointed. But if you watch the movie for entertainment (or educational as it was, it's a good movie!
