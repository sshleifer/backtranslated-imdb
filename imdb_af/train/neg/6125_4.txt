This is the best movie ever made by the Derek couple and if you think this is a recommendation, you haven't seen one of the others yet. There are the usual ingredients: it is just as poorly behaved as their other efforts, we can see Bo or dislocate for a wet T-shirt game very often. The story is just fun, and the film takes itself very seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa? <br /> <br /> But it has some things going for it. Bo looks good, the production values ​​(sets, costumes, etc.) are pretty good, and it significantly increases his camp value. In a strange way, it is actually very funny, simply because it is seriously trying and failing.
