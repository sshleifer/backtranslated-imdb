What is this crap? Of course, my little cousin chose it for the exaggerated girl DVD art and title. I decided to see it with her, so she didn't get bored and I was probably terribly horrible. <br /> <br /> First, the play was terrible. They look like amateur shows that read from tickets. The delivery is sub-par and very formative. Scene cuts were terrible. They seemed to have taken it straight out of the storyboard, if there was one. <br /> <br /> Second, the jokes and stereotypes were not original or well-played. formulaic. I can't count the times I could predict the next joke. I have some chuckles from the blatant "subtle" sexual innuendos. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. Come on! Just .. stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupidly funny. It's just stupid. It's like a PG child movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo, vulgarity and violence to bump the MPAA rating. Stay away. <br /> <br /> "Would you like to ride my hunt?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they call it?" <br /> <br /> "You can ride my thing." <br /> <br /> "Oh, I think I have blood on my chair!" <br /> <br /> Bad play, sir.
