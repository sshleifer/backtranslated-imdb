I heard about this movie and knew it wasn't really good. But I started watching the movie (on my movie channel) and was interested. It can be a very big, dark black satire on today's morale in the media. The little featurette on each participant was good. It builds on something I don't want to miss. But when the so-called show starts, everything becomes unreliable, cheap and rather stupid. Here's where the writer added something that would make people think. But instead it is wrapped up and people accept this stupid. <br /> <br /> The end is so bad, I give it a 1. Even though the movie is promising.
