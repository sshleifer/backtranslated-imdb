There are two types of 1950's musicals. First, you have the glorious MGM productions with great names and good music. And then you have the minor league with a lesser-known movie, lesser-known music and two-day directors. "The girl can't help" belongs to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became known and Jayne Mansfield was known to her. Seems like every decade she's part of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is thin as a razor blade and one cannot help but suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or others of the 1950s who appear in the film. If that music calls on you, it's worth watching. If not, don't bother.
