There will be a time when children grew up without ever seeing the only one Bugs Bunny kiss (technically) another man on the lips. There will be a time when it won't be duck or rabbit season. There will be a time when the Tazmanian devil will be called politically wrong. <br /> <br /> But so helping me now is not that time. <br /> <br /> No one really wants an 'EXTREME' version of our beloved Loony characters. Whoever is in marketing comes up with Corn Muts: Corn gone wrong and Extreme Doritos. Obviously this festering should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising, or whatever means they don't know Jack. children. <br /> <br /> I think they are kidding children, depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic performances of all time. This show blames me, and it's not just the dated artwork or the terrible dialogue. They abuse good voice talent, such as Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo, and so many others. The show, like repackaged characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny) is just a shadow of his former, timeless and beautiful self.
