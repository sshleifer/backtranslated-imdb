The main problem with "Power" is that it also indicates, can also add meaningful characters and subplots that absolutely nothing to the movie. It gets boring after a while, and sits waiting for scenes that aren't bound to find something that drives the movie forward. You can probably pass everything as character development, but all are recycled from early plays in the movie, or simply plain and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to bleed any of the support cast. He had cut some of the characters (hackman, the woman) and concentrated on others (Billings). It could have been a huge, hard political excitement instead of a mess that lost a message in a sea of ​​bad writing and acting, a fact that surprised me at the movie. Even Gene Hackman's performance wasn't on the right track. Denzel Washington is the only true actor of the note here. Gears and others have done far better performances elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet must return to the fiery one-man show he did in the seventies (ie Serpico) and stop trying to regain his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". Sidney has not yet worked, and it will probably never. leaves the ensemble dramas to Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
