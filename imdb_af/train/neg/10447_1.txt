I chose to watch this movie because it has a good score here on IMDb. But many people also have very bad taste or someone has set the score. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this was a real disappointment. The movie is exactly as stupid and far-fetched as the title would suggest. There is really no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here it is: it feels as if someone thought: "Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for some reason would be crazy and start biting and things?! "And that's about it! The plot is thin and original. The snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no-one in their right mind would recommend to anyone!). The acting is poor, and all people are amazing stereotypes. <br /> <br /> To sum it up: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
