I recently watched this movie in a film festival. It is the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who has just emerged from a major depression and a single middle-aged woman working in an office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich√©s, taking the 'social' theme of the movie and changing it into a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job, he certainly looks like an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not credible as a working class woman. She looks, trades and talks a lot like a "high-ranking" woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole scene of the movie was very poor. Photography is ugly and does not use well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds most of the times. The comic situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and they are poorly solved. In my opinion, this movie is not worth watching. Just if you really like Pereira's previous movies, you can enjoy this one a bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The movie maker was at the door. I wonder what a director feels when he sees someone running out of one of his films, especially one that was made to please everyone.
