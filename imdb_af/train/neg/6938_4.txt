In this movie, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman. He met her in his restaurant. The younger woman Tabu flirts with him. He doesn't know what to do and asks her. Her response to his invitation is rather strange. It's supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> And this annoyed me about this whole movie. It wasn't that funny. The jokes and the writing were terrible! The only jokes I liked were over the waiter's teeth, but after a while it even started drilling. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a little girl named sexy. It was a strange relationship! A little girl with the idea of ​​an old woman! It was scary! I know someone can be attached to a child, but this man has mature conversations with this child. It didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He must give Amitabh hard, but we all know Paresh, he can't do it. So even the conversation at the end when they were sitting around the table, was even supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I just love movies that are really funny. I suppose I'll never watch this movie again.
