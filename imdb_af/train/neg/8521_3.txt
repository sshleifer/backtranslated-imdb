It does give away some of the plot. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that will teach you the value of Christmas and just enjoy the holidays. However, this is not. It tries to capture the emotion of a Charlie Brown Christmas, there is even a Christmas game, but fails with fearless and easy jokes. Charlie Brown no longer wonders about the spirit of Christmas, but rather wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the movie. Here's one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but doesn't know how to spell Charlie (for some reason he should be in her letter). Instead, he decides to call Sam because she knows how to play Sam. Sally also plays an angel in the drama with one word to day: "Rake!" Rather she says hockey stick (she has). If Sally speaks 12 times (though strange sounds exactly the same) don't kill you, nothing will. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a great focus, but it hardly makes it. Marcy is funny with her answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. She sounds like a boy (who doesn't pour out the rumors) and gets angry when she has to be the sheep in the play (terrible boss and everyone). Apparently she is the sheep every year and is worried that she will forget her lines (lines she doesn't have). She is so worried that she calls it twice, one right after another, and gets the same reaction. I suppose she should have short-term memory loss or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has annoying advice), but hardly much too much airtime. I'm sure Schroeder isn't even in this one. All in all, it tries to be a parasite for the original, but has compromised the message for a few quick laughs.
