(possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> Somebody once told dr. Seuss asked if they could secure the movie rights for his 1957 Christmas classics. How did the Grinch Stolen Christmas. He turned them around and insisted that no one could do better than the wonderful Chuck Jones TV special from 1966. (Also, in mind, his bitter experience was to write the writing until 1953's The 5,000 Fingers or Dr. T). When the good Dr died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, refused to sell the film rights. But with the everyday use of CGI effects to become a reality, Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer that she accepted; She also accepted the farewell to Jim Carrey as the title character. She was apparently satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, who makes one of us. <br /> <br /> The film received a $ 123 million budget (which includes more than just the Witch gate cost, inflation adjustment) extensive makeup, design, and special effects (which undermines /> <br /> somewhat by the rather vague cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that nothing of that money has been set aside to get a better writing than Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Who are much better <br /> <br /> using " budget). While the TV specialist was out of advertising for 26 minutes, this movie is trying to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that as a child he was ridiculous, including a particularly humiliating experience, one Christmas at the age of eight. So it seems that everything that belongs to our poor Mr Grinch is directly due to the Whos. Trouble is, it looks like a pretty long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging the story. It may not look as bad as just the Grinch was a little more ... well, Grinchy. The character dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated, was a cunning fox that undermined his attempt to cut the holiday season by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of the heart. Carrey's Grinch is a harsh, hyper-active and sometimes, a rogue who, when he made the 'Cheermeister' holiday, ruined the Whoville square in anger <br /> <br /> (hopefully the landscape tasted so nice as it seems). This undermines the writing's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos that are so impersonal in Whoville (at least in this interpretation). <br /> <br /> The Whoville of dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest people who knew the true meaning of Christmas in their hearts. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; a clear effort to comment on American consumerism. It is striking <br /> <br /> hypocritical, as the film industry benefited greatly from American consumerism, and if this film contributed to a great merchandise <br /> <br /> campaign. <br /> <br /> The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but important character in the original. The innocent two-year-old who arrived at this turbulent Santa is now older and wiser, constantly asking the false values ​​of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's stance (her one big scene from the original is being restored it seems to be out of character. She <br /> <br /> seems to be the only one who ever wanted to know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, making her a completely different and more annoying character. <br /> <br /> Those who celebrate Christmas should earlier accept a piece of coal in their socks on the morning of December 25, as a copy of this oblong, unashamed, indifferent, boring, gruff, rough attempt turn. classic in a feature film. It once and for all proves that darkness, vulgarity, manipulation and heaviness are insufficient substitutes for charm, white, sincerity and heart. The people at Universal have to get on their collective knees and thank God that this really bad $ 123 million stink bomb would soon be $ 260 million or they wouldn't be here today. Furthermore, Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat made it possible!
