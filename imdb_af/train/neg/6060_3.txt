There is this girl and she runs in the bush, but she ends up at this woman's clinic and she wants an abortion. Her father was in a bus outside and he was angry about it. The entire episode takes place in and outside this abortion clinic. I'm not really pro-choice, but I wanted to have the choice to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw the baby come out and it went into the corner. The part where they did the ultrasound was also pretty funny. I was really sorry for the poor father in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter and I couldn't really blame him for what he did. I don't know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I just laughed too hard and I suggest watching "Pick me up" instead of this episode. It wasn't the worst episode, but it wasn't so good.
