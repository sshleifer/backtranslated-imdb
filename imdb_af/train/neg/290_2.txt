Killer Tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor - you like it or hate it. I find it personal, but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone. The tomatoes are not the same, jokes are lame, even the actors are not so funny. Because this is the only thing this kind of movie is supposed to be - funny. <br /> <br /> So now the plot made to laugh is annoying. They really didn't have to do the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
