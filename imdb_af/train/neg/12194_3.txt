The movie starts with a voice about what the audience is telling them where they are and who the characters are. And that's the moment I started to dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities that any film director has in hand, I really find it a very easy and inexpensive solution to express the situation with a voice that tells everything. Actually, I think voting instructions are treacherous to the film manufacturing concept. <br /> <br /> I hate to hear a voice about where we are, what date we are, and especially what the characters feel and think. I believe a director must find a visual way of conveying the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after the bad influential intro, a very striking movie starts and goes far enough. The lives of a middle-class family and all the members individually are portrayed in a perfectly realistic manner. I think the director has a talent for capturing real-life situations. For example, a father who has to make private calls from the bathroom can look abnormal at first, but life itself leads us to some abnormal situations, but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer about real life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. After a while, the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the storytelling. I really felt that I had a big headache due to the non-stop talking characters. It was as if the actors and actresses had given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogues. It's realistic, but characters always ask "really," etc. To each other, or characters who say no or "you listen to me," ten times when it only says once, it's just enough to let me have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think the play is practicing and book reading scenes are more than they should be. I understand that the drama and the book in the movie are very related to the plot, but I think the director missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes.
