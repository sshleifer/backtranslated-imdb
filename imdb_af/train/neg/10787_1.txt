Let me put it differently: balls. Or, what about bollo * ks. It's really awful, more embarrassing than those trying to satirize. Julia Roberts is a skilled actress, and usually her work is of the highest standard. This movie is so lacking in the direction, even she struggles to watch. Usually she is the perfect professional, but I swear that in her eyes there were signs of confusion and despair. <br /> <br /> The one thing that saved this move was the idea of ​​director (Chris Walken) turning the film into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, the theme has not been explored to its full potential. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was wood, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal had to play at acting. The two talented old Buffy stars had different experiences - Green overwhelmed, and underused Balfour. It's good with Julia just to prevent it from being the worst movie ever made.
