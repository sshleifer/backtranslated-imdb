For my life I can't see why they want to make a movie about the "Jerry Springer Show". It's so incredibly trashy. Some ways, unfortunately, are a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. This is part of our pop culture. I saw it recently in the US. It's pretty bad. I will admit it. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he means as acting. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is in it. She basically plays herself. All she needed was her mistress, Kid Rock. It would have been perfect. So, I would recommend hitting "Ringmaster". Just look at the "Jerry Springer Show". It's better than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
