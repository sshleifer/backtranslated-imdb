If there were some odd Oscar Academy awards, this movie would win it all. It has all the gods, excellent plot, extreme special effects along with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar. Well, this could be the scenario if the world is converted, but it is not. Instead, it's the worst horrible movie ever made, not just bad actors who want to read the scripts of a teleprinter with bad dyslexia, but also extremely low on special effects. For example, the devil costume (which is a must see on the way) is one of the hilarious things I've ever seen. When I saw that red-black so-called monster on the screen, I couldn't hold back my laugh. And on top of that, the funny creature seemed to be transported by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Don't do the same mistake I did. When I checked the IMDB, as the movie was released in 2003, fewer than five voices thought, "Well, it's worth getting a shot, can't be that bad." <br /> <br /> Yes, it can. /> <br /> I'm not even going to waste more words on this movie.
