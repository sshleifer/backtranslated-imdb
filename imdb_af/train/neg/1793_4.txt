An interesting concept of vampirism that has something to do with a virus. (But done several times). Overall the movie is too long and dragging a little. The editing could have been stricter. I'm sorry to hear about the problem with the credits. Maybe the movie is rushing to market. The lighting was too dark in places. But the worst technical problem is the sound. The level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many of the interiors have an echo sound to them, which is very distracting. Or they weren't careful in the recording, or the sound mix could have been better. Too much background noise has come through. It had to get someone to make sound effects for martial arts scenes. The naked sound of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in the battle scenes, the editing had to be stricter. <br /> <br /> The play was also a bit flat. I'm sorry, but if I see the same person writing and staring in a movie, it's a red flag. <br /> <br /> But that was a good effort, so I gave it a 4.
