I am a good guy, and I like to think of myself as a genre tolerant. And I think this means I'm trying to consider a movie in the context of the genre in which it lives. If nothing else, it saves me feeling that I have to say really nasty things about people or movies, which I don't like to do. <br /> <br /> The plot in this one was strikingly obvious, the production values ​​are very low and set, uhm, simplistic. The play has risen from time to time in a "play for high school". My feeling was it was filmed in a day. Tell me it was. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the generation, while reasonably abundant, was fairly commonplace, at least in my copy, a "sound ear" that was inconsistent with the action (climate storm and shouting while lying on a bed and withdrawing a bra?). There was definitely no "rand" - nothing distinctive or interesting, and with surprisingly fast cuts. <br /> <br /> My voice is a "1" then, with the following summary statement: would have been better if the fill strap material at the club was expanded and condensed the rest of the movie.
