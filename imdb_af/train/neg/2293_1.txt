If this series is supposed to be an improvement on Batman - The Animated Series, I think for one, it has failed terribly. The character drawing is uncomfortable ... (Catwoman, for example, looks terrible ...) But what really annoys me is that Batman looks like a kind of wimp that just can't take care of himself in battle. the help of two, even three sidekicks. I mean, he's Batman for God's sake! I know the cartoons, I know Nightwing and Batgirl Batman should be allies except Robin, but still ... so Batman says he needs help from them ... What can't he handle a few bumps? In BTAS, he can undoubtedly hit a dozen opponents. He gets old? Continue ... <br /> <br /> And another thing: I really don't think Batman will allow a kid like Tim Drake to go into battle soon, soon without hard training. The one is irresponsible (and Batman is all but irresponsible), and two, it's not what happened in the comics, if we have to stay true to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - The Animated Series made history, With its animation, its stories and its characters ... It was really a legend of Batman. The New Adventures series has transformed the legend into just another Batman movie.
