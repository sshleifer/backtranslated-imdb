This movie really shows his age. The pressure I saw was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better prints there. However, this was not the big problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film, with only the scarce dialogue being distributed in the most amateur fashion (only a few sentences). Sometimes the characters' backs were twisted or they spoke with their hands over their faces - all in a pathetic effort to obscure their lips and "cleaverly" (?) Hide the fact that the film was baptized. Well, it is true that this Czech movie has to be dubbed in many languages, but to do so was really stupid and obvious. It just looks cheap. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie looks low budget and stupid. However, it is a pity, because there was a grain of a good story - a young woman who marries an older man who is gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to put this archaic rubble. Even with a few gleams of the bare (and somewhat thick) Hedy Lamarr, it is not worth the film to accompany it when it made its debut. Even by 1933 standards this film was a poorly made dud. About the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different Lamarr looked in 1933 compared to the glamorous image that Hollywood created when she came to America. She looks like two completely different people. <br /> <br /> It's such an incomplete outlook and technically inferior movie, I don't see how it got such rave reviews. For technical issues alone, the movie may not be a 10 or close to that rate.
