I saw this movie at his premier at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> Since American Beauty is a movie that has something to say, I was hoping for Towel Head. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, from many films I've seen in nearly a dozen Sundance festivals, Towel Hope is the only Sundance movie I ever wanted to go out early on. <br /> <br /> The worst problem with Towel Chief is that it is so natural with a collection of "challenging" concepts regarding cultural stereotypes, rather than an organic human drama. The script comes from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. The well-known Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good, although it was adapted to the author's political views. This observation is especially devastating for Towel Chief because his political views are so presumptuous and simplistic. If there was ever a time when Towel Head's white male villains, descendants of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc. Fresh, it is over. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, please check any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost everyone judges this movie poorly and exposes the level and manipulative tissue on which it is based. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the amateur judges look easier on bamboo. As you read through the reviews in these and similar sites, you often come across superlatives: "stunning," "breathtaking," "deeply," "shocking," ... It gives me to read it, but it doesn't surprise me. Indeed, I have found many people who are so deeply moving, thoughtful, full of insight into any book or movie that sees racist, cultural, gender or sexual issues. If you are such a person, you have to rent a towel head and move it. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely pass this one on.
