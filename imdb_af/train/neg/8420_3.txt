Despite the excellent role play, it is an imperceptible film, especially from the aviation perspective. It can be a bit better than the big "von Richthofen and Brown", but not much. "Blue Max" remains the best of a small market for the past 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if not taken seriously. It is interesting to speculate what ILM can do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new, high quality WW I-aero movie.
