Where to start ... If this movie was a dark comedy, I'd say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (do you think it was the price I paid it from Wal-Mart), this movie was meant to be a thrill. The only THRILL I got was watching Kirkland's lousy version of Anne Wilkes from Misery Sans's snow forest area. If you want a good laugh, on a rainy Friday night with friends, then I recommend this movie. But if you want to see half of it half properly, don't worry. <br /> <br /> For one, I enjoy crappy movies, the worse the better in most cases. But Wow ... I mean WOW !! The only person in the whole movie who didn't hit it was the little boy played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something.
