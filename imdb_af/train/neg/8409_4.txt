Eddie Murphy for best supporting actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) walks through this movie like a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? It was acting ??? <br /> <br /> This movie is compared to CHICAGO or just about any other recent musical. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for the big song and performance of Jennifer Hudson, I'd give it a NEWS. <br /> <br /> And no, I've never seen the play, so I'm not the typical Broadway vs Hollywood rap.
