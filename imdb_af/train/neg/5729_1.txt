It must be the WORST movie ever !!! The acting is scarcer than the movie. A lot of blood, but no idea where it came from, cuz, they don't even show you the cuts. I can't believe I'm wasting my time watching this movie. We laughed as if we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie. It's a shame for horror movies !!! For one if they are in Asia, why is there a white policeman driving down trash cans? There is so much of a different language that you don't even know what's going on half the time. The movie editor is a joke, my teenager can do better. And if I go to a cinema and that nasty old man works the window that would be the first idea. Don't See This Movie !!! Not to even see how difficult it is, you will be worried!
