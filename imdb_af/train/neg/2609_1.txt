This movie provided NEW or worth it. After I saw it, my wife and I both agreed that the studio just cut it out and could care less if it was entertaining. This is a good example of a concept-only movie - they have a concept about a movie and the other details are unimportant because executives KNOW that it will only make $ the initial concept. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Cruella coming out of jail and going on parole. She no longer hates puppies, but is programmed to worship them. She simply can't hurt a flea. It does not last too long after her release and she is back in her old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters. Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth the bird made me hate - and that's hard because I'm a mortal Python fan. It was clear that he did this because they gave him a lot of money (there can be no other reason). Cruella's low self-esteem, Tim McInnerny, was funny in the Black Adder performances, but here he was completely wasted and unfriendly. And it had cost a few dollars to get Gerard Depardieu, but he was also completely wasted. There were also other supporting actors, but given how poor the characters have written, I try to stick them out of my head. <br /> <br /> Overall, you'll be better off just watching your kids watch TV.
