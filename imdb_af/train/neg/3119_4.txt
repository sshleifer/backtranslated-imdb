Robin Williams delivered a good performance in The Night Listener, as did other role-players. However, the movie seems rushed and leaves too much loose to be considered a "must see". I think the problem happens because there wasn't a strong enough relationship between the caller and the Gabriel Noon (I had to play it that way, because IMDb wants to automatically correct the correct spelling on "Nobody"). The movie runs a little over 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes it seems as if Noon is looking for Pete Logande, the boy's caller. <br /> <br /> This happens after talking to the mysterious caller. about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not too deep in depth, mostly consisting of how it goes ... I'm in the hospital ... why did your boyfriend leave ... etc. In the book, the child is about to shrink and the ruin is over and the reader understands why he is looking for this boy, as soon as he finds out the child disappears and thinks he can be a hoax. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Noon is obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is wondering why? Since there really isn't a strong enough bond between the afternoon and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller doesn't exist? <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between a book and a movie, but those calls and the relationship were critical to establishing on the screen because it forms the basis for the rest of the movie. As this doesn't happen, the movie falls apart. <br /> <br /> It is surprising because of Maupin's other work, Tales of the City. When made in a mini-series, it worked beautifully.
