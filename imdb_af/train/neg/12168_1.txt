This movie was bad from the start. The only purpose of the movie was that Angela wanted a high body number. The acting was terrible. The murders were very bad. As when Ally hit that toilet, I thought it was in the deserted cabin. But when the end of the movie came and Molly and the other man were in the cabin, you saw Ally, so Angela had to go in to get her. The part I really got was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar ring and confronted her. One was terribly perceptible and two why would you not just turn around and the bitch type?!?!? Then, when Molly was chased by Angela if you had the neigh why not just turn around and stab her? So stupid. This movie sucks ...
