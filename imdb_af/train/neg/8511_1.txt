I couldn't follow, invent or understand the story for my life. As the plot progresses, it remains incomprehensible. I'm going to guess and say there was a pre-production story / plot problem that was never chosen. The producers can never separate the many details that the novel or any novel has the time and space to create the other idea, namely to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer's pursuit of the police. They ended up with too many things happening in a banned movie time limit. Really because they had a solid role, a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography. In fact, a well-made movie that one can enjoy and relax for a few hours.
