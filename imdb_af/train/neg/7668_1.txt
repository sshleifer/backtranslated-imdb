The moment the forward started, I knew we were in trouble! The premise is at best ridiculous. The story line was even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> The act was stiff and the actors felt a sense of inexperience. You expect more from Slater, Reid and Dorff. Lines were delivered as from a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid, but she was VERY incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a lousy movie to increase their return. <br /> <br /> The continuity was throughout the film. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I want those ninety minutes of my life back. They can keep the money, but give me the time! What a waste.
