I'm probably one of those who actually read Stephen King's book, the one on which this movie is based. After reading this excellent work, I couldn't wait to see the movie version of it. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is displayed on a game. The main purpose is to survive. But he's not in an arena. He is released into the city and must escape the game show (I think you call them), which doesn't quite match the movie characters. This point of departure has built up a lot of tension and suspension and has largely ended with the climax. The movie was absolute rubbish. There was no film quality about it. I completely respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he has one mess with this.
