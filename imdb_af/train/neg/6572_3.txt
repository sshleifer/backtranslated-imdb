In my opinion, this movie's title should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". A few months ago I went to a show of this movie and was disappointed with the outcome. Although I appreciate that the director made a film about the 442 men - a topic that has long been deserving in the film industry - the acting in some parts of the film was rather outdated. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were all great. However, the director should never put him as the main character in the movie. Sorry Lane, you're just not a movie actor. Stick to what you're good at - acting. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also terrible. She never had to play a voice and her appearance was incompetent to the part of a Miss. Nisei Queen to play. There were other young actresses in the film that was of course beautiful and whose performances were wonderful. Why didn't they throw that roll? Another big problem with this movie was his performance. The Japanese-American soldiers don't seem to be fighting German soldiers. Don't let anyone wait. Granted it was a low budget feature, but since it was a war-based movie, isn't it important to show some are really fighting? This film was a worthy effort, but certainly not worth a huge spread.
