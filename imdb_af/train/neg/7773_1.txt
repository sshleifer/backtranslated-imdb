This movie sounded like a good starting point: 9 people have their fears to win one million dollars. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and really useless like the dancing scene. A few scenes are just an excuse to show the camera on female body parts. The acting is bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their horror. What is really strange is that at the end of the movie it looks like a 5-minute western, and in the end, the twists, of which they were several, do not make sense to the rest of the movie. It seemed the director had just added things because he thought it would look cool while ignoring the plot of the movie as far as possible. It just didn't make much sense. The only despondent thing was the old people dancing in the hall, but it didn't even come close to making the rest of the mess.
