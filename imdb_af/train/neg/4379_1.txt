<br /> <br /> Okay, I rented this movie while I was on the bed, jumped on pain killers, and let me say it didn't help the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a man who buys a car because he's going through a midlife crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him. One day, his wife decided to borrow the car. Since I don't want to spoil (not that there is something to spoil), I will take your imagination from the "Zany" (and I use the word lightly) antics that follow. <br /> <br /> I had to fight to stay awake through this snoring a minute's sleep of a movie, and I'd like to say that if you venture into the movie store and think it's adventurous, Don't do it, it's a waste of the movie it was printed on. <br /> <br /> Then again I could be wrong ...
