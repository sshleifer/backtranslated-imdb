It would have been the gay peer for Gone With The Wind, given its epic length, but it pleased him to be a huge chain of empty episodes in which nothing happened. The characters are unidimensional and have no other development in the story (there is actually no story) than looking for and kissing each other. It is a pity that an interesting aesthetic suggestion, such as having almost no dialogue, is completely wasted in a movie, but does not bother to investigate the psychology of its characters with any dignity, and to have real emotional resonance. range. In addition, it makes it an "art" film by using the worst naive clips of the movie snobbery. But anyway, if someone with his heavy banality can identify, I think it's good.
