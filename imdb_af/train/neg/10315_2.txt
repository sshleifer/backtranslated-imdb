I can't believe people thought this stinking trash was funny. Moving the efforts of humor under cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There is something about Mary', leaves little reason to keep to the end. Certainly, Cameron Diaz is very beautiful, but it will never be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is of course very talented, but the movie is a loser. <br /> <br /> Not once were any of the screens credible. The shots were bad time and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers must be kept away from making movies at all costs. I look at IMDB to see what they are working on, so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The bonus is the one time I smiled. It's not like I'm in my opinion immune to humor or alone. My wife also hated it. The next day we saw Rush Hour and we laughed at ourselves. This movie just knocked.
