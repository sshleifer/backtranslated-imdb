I understand that this movie is made for children and as a parent I have put through many movies that do not really interest me, but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view how it is received by my children. Parents should be encouraged to participate in their children's activities, and to monitor the quality of entertainment they see should be something that addresses adult audiences at some level, even in children's films. Disney has always understood it, so it's so hard to understand how it can allow such a complete piece of clothing to carry their name. <br /> <br /> Technically, the sound processing is terrible and all dialogue sounds overblown and unnatural. Personally, I hate it, but it was double awful, as the dialogue itself seems to have been written by a 12-year-old for a school project. The "play" reminded me of a school game and none of the children's actors had any emotion in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short movie. <br /> <br /> Now, before I come across as a video geek that measures a children's movie with a mature yardstick, one thing that can even save the worst child movie can be a positive message. It's far from me to determine how a message should be delivered as long as the right one is. Let's walk through this movie to see what messages are being given: <br /> <br /> If you are lost, don't worry, you will find your way home. <br /> <br /> Approaching wild animals without any fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition just because you "know" what you can. <br /> <br /> And my favorite, the final message in the movie: <br /> <br /> It's okay to obey authority figures and do what you think is right.
