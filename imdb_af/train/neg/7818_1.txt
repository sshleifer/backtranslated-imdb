I don't usually walk out of a movie, but halfway through. This movie promised something else, but I thought I hadn't seen it before? Destroyer warning! Back in 1, the spaceship crashes and lands on earth, well, all these years, with a super adult on board no less, this thing can still burn and crash! What can't this advanced civilization look like? For an industry so liberal, we get another Woody Allen movie, no blacks! Superman runs to save people, make sure he bumps into Europe and the US. Please do not go into dark areas. Maybe I could stomach it about 30 years ago, but now.
