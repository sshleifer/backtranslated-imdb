Maaan, where do I start with this god horrible movie. Bad bad storytelling. I don't know what the director thinks when he made this movie. Namaste London was quite a nice movie to be honest. Although the soundtrack was good. But in this one. Oh my good. For a movie that is supposed to be a musical one. The songs are so bad. AR Rahman had to be the music director. <br /> <br /> Given two major actors had to do a much better job by the director. Although the first half sucks, the last 30 minutes of the movie is OK. Performances by Salman and Ajay save the film as a total disaster. <br /> <br /> See if you can't do anything better. The last good movie of Bollywood I watched (and I watch a load of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
