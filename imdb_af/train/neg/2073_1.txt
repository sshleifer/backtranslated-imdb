Oh my god. Oh my god, I can't come over this movie. It was god-fearing. horrible, terrible! Don't even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cents bin. No, avoid it at all costs. I warn you !!! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? Make a joke. Really get what sounds like some new Barbie doll. Super Women? Make a joke. It was so fake fake fake. The people of the town didn't even care that there was a blonde blonde just making her a fire around the city. Ohh big! Jesus, was it just me or did it? movie looks offensive ?? I think what you need to be a super hero is a couple of double D's, blonde flowing hairs, no glasses and a fancy suit? <br /> <br /> If it was romantic ... as God, I don't know. It was terrible, if love meant taking someone to an art show and having sex in a bed and in the air. Like what they absolutely love! <br /> <br /> It was pathetic, everything went too fast. First, the man was single, as he was G-girl. When they broke out, he dated the Hannah girl. And it just goes on. <br /> <br /> I have to say this movie made me wonder. How did they get it in theaters? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
