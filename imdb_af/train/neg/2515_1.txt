This film is an abomination and its making was considered a capital crime. <br /> <br /> One of the great mysteries of movie making is why no one ever made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful puzzle. It's a story of a very gripping riddle, nice old-fashioned romance and dry English humor. Why did the makers Richard Gordon of a Scotland Yard policeman have to change to an amateur detective, the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant, changing the part of the main storyline about the murder compensation and circumstances of Gordon's battle for the save accused, etc.? These producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book, should write the original script themselves and not rape another person's product.
