If you watch this movie, you have a grudge against the movie, the director, the producer, the actors and the person who told you to see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, to give your name and face to this poor excuse for a movie. It might have been more scary if Japanese actors only spoke in Japanese instead of acting in English. I wanted to boo when the movie ended ... a real disappointment to all the hype on TV and movie fans promoting this lame cashier. Sarah Michelle didn't really need anything at all to make this movie ... She just did her frown skills. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
