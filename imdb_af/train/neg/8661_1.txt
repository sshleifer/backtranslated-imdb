the movie looks as if the director was forced to make this movie by a gang of terrorists. it should actually be called dino-crap. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good about this movie. even the actors are not worth a penny. Don't waste your time watching this movie. the director has to be shot in the head because he has the mentality to create such a bad movie. I mean, isn't he ashamed to look at people's faces after they see his movie? The dinocroc seems to have been powered and almost cut and pasted. And this is the same old story. Man plays god. create a creature. it escapes and is happy to eat people. And finally, a pretty girl and a man in a sleeveless shirt have to kill it. bla bla .. you will find the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
