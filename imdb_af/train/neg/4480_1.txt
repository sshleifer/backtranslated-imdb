Let me start by saying that I didn't even watch this movie with high expectations. It was recommended to me by a mediocre friend in movies, and "MTV" was worn on the cover, so I didn't expect much. What I expected was a tear, too dramatic but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, let me start by never reading the book. or watch any other versions of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was my main gripe with the movie. It is unnecessary through God. The head girl is fairly mediocre, but compared to the rest of the role play, she is Maryl Streep. The chief "Hero", Heath, is just terrible. He can sing decent sounding songs, but it's about it. His play broke the "sad" moments by being so bad at points I just burst into laughter. The Isabel girl was also pretty godly, and the brother was just a flat character played by an actor who couldn't show emotion. And when he tried, it failed. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor to play Edward, although it was clear that the direction was bad because he didn't even hear what I saw him. Oh, and the dad wasn't half bad, but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time that I hardly remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself wasn't very good. More breakups than you can imagine. Predictable story (To the end, which I hardly understood). EXTREMELY unilateral characters with no real depth. Not just interesting or compelling, nothing we've never seen, much done, and nothing worth looking at here. <br /> <br /> The end is supposed to be a tearjerker. It did nothing of the sort. The end is not built up, it almost feels like an afterthought. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY the end actually happened, what when they explained it to me, I had a look at my face of "Wait, when did they say that? What?". Never a good sign. The editing was probably the worst I saw, though I understand the blur-fade-outs are being made because it was originally made for TV, but it's really no excuse. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is just garbage. I'm a sensitive man, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this crap, not even close. Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tearjerker, look elsewhere.
