I read the book a few times and this movie does not follow exactly as it should. I can leave this slide, it's a movie. However, I have serious trouble setting up the movie. No one said to mention that this movie and the book on which it is based is based on real events that happened in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the village where this movie is based. Firstly, the "small" neighborhood talked about in the area is the third largest city in the state. With a population of about 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Secondly, the landscape is wrong for the movie. Grand Island is in the Platte River Valley. It is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me crazy to see my hometown treated so badly. It was a real event. Large parts of the city have been wiped out. In the book they talk about the biking from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I think you can if you don't mind getting a 15 mile ride each way.
