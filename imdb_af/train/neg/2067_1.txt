Straight to the point: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most indifferent, indifferent and straightforward horrible movies ever made. This "comedy" is so empty of anything that looks like a white track that it's almost incomprehensible that it's even made. I almost said because after all, fans are everything. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even 'good' bad or 'pleasant' bad. To place this movie on the same level of entertainment as "Plan 9" or "Robot Monster" will be a crime for those movies. Movies like you can actually watch and get a kick out. But this film is so bad, so bad, acted and written and so incredibly old, that there is no trace of "camp" or "schlock". <br /> <br /> Although made before Saturday Night Live, comparisons were probably inevitable. I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this movie is worse than the worst SNL skit you can find. And man, it's BAD. Just to leave the men's viewers, Shapiro throws in so many breasts every time, but poorly-filmed breasts of 1974 won't excite any of these days. Surely this film is so poorly made and is such a sneaky outing. I doubt they were excited in 1974 too. <br /> <br /> A man named Ken Shapiro made this movie. I swear to God, any ten-year-old with a video camera can have made something funny and smarter. It's just unreal - it's really an amazing movie. The "jokes" and "gags" are so childless that even little boys who leave father's pornstar tonight will not laugh. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie one thing - the very last order, the "dance man" series, where a man (Shapiro) on the streets of NYC is dancing to a song is easily the best thing in this terrible movie. Not that the "dance man" series is so good either - it certainly has its moments to not be smart, as Shapiro immediately tries to fill in the time for the whole song - but it was actually a bit viewable. The part of this series where the police started dancing with the man is the only trace of smartness in the whole movie. No wonder Shapiro lets this series last - again, while it's not that nice, it just saves something else in this "movie." <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie is such a complete piece of crap, it is incomprehensible as to how a real person can be so straightforward. The name of this movie should be "Ken Shapiro's Craparama." It's incredible that it's made, but many really talented filmmakers can't come in. However, I will say that I bet the NYU geniuses will love this movie. Total refuse.
