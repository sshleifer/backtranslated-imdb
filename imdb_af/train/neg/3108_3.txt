Another chapter in the ongoing question, what happened to Mel Brooks' sense of humor? It starts out pretty well, with Mel as Trump-like mogul Goddard Bolt ("You can call my God"), who accepts a bet that he can't stay in the street for 30 days. But at the moment the movie touches the streets, it becomes a pathos-laden mess, with sometimes "funny" pieces falling apart. (Mel sees a black kid dancing for money and trying to make a vaudeville goat and wing, Yuk). Leslie Ann Warren is nothing less than wasted. The worst part is the movie's musical number, in which Brooks and Warren do a silent dance to Cole Porter's "Easy to Love". Brooks' musical parodies are usually the highlights of his movies; here he plays the whole thing straight, like a dance edition of an aging guest star on The Carol Burnett Show (which started his film's co-author Rudy DeLuca).
