Wow ... OK. So, after reading the little fact here, I decided I had to see this movie for myself. This movie is surprising. I stopped watching. I strongly recommend cleaning a cupboard instead of watching this movie, you'll be more ghost / entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's low budget with bad acting. <br /> <br /> Whoever gives this movie 10s is completely wrong and should be ignored. <br /> <br /> I'm in no way affiliated with any of the other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> Many, many BAD MOVIES.
