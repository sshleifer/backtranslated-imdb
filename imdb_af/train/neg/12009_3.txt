I had a video of the thing. And I think it was my fourth attempt to see the whole movie without sleeping out. It's slow moving, and the idea of ​​a mid-Atlantic platform that was revolutionary at the time is just a big yawnaroony. Aside from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast is very forgotten, and it's just in action at the end that things really get interesting. When the water started to spill over, it once woke me up. <br /> <br /> But give the man his excuse. Nobody can hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He doesn't wrap it between his index and middle fingers like the fewer mortals. He held it in his fingers, pointing the old pearl brown. There are a few scenes in this film where the smoke moves towards the sky against a dark background and looks very artistic. But it doesn't say much about this movie than anything that impresses you is the tobacco smoke.
