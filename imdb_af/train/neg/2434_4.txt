Realistic movie, sure, except that the characters don't seem to be scared. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he doesn't look like that. That's why I don't like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger is playing a soldier again. No good excitement, realistic sequences. Not always shooting, that's one good thing. Well filmed. I hate the helicopter sequence because only one terrorist kills almost the entire marine crowd ... I give it ** and a half out *****
