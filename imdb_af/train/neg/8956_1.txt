Pretty disappointing predictions for the first two movies, it doesn't have the tension of the first or the interest of the second. Concentrating on the guys running 'the cube', it basically takes away any tension in the cube, because we just don't care about the characters. Much of the movie is just boring, and it really gets awful with the launch of the glass eye superiors and the green-eye-mad marine. After that, however, it only falls into the excessively unintentional hilarity. However, the end is appropriate, and it is tied back indirectly in the first one. The writing is terrible, the acting mediocre at its best, and the direction is unimpressive. A lot less follow up.
