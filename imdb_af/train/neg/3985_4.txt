Flat, ordinary thriller about a female woman who deceives all those who she supposedly loves to raise her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the fraudulent Tracey, married to the doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy's name Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) emerges as the resident surgeon, the trouble is not far behind him. <br /> <br /> Script failed because it did not develop the promising premise carefully into an effective, seductive thriller, and the serious lack of character motivation, background and development left the whole show. None of the players is able to generate interest in their level characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose own inexplicable inquisitive Andy is impossible to believe. The poor director Harold Becker tried to generate an impossible dead project and couldn't make any of it. By the time the "secret" of the plot is revealed, you just won't mind. <br /> <br /> At least filmmaking looks like Massachusetts. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
