... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario was seen for at least two thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centered third part of the movie gave us a taste of what would come in this extraordinarily self-destructive mess. Moretti says he feels a need to make this movie, but does not want to, while the viewer feels that he has to comply with it, but doesn't really want it either. A film about Italian politics and elections can be fascinating, but it's not the movie. At one stage, Moretti and his friends stand outside the Communist Party headquarters and discuss the interviews they are preparing to enter with Party leaders, but this is a feature of this film we never see from them. Involved with Moretti's political ravages are the events that led to the birth of his son, and subsequent home cinema shots with the baby and later the baby Pietro (the film pulls us through a few years and more than one election period) . We expect to see a definite order or consistent argument, but they never come. I am one of the doubts that I can ever put the patience through a Nanni Moretti movie again. He manages to make an hour and twenty minutes look like an eternity.
