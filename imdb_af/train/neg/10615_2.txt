Strangely, the less than 2 hours can look like a lifetime when sitting by such a flat, uninspiring, fool. If a story is as personal as it was called Sally Potter, would you not expect a little passion to pass through in her performance? Her acting was completely loose and I had no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango screens, which had to be the nature of the dance. Instead, it was uncomfortable and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story about the movie is frightening. As such, Sally Potter would have been wise to allow a better actor to take on the task rather than dropping her passion to her own sheep quality.
