It's amazing that a font like clich√© and totally absurd can make any screen, even the small one. The dialogue in this movie makes Catwoman look like a high culture classic. Billy Zane plays the bad ass harmony game, Elvis personalization, armor, martial arts master who has played the life of an absent former soccer player, played gambling addict by the winner of NBC's Craptastic show, " Action Star ", played. His performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way. The film takes place in Vegas. And since people play poker, the authors felt it was a perfect setting for a movie about a man who tried to survive 24 hours against a ubiquitous rich player who offered his target $ 2.4m if he could this day. And so the hunt follows. A hunt with insignificant explosions, construction works, scary cinematography and one-liners containing the word "bet" or "gambling". The female winner is also thrown into the mix, but for whatever reason I have no idea. Oh, but don't worry. "NAS" fans, the losers also make their memorable cameos. The surprising end will turn off your socks if you like predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver has to revalue its decision to sell even more. I wish he could give me back that two hours of my life.
