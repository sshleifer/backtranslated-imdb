I am usually not one to say that a movie is not worth looking at, but it is certainly an extraordinary circumstance. The only true upside of this movie is Cornelia Sharpe, which looks attractive and the fact that this movie is VERY short. <br /> <br /> The plot in the movie is incredibly boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film. None of the characters are even internationally interested and there is no reason to care for anyone. I'm not sure why Sean Connery agreed on earth to do this movie, but he definitely had to pass this one. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see watching this movie is if you're a die-hard Sean Connery fan and just want to see everything he did. Keep this one for the last time. <br /> <br /> Well, if you see it with a miracle despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.
