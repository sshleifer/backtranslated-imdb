Mulva is placed in a sugar bowl by Teen Ape. When she wakes up, she is much warmer (the parts that Debbie Rochon played in this sequel), and out of revenge for those who did wrong. As the subtitle and boxing art implies, it is indeed a discount on the "Kill Bill" movies, but it is a Chris Seaver movie. This is an incompetent satire (and I use the last quarter extremely loosely). saying it's better than the first movie, but the truth is that I was so drunk with my ass when I saw the previous movie I can't even hope to compare the two at this time. But I had enjoyed it since I bought the successor. (See when I'm drunk, I like the lack of a better word, full and total crappy movies.) There are a few happy moments (very little), but I remember Bonejack, though. Well, at least a little more than an hour, it's very quick about what it's worth. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> DVD Extra: Audio commentary by director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon, and the Lbp gang; Second comment by Seaver; 31 minutes of featurette; Lloyd Kaufman's 6 minute tribute to low budget photos; Fake 2 minute syrup commercial; stills gallery; Promo trailer; and trailers for: Mulva "," Quest for the Egg Salad "," Fiilthy McNasty "1, 2, & 3;" The Feral Man "," the Bonesetter "," Midnight Skater "," Demon Summer "&" Splatter Rampage Wrestling "
