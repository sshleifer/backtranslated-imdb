If I accidentally stumbled across this script in text form, I would read it and maybe laugh. However, I will not laugh at the points in the movie where the director wants me to laugh. Although I'm still not quite sure where it is. I don't care if it's Woody Allen, this writer can't write dialogue, or at least he can't write with knowing dialogue and then draws performances from actors who can even laugh at most of the clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I'm an art historian, I'm looking for a work in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> OK, so this explains the fact, but honestly, do you know of any art historians who would say it? How would you answer? <br /> <br /> "Actually, an art gallery? Who would have thought it?" <br /> <br /> The entire script is littered with the kind of fool-intellectualism I would not have expected from such a respected writer. I admit that I had no knowledge of Allen's other work, and by judging this one, I do not want to start learning. The characters are ominous, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really writing bad character? You are the judge.
