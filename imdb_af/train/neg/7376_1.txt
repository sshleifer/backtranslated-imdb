Steven, what did you do, hit a whole new layer. This is weird because Steven's last movie shadow man is directed by the same director. Shadow man was good it was diabolics bad so bad, it wasn't even funny. Steven is scarce in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo look and when he is in the movie, he is called half the time anyway. As for the action, let's just say the oz wizard has more action than this garbage, there's almost no action in the movie and when it finally arrives, it's boring, depressed, badly shot, so-called action scenes. Seagal kills anyone other than his over-films where he goes one man's army, that is, under sieves 1 and 2 and external wounds. the plot is so confusing with so many pitfalls that it sometimes does not make scenes. flight of anger be better, what a shame I have 5 pounds of garbage on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time
