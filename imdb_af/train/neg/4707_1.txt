OMG it was the painful experience of my life to see it. I can even finish what happens to Nick. Their best thing about teenage Nick is Drake and Josh and it's about to get out of the air. The children's songs are very annoying and so are the children. My little sister wanted to see the show, because she loves anything that usually comes to Disney or nick, but after this show she said "one of the worst ways I saw so boring." My little brother actually fell asleep and I envied him. In short, if your 3 year old without brain activity, you will enjoy this show, otherwise the channel will change.
