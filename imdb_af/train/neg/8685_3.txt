Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I expected a bit of cartoon with lots of fun (but repeated and exaggerated) Bush jokes. Apparently, I had to lower my expectations even more. <br /> <br /> Writing was absolutely pathetic. Aside from the Cheney Chicken Eating joke, and a few giggly little swipes, it was really boring and unfriendly. <br /> <br /> The animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen-year-old Flash project. It's scandalous that they use Macromedia's product for it because it can do so much more. <br /> <br /> I don't like Bush much, and I enjoy a Bush joke as much as the next guy, but it was only half an hour swipe with the President with several painfully incredible moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did so much more with That's My Bush. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, hit "Lil 'Bush" and buy a copy of the short-lived comedy "That's My Bush". You will thank me.
