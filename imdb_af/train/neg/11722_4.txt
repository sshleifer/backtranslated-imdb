The problem with THE CONTRACT is summarized on the opening scene. The CIA wants to kill an international terrorist, so contact the black ops killer James Dial. The terrorist appears at the Old Bailey Court in London, asking the question why they want to break down a terrorist if he spends the rest of his life in prison? He's either out of traffic. Didn't the CIA have a chance before being arrested? If he gets a chance, he gets an innocent verdict and then kills him. There is no logical reason to kill anyone who will bring life into a maximum security prison. <br /> <br /> Since the premise sets the story up, an audience can choose to ignore the plot hole, but the assault itself throws fuel on the fire. Dial's colleague is killed by a police officer and the taxi they are driving in the accident, but Dial manages to escape. So the police were close enough to shoot someone, but too far to understand someone from a car accident? The film of this kind of plot-connivance. Later Dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun to him and said, "This airport is surrounded by armed hairdressers," but Dial easily manages to escape without explanation. The whole film deceives his audience by relying on things that are never explained. It includes an important supporting character called Emily Day. Why does she help Dial, though he has fled? Your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty bad thrill and isn't caught up in the "big name" throw. Wesley Snipes used to qualify as a movie star, but killed his career by playing in more and more unobtrusive films. Charles Dance also appeared in Hollywood's major productions, such as LAST ACTION HERO and Alien 3, but again he is best known for the performance of DVD tickets. In any case, he plays a movie. Lena Headey can be big screened in the film, but they will definitely not put the CONTRACT on their CV.
