This movie could have been very good, but be brief. Cheesy special effects and so-so acting. I could have looked it over if the story wasn't so bad. If there was more of a background story, it would have been better. The plot centers on an evil Druid witch linked to this woman who gets migraines. The movie goes on and on and never explains anything, it just stops. Christopher Walken has a role, but it is completely pointless, just like most of the movie. This movie has potential, but it seems that some are really bad for TV movies. I will avoid this movie.
