I didn't know anything about this movie and I walked out in half an hour to know everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am generally a pretty person, but if someone told me they love this movie, I'll probably never talk to them again. Anyone who enjoys it is probably a very dry, hermit type personality. I will also include that they think they are pretty intelligent, just like the self-centered bags that make the voices for the movie. I know everyone has different kinds of humor, some may not be like mine, but it's good; However, I don't think it covers a range of humor. This movie is as flat and sowing as Wes Anderson's thoughts. Go in and get ready to walk out; It's also best to get your money back.
