I've seen this movie years ago in a group of traditions of Fast Forward Film Festivals, where we'll rent a bunch of B movies and vote for the worst. <br /> <br /> The night we watched it, it was best rated due to the plot and fun costumes. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a stupid, fast-paced movie, watched under the full understanding that you're looking at low-budget fluff. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances. This movie will leave you your own point on you. <br /> <br /> It made enough of an impression on me that I actually tried to get me. Hands on a copy for a few years. <br /> <br /> If you watch bad movies, it's a good choice. This one is fun, and I remember jumping music ...
