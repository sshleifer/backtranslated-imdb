"Fred Claus" somehow avoids being this year's "The Santa Clause" by having at least a little more amusing moments than Tim Allen stares, but that doesn't mean it's enough, it's a trip for the theater. <br /> <br /> Going on holiday, it's confronted and sentimental. But actually, this can be the least of one's concern, as "Fred Claus", who boasts David Dobkin ("Shanghai Knights," The Wedding Crashers ") at the helm, contains virtually no real moment as It is a line between a Vince Vaughn drill vehicle and a fuzzy Christmas movie, but it's not much of both, and with a cast consisting of Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates, leave it Vaughn plays Fred, Nick (Giamatti), older and estranged brother, who once left him and their parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after having had enough to keep his parents' favorite of his younger brother and sister Nick grows up to Santa Claus (and as the voice tells us, the time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint), while Fred becomes a Yuletide reped man in Chicago who remembers a difficult time to remember his girlfriend Wanda's (Weisz) birthday. <br /> <br /> He's in trouble with the t and had to call his younger brother (who was at least a decade older than him) to sponsor him out of jail. Nick agrees, but only if Fred agrees to help with the North Pole toy package. Fred agrees unwillingly, but his cynicism clashes with Santa and the elves' ever-cheerful nature, even if an efficiency expert (Spacey) looks at the toy factory activities, but just too happy to shut down the entire Arctic business if things fail. /> <br /> The film, as said, has moments, but the stuffed hard-length extends over the duration of the movie. In between are lots of Christmas movie clips that were better treated in, say, "Elf" and the attempts at sentimentality are just as enjoyable as last year's fruit cup. <br /> <br /> As usual, he brings his coarse charm to the table, but Dan Fogelman's manipulated writing keeps him doing his thing. Giamatti, under the bad fat suit, brings a lot of old charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately he has to play second violin for Fred. Spacey brings his game face, but his turn usually ends as illegal vapid. <br /> <br /> Eventually, "Fred Claus" becomes a forgettable film earned by those involved. Sure, there are worse ways to start the season at the theater, but there are definitely better ways.
