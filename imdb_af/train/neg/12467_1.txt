This movie was slower than Molasse in January ... in Alaska. The man who has been previewing must be given an award for management to place each of the 30 seconds in the preview. I had to wake up the people I have woken up several times. After it was over, I felt bad about waking them up. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is approached with the hope that something will actually happen, but nothing will ever happen. It was easy to prevent people's motives, and the characters were flat and uninteresting. By the end of the movie, you just hoped everyone would die. Everyone walks around either despicably, small, or miserably, and usually all three. <br /> <br /> Even worse, we've watched a minute or two of the additional features, just for kicks and giggles you understand. And all we saw was that people were sick about how socially aware they were. If they were spending the time on the movie they were packing on their backs, it might be worth watching. <br /> <br /> I was brought in to expect the excitement of '24 '. I have a lecture on social awareness through the blue eyes of the sandman.
