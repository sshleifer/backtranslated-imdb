"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is a mess. The play is terrible, the atmosphere doesn't exist and the characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this piece of scum is that most IMDb users have given it 10. It's really scary. No horror, no tension, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted, the supporting role is also terrible. Yes, some people may enjoy this photo, especially a mainstream society, but hard-hearing horror fans or gore dogs will not enjoy this piece of crap. Personally, I hate horror comedies, but I prefer to watch serious horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Last House on the left". In my opinion, a real horror movie is supposed to be frightening, excessively bloody and disturbing, without stupid humor, which usually destroys the whole concept. This one is not scary, is not sorry, is not even funny as a comedy. Don't waste your precious time.
