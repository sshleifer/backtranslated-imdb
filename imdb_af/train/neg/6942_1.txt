This thing is really great. There are no characters with weight, they all fly in the BG's. The Motion Capture is a good toy, but this movie demises that you really need people who know animation to make an animated movie. The machine can't do anything good. If you see it as a bizarre movie, you will have fun to have continuity errors ... IN A 3D FILE !!! It's funny to see how the princess dress moves like a thing with different phisics. You need animators and 3D animators, not data entries that know 3D programs. Note the intersections, such as the elbows, how they lose volume and become deformed. The person who made the character design (a very good one) probably knew when he / she watched them move, 'so you can't say they come to life.
