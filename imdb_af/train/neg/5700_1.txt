How this movie scored 6.7 is out of faith. It does not earn anything better than a 2.0 and should clearly be under IMDb's worst 100 movies of all time. National Treasure detracts from national intelligence and just another assault on American audiences by Hollywood. Critics have told about plot holes that you could drive through a 16-wheeler. <br /> <br /> I love the justifications because this movie is good ... "Nicholas Cage is cute." Come on people, no wonder people in the world think Americans are stupid. It must be the stupidest, most insulting movie I've ever seen. If you want to see a real movie this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. Unfortunately, National Treasure has much more publicity than these awesome movies. I bet most of you read it, they didn't even hear from them, as some have not been widely released. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a great actor - when in real movies. He has repeatedly seen Cage waste his incredible talent in ominous films such as Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is used well as in Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation, he is an amazing actor. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - I'd rather feed my hand on a wooden sniff than I am again subjected to this visual horror.
