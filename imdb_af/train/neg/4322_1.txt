Read on and notice - you can save 88 minutes of your life (it was all!). <br /> <br /> Ceaselessly pale, this film sets out to produce a modern small-town American Christmas fable in the Capra style. If failure ... completely and absolutely fails. I tried to think of one good thing about it and can't. Let me mention some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People don't die, they get eternity as immigrant workers in Santa's factory. Angels are actually old cowboys sitting in trees. Santa can bring people back from death (if you send him a good letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot. I won't spoil it for you, but there should be some light in movies if it can only contrast with darkness, but there is none. Even photography is dark - snow shows at the end of a freezing, cold, damp and miserable everywhere. <br /> <br /> As you may guess, the movie has a happy (quirky) end. What a relief!
