A movie that strives to be much smarter than its creators is capable of producing. the film turns and turns by miriad plotting "surprises" on a desperate attempt to guess the audience, the appearance of the plot with steaming scenes they thought would help. <br /> <br /> James Belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual effort and just sleeps through the movie. The same goes for the other "actors". The plot is pretty stupid and tough. which itself is not such a crime, but at the end the tremendous plotworms become very tiring and boring. <br /> <br /> However, the movie can generate some interest in the drug. a lazy watch that is worth a very boring day, but don't cry if you miss this one. <br /> <br /> A Lame 4!
