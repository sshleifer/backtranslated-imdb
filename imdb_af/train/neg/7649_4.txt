Joyce Reynolds seems a force for the role of Janie, a boy-crazy sixteen-year-old in small town America, who relaxes her steady guy for a visiting soldier and blows on the cover of the Life magazine. ) everyone in the same week! Non-stop barrage of wreck cracks, retrenchments, bumps and unfinished items such as Janie's little sister-bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (as the little girl) who constantly cries to the sassy child, Janie's mom involved in the Red Cross was, and Janie's father tried to write an editorial report on the problems with today's teens (such as parents, stuffed, sexless Edward Arnold and pert, Ann Harding sounds, an unlikely couple, even for 1944; he doesn't look like able to make a child much less pregnant not raising two of them). Nomination for an Oscar Oscar (!) For Owen Marks Editing, Warner Bros. follow it in 1946 with "Janie Gets Getroud". At that time, Reynolds had been her co-porter - she was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 of ****
