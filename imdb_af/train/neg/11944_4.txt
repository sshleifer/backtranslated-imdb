I hired this movie and thought it was the sobering-sad 1959 version I saw as a child. It wasn't. So I was very disappointed with what I felt was marginal acting, poor character development and especially the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... the "Dog of Flanders" is just a cute "one side" of the movie. Get the 1959 version!
