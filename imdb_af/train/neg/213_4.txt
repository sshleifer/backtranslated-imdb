Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love twins, (sorry for the poetic license, but it's not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately, badly said. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes, the picture looks overcrowded and meticulous. The sound needs more attention (usually in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and does not help the action. About the acting ... sorry, but the best actress is the landlady. The other is unfinished and cannot convince the viewer. The play is poetic when it has to be realistic and realistic when it comes to being poetic. This is a photo for adults, told by the children. Just bother if it is very curious.
