I had the clear accident this morning catching up with two of 2004's worst movies. First, the incoherent CGI-driven emptiness of The Chronicles or Riddick, and then the embarrassing quarters project known as Greendale. One costs multimillions and the other costs pennies, but they are both bad. Really, very bad. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I'm not the world's biggest Neil Young fan, but he has contributed to classical songs: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were Young compositions) Harvest and Mirror ball, the man wrote some very good songs. Unfortunately, there are no good songs in Greendale, and precious few goodies, and the movie they are built on, are really cringeworthy and simplistic political slogan. Completely without merit as art and insignificant as polemical, Greendale is best left out. Buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to Young's bank account.
