I will say one thing about this movie: there are no lulls. You can't be bored to watch it. The problem is that it is too intense. There is too much action and it needs lulls! This is the risk you take in modern action movies. You want it interesting, but not overdo it. It's very exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Although the play is good and contains some "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it's still the feel of a B-movie. The best part is the dialogue by Scheider: the only "A" part of this B movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strict Rambo mentality, but has some notable scenes. One in particular was a very innovative landmine scene. It was memorable. Not enough of the other scenes was to make it a custodian for a long time.
