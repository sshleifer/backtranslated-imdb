A real disappointment to the great visual master Ridley Scott. G. Jane tells the story of a first woman ever going through the clear training at the Navy SEALs. The training is the hardest and most difficult one as the instructor in the film tells the main character O'Neil, played by Demi Moore. There is no specific message or point in this movie, or I could not reach it properly. It may be a kind of a statement of female rights and abilities, but it falls under the tired scene and dumb rifles at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand why Ridley doesn't use so much zooming in the last-mentioned rifle in the desert? It looks so stupid and annoying and almost amateurish, so I really want to know what the director saw in that technique. Looking at his latest movie, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle tones (which is enough) and they are very intense and skill-oriented. The entire final in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more than stupid and brainless shooting and killing. <br /> <br /> This is Ridley Scott's worst movie in my opinion and there is no significant touch of this great director. Still, I'm glad I saw it in Widescreen format because there are still many great scenes and samples of Scott's abilities, but they are very few in this movie. <br /> <br /> A disappointment and nothing compared to the classic (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on ..) of this talented director. So I am forced to G.I. Jane 4/10.
