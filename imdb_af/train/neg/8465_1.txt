I can't believe how terrible this movie was. I feel magnanimous even referring to it as a "movie". The acting was flat, the editing was terrible and the plot left many important questions unanswered. The point of departure was OK, if not original: a small group of aliens live in the US and try to take over humanity slowly. But it goes off fast. How can they convince a "man" to accept a stranger as his wife to make their alien human hybrid what they need? They show a larval stranger, but never show what it does. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce perfect skin on an industrial scale. They throw in the mandatory large alien monster with teeth. The end was almost too painful to watch. I suppose I'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner has anything to do with it. How can he say with the big alien monster with teeth: "Stay away from him your son from a b * tch" with a straight face? It's a long fall from his Babylon 5 days. Avoid it at all costs.
