I really can't understand how anyone can give this disgusting movie more than 1 star. How can you have such a delayed movie, where all the animals are abusive? I don't even want to suggest the ominous pain that innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those terrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" would they not torture for such a way, or just for money? I tell you, that director is spiritually delayed, or he's just a monster with a heart of stone. Or both. He really deserves to cut off his hands and burn them alive. <br /> <br /> It contains several terribly barbaric scenes that can cause shock, especially for sensitive people and children: A real frog is sharply alive, fish are sadly mutilated and thrown into the water, a dog is beaten , birds are thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This movie is more than horrible; It must be the worst and most delayed movie ever made, along with another, called "Cannibal Holocaust" or something. I will never watch or buy any movie directed by this heartless monster. No one should waste their time watching it, especially if there are many LOTS of movies in which all the animals are misused. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, only a few people liked it - which is, of course, being the worst movie ever - so it wasn't successful. I hope it will realize the delayed director that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence will never be praised by REAL animals, and he will set up all the abusive tones in his next films. I really believe that everyone receives, but what they give! There will be a day when all the delayed and cruel '' people '' will feel the same pain they have ever inflicted on others. <br /> <br /> However, this is probably my only negative review. I don't usually comment on a movie if I don't like it, but this time I just couldn't keep it. I had to speak the truth because animal cruelty must stop!
