I always loved the account because of its great writing and characters, but lately I feel like it has changed into an emotional type of soap. If you look at promotional photos / posters of the account, you will now see two of the officers hugging / kissing or dealing with friendships, while promotional photos of the bill have long been about crime. It proves that it has changed a lot from an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap. When I see this, I feel like I'm looking at a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I have to say I still like the bill because I am interested in police work and that sort of thing, but I miss the greatness of the bill. I would rate it as 2 out of 10 because you have to admit it has been completely destroyed by the people who brought the account. <br /> <br /> As far as writing and characters are concerned, both of them have been descending, most of the great characters are now gone (though some still think I am) and I'm not saying the newer characters are poor or anything is, because they are definitely not, it is just that they do not have the difficult appearance, personalities and writing lines. who had all the old characters because most of the new ones are currently involved in stupid relationships and family problems. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the only police programs on television is the bill today. will always be a very interesting thing to look at, but as I say, it has lost a lot of its uniqueness (if it is the right spelling) and it will now be a terrible, unreal TV show. classified. <br /> <br /> Recommended to look for a good laugh about the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10
