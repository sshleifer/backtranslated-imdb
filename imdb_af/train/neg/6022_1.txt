I get a little tired of people abusing God's name to preserve their own elevated view of the world. Well, I do not reject the idea of ​​Armageddon or the arrival of the antichrist. I reject the notion that only certain people who live really good lives (it seems that they are mostly white Christian children) go to Heaven The rest of us must suffer from a millennium of hell on earth, just because we are not good was not enough. God may be a judge, but I don't think He'll measure every level of goodness. Give the Creator some credit.
