Please let me forget. Please. Please. It's the worst movie I've ever had to watch. I see the film as an insult to my brain as well as my back that both suffered from me and put on this movie. I still have to see what damage it caused and my ability to complete sentences. What a rubbish! And don't start me over the acting ... Someone please help me forget! "Weird Science" - come back !! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I'm "proud" to give the first 1 here at IMDb ... And I voted for hundreds of movies ... Many of them c ** p, but it's so bad I can't even believe it. Somebody actually got the idea and thought it was worthy to become a movie? Does anyone actually read the script and decide to produce the movie? Someone reads the script and audition for it? Someone saw the movie and decided * not to put it on a shelf to collect dust forever? * These * are the questions I want answers to. Not the philosophical question about the tree in the forest and you know ...
