I tried. I really did. I thought maybe, if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy his movie. I know that, after I saw O FANTASMA, I felt sick and almost angry at the core, but some of the reviews were pretty good and in favor, so I was like, "What the hell. At least you don't pay. $ 10 at the Quad. Give it a shot. "<br /> <br /> Sometimes it's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthesia to relieve the horror of so much pain . I often wonder if it would not be better to go back to my childhood and demand that my former bullies really let me know. On other occasions I often think that the world is really flat and that if I go far enough away I will not only get away from it, but it will be clear and that an evil, loving thing with my 9000 tentacles and my life - and a few French fries of 1995, still sleeping in my esophagus. <br /> <br /> Is there any reason for Odete? I don't want to say at all. It's just that her Creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness (one that Alex Forrest looks like Strawberry Shortcake) doesn't just look creepy, but flat out of the sick. She decides to abandon her current boyfriend, because she wants a child and believes they are too young. She later crashes a funeral of a gay man and - gets it - to get closer to him, she is pregnant while she falls into the worst ways in the lives of the dead mother and lover. Oh, of course she shouts like a beanie and does not throw herself, but a good three times on his grave. And there is this ridiculous business that she becomes progressively "Pedro", which constitutes some poor-as-bad tea explanation that love knows no sex. Or something. <br /> <br /> I want to say she's like nuts as a can of cashewnose, unsalted. But then again, so is the director. And I, to give this a chance. At least the men look good. Other than that ... not much else to see here.
