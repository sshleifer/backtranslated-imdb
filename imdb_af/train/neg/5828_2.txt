I couldn't agree with another reviewer named Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems totally boring and uninspiring "faithful". He can produce eye candy (and I like candy), but his pretense and fundamental artistic emptiness just reduces all the joy. <br /> <br /> I fear that many people do not distinguish between similar (but only on the surface) works of Jodorowsky or even more linear filmmakers such as Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love Odyssey 2001 and have never been bored by the final shows ...). The kind of art that M.Barney's makeup adds confuses and rejects the viewers who might otherwise appreciate experimental theater. Typical empty postmodern "conceptual" art. And look at his interviews. I just buy it, sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I was never bored to see Alejandro Jodorowsky's movies, while Drawing Restraint 9 was a great disappointment. Especially while offering the possibility of being something, actually telling something in a non-linear unorthodox way (such as the beginning and the great choreographic dance and preparations for the ship to go out of bark as an object of value (if it were feces) The "pearl" divers ... Everything can build a great surrealistic movie with a little content, but it doesn't have that terrible pretentious scene of dress and false tea ceremony ... How in vain and false and philosophical pretentious but empty can it get? <br /> <br /> I have some beautiful paintings, but the whole movie has become so boring and pretentious and completely empty and fake that it made me physically sick . <br /> <br /> And it doesn't have a good pace. I like slow tempo movies, but it was just boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and fake - so I was just forced to witness long scenes of artistic vanity ... <br /> <br /> That kind of movies mom just the art and spiri are in my opinion dead. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
