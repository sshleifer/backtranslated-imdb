This film has long been scanned, that it has become a very sought after item ... the indignation, the riddle, etc. It all has to be a great movie production, but eventually fails in every way. It's a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror movie, a lame erotic movie. <br /> <br /> The 2 CD DVD contains a beautiful booklet with stills, interviews, bestiality essays, etc. as well as an extensive interview with the more than pretentious director. For those who have heard it but have never seen it, the package will look fantastic until the film is really seen. disk 1 contains the processed film, poorly translated in English but with good visual quality. disc 2 contains the cut of the director, in a terrible transmission, in French. <br /> <br /> What can I say about the actual animal? A puppet of Kermit would have been more effective and shocking.
