This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like a "homework" for a movie class. It misses the point when it comes to the "message" it is trying to redirect. Characters are about exaggerated, poorly acting and like a plot. Well, that's completely ridiculous. The cover shot is what makes me think it can be a decent movie, the fellow actor is attractive and it's about it. Morals of this movie: Never cover a movie through it! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you'll be much better off than me. It was painful to watch and frankly, I'm surprised anyone would spend money making and distributing it!
