Don't see this movie if you appreciate your mind. At the end of our collective show, my friends and I estimated that we lost every 5% of our brain during the course. The only person involved in making it was not clinically insane, was the set designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. I now realize that instead of a sense of aversion, this film has grown a deep hatred in me. I hate this movie so much, much. <br /> <br /> Some people may say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If it just doesn't take itself seriously. But it does. The plot is a heated version of the Blade Runner-esque universe reported with the cheap rubber suits so common in bad dinosaur films. The dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless, but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg doesn't even try, but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like cousins ​​on the soul. And whether Juliet Landua will once again set her up with the British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the refugee commissioner. You will sink into an increasing sense of disbelief and disillusionment. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only to anyone who wants to see the depths of stupidity on which man can fall.
