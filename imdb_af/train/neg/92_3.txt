Really, I can't believe I spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a big zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It really had zombies? Was I wrong! To be honest, the movie had moments. I thought it was cool when the man got his head, but it was about it. In general, I think it would be better to slide a razor blade on my bare nuts in a vinegar barrel and then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see a little, but I had to look at the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see it. Buyer beware ... unless you are in masochism.
