R O B O T J O X. <br /> Burn the master. <br /> <br /> Grotesquely horrible. <br /> <br /> No end; no closure. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Replace "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate this totally unprocessed, unedited, unregistered, unfocused, unmade thing of a thing called "Robot Jox" - and I just found out. They made a second one!?!? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) to hate their movies. This mess of a thing makes those movies just bad - not terribly terrible and grotesque like this thing. This is the only movie I've ever said - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10,000 people out of 10 found this comment helpful.
