Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this movie, and had to be forced to play a Mexican party or he would have been suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Presumably, after Dodge City's success, Warners followed up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends like Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh, and the ever-present John Litle. They made the big mistake of offering Miriam Hopkins a love affair for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer to really do things because she has proven one thing, and she can't sing. The story wasn't bad, but Bogie also missed it. It turned out to be a poor Western who remained, and on a low budget, but in fairness color wouldn't have helped.
