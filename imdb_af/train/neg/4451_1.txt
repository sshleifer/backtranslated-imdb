This movie was probably as silly as The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Case in point: <br /> <br /> 1. In order to expire her drowning, Roberts secretly takes swimming lessons at the YWCA. After her "death" the YWCA calls her husband at work to give their condolences. HELLO how did they find his job number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving town, she drops her wedding ring in the toilet. Days or even weeks later her husband finds it in John. Does this mean that the toilet has never been flushed? <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation is given on how she pays for her maternity care in the retirement home (as she did it back from her RICH men). <br /> <br /> 4. By the end of this tiring movie, Roberts suspects that her husband is in the house. Instead of running for her life, she rather goes to the kitchen to see if the cans are neatly stacked.
