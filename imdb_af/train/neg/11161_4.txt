"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Targeted by: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> With: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez, & Darius Rose <br /> <br /> MPAA Rating: "PG-13" (for some rough action, and rough humor including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Say what you will do about it (I know some people despise it at no end ), but I've always thought that "Napoleon Dynamite" was a funny movie - not the brightest brick on the wall, but a funny movie. Jack Black is also a very funny man - sometimes annoying, yes, and overwhelmed by adolescent audiences who practically worship him, but funny. There was seldom a Jack Black comedy that I didn't really enjoy. So, I was delighted to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of "Napoleon Dynamite" and Jack Black will work together for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only discussion was that the plot was a bit too thin. Unfortunately, one discussion made the downfall of the whole movie. This plot, as a shave on some such a show as "Saturday Night Live" or possibly even Mad TV, would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, the plot runs for too long over about one and a half hours and this one-joke comedy falls flat. <br /> <br /> Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a godly man of the Lord. Nacho (Black), now the monastery's cook, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances are low, Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It looks like the perfect movie for Jack Black. See what he did with "School of Rock". Well, to my dissatisfaction, this plot is almost completely destroyed by offensive and brutal humor that is just taken from the heart of the movie. Again, it is Hollywood's way of showing that they feel teenage audiences just understand jokes and foolish humor. Of course, for everything I know, maybe it's the general thinking of teenagers, so many people have enjoyed this movie. If you look at an obese woman who looks like a mouse over the floor, it will definitely make people laugh, but don't expect to get an award to put it in your movie. A seven year old can make the same joke. <br /> <br /> The performances in "Nacho Libre" are actually good. Jack Black proves that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic, worthless lines ever to come on paper. Unfortunately, this movie just wasn't enough for him. It gave him nothing to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him. I have never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera yet, but now I can say it, not only she is talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women who have ever donated my face. She just snapped into the roll and it worked wonderfully well. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Nacho's stupid, Esqueleto, laughed at me constantly. He did a very good job and it was very effective when it was with Jack Black's partner. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, doesn't have many lines, but what can I say, I just enjoyed it. He was wealthy. The rest of the cast did their job. It's a pity they were wasted on such a subpar movie. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" just doesn't work. The plot is stretched too much. The heart of everything is polluted by moronic humor and sickly jokes that just don't work. I rarely laughed and if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast. And that leads me to the bright side of "Nacho Libre": yes, the throw. This throw was just fine, because there was a better word, they were up. They all clicked, put together excellent chemistry, and pumped as much life as possible into the flat writing. After Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dynamite" thoroughly entertained me for the whole movie, I was surprised to find myself so bored with "Nacho Libre". Something lost here and I haven't yet understood what it was. All I know is that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie and yet, because of its cast, it is totally worthless. There is a little reason to look, if only to watch Jack Black. But if you're not a fan of Jack Black, avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black, but I've finished this movie and with this review. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: Yikes! It's Jared Hess's surprisingly disappointing sequel to his hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite". <br /> <br /> Overall Score: 4/10 (C +)
