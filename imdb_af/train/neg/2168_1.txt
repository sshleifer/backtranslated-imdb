After reading another review, I thought this movie would be really good. I enjoy the "B" movies, but it can't even be classified as such. Photography is probably the only half way decent thing in the movie. But the editing remained a lot to be desired. It was very choppy and staccato. Whoever picked the music and sound did a terrible job. The music was terrible, especially something atmospheric or scenic. If the play was better, they could have pulled off the movie. Unfortunately, I performed better in porn flicks. If you want to see a "B" vampire movie, see "Blood bindings". You'll be much more entertained.
