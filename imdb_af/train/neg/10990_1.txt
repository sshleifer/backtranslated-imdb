I finally watched this whole (very long) movie because I was fascinated by the mere stupidity and naive of it. It seems hard to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would willingly participate in this vessel. But maybe in 1968 were people really * so * naive? The plot looks written by a confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda. There is a superpower conflict and the Russians are really good guys. The Communist Party Secretary-General is a nice and spiritual man who suddenly sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner. priest of a Siberian yellow. The priest then quickly became the pope through a series of coincidences. We are allowed to see the secret Vatican papal voting process, which is portrayed in the most hilariously pious form you could possibly imagine. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the communists in China have achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of their hunger half. land to death. To solve this slight heap on the relentless shining path to communism, they want to begin a nuclear war (to justify Western capitalist wealth just to the poor workers of China). Our good old comrade general secretary is worried and calls the Pope just before his coronation to ask him to mediate peace. They meet with the Chinese leader comrade Peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy. You will roll on the floor as you laugh about what people thought in 1968 the Chinese looked like. Comrade Peng requires Western capitalists to pay (which is logical, capitalists should not always pay for socialists' socialism) and that the Pope should also sacrifice for the general altruistic cause of equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> So when the pope is crowned in Rome, he promises the entire wealth of the Catholic Church worldwide to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. And so he saves the world of the nuclear holocaust. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, there are also some small subplots, which unfortunately provide little to release this incredibly bad movie. I'll give it three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn looks rather unlikely as a Pope. He is much more acceptable than Zorba the Greek.
