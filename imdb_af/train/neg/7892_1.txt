It started with an interesting starting point. I always like civil war and ancient secret societies. The more the movie progresses, the more I realize it was indeed a B-movie. In the second half it quickly became a C-movie, then D, then F, then: "I wish it wasn't a rental so I could put it in the microwave!" I can't say the acting was terrible in all cases, just the most. The script, but ... I never read the book. Perhaps the book is well written. The script is written by a 10-year-old. It was ridiculous, the dialogue threatening and uninteresting, the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer. I hated this movie very much, as my wife did. I am a Christian and I have no problem with movies that promote or support Christianity. This movie resulted in a great disservice. Terrible, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I strongly recommend Superman 4.
