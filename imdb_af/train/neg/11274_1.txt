Just so that your fellow movie friends get the point about this movie, I decided to write another review. Last time I missed a few things ... <br /> <br /> First, the writing. Secondly, the acting. Thirdly, Jesus Christ, who thinks they are making such a piece of garbage and then expects us to enjoy it if there are no redeeming features from the beginning to the end, unless Joseph Fiennes is finally blown away into a very inconspicuous climax ! <br /> <br /> I can't believe I wasted my money on it when I gave it to a homeless person or a sheriff or something <br /> <br /> Did you get the picture?
