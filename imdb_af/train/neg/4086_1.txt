I came to this movie with high expectations. I was aware of Greenaway's work and 'The Tempest' and was interested in an adjustment. I only wanted to switch off after ten minutes, but felt that it would be unfair. There was an incident of a storm, but where in your mind do you think of a little boy about a toy boat? It's symbolic of what? I continued ten minutes to pull my finger over the 'off' button, somewhere something will catch my interest. It's not Shakespeare, it's not cinema. There is a time and place for that, but I will not waste my time and there is no place in my studies of Shakespeare. After twenty-five minutes I gave up and it was the end. I then read all the comments on this site and the pretentiousness of the movie is only matched by its defendants. "It's a painting ... then put it in a gallery", "it's a ballet ..... keep it on stage then". Shakespeare can be done intelligently, and the plays are performed to mass audiences. They were accessible, and this version helps a wedge between Shakespeare and the general population in general - and I don't think the Bard will be happy with that.
