By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto couldn't save this turkey. I heard that the movie was originally titled "The Treasure", but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws". I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; The fact that they had to be included in this "thriller" was supposed to sell tickets. Didn't work. Every time something happens in the movie, the ship's crew becomes one with a certain type of beer that was just introduced when the film was made. Do you think beer might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it more obvious? The only time someone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing. It's enough for celebration.
