I looked at this knowledge, almost nothing of it, except the brief description I read here. After looking at it, I was originally going to say the director shows promise, but it looks almost amateurish. Then I looked at the other things he did to see if it was his first or second movie, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill. Fear Dot Com. He missed the mark on both of those movies and it was the same with this one. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible too, can anyone just fall in love with a girl because she is beautiful, but has the mind of a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some footage I enjoyed near the end, but overall this movie is pretty awful.
