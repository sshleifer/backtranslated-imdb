How many centuries will pass until the Japanese / Asian horror movies leave the long-haired ghost woman shtick? They did manage to snatch a million times 'Ringu', and often it worked well. It just shows that originality is not so much a requirement in the horror genre (or that I am very uncritical and easy to please?). But this time I found myself a little restless, a bit bored. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, with its absurd 110 minute length. Compared to many other Japanese horror movies, OMC has no atmosphere and excitement. Plus, the end is confusing: it doesn't make sense at all. As for the ringtone, Miike could come up with a melody that is more effective than that memorable thing. Although it's played a dozen times, I can't even remember it - that's how frightening it was. He speaks of Miike, for him it's something of a commercial venture, so if someone thinks they might get the perversion of the "Bijita Q" or "Audition" kind, they waste their time.
