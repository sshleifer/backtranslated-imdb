I can't believe some people actually like this. Yet they call their Batman fans. Even going as far as saying it is better than BTAS. What it is not. It must be plagiarism for them to use Batman's name for this piece of crap. It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole premise of the show is "" if you can't defeat, someone gets a bigger weapon to help you. "" Batman is not just about weapons. He uses his batarang and grappling hook and Batmobile, that's it. He doesn't come up with some new engineering technology every time he can beat someone. I don't know where hell has the idea for a Batbot. or whatever. They destroyed all the villains. Mr. Freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a small criminal who has fallen into a cryofree thing. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a silly costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 foot hat. The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, which makes the Dummy the centerpiece for the character. They even had a stupid idea of ​​making him a giant! wtf? And the two worst character changes are those of The Joker and Riddler. they turned Riddler into a gothic / retro teen freak. and The Joker to an acrobat with dreads. He looks like a bob Marley wannabe. they completely and completely destroyed batman, even moreso as b & r! I wish I could meet the creators and / or writers and animators of this show so I could beat them in the head with a metal ball bat.
