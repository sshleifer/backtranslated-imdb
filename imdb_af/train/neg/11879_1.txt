My wife and I rented this movie because some people drew parallels between them and "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB even chose it as a "recommended" option if you liked the "Office Space". <br /> <br /> Now I've probably seen Office Space 15 or 20 times. I love it. This is probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Sharp, humorous and with characters reminding me of people I've been working with for years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space" because it is both films. That's where the deal ends. We've probably gone the first 50 minutes of HT, and that has benefited the doubt. Hope, no, * pray * that it will be better. It didn't. We couldn't take it anymore and stopped the band. Thanks, it was a free rental. I would have been if we actually paid for it. We have to be compensated because we have to sit down. Now, since we haven't seen the end, maybe it comes together wonderfully and saves us ourselves. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Haiku Tunnel is so bad, it's hard to believe it's ever been manufactured. The movie is so rude, it's painful. Don't post the friggin letters already !!! The point of departure is asinine. The jokes are terrible. We had as much as the "printer didn't work" scene and had to stop. We couldn't take it anymore. This film is a portrayal for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of office space ...... don't waste your time with this maze. 0/10
