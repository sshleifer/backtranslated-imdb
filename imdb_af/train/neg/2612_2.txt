The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was his original song and costume design nominations for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less impressed with this movie. In this succession, Cruella DeVil (incidentally, Glen Close pulls out this role very well) because of her good behavior released from the hospital. She loves all kinds of animals and closes all her fur. From there we just wait until she starts crisis. Soon, she does and tries to make the best dress fashion world, of course for herself and good Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I found it all tough but a child's eye funny. It's fair because the target market takes me, children under 12. Very good fun for kids and families, but didn't do much for me. * from *****
