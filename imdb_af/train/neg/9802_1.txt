Many people here say that this show is for children only. Hm, when I was a child (about 7-9 years old), I first watched this show. It was disgusting to me. I talked to other kids about this and certainly other shows and know what? That was the measure of disguise, when we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (or on TV or something else), we said, "Uh, just like Power Rangers" and laughed. <br /> <br /> And before I visit this site, I couldn't imagine that there are any MMPR fans. It was so strange to me that I decided to look at it again and try to understand why people like it. I didn't enjoy it. But it came to me: maybe I didn't have enough imagination? It may be. However, this argument is not enough for me to rate it more than 1 star.
