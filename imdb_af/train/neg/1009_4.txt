*** OVERVIEW MAY MAKE MORE SPOILERS *** I will make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounds more important and had some top actors in it, such as Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad can it be, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that could lead to corrupt police at Edison's police force. LL Cool J is Act, a policeman in power on a special power team called F.R.A.T. (First Response Assault Tactics). He is with an "on-the-edge" bad cop called Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene we see Lazerov and Akte on a few bank robbers, but at night they break a few guys doing drugs. I don't want to give away too much, but things get bad for the guys who do the drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) goes to a trial with Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects foul play and, with the help of Ashford, investigates some that become ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins Ashford to try to bring the corrupt police to justice. <br /> <br /> You can tell from the outset that Freeman and Spacey's performance is pretty dark. The only person who gives an all-out performance is Dylan McDermott. He is a full nut in this movie and made a believer out of me. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. He says every line in the same way and shows almost the same emotion. He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The movie starts with some good action, but then drag it through the rest of the movie. The end is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. I'm sitting on Ebay this weekend.
