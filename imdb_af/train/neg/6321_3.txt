I can't imagine anyone in a million years wanting to watch this movie. Not because it is one of the worst ever made (it wasn't), but mainly because it's about 20 years old and o-so-out of the mainstream. I tried to find out where I had seen an actor before and it surfaced. So, yes, a child stops playing small league because he doesn't like nukes, it requires great media attention and a quick solution to the cold war. The end. A fantasy, surely, but one so hurry that it will blush John Lennon. Since terrorism has replaced communism as the -ism that frightens hell, this movie really has no relevance, except when (unnatural) looks back in those times. The writing, acting and filmmaking are also undeveloped. The reason I was as tall as I did was because I watched this movie about 50 times while I was 5-6 years old and had a little bit in my heart, but now I realize it's not do not completely cut mustard. So, if the law of large numbers is true and someone finally decides to watch this movie, realize that there are much better ways to spend your time, but also much worse. (I will now withhold a John Q. tirade.)
