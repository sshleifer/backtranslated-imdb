I had to turn it off after about 15 irreparable moments. <br /> <br /> I was hoping it could improve, <br /> <br /> What I saw was badly acted, directed and written. <Br /> <br /> This movie should never be released directly onto DVD. <br /> <br /> The main character who is a bride and groom is from HELL, a great ice sculptor falls on her to kill her. She was such a rebellious person. I wasn't even sorry for her. She waved there in a kind of heaven and was still repulsive. I left shortly afterwards. Eva Longoria portrays her and I hope I never see her again, she can't even act. She is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd an actor who also can't do wrong, was also in this dud. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer a teenager) is also present <br /> <br /> I like comedies, BUT don't stupid people about dumb people. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
