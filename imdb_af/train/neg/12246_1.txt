*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If you review the movie based on the premise alone, one might think that you're looking at an average animal-oriented horrorflick. The plot is as follows. A group of documentary filmmakers go to an island to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing. (I live in South Africa, so it's released as "Blood Surf.") It looks like it's a somewhat interesting idea, which, if further investigated, could slightly improve the movie. However, this is not the case, as the movie's movie is low due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a fairly large saltwater crocodile. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is when one is eaten by the crocodile, which is a regular occurrence in this movie, no one looks like a damn. Most anyone who did in the movie was just to rape the victim in a scene that was meant to be, but just become ridiculous because the dialogue in this movie was extremely dubious. Another thing that is really annoying about this movie is the fact that they introduce characters that are completely redundant for the movie itself. They present a lot of pirates that can only be seen to add another 10 minutes to a gracious short film. <br /> <br /> The acting can be said to be mediocre. It would probably have been much more impressive if they didn't have such a terrible writing job. All in all, there is not one person who has made a huge impact on me. Every single person looks as though it were a subtle caricature and in this way none of these actors made any impact on me. <br /> <br /> The crocodile itself is said to be large, over 31 feet and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious neck of a crocodile they provided to us in the movie . The crocodile's death at the end of the film is so ridiculously false and impresses that it turns your stomach. With a big bravado exclamation, the hero of the movie announces that he has a plan that apparently falls down a hill and drops the crocodile at the bottom of the hill. <Br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that this movie is one that should be seen for you to believe how bad it can be. What looked like a good idea at the time was due to a horrible script and an overwhelming sense of low budget, all of which served to create a truly horrible movie.
