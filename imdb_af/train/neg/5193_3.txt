Another teasing action / adventure movie from the Quinn Martin Productions factory. Roy Thinnes plays captain Diamond Head (Mr. Head for you), works for his G-Man handler "Aunt Mary", looking for "Tree", who is on a mission ... well, just look at the movie. <br /> <br /> This one earned and received the full MST3K command. As the boys and several judges pointed out, the movie "Fargo" had more Hawaiian places than this movie. Apparently shot at a mischievous budget, this movie highlights Hawaii's demolished dive shops, petrol stations and cheap hotels. Zulu - who later stands as Kono in Hawaii-Five-O, appears as Thinnes' clumsy, fearless sidekick, while France Nguyen models the Jenny Craig diet, terribly wrong. Others who share the flickering screen include a drunk Richard Harris knockoff, a George Takai mimic, a not-so-clever hit with Sansabel slacks and the villain "Tree" that plays a bush British accent. You can figure out the plot just halfway through the opening credits, but relax - just enjoy the furious mediocrity of this 70's movie of the week. <br /> <br /> When I think of this movie (and I think of this movie often), I catch myself the theme, written for flute and tuba ... no one knows why. <br /> <br /> Trivia Note - Diamond Head is directed by Jeannot Szwarc, one of three contract directors at Universal, who would make much larger films in the case of Jaws 2. The others were John Badham (War Games), and a young man named Steven Spielberg ...
