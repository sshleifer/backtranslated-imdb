Wow a Good Presentation for a Movie: Imagine a movie maker with writer's block who decides to take tango lessons. Hey and what a better idea gives the central role to a movie maker interested in tango. So I wish I had that talent for genius. Yes, I'm sarcastic. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this type of zero potential for making money movies is made. Come on, unless you're a rabid tango fan (I admit it doesn't exist, rated by the commentary) or a mortal member of the Sally Potter fan club (?) Is there nothing in this movie that will let you hurry to see the theater. Even if you're back in the tango, much of the movie is recorded with meaningless scenes like a house being renovated or a man in a wheelchair walking along the road. <br /> <br /> Soon THE OVERVIEW LIST where a failed scriptwriter from Scotland sits in front of a computer that writes a lot of sarcastic, yet highly entertaining reviews of movies he saw. In the shock, Theo Robertson is in the hands of the youngest Hollywood groups. He is in sympathy for receiving another letter from a film company. He has a bath and rubs soap over his well-colored body. THE REVIEW LIST comes to a theater near you soon if someone is foolish enough to fund the movie. <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter is not related to Harry Potter.
