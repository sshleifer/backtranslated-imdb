The male and female team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were big stars in Vaudeville, but they made very few films. As for other artists of their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible film movie for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT, in which they are portrayed by other actors: 'Somebody Loves Me', with Betty Hutton and the relentless song and dancer Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> In their high season, Fields and Seeley were so popular that another man-and-wife vaudeville act - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - achieved almost as many stars as an almost identical act and the "second team" Fields and Seeley become effective. Offstage, however, there was a big difference in the couples' life arrangements. Fields and Seeley live in hotel suites, pay room rates for each meal they have eaten, and eventually spend money. Block and Sully became modestly accustomed to investing wisely. They ended up with easy retirement. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone card are practiced by two splashing pianists. Apparently, these two men had a slight nominal value in 1930, although I have never heard of them. Eventually, Velds and Seely get in and start the performance. They both have lots of pep, and she is pretty attractive. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed that both artist movements were pretending to break into a dance, but they never did it to the third. of the three songs they perform in this short. When they finally head off, the results aren't impressive. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see this opportunity to see these two great artists doing their fad. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never starred in movie music. My rating for this one: just 4 out of 10, and I will be at Block and Sully.
