The Forest is not just your everyday standard slasher / backwoods cannibal card, but also an interesting mix of supernatural elements. The story is about two couples walking on a camping tour in the bush. A house, cannibalistic foresters and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them. There is something you do not see. Director Don Jones gets an "A" for effort, although the movie itself just goes down every level, the play is just plain, except for Jeanette Kelly who plays the dead man of the bushman (Michael Brody, also known as Gary Kent ). /> <br /> The movie opens with some beautiful shots of a couple walking through a valley and in a forest. They realize that someone is stealing them. They are both sent in a typical grinding disc. Our murderer uses a reliable knife throughout the film, except during a setback when he implements a sawmill, elevator and blunt sawmill to send his lover's lover. <br /> <br /> The forest has a good story line, but the movie just doesn't work together. I really found it boring with just crappy acting. 10/04
