Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were terrible. It's hard to believe that someone other than John Cusack would bring in money in it. With a series of anti-military / anti-war movies already destroyed at the box office, it is almost unthinkable that a studio of any kind would want itself in connection with this writing. <br /> <br /> Initially it may look like some kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (s) again. But just about 90 seconds in the movie, it becomes clear that this is a talented effort at DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I had a lot of Cusacks movies that I thought I'd see the DVD of this one. I have to say that I don't know if Cusack is purely enough for me to even see another feature that sees it again, unless someone else sees it. Cusack appears to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for George Bush and the Iraq war that he is prepared to commit murder. Tom Cruise was never near that far away. Not even close.
