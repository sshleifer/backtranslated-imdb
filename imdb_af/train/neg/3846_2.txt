W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage is supposed to be an English language classic. If so, much of the movie version should be missing here. Phillip's (Leslie Howard) attraction on Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicably that the scenario looks like the post-breakup retelling of a man's point of view. Being a family lawyer, I heard many such accounts; the man presents himself as noble and always right, and the woman is a bright man who has no purpose but to exploit the man. <br /> <br /> Indeed, unless someone is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker, it's an awkward movie to watch. Phillip even welcomes Mildred when she brings a baby of indefinite fatherhood, but the real highlight comes when Phillip Mildred - now enraged of dubious understanding - releases his apartment with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period didn't happen here. In fact, by the end of the movie she looks very much like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I notice how Howard's character is always impeccably dressed and cared for. It tells me that Phillip requires middle-class responsiveness. Someone like it can't run from a woman with a Cockney accent course. Phillip is a student for most of the movie; such a person would have been more credible if he was younger and had the horrific appearance of the low income and low self-esteem that often accompany student status - an English Raskolnikov, as it wishes. And balance it by allowing Mildred a special charm.
