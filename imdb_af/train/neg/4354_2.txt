This show is terrible. no comedy, no plot not good characters. America is you blind, giving real shows awards. I hate this show with 30 rocks. Honestly, I am so glad they canceled this show. thanks CBS. Keep two and a half men, keep Christine, keep up with the rules of engagement, how I meet your mother who is not really funny but very funny. This show is a deterrent to friends. with the same director, that's good. but keep this show away and never bring it back. never ever ever. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 rating is because it keeps me awake rather than asleep. These are the types of movies or TV shows I give one. The only reason I was still awake was because of the audience's laugh and I was looking forward to the next show. I really wish this show was funny, but my opinion is stupid. very stupid. I don't see why everyone likes it. my opinion again. but I also find a big bang theory, a little stupid. my bad slim The day to day class, I have a smile and it is not your show to watch.
