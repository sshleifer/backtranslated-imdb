I wanted to keep this movie. But it falls apart in the middle. The whole point of departure is a good one and binds well, but the middle runs out of the tangent. The people I watched annoyed me while it obviously ran out and hoped it would end earlier than it did. Another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment! I dreamed myself to dream elsewhere during the Schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot. I bought it for the candy and it did well, but it lacked Pixar's writing and soul. I think kids 8 and under will enjoy the ride on the face vaule, while the plot is missing. People who are old enough to follow a plot will find it too far to return quickly and easily. Show most of the middle section, make it 50 minutes and it will be a solid movie. I wish I had better things to say. But I don't
