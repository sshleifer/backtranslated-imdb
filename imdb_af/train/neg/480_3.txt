2 stars for Kay Francis - she is wonderful! And she didn't deserve this terrible spout that Warner Bros. threw her away! <br /> <br /> The dual premise on which this movie is based is ridiculous and incredible in the extreme. Kay is a small town woman and mother who long for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a large-scale actor comes to town and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities, Kay tells her husband that she is going to the movie. The hubby's prayer of a mother makes a mistake in the man's statement that Kay is not true and he is looking for her. He finds her with the actor in the hotel (they only speak!) And he sneaks the man who falls over a railing, lands first in a dam, and dies. Now here are the two incredible sites on which the rest of the movie is based: <br /> <br /> 1) The judge tells the jury that if it is determined that the man is dead * before * his head is in the water gone, that they should make the hubby guilty of first degree murder. (Whaaaaa ?????? I think a man in a rage in the desert swallows, manslaughter or murder 2 will not be the first murder of the first time. Give me a break! But the plot required him to be convicted of murder so that he could be sent to prison for life.) <br /> <br /> 2) The hubby's lawyer, after the conviction and sentencing, tells Kay that all this is her fault is. His reasoning is that if she did not go to the actor's room, her husband would not have to go to her and beat the man and kill him. He told her she was the culprit, not her husband, and she nodded and agreed. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the film is about Kay and tries to get celebrity and money to release her husband from prison and the mistake she made causes him to kill the actor dude in the first place. <br /> <br /> I can't even go with this review. The movie was just too painful. Four years earlier, in the pre-code days, you would never have caught Kay to play such a wimp! In true Kay Francis fashion, however, she did her best to make us believe that this woman was a credible character. I give her a lot of credit for trying to catch up with breathtaking life and credibility in this ungrateful role. This character was far from pre-code Kay roles and the real ghost fire Kay Francis. <br /> <br /> Get away from this one! There are much better Kay Francis vehicles out there! (From personal experience, I highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery, also good are Dr. Monica and One Way Passage. I'm sure there are other good Kay flicks, but I just call the one I "I have seen and recommended.)
