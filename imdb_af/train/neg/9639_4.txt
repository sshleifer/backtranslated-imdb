Sometimes a new look is served from foreign films. It's their great attraction. They take life away and serve it raw. American films rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar determines their choices. Something that invites European directors. In addition, audiences worldwide are starving for "different" films, especially those that offer a hearty bite from the miserable, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences desire beauty, poetry and the pristine taste of life. This is what the film "Left of the Father" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the conviction that unity of family comes from the unity of its obedience to tradition. Yet, when the patriarch of a family forgets it is members of the flesh and blood, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set against themselves. Selton Mello plays Andr√© a boy who wants to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who tries to swallow a banned thirst from the family water. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the oldest brother. The movie offers a lot, but it takes an extraordinary amount of time to say it. ***
