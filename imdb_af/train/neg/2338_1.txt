How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminds us of the agreement with the other better Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also a number of characters in the Congo Express that are compiled without really having a relationship with each other: Jean, the Congolese, the workman, the two taxi drivers, the street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels was not. It should not be a reason to forgive the mistakes in writing (if there is a writing) of the wind. The joke (the only one!) At the ice cream festival in the fridge was taken from the great Flemish film "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte sits too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie, but there is no explanation. Tom Barman gives us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch television than a movie for the theaters. Another missed opportunity for the Flemish Cinema.
