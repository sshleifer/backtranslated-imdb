It's not a terrible comedy, but it's very DULL. It hardly laughs, and it wastes its cute production values. There is a painful moment near the end when Fu Manchu gives a dose of his elixir to his "nemesis" and tells him you were my one-off opponent and now we can start again. The scene, along with Burt Kwouk's amusing, came in the beginning, being the only memorable parts of the movie. (* 1/2)
