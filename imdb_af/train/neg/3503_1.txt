And if I look at Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love impressive, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so B-O-R-I-N-G, irritating and dignified. She is also completely lacking in anything whatsoever humorous. The dead end she's trying to make her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny. I watched two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> Geez, my child (19 years old) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a stupid woman. I thought it was a compliment. The one she says, "Watch my show or I'll kill my dog," is actually credible. I know she's a comedienne. She comes just like a twisted nut. I never want to see her around MY dog.
