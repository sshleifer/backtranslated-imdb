Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood's worst overestimated films ever. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make a period-related movie, gives a garbage film. The songs were boring and not the kind of song you want to listen to in your car, full of volume. Sunny Deol is known for making daft movies, hitting 100 bad guys on his own. He even kicks a metal prison (Indian) and kicks off a moving car (Teesri Aankh). I can give another 50 examples of shameful action by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know it. Sunny gives a pathetic performance again the same type of role. A man who claims to fight for his lands uses violence. Amisha Patel is dead dead, sexy with a wonderful body I would like to have. But even she can't save the movie from a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes as usual, in this movie she doesn't. Maybe, cos, she played a Muslim, but she didn't act like one in the movie. Overall, it's a poor performance altogether, I'm sure it will appeal to some people, who like to beat the Hollywood actor 100 people. Give me a chance.
