It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over, none of us understood the plot. Apart from the lack of plot, the play was horrible, the "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. The film's only reasoning factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's pretty funny. You can't help but laugh at a zombie overflowing while the actors are making a scary dialogue. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, but it is something a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh. It's now a running joke among my friends and I. 1 out of 10.
