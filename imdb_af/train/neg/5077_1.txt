This is pointed out in a now-removed message from another IMDb user that anyone who may see the "The Medusa Touch" should be warned about a scene that is frankly reflecting the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in NYC. But I hope everyone who reads this will consider this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree, producer Elliott Kastner produced Harper and The Long Goodby. Co-producer Arnon Milchan composed the Oscar-nominated "LA Confidential" and scriptwriter John Briley received an Oscar for "Gandhi" and an international cast, I found the "Medusa Touch" a heavy hand, unintentional laugh-riot is. It was a poorly directed, terrible writing and called mess. It tried to capitalize on the 70's telekinetic thrillers genre. The movie fails at many points. Please consider "Carrie" and the underrated "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). They were two entertaining and exciting thrillers who were dealing with the same subject.
