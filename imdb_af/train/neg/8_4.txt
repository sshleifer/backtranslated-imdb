6/10 Acting, not big, but some good actors. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Director, make some dumb decisions for this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Author, story doesn't make sense at all. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Overall score for this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it can be too much. Characters are as exaggerated as they can ever be in real life and some pretty inexplicable things happen "storywise", not in a good way. Due to the style of this movie, you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motion and camera shake and fast forward). It's always good that the movie uses music to smooth the story, but there are too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
