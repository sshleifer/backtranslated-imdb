It must be one of the worst movies of the 1990s. When my friends and I were this movie (which was the target audience), we were aiming for it. We only watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor, how bad it was. The rest of the time everyone in the theater just started talking to each other, or they usually cry in their popcorn that they actually paid money they deserved to work to watch this poor excuse for a movie. It had to look like a good idea on paper, but on film it seems as if nobody in the film has an idea of ​​what is going on. Crap acting, crap costumes. I can't see how embarrasing it is to look. Save yourself an hour and a little bit of your life .........
