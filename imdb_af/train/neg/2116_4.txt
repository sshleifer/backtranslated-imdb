The poverty drive horror photos of the 1930s and '40s are pushing hell out of me. God knows I have nothing against low-budget movies, but those produced in that period have such a fool, clumsy look at them - and ultimately it's not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more entertaining than the bottom of the beverage like "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not classic. Bela Lugosi, long past his "Dracula" boom, still plays a crazy doctor; The unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a dubious young female reporter (Luana Walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also on hand, which may be hardcore fans of '30s and' 40s movies.
