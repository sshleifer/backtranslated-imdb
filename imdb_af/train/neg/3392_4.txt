What about Indonesian music films? I've never seen Indonesian music movies like those made in Bollywood. They miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of what they called 'poetic lines'. <br /> <br /> This story about the love of two children being divorced and then reunited after a few years of change, has no special remarks. This is a simple story plot (but it's rather focused) with "intended to be musical story lines here and there. <br /> <br /> Confusing characters to be saved by brilliant acting are neglected. The main actress can try to live the character, but it's the best she can do, try. Regarding the casting, I do not feel the need to place a Balinese student in that story and of course it is not the only unnecessary characters. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is why I want to watch This movie? Maybe because of the mangoes ...
