I thought "Intensive Care" was very bad and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it is somewhat exciting, but never a good shock. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> The fun lies in ridiculous moments. But the all-time classic moment is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. He leaned in the corner of the hallway. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels beside him and asks, "Poor Peter, will I get you a band aid?". <br /> <br /> This movie was shot in English and Afrikaans. To save costs, all license plates are the US, and the background in the news studio is a Manhattan skyline. Very funny when you are Dutch and look at the original version in Afrikaans.
