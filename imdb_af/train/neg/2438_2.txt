This notorious end to Koen Wauters's career came to my attention through the 'Night of Bad Taste'. To judge by the comment index I was not the first and I am not the last person in Western Europe to learn that this musician (undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agree on it) has an actor. Whether or not he has attempted can not be judged. <br /> <br /> In 'Intensive Care' he is pretty similar, but he looks uncomfortable with the movie in which he participates. No one can blame him. It earns its position in Verheyen's Hall of Fame in every respect and standards. The story of the murderous mania that is supposed to kill in an accident but is alive and cruel has been told dozens of times before, and even without original twists, a director can create a more than mediocre story through innovative institutions and cinematography. liver. /> <br /> IC content itself with a hospital wing and a few middle class houses. The pace is boring. The tension loses the last part of his credibility to the music count, because every appearance of the killer is accompanied by a boring threatening melody, followed by orchestral eruptions during the murders, which have been widely suggested and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can make them. The sex scene is free, but not least attractive. The couple from Amsterdamned could have made it work. While dealing with the few box: the entire subplot between Wauters and the girl does not work. A more effective emotional connection could have been established on the screen if they were just co-victims, loosening their nerves halfway through physical intercourse. I won't even give the other governors the dignity of a mention, because they all had to be cut into small, greasy pieces. In fact, most of them do. Those I remember where before the genre is obvious: a nice nurse and two policemen. <br /> <br /> So, in a scraper, the cavalry comes first in time to save itself. The (anti-) hero has to take out the villain, mostly by clever thinking, because former reds don't often get parts in these movies; they can overcome the illusion of incompatibility surrounding the murderer. Translate to the events, the Wauters kill the doctor and rescue the woman in distress. <br /> <br /> No people, I'm not done. This is not how the story goes. Wauters makes his heroic effort, but is defeated with a rage that comes close to a Clockwork Orange. So it is up to the girl to find the killer and pierce the doctors' brains. Although this method ensures killer death more than the usual 9 mm bullet rounds, the doctor survives to enable IC to reach the 80 min point. <br /> <br /> Now I had to make my point. Intensive Care is a bad movie that can only be enjoyed by bad Taste lovers, who can verify and make Verheyen's catchy statements and try to put it through. For example, the (unintentional) parody value of the doctor's clown mask (Halloween) and the final confrontation in the park (the chase at the end of Friday the 13th). <br /> <br /> But I have to conclude by giving an overview by a few stomach elements that give IC a little credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is a horrible monologue endured by a co-doctor / French actor and seems terrified when he flames himself to mark his big name on a stand. He could have played his Naked Gun part again, to end up as beef, but with a longer screen time. The final can be one of them. I have never seen a maniac broken down by starting fireworks in his intestines to crush him against a flexible fence. It's good to laugh. <br /> <br /> Mention one good, real point about Intensive Care ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself completely to his musical career. It makes me wonder how many editions of the Paris Dakar race he had to break down before coming to his senses. <br /> <br />
