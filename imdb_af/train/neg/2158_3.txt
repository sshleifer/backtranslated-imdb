I can now clearly see why Robin Hood fled quickly. The first episode of this is probably the worst ever broadcast by BBC. The opening styles were about as intense, meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys were fighting, Robin Hood had no character and the sword fight was just laughter. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood who dressed a cow in the make-up at the beginning of the episode. How many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century? Nobody. The series has since improved drastically, but this first episode sets people's hopes down quickly and is actually a stack of cr * p. A great hero of England is ashamed. <br /> <br /> "Will you endure it?" I won't, that's for sure, unless the BBC starts to understand what a wise investment is. 10/03
