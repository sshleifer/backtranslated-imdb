Hi, may be because I am not a theater director or a sophisticated movie-keeper. I think this movie is 'Boring' and 'Dumb'. <br /> <br /> I rent this movie because of Charles Bronson and it's title ... but boy who's wasting time ... just watch 2 guys sitting in a safe and talking ... <br /> <br /> The movie on this DVD was so "DARK" ... I had hard time watching the darn movie ... I realize it's a 1968 movie ... but they put it on a DVD, then they need to do some digital remastering. <br /> <br /> Also, I was totally surprised to see these high points on IMDb for this movie ... as I said before I wasn't as sophisticated as the other people who responded to this movie earlier.
