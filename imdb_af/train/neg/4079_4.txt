I bought a DVD of this movie for my girl who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this movie, and enjoys movies about the paranormal. The movie is shot entirely on video, so it has the look of a PBS special about it. The special effects are fine looking, but there are actually terrifying moments in the movie that made us jump into our seat. There is a particularly effective scare with a Virgin Mary statue. <br /> <br /> The acting, however, is bad, the plot scenes are long and very boring, and I will tell you I have no idea what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, please make sure you pay less than $ 5.
