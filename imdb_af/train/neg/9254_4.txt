Resnais, wow! The genius that our Hiroshima Mon Amour brought, takes up the challenge of making a 1930s French music in vivid color. The opening stamp with old, decorated intertitles was a fine touch. Then open the camera opening (like the old crawlers) on a black-and-white poster. The camera leaves (or rather on), which suddenly shows us the surprisingly brilliant colors of an elegant tea set table set. It's all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. A little banal and forgetful diddy with a convincing chorus of 3 girls who blow a little nonsense that is not relevant to the movie (and yes, I speak French so I can't blame it on the captions). Those characters shine out the door and are replaced by more people breaking into an even more forgetful song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first notable dialogue 15 minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resnais meant to start with such a gaping waste of time and musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you shoot and storm on the screen. I insisted. <br /> <br /> It didn't get much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We don't even see their faces half the time (as Resnais seems to mean the expensive scenery to care about the real people in front of the camera). People flash up and down like moths around a lamp, and we the public is unable to focus on any particular person or plot. It is as if you have to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and tackle it in a 2-hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing I watched as long as I did it (1 hour) was that I watch the camera techniques, lighting and scenery that were all right, I admit. But is it enough to keep your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Perhaps I will try tomorrow to see the end. Aw, I guess. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you do too. Skip it.
