Why every horror director wants to mimic "The Exorcist" is a complete mystery to me, because William Friedkin's "classic" is a very overstated movie and, in my opinion, not everything that is tense or shocking. And yet here is another clean rip-off, a Spanish one who repeatedly repeats this story of a young girl owned by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I have to admit seems quite hot here) plays the honorable priest approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior has changed drastically since meeting her new boyfriend. Initially, the priest does not believe it, but when John's body is twisted with his neck, Leila's demonic action becomes more noticeable ... "Exorcism" is not only very original, it is also an inexorable boring movie! Here, Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religious theme-exploding band full of shocks and gore, yet the result is an easy and complete bloodless drama that will almost sleep you! The last twenty minutes contain a few atmospheric moments, although it is very silly, and there are quite a few stylishly filmed feminine nudity and wastes. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse, as Paul Naschy has already shown that he has enough imagination to make a shortage of money. It's just a horrible movie, ending the story. Other European "The Excorcist" rip-offs are "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they also suck!
