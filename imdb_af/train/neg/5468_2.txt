I absolutely love the 'Toxic Avenger' series, but this poor presentation by the Troma people didn't make sense, and it has known me all the time. <br /> <br /> A leaky nuclear plant (and the growing weeds next door) make the youngsters of Tromaville High nuts, causing them to join a gang, have sex, explode and whatever. Also there is some sort of monster breeding in high school ... my God, this movie is a mess. <br /> <br /> The actors stopped their efforts after this one. The (intended) overwork started in about 5 minutes on my nerves ... <br /> <br /> Disappointing. 10/02.
