Wow this one sucks. I'll summarize it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> A count invites 4 naive props back to his castle. A lot of nothing happened for a long time. Some lamb and non-erotic softcore sex scenes happen. Some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen) -The End. <br /> <br /> The only things going on for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes, some bad dubbing which leads to inadvertently funny dialogue, and a few short nudge shots. And believe me - these things are not enough to release the 90 minutes of the tedium this movie is. In fact, the best part is the start of the distributor who is covered with some bloody blind chicks and is shown with their tits. This is definitely not the price of admission for this garbage. As everyone else noticed, the title of the movie is completely stupid. There is absolutely no blood slaughter, and not in the film at all. It can also be called 'The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk', and at least it would have been a better title as well as nothing in the film. An accurate title would have been '90 minutes of torture '- another attractive title that at least was truth ... for the viewer. Honestly - the trailer standing on the disk shows all the best parts (and I use the term "best" very loosely ...), so I strongly suggest it if you're still curious. I can't imagine anyone holding this flash of a movie. Please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf. 10/02
