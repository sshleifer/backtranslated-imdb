It's the saddest collection of cliches, stretched on a straight line, with no observable plot or any decent way of acting I've seen for a long time. Canibalizing scenes from Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter have gone for a whole war on the viewer intelligence. Was this movie good? It was not a movie at all! <br /> <br /> Although it's not so low to actually be funny and get cult status as a comedy, the movie offers a little laugh. The trick is to place the copied scenes in the context of their original movies. Gandalf can talk funny Korean, the basilisk looks sneaky when you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can have a lot of fun between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever its name. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Any pleasure that comes from this movie depends entirely on the drunkenness and imagination of the viewers, not the director / writer. Shame on you, Shim!
