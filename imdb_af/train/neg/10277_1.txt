I feel totally ripped off. Someone has to repay the $ 4.95 I spent at Blockbuster to rent this homemade mess. It's not a musical, it's a total waste of time and evening. What I don't get is why did it spread in the first place? ... someone MUST do some heavy drugs that night. I saw the better movies coming from film schools and I was in the film school so I could say it. The quality of this work is also just as bad to see ... shot at DV ??? Nuff said. The songs are not songs, but just as much fun in each section. Want to see a good musical? THEN DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE.
