Films like this are for the original album-oriented Rock stations that music was used - repetitive, boring, and drained of all the original energy by a corporate drone committee. I am glad that Aragorn does not pass through this P.O.S. if an expected psycho is selected. Go back and look at the 1971 version, count the things that will never be included in a modern version, and thank you, regardless of the deity, worship that somebody in the distant past had to write the balls and shoot an original concept film that was not based on someone else's ideas, and was not conveyed by a corporate council until it was seen by the day.
