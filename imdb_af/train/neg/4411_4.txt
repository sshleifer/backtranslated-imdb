Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he's not the lead, except in a low-budget movie. He doesn't really have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has much more screen presence, and unfortunately he's not really the main character. Danielle Harris (of Halloween 4 and 5 movies) plays his daughter, and she is cute and entertaining, but she is not written either. clever and one of her stupid mistakes gets one of the main characters killed. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait, and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just watching what happens to these characters is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays the Consigliare to the local Mafia Godfather, and it's hard to tell if he works the movie as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. He appears to be in every extremely low budget direct-to-video action movie. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. To see so many comedians and comic actors in this movie, it felt like a ghost. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? It's hard to tell on some points. There is definitely very little Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> Thugs and Goons support casts are threatened and thrown well. Some of these movies have Thugs that seem to be working at the local Comic Book Store or as stock boys at Piggly-Wiggly. Overall, this movie is very uneven. On some points it looks like a comedy or a parody. Then it works elsewhere than a good action movie. Then it sputters to an end. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this movie will rate a zero in my humble opinion.
