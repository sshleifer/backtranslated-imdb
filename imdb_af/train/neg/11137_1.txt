All the bald women in the world couldn't hold me in the hands of the stop button about a third of the way. With the false acting, equally horrible writing, plus the poor CGI FX, beware; This movie is an insult to the Werewolf genre. It's supposed to be serious, which in itself would be funny if this movie could even make the level of a bad joke. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies where people behind the camera are of course skilled, but too lazy to make even one quarter decent. Avoid at all costs and look at one of the classic Werewolf movies. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
