Something somewhere must have gone terribly wrong, right when the director observed this plot. The movie, which was supposed to be the remake of one of the beloved movies in the film, fails to deliver in every aspect of movies. The best of the artists could also not pick up the voice, it simply shows that the movie was a serious mistake in itself. <br /> <br /> Editing is poor. Direction is shit. Acting from this world (omg)! The characters who are supposed to watch people with scarce power to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes. <br /> <br /> I won't see the movie, even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free citizen.
