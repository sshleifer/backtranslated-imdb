Let it stink! As everyone knows, it is based on some Geico insurance ads; what no one knows is WHY? These ads were first-time amusing on the first show; rare feed for a range. (It speaks Geico-gecko - it's another story. Now it would make for an intriguing series!) And why did ABC, as reported in the press, actually agree to buy Geico's cavemen character rights for this? The idea of ​​cavemen struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to TV; Phil Hartman had a recurring Saturday Night Live role as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer over a decade ago. And that's how a concept like this works best - but occasional payment. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A 1960 series called "It's About Time" also used the cavemen in the modern world concept. It lasts one season.) <br /> <br /> One of the directors of the show, who was also responsible for the Geico ads, were recently quoted: "We were so excited when we shot our ads because we felt we had something very unique and we had bigger stories to tell." Wrong. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad TV, it's set to take its place with 1972's "Me and the Chimp" as one of the worst. The chief actor in the embarrassment of the Chimpanzees fiasco actually hid in the shame-for-association after it was suddenly canceled. Undoubtedly, we will follow cavemen friends.
