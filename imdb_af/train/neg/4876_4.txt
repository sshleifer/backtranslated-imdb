... when he made Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). The review of Bing Crosby as THAN BROOKS did not date a script left in 34. This sad film has raised many scenes of the original with much of the supporting role that their roles repeat unless they were dead. Although it was older, it did not seem to the Director. Also, the cars and clothes in the background plates of 1934 did not look like the 1950s standards. Not even the "Bingel" song can do this effort. <br /> <br /> We reviewed both the original and the remake IMDb Four **** Stars. Frank's touch was long gone and everything left was CAPRA-CORN. However, it does not have Mr. Capra stopped. After making some educational documentaries around the fifties, he retired his career for LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again, there was a good role played on that IMDb Six ****** Star effort compared to the original Eight ******** Stars. Sometimes it is better to stop while you were still, just after STATE OF THE UNION (1948).
