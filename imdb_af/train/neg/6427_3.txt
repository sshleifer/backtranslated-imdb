so i found this documentary quite strange and really useless. I know it has awards and things, but I didn't personally enjoy them. There was no humor or drama in your interest, just a bunch of truths and their work. some of the people are quite different, which is not bad, it didn't just leave me a good impression. I was thoroughly bored by this movie, no offense to my creative writing teacher. The circus theme throughout the movie was so cool, but I didn't get it, and robotics and lion roaming are definitely not my thing. The green animal thing was neat, I had lots of garden lots of colorful flowers, but how did these four lanes connect? It just didn't make much sense to me, why someone would make a movie about it. But if you are in such things, you can enjoy it. Who should I stand on your way? I only exhort you on possible suffering.
