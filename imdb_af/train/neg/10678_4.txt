This movie looks good - well cast, evergreen subject and an explosive opening. It pulled down from there. Why is it filmed with the handheld camera? It shakes, judges, screens that capture and confuses the viewer. A poor choice indeed. As if that wasn't enough, the worst-edited memory in the memory accepts a drunk viewer - compulsory if you don't want it at all. And then it commits the worst sin of all. After the viewer led all the possible unlikely and unquestionable scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they roll out credits without revealing the denouement - the end - the discount - just as the head was the motive? How can you expect to be successful by ending up with exciters? Do! This movie had a great promise and ended with a facial plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. Weak attempt by writer and director.
