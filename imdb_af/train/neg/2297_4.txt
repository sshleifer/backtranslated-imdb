I turn 700 Club once in a while and just agree with some of the statements made. I am one of many believers who are considered liberal by most Christians and are conservative by most non-Christians. I agree in my mind and it is usually not rep. or them. - I do not believe 700 clubs tell people what to believe, but that it represents many older Christians who grew up with great conservative backgrounds. I think many people misunderstand what is being said at 700 clubs. It pushes me to hear the name, and calls either direction. I think 700 clubs really love Jesus but are so busy getting people to vote conservatively that they have forgotten to show love to some people and promote peace as Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus by ignorant individuals who believe in Him and let us not be so ignorant of our comments about them. Why are people so mean to each other?
