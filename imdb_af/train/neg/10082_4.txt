I totally laughed at this rotten movie. It's so incredible. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job !!! Hilarious! Next thing you know the two women are going to. Yes, it's lesbians! Nothing rings true in this "Lifetime for women with nothing better to do" movie. Clunky dialogue like, "I don't want to spend the rest of my life, feel like I was happy and didn't take it". There is a rich, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A Sassy Black Maid - incredible that in the year 2003, a movie is made in which there is a sassy black girl. Hattie McDaniel must turn into her grave. The woman has a man who freaks out and wants to oversee the snotty teens. Wow! No cliche is left unchanged.
