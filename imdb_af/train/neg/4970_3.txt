Good people, I stumbled on this movie in the evening while I was examining papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one ever deserved the honor. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I have seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version is part of the Christopher Lambert version. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What didn't I like? CGI for one. Incredibly bad. More important is the faithfulness of the storyline, not the stationary acting. I am used to both versions I have seen. <br /> <br /> Rejoice, Peter
