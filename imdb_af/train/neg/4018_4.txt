This movie is too skeletal. It's a pretty low-budget movie (I hope!), Which excuses it a bit, but the lack of a decent throw and a split plot hurts it. Phillips is reasonably credible in his role as a torn son of a wealthy family looking for himself (though his family is ... well, a little too white ...) but the rest of the throw is grabbed by straws. Every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama, and there is * way too much sub-plotting (which is a clear sign of shortage. They need filler ...) I will not recommend this movie to anyone who is not either a stubborn Phillips fan, or who has absolutely nothing * to do. 10/04.
