I have never heard of this one before the owner of my local DVD publisher told me; Being an 1980 horror with the infamous distinction of being banned in the UK, I decided to check it out. The movie is a boring, amateurish and ugly look; the sound recording is so poor that the dialogue is incomprehensible half the time, while the act gives new meaning! <br /> <br /> What's worse, the movie follows the terribly tired formula of a trio of teenage girls involved in an accident and protected by a dysfunctional family living in a remote environment. Soon one of the girls is going to seek help and is never heard again; Another, still bed-ridden, is quickly done away (after forgetting most of the time). The heroine is the one who interacts most with the three inhabitants of the home: a harridan of a bibling mother (fear terror), her oppressed (and long-suffering) daughter, and the latter's strange brother who sometimes prevents the scene over sleeping female guests. <br /> <br /> Often after memories of the man-hate mother (as a way to fill in the grief, to say nothing of original background) and constantly evolving in mother-daughter sparring games, the film one bait its sleeve - the turning end is as unexpected as it is inventive, but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film (so much through the lameness of everything as the intervals ) or the inevitable feeling of wasting 80 minutes of my time ...
