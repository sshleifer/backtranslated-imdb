You should note that when the star's name is listed incorrectly in the opening credits, you are not in time (the credit reads "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). A nice car hunt, shoot 'em up, blow' em up action as ALL you want is action, because the relationship to which plot exists is best at its best, and totally incredible. The motivation of the characters, especially those of Gooding's in the end, is worse than incredible, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly disturbed. All I can think is that Andy Cheng must be a very good guy to get these very good actors in this dirty project (he can't have anything on them all, can he?).
