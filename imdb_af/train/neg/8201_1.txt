Snuggle into your favorite chair and switch on the playstation as you throw it into the waste disposal unit. Spend a useful 90 minutes. Live your favorite game. Disobedient - poorly filmed - non-directional junk. It takes a piece of several other "science fiction" movies and tries to connect the parts into a pathetically weak story. There is nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to realize that providing simple entertainment will achieve a monetary game, but a touch of skill-friendliness and flair is needed to make it into a good movie. Any money spent on it is a waste, and personally I want to have 90 minutes of life back.
