(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /> <br /> Usually a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to look here tonight. I had to turn it off before the second hour, because I found myself absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. Both absorbed themselves with little respect for others. The daughter also added rude and recklessly to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was "we no longer have to look at her." Keaton did a good job of moving in her astonished state and mourning, but it went too far for me. I simply didn't enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the protagonist, you need to care more about the characters - if it's almost an hour and I don't care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> The supporting role play was sincere and well played - I felt for * them! * - And the gay best friend was wonderful, but even combined, it wasn't enough to carry the movie for me.
