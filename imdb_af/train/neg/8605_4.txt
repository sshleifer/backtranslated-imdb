This is an interesting 80-year-old feast with some nasty snails with a taste for human blood. If you can get rid of the ridiculous thing about the whole thing, you can actually get some pleasure from it. The play is terrible and the plot is simply there to keep the movie together between gory slug attacks, but the movie is not a total waste of time. The special effects are actually pretty good, and the gore is well done. It reminded me of the redesign of the Blob, probably because of its smartness. All in all, you can definitely be worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I won't predict seeing this movie unless you have a strong stomach and are in such things.
