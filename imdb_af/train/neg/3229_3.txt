A found band about 3? guys who have fun torturing a woman in various inhumane ways. <br /> <br /> Yes, spoiler. <br /> <br /> First, the play didn't make it scary at all. orgasms, not suffering. The punishment was so ridiculous! What is shocking about throwing meat or turning it into a chair? Shooting a nonsense band at least makes it good. The only part of the comment is the end: the hammered hand and the pierced eye, the rest of the film is really poor. To end the boredom, the alleged story about the band being investigated becomes extra bullshit.
