It was Jon Pertwee who said: "It's very hard to be funny, but very easy to be stupid." Well, if so, PASTY FACES is "Very Easy". David Baker (director / screenwriter) and his role-players seem to be under the impression that the comedy includes the acting and style of the best Britcoms like LOCK STOCK. And TRAINSPOTTING, uses a completely underdeveloped script and jumps up and down in a very fast speech. vote very hard. Alan McCaffrey suffers from this type of OTT show, but not enough to destroy the movie, as there is not enough film to destroy. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts, especially scriptwise. I couldn't understand why it ended as it did, but it just seems to stop in a very abrupt and stupid way. Oh, and other nasty mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the US and a green card to work there. This movie will believe you can get a plane and a new life in America without any authorization is still being paid to donate blood to America. People I know in America, and who donate blood, tell me payment for donations discontinued a few years ago - and that you can buy any type of gun from a gun store. As far as I know, gun laws in America differ from state to state, but no gun stores sell counter-tanks anti-tank guns. So we had a very wrong view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfulfilled movie. Maybe it's revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots? Maybe, but it stops PASTY FACES from a crap comedy
