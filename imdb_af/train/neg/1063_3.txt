The idea is nice. Bringing so many stars in one movie is wonderful. But .... too many stories, too short and without any sense. No connection between the screens. There were about 3-4 brilliant stories ... but it was out of 18. The frame reminds me of "All the invisible kids" - a movie I liked very much. In comparison, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks the intriguing short story, which evolves - begins and ends. And it lacks the subject that connects all the children. I don't think Paris suffices from a subject to link 18 short sketches together. Maybe it's interesting for people who know Paris. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it ...
