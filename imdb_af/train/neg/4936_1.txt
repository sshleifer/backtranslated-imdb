I wasted my time and gave this opportunity a chance. It should be one of the worst new programs. If they have given an award to show that it sucks, the category should be demolished. The acting is poor and the story line is confronted. Now Dinosaurs were a bit strange, but at least it was entertaining. This show lasted for three seasons and was eventually scrapped. This new show, based on an insurance company's advertising, isn't funny and doesn't really matter. Perhaps the original ads and the number of times they were and still are repeated, which is wrong with this show. It just came to TV and even though we are tired of seeing the "cave man" characters.
