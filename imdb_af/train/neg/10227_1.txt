It's a well-tale story about a man who marries to escape the hangman's nose, and then bumps over his disappointing bride. It manages sexually and racially exactly the same time. For example, we never find out why a woman who has won the respect of an Indian warrior cannot quite return to her former husband. Or why are the members of her team so keen to get a "real man" in the hall when she appears to be just fine in the right way. It just felt like Hollywood in the fifties. <br /> <br /> There is a very silly scene where she horsewhips him and he actually grabs the whip - the second time - chases her off her horse. Remember, for the first time, he probably lost his eye, which would make it difficult to grab that whip! Then he is in a fight against her Indian bodyguard, where he spends the first two thirds to beat a pulp. It's a second wind. Later, he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty Indians (as they are all in this movie) after rejecting her, she is squaw. Remember that he does not have diplomatic skills and has been negotiating with them for years. And the way he likes to reject her attempts to deceive him, just to stop her and keep her from not holding him - yes, right. As the women just throw themselves completely on the trail. <br /> <br /> Finally, none of the leaders is convincing in their roles. Madison is just a while getting unrealistic luck. Fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot, but is completely unconvincing like a fiery tomboy. The only reason you want to root her is because you want Madison to be tied to a runaway horse and towed over a cliff before the end of the film. The way Madison Tames is Fleming is so predictable and has so few stumbling blocks that it will irritate you if you see women as anything but blow-up dolls. Even if you see them as dolls, the total lack of tension will drill you. <br /> <br /> Total waste of time. Even the scenery is dull. Give this one a big mistake.
