What a time we live when someone like this Joe Swan is considered hell as a good movie maker ... or even a movie maker! Where are the new crop filmmakers with brain and talent ??? We have them bad, and to hell with mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This movie is about nothing, just as the characters in the movie stand for nothing. It is this horrible, so-called Gen Y, who is full of bored idiots, some of whom explain their filmmakers, without doing anything about the vessel before they are shot. Well, Orson Welles was a movie maker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Current movies like this just show how stupid young, so-called "filmmakers" can be when they believe they are without writing, no direction, no thought, no legal "camera work" (everything has been terribly shot at DV), no craft of editing , nothing, stands for "rebellious" or "advanced" movies. No, it calls ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of the theater (and there's actually a jack-off shot in your face, so be ready). <br /> <br /> Watch the early movies of any perfect indie movie maker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog ... nobody made something so boring and aimless This But Swan, who is hell, goes every year to SXSW and is considered a kind of gutsy, new talent. It's shit! I can't imagine anyone likes this, and everything that this so-called movie maker did is just as bad (the newer things are made clear to addressing a more common audience, one of the sitcom calls). Steer clear unless you are a friend or relative of the people involved. If you are a relative or friend, you will probably be ashamed to see a relative or friend in such compromise situations. . <br /> <br /> Full garbage. It's not art. This is the ultimate opposite.
