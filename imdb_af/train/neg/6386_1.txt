I wanted to keep this movie, but it was just impossible. The scene was ultra hammy, the plot was annoying, and the pace was slow, so slow. All the time sitting in the theater I wanted the movie to end. Twenty minuets in a movie and I pray for an end. Certainly, some of the sculptors were nice, but guys, I really mean! And for a movie about a man voting magic instruments, there really wasn't much music to talk about. The music there was annoying and boring. There were also loud, loud, shrill sounds, which were also annoying. Mainly this movie healed me and crawled me at the same time. <br /> <br /> I'm glad she passed. I have to go see "Tideland" and was this bad taste from my mouth.
