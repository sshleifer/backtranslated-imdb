This is the last time I rent a video without going to the IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote, wrote the truly horrible Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed such a garbage as Out of Sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a good actor and it is a pity that he has involved himself in such a bad movie. There is regular confusing editing that seems like a last minute decision to make up for the lack or story, filming and just common sense. This movie does everything wrong. What do they think?
