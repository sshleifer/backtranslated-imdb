I'll keep it as short as possible, as this piece of crap probably doesn't mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst movies ever made - right there with Schnaas' other horrible zombie tournament - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films suck so badly that everyone involved in their creation must be shot. In a way (more or less) I managed to go through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 was so terribly indifferent - even compared to Schnaas' other horrible movie - that I had to go through the first 10 minutes. ZERO action skills, indifferent gore, horrible camcorder-style camera work, ridiculous dubbing ... it just goes on and on. I really can't find one thing that saves on this garbage - and I can usually just get something back in just about any movie. It's really one of the worst movies ever made. You're warned ... 1/10
