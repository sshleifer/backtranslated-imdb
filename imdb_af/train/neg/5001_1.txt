I don't know why I see this silly reality show. I watched several episodes of (a cable marathon broadcast when they sent 5 episodes in a row or something, I didn't watch the whole thing. Only like three episodes) as I was nine months pregnant and on work any day. Maybe I'm just bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for Britney, I really do. For all her money and fame she has very little sense of dignity. Or she is self-centered to the limit. She's married to the nitwit Federline (okay, someone can make a mistake) and before that she "died" this terrible show about her everyday life with him where she kicks a camcorder wherever she feels, whether in someone's face or in the shower is like Federline in there. She talks about her sex life without giving anything to your imagination. I don't care, but I can't help wondering how she feels when she's divorced. And yes, it is embarrassed for me. But I shouldn't be. She seems to be living a beautiful, empty, level life. I don't want to live with her, even if I could. Road-kill TV if you like.
