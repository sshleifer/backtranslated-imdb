Oh, it's really really. I've seen movies I don't like anymore, for whatever reason, but I've never seen a movie that just fails in every aspect of filmmaking. It even fails in filmmaking. Somehow, the Hercules in New York can be said. It's not the movie I like the least, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The play is the first thing that hits you. I have never seen a worse-activated movie outside of pornography. In fact, I have many pornographic films that are a damn site better than this. It's really awful. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. The camera work is amateurish. The editing is nonsense. I suppose they couldn't afford proper sound equipment, and that means every scene in a car (and there are a lot of them) driving around three miles an hour and every scene placed outside by the same piece of wood (and there is Also many of them), are actually bought from a studio, again borrowing from the bad porn atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid, as many have pointed out. I will defend vampires in daylight because, though popular with Nosferatu, it was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mite. <br /> <br /> Speaking of vampire mites, the author clearly read Carmilla. , or at least seen The Vampire Lovers. I am not sure how I feel about this, and I am scared of the impression that a movie this crook at least has aspirations for a Gothic novel that I love very much; or irritated by its best sledge hammer references and the worst total desecration of source material. But at least "the general" is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> However, it gets two stars, but simply because I can't bring myself to vote for a star at least that claims to have both vampires and zombies in it. By the way, I watched Lifeforce on the same day (another movie that has vampires and zombies in it), and despite being a fine movie, it really comes with a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So in the end, it's not a movie so bad it is good, or so bad it is in any way enjoyable, even drunk. It's just a mess, and it's worth looking at nobody's time.
