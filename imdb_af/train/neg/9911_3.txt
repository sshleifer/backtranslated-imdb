If you are beloved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal, and Bill Cobbs, you don't need Billy Burke, Coolio, or any other distractions. Massive talent has been completely wasted in "Three Days to Vegas", blamed on the quadrilateral. My neighbor's holiday movies are about as interesting as this wrong road movie. If you want to see how to use a veteran with a good script, look at "The Crew". There are really no reasoning factors here, and looking at these wonderful actors struggling with such poor material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the plain scared the audience, by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with. - NOTE
