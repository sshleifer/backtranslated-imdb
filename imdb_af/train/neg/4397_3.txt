One of my sisters' friends lent me this game, and it's too damn hard! It carries the look of a child's play, but you have to learn how to do tons of complicated movements that need you to turn and change your hands in all kinds of awkward positions, and you seem to have endless levels for 100 notes to improve you 'score'! You also need to find these uncompromising hidden puzzle pieces, which require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! AND I AM ONLY TO STEP THREE !!!!! Perhaps, if you have no life, you can stay home all the time, but you may get some pleasure from it, but otherwise stay away! And it's definitely not recommended for kids - they'll roll out their hair in the hour!
