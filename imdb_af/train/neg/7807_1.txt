I selected this DVD from the Dollar store. The DVD was on the 2 for $ 1 rack, but since it had Michael Madsen in it, I thought that since I never saw the movie, I bought it anyway. <br /> <br /> I have to say I'm not 'It's like the movie. The movie is more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. I found that the director's use of flashbacks didn't add me to the story line. I would prefer to see the story line in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I won't throw it away like one of the other commentators, but it may be quite a while before I consider this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since it was Michael Madsen's movie debut, it might have some archive value on any future date.
