Oh yeah, the Sci Fi Channel still produces yet another horrible movie. I was especially taken by the screens immediately after the accident where, if the survivors desperately sought matches, at least half a dozen fires burned ?? with no clear reason ?? at various points of the wreck. Fire was always a dominant theme. They searched bodies for lighters and matches, and eventually a box built a fire every day for, believe, 12, but no one ever gathered wood. Then when the vegan (hah) burned the bodies, what did she use for an acceleration? I mean these guys were frozen? Well, maybe not. Despite the seemingly low temperature, everything that ate the meal blew. Maybe it's just me, but even in an incredible story (none of the survivors have ever heard of a yeti or an abominable snowman) to the end. If you take care of the little things, the bigger transactions become more acceptable. Oh, what did the prologue (1972) have to do with the rest of the movie? And the revolver, warm enough to hold in his hand, froze and didn't want to fire. Go break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another extremely beautiful Canadian lass. And with little irony, Ed Marinaro as the coach. <br /> <br /> Well, I might as well add, the rabbit they ate (despite how it looks like chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now if it was a squirrel (or a rat) it would have been a rodent, but it still looks like chicken. And the writers missed a real chance to let someone notice: "It just tastes like ..."
