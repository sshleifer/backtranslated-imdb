I gave this movie a very fair chance, and it betrayed me. It is very little more than a black and white excuse to carry the hell out of the audience, even though the egoist Bogdanavich (who did better with TARGETS) got quite a few hammers in their debut 'good performances'. Many teenage secrets come from this movie, like the teacher's wife, impotence, the ugly prostitute (it is very uncomfortable shot and sharpen things completely, not that things really go completely) and skinny dip. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sexnons, for me it was just annoying. I was much more entertained by cleaning my fingernails than watching this mess.
