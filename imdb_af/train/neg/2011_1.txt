This movie is pure guano. Mom always said if you could say nothing nice, but even Mom would say I had to do my part to warn others about this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that this is the movie that Geoffrey Rush will just leave. I hope Greg Kinnear dismissed his agent. From a cannon to give him the writing. After that, Ben Stiller probably asks someone to stab "There is something else about Mary." I've always been a fan of Wes Studi's, thank you for holding that he wore a mask through the film. Perhaps people will not identify the film with him. <br /> <br /> It begins with promising with a stylistic spoof of the movies from Batman movies and then loses something ... like a coherent plot and half decent effects. <br /> <br /> The jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes, and even then they fall flat. If you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world, see "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! DO NOT AWAY FROM MYSTERY PEOPLE!
