I managed to sneak away one night and go to the cinema to see this one, and I thought I was a surprise. Boy, was I wrong. Taking into account the particular talent, it must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Everyone in it was overlooked, and I find it incredible to read on this site that there are people who really liked it.
