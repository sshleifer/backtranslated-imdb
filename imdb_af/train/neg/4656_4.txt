Unbeatable and irrevocable remake of an old, celebrated English film. Although it can be too much of a total disaster (which it is not), it never builds up tension and its TV origin falls. Richard Burton sleeps through his role, and Sophia Loren's closed (in this movie) face also doesn't show much passion. (**)
