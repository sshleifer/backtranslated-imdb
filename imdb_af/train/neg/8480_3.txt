I can't say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But then I can't say it's one of the worst things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> OK, so it's basically a skating girl, good at it, want to go for an expensive school, can't afford it and have to take a hockey bursary. She has to hide her skate secretly from her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I didn't love the actress playing Katelin. She couldn't cry to save her life, just made laughter sounds, like a toddler pretending to cry to get her own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just an annoying person. The way she tried to do everything good and useful to people. Also the part where the two skaters call her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she pulls the line "make me crazy." <br /> <br /> We all knew where it was going with her and Spencer. Classically they did not like each other and were similar at the end. Just as typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's a movie to see if you want skating, but if you don't mind skater is extremely annoying. It's good to kill time basically.
