I live in Ottawa where this movie was made and I really wish it wasn't. It's a God-horrible movie. I'm really trying to support independent movies, but there is this stigma attached to anything and that stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie does nothing to shed this curse. Actor, writer, director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre, but rather passes tired cliches from movies. I'm really tired of cheating on malicious characters hiding in the shadows and preying on the unsuspecting, it's too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I can remember one scene in particular, near the end of the movie where the whole scene with car lights is illuminated. Now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension, but unfortunately it was to display the shocking budget of this movie. Also, for a movie that dares to call horror, a viewer will be hard pressed to find any real gore, except for a few scenes of maize syrup and red food coloring. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing this film is about is the pacing and lack of character development. The basic plot is that children are kidnapped and the parents have to locate this Bonesetter man before a certain time. to get their children back. Not that this concept obstructs me, but I have not really found it credible that when the two main characters, both of whom have lost children, can get time together. This is done in such a short time that it is unthinkable. My first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the woman before coming out with her. <br /> <br /> The last point I have is .... and I won't like Kelly, but the movie is totally shot at boring, emotional video and it really takes away any timely moments that would have just had style on film. Although this movie was given a million dollar makeover and the story was reconsidered and boring and lame, it couldn't hold the movie of the movie. My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a successor reported on his website, a sequel written halfway through one meeting. <br /> <br /> Help us all.
