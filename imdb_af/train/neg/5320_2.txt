It is a dry and sterile feature filmed on one of the most interesting events of World War II and in the history of warfare behind the front line. Bad drama composition is the worst about this movie as a plot to kill Hitler, supposed to be a pretty dramatic event. There is no character development at all, and the idea that Tom Cruise is supposed to play a high-quality commander with his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and betrayal is completely insane. I believe Mr Bin will play it better. Generally speaking, a good copy of a good German TV movie Stauffenberg looks like from 2004, but can't get close to that movie about any movie aspect at all. However, film, of course, gets its financial goal with popcorn audience that cherishes Hollywood's fast mood and shallow art values.
