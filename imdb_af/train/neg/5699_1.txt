WOW, this movie was so terrible. I'm so glad I didn't need money to see this horrible movie. It was like a history mug that went on a coke binge! the previews made it look decent, but it was VERY bad. I will say the idea sounds decent but come on. it was really very bad. If you sit down and think about it, you will also realize that it was irregular. come back in the day you think they have all those things to work with. It wasn't like Ben Franklin sat down one day and made a damn mystery. it was completely ridiculous, and you want to see a bad movie, then you have to see one. ALL AND ALL LOVE movies are actually on my top 10 WORST movies I've ever seen.
