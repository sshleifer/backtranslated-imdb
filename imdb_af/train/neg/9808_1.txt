The worst show I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who have super powers for some inexplicable reason, and when they use a special device, they morph into strange, poorly designed suits. The acting when they are not in the delayed suit is decent. Definitely not good, but not the worst I have ever seen. But if they wear their suits, the actors' scene goes from bad to worse; much, much worse. The hyper-animated idiots have a multitude of unnecessary movements that they do. Even when they talk, they seem to have seizures. The villains are stupid than the Rangers. Every episode, some weak, idiotic villain, comes up with a plan to destroy the Rangers. He / she then sends a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. The Rangers then start their 10-hour transforming animation, then destroy the aliens. Then, the poorly-designed villain, who is either an armored villain who looks and behaves angry, to a humanoid ladybird creature with trumpets attached to his back, showing clear signs of mental retardation. The Power Rangers fight the villain, then the villain changes into Godzilla, whether it be through a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, they burn nukes to the creatures and creatures become giants). The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes hyper-animating and calling their Zords, which is, of course, toys that show manufacturers use special effects to make them look real. The Power Rangers win, the villain gets angry, they all learn a "valuable" lesson, and the show ends. That's it. Twenty-five minutes of the brain was fake kung fu fighting.
