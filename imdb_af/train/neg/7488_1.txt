Anyone who has seen the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent movie, script and director can compile a comedy masterpiece. Likewise, it's easy to see how the opposite can create a careless Hollywood drill-a-thon! This movie was pathetic! Had it not been for John Cleese (a comic genius), I would have been in this terrible celluloid waste for about 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon won't write another script for this version (he said he couldn't improve at first), and I'm surprised he wouldn't beg for slander after this movie movie of humor! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a wonderful job in The Original, what did the producers think about throwing this one? How can the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny? I don't know, but one thing I know --- it's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming increasingly popular.
