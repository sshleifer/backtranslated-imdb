This is a strange sex comedy because there is very little comedy, but a lot of sex, most of which is happening in the back of a car and is so graphical, makes BASIC INSTINCT an issue of TELETUBBIES. I don't understand, the gender in this movie is in your face, it can only choke you, especially when you look with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO There is not much more mentioned except the language where each sentence contains the F word. It's a somewhat pale hyperrealistic British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the UK's main investor, stating that it was made for low-budget television.
