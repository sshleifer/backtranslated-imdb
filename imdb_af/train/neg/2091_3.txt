I remember watching the SCR pilot. I can describe exactly that night. I remember what chair I was sitting on. The show was magic. It became alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I even enjoyed parts of the third year, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, totally faithful in great hope that it would somehow turn around. Well, it didn't. <br /> <br /> I watched the Caprica pilot and was thrilled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started looking at the regular episodes, and they are becoming increasingly boring. <br /> <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the crazy political correctness of his last failed show, Virtuality. <br /> <br /> Much of his line work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. It was especially early in the past when they followed more or less the pattern of episodes set by the first SCR series. When they left there after meeting with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, it all threw into the pot. It was as if he had written the rest of the show without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will improve. Maybe it was just a few bad initial episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
