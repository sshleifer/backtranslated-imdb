Too much of something borrowed Grade B- <br /> <br /> Superkom Sunday is one of the slowest days at the cinema every year. As a result, the movie studios tend to prevent the release of larger budgeted movies this weekend. Every few years, a studio introduces an anti-programming female skein (2001 "The Wedding Planner") to compete with the big game. This Super Bowl weekend, also called "The Wedding Date," will try to achieve success and attract viewers who don't watch the game. <br /> <br /> Sick people feel sorry for her, single wife, Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, TV's "Will and Grace") appointed a male escort Nick (Dermot Mulrony, "About Schmidt") to her set. boyfriend for her sister's wedding in London. Her family had given her a hard time not to marry her, and her seven-year-old ex-dump, the best man. To make him jealous of Kat Parades Nick to let her ex see what he misses. But eventually, Nick helps Kat to realize she can open, and let someone love her. <br /> <br /> The movie borrows too much from similar wedding movies. It's almost a carbon copy of 1999's "Picture Perfect" and blends into scenes similar to "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding". The film also has a reverse "Pretty Women" theme that goes for it, and the audience knows the client. The director makes clever references to those and other films. <br /> <br /> "The wedding date" has all the clich√© elements of a typical wedding movie, there is the stereotypical overbearing mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde") and almost paved wedding speeches by family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal. The turn at the end was done before, but it was something not quite expected. The real reason Kat was dumped came as a surprise and changed the direction of the movie for the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Although "The Wedding Date" is predictable, it can stand alone. . Debra Messing, in her first lead, proves she can be charming and funny. Dermot Mulrony has good chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogue was too wheat and unrealistic. He can make the best of what he is given and save the character. <br /> <br /> Using very clever words (often sexual), the movie is actually funny. Although the film is mainly a chick spot, components that everyone can enjoy. Feeling good story, and humor makes it the best date movie released in a long time.
