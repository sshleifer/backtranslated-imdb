After watching the movie, the first question that arose in my mind was: Is it ironic or not? After reading some comments on the character Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew this movie was not ironic. So, the story tells us about an American-American Super-Doc who saves a South American republic of evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this one comes so unrealistically that it becomes ridiculous. The compulsory final show shows the worst offer of martial arts I've ever seen. The movie may be interesting for low-budget film designers as a bad example.
