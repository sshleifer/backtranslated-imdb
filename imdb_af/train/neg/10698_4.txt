The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining movie while F. Murray was Abraham in it. Spoilers: About halfway, F.Murray gets zapped, because The Darkling is a kind of devilish creature that lives fiercely. He takes bombs and losers and distorts them while giving everything they want in terms of success. He feeds on the enjoyment of the Seven Deadly Sins. But part of it is that he must get people who are wrong, but not quite angry. Otherwise, he cannot distort their natural goodness. That's what the little one said in his Barry White voice, which I found both charming and amusing. Most amusing. Like Barry White, if he was a little dwarf, he tells Aiden Gillen. "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Forest, Come Eat Here, Dee Plane!" Through the movie Dee Dwarf (actually a robotic cherub) talks to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice and says things like "It's right to be bad, you know you want it." "Now you've committed murder, you're really moving around in the world" and other remarks that sound like commercials for "Being Evil" Stores or something. It's actually hilarious in a sick way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Aiden Gillen is no F. Murray Abraham, and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the ax (or clips?). F. Murray brings some happy malice to his role in this movie. He's a good actor. Aiden Gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smile on his face, and he may look like his remedial English Comp. class never hit the mythological characters and he couldn't think about what the movie was about. The END is very creepy and yet almost comical. If this movie were a parody, the end was perfect. If it wasn't a parody, it was creepy; but a cheap use of a little girl to spend a great deal that the movie itself couldn't deliver. The people who made this movie lost everything they wanted, somewhere before the end. It ends just as they just realized they lost money and had to make a quick end.
