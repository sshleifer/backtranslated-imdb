"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations and not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically, here's the show: The Cavemen is an alternative race, they are biased, etc. Sometimes the stupidest idea ever created; almost worthy of imprisonment for the authors. On one show the cavemen went to a club, tried to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. It was reminded of listening to a 22 minute Andy Rooney dialogue, followed by death by steak knives via midget cannibals. For those who have not seen this show, here is an example of the dialogue: "You're sure you're ready to go out with a cave man." "Yes, it's good. I had like 10 thousand!" Hilarious ... Probably the best writing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes of cave dwellers with horrible make-up, tackle difficult social problems ... Sounds like an entertaining evening. I also love how bad the recent ideas are that they are dedicated to making a sitcom out of car insurance ads. I wonder if they're going to do the Gecko next, so I can get a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I'd even say it's worse than "Viva Laughlin." At least, "Viva Laughlin" was ripped off from something that was somewhat inspired. <br /> <br /> Shows like this let me hope there is a comet out there somewhere on earth. <br /> <br /> Incredibly honest ...)
