It's pretty ridiculous, I hope many people are exposed to Muslims living all over the US, UK, and around the world. The religion has more than a billion followers. I myself was born and bread in America and through my religious classes and teachings I have learned to nurture and work my country to contribute to society. I am devoted to the successes and teachings of my religion that have been emphasized by life to educate themselves and prepare for success through education to return to the world. I knew many Muslims from all over and I traveled to countries like Pakistan. I met another person who believes that we should hurt someone or not accept any other religion, except for the people in the media ... I wonder why ... It is also sad that these extremists are those who use the media to represent a whole religion. It's a one billion people religion, and it's less than one percent. I'm sure the other peoples of other religions don't like to be represented by the KKK, IRA and much more, who are simply small percentage of extremists who use outdated and not literal portions of the respected books for their own revenge, personal or business affairs to follow their so-called religion
