Let me start by saying that I really liked Betty Grable, especially from "Down Argentine Way", but by the time she got disaster, she also became "around" and frankly the whole movie was a embarrassment. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who had to be pretty desperate) the story was bad, the colors good and the movie too long. It had some of the old standby's like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to stimulate interest, but with no success. The music score was despondent, and I have to say that not one thing was remembered in any way. If I were such a fan of Miss Grable, I always wish I had never seen this one!
