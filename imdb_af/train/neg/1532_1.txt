Although I warned properly, I actually sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I usually give each movie an even break, and because I thought a single movie might not be that bad. I'm getting fixed. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey like sinking a bunch of bricks. Only once during this humiliating transvest of a spoof I laughed. On behalf of Simon says the scene. The other jokes are either poorly executed or simply unsuitable. And some of them actually see you a mile away. This movie just doesn't have to be a good parody like Airplane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III), or Scary Movie. They all have A. funny gags, B. good dialogue and most important of all C. memorable quotes. Men in White have none of the above. To call this movie will be a gross understatement. Avoid this movie you can! Consider Yourself Warned!
