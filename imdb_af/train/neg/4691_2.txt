A real blow up of the movie literally. This British movie is annoyed. <br /> <br /> What an exciting plot! A terror places bombs on a train. How can the authors and producers of this stinker change it in such a dull story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, as the expert defused the bomb, is given terrible writing to work with. Of course, just as he was called in, his wife, Anne Vernon, was about to leave. No wonder we never heard from Miss Vernon. After such a movie it will be enough to end her career. <br /> <br /> The elderly man who loved and interfered with trains is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I thought it was very offensive to show this man, even at the end.
