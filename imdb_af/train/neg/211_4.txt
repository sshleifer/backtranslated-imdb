Hilariously obvious "drama" about a lot of high school kids (who I think), enjoying non-stop hip hop, dancing dance, graffiti and trying to become a DJ at the Roxy - or something. To be honest, I was so bored, I forgot! Even people who love the music agree, this movie has acted terribly and - as a drama - fails failed. We are supposed to find these children enjoyable and enjoyable. I found them dirty and dull. The one I really hated was Ramon. He does graffiti on subway trains and it is considered great. Excuse me? He is damaging public property that she is not starting with. Also these "big" children are tapping into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at a deserted building. Uh huh. So we're supposed to love a lot of law switches and find fun. <br /> <br /> I could forgive all this if the music was good, but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre and they were nonstop! They always play ALWAYS! It came to the point that I was quickly through the many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you have a 30 minute movie - maybe). There are some imaginative numbers - the metro dance fight, a really funny Santa number and the Roxy show climate. If you like hip hop, it's your movie. But it looks for good drama mixed - forget about it. Also HOW did it get a PG rating? There is an incredible amount of curse in this.
