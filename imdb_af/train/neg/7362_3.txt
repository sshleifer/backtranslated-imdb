An average TV movie quality, completely formula story of religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who gives good. "I'm not just the President of 'Psychos R Us,' I'm also a client. '') What controls a get biochemical virus (think the virus from the movie "The Rock") It is bad for him that he is also thrown into a bank building during an earthquake with bank robberies and government agents trying to stop him (led by the impressive , physical, poorly entertaining Wolf Larson, supported by Fred Dryer) with the standard "in The wrong place at the wrong time" Spanky Female (Erika Eleniak forever) and "live as a wimp but at the last minute as" a hero died "man (Brandon Karrer). Has the default background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic (woman and boy killed in a police attack a few years ago). <br /> <br /> Basically a decent rainy day movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite line, talked by Ron Perlman w words after hiding the bottle of virus hidden in Erika Eleniak's fission: a woman and her mystery. "<br /> <br /> worth a rent.
