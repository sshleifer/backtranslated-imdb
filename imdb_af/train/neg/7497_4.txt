After seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out that Spike Lee was live, I was excited to hear about this event. I wasn't alive then, I didn't live in New York, so I expected more of a history lesson than anything. What I got was an interesting play, lots of sex, and about 30 minutes of film that had something to do with the Son of Sam. I think the movie is not about the Son of Sam, but it was a glance in the summer of '77. Notice me disappointed. <br /> <br />
