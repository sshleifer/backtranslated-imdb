This movie should be called "Plan 9 of Joseph Smith." I think his strangeness is underestimated. The playwright seems to read Paul Ehrlich's "The Population Bomb (1968)," and made a musical response made especially to Mormons. The whole point of the game is that having as many children as you can is part of the plan of "heavenly fathers" (god). And everything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad. get it? <br /> <br /> This version was filmed in 1989, which is confusing. It is utah, so it seems and feels like 1983, the play was actually written in 1973, and of course the theology is part of the 1840s, part battlestar galactica. Some of the action takes place on earth and some in the "pre-existence, an aimless body room where annoying children wait to get their bodies to come down, try not to hit the door on the missionaries, honesty. <br /> <br /> These are such stages as they come, but don't let the poor potatoes spoil your appreciation for this demented Mormon universe where the 'cool kids' are all in population control, (presumably) counseling Parents no longer have children! With large families when the play was written, the cultural norm in the LDS community, and more importantly as part of God's plan, the church has since a 180-year-old family planning a choice made of the parents, and big families are now much less the cultural norm. Make the whole doctrinal presentation of the movie for a contemporary mormon moth! <br /> <br /> ahhh but it's really as good as the music. There are some catchy songs that just don't fl will not allow the death of the 1970s for which it was destined. the brother and sister sing a few love songs to each other that make you wonder if there might be something else going on - wink. And the tough, cool kids make new kids on the block like metallica. so shout it all! Collect the family, make some jell-o shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
