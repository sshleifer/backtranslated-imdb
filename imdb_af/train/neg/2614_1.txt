A follow-up of (actually a remake of) Disney's 1996 live remake of 101 Dalmations. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after she healed a doctor called Dr. Pavlov (ugh!) From her obsession with fur. But the "healing" was broken when Cruella heard the toll of Big Ben, and she again put on a crazy quest to make herself the perfect dress from Dalmatian skins. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it is a "Thanksgiving Family Schlock" movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Includes over-over-trade as Cruella. With everything she had to get into this movie - the lame script, the endless makeup, and finally baked in a cake. I hope they gave her a huge salary. <br /> <br /> (What, where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line and a candle light restaurant all located in the same building - like you in the climax of This movie is?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs. They serve as the "Macaulay Culkin's" of this movie, which is all the silly "Home Alone" gags on the villains. (Bite them in the cross, walk over their hands with luggage carts, spray them with icing sugar etc. Etc., Etc.). I have to admit that the dogs were pretty good actors - much better than the people. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is totally wasted in this movie as a freaked-out French furrier. The two human "dog lovers" - who were repeated from the previous movie but with different actors - are completely boring. When they enjoy a spaghetti meal at an Italian restaurant, the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home and watches Lady and the Tramp's dinner. I thought to myself, "Oh, please, don't go there!" I expected the people half to do a satire on the "Lady and the Tramp" dinner - as did Charlie Sheen in "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - doing the "spaghetti beach" and the meatball with his nose pressure, etc. <br /> <br /> Don't start me on the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice. <br /> <br /> The costumes were nominated for an Oscar and the costumes in the movie * are good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. The rest is unbearable liquor.
