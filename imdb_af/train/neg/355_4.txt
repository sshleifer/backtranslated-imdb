Just Cause is one of those movies that only makes you wonder why it was so heavy when it came out - nothing special, but capable enough and with an excellent supportive performance from Ed Harris. Then you become the third and everything becomes stupid, until you have a killer with a flashlight that was threatened on his forehead, which is the Sean Connery's wife (a typical and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and a child (a very young Scarlet Johannsen) in an alligator shining shack. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie that is probably best seen on a plane, and even then only once.
