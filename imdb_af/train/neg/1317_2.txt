When the people at Kino Video compiled their fine "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collection, a multi-cassette selection of silent comedies, someone decided to kick off the first installment with ONE too much (1916), an obscure one. Rule Farce, who starred in Florida played the very young Oliver Hardy. As enjoyable as the set is over, this decision was unfortunate, because ONE is too much a very poor movie that almost discourages the viewer from looking further. Like any typical farce, this fraud involves scams inspired by greed, panic if plans go wrong, and complications that rise to the point of absurdity, but unlike the good, ONE is too much unobtrusive, infallible and really annoying. It is difficult to say at this stage whether the hopelessly confusing plot is due to missing footage or inactive movie production, but whatever the cause, even the most cautious viewer does not have the idea of ​​what character relationships are or what happens, and by the end one does not care anymore. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest here is to see the 24-year-old "Babe" Hardy, who looks much heavier than he did a decade later when he worked together. Stan Laurel, but who is full of youthful energy. In the openingstone, waking up with a hangover, Babe performs a highly athletic back roll of a bed. Trust me, it's as funny as this movie gets. If you read it before you see the first cassette of Kino's "Slapstick Encyclopedia", I suggest you move fast and go for the good things.
