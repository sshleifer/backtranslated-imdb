Honestly before I watched this movie, I heard many people said this movie was a shame. I didn't think Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took roles in this movie and saw it myself. Apparently they were right. I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie. Why did I see this movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, I didn't expect much from Justin, as he really didn't belong in the movie / theater. business. But Morgan and Kevin? I couldn't stop asking how they agreed to participate in Edison. To be honest, their roles are rather stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, you can think if the players suck, then I have to pay more attention to the story. It is indeed the story that is at the heart of a movie, but guys ... trust me ... it's not a movie you want to give credit for his story. Imagine a sound journalist (Justin Timberlake) writing a story against the system while learning how to become a "real" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All of this was supported by one agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they beat the system with a happy final story. <br /> <br /> Jeez, I couldn't even keep it. Just remembering the movie I am sick. My advice guys, don't see it! Please save your money and time for another movie.
