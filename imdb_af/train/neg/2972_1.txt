My teacher signed it and showed it to us in Child Care to demonstrate how teenage pregnancy affects people. It just demonstrated how teenage pregnancy becomes a childish jocke, not well educated on how sex works and a shiny, unmarried girl who throws fruit when she is angry and can't tell she was with the wrong man, even he carried a sign saying he was like that. I won't be surprised if the baby's father had about eight girlfriends in the first issue of the screenplay. Stacy's (the baby's bearer) mother is a riot. She is unaware of the fact that her daughter is past the age of four and apparently becomes unashamed when people spy on her dining room window. Bobby's (father's) best friend's name is Dewey, and is a clear ripe of Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is horrible, simply because none of the characters is credible. Thanks, it's just made for TV, which limits the public's chances of viewing it.
