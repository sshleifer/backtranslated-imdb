Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993, presumably based on the Japanese sentai television program that started in the 1970s. Now as a fan of Japanese action movies and series, you'd think I'll get a kick from this show. <br /> <br /> You can't be wrong anymore. Working in the Japanese version has become a complete horror of television with mighty morphine carriers. <br /> <br /> MMPR is based on five teenagers who get power to get costumes, with robotic dinosaurs forming an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Now, this performance is more far-fetched and more laughable than anything in Transformers movie, but the ridicule of this show is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> That's followed by two really bad ones, and I mean, very bad movies, and the actors in this series disappeared completely from the scene. <br /> <br /> If you choose, try to watch Japan's Zyuranger series. <br /> <br /> What's with the terribly long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys? It makes them all look feminine!
