I have to say I was very curious to watch this movie and it was considered a notorious disaster when it was released in the 1970s by Fox. It also played a list of bad films at several critics, and it only exacerbated interest. I just had to see what made this movie so bad. As I see it, I think I have my answers. Although I will say it makes curious look, the acting, direction and writing are so laughingly bad that the supposed satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch wants to try to carry the film, but after the opening sequence of the gender change, the film goes so far from the mountain that she cannot handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is definitely no help as he learns well on the screen, sometimes he seems to be wondering what he is doing there. Rex Reed walks around like Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. Bravo for debut shows! Farrah Fawcett plays a stupid blonde; She was convincing in this role. But, of course, the most notorious role was probably in Mae West. The sight of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos looks more suited to a horror movie. I don't mean to put this role down; but in this movie no one comes out to look good. The direction seems so unkempt and non-existent, that the film is not only bad, but also boring. Throw in old movie films from old stars, and the movie is even more disconnected. For each one of its own to anyone who enjoyed it, and I was glad I at least saw it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster it has always been from the beginning.
