I have to say this is a terrible movie, for the fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary. As I watched it, I started laughing, thinking of myself, does this man actually expect me to believe it's real? So I had to look it up and now see that it is a movie, but now that it is not a documentary, it is now a movie with bad acting. So, anyway, it's pretty bad. I really didn't make it to the end. I had to turn it off. I am a NYC police officer and felt that someone was trying to trick people into thinking it was a documentary, with the intention of making money for a terrible day for me and my colleagues. So, I made it a little personal. Maybe I'm blinded to it, and it's not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
