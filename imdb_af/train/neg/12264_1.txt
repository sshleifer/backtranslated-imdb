You get 5 writers together, each writing a different story with a different genre, and then trying to make one movie out of it. It's action, it's adventure, it's sci-fi, it's western, it's a mess. Sorry, but this movie absolutely bumps. 4.5 gives it a very high rating. That said, it's movies like what makes me think I can write movies, and I can hardly write.
