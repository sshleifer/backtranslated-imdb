I was fully in office to see this movie. I waited a year for it to be cleared in New Zealand. I didn't have to build up so much, because it was so disappointing and without doubt Clark's worst movie. There is so much wrong with this movie. First, some of the plays are great, especially Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't remember her name), but most of it was so unimportant and incredibly incredible. , especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is now a veteran of Clark's movies and he was so brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invested his lines with such a ceremony to turn his scenes almost into a parody. The script felt that it was written by a first-year film student. No pity, a high school student ... one who has never seen a movie. And I couldn't satisfy Clark's intentions. Did he try to show the meaningless of these children's existence? Certainly, like hell, he didn't stop him from getting into a damn good pervert. I'm not prudent, but I didn't need teen breasts and buttocks every ten minutes. I still like Clark's best movie 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I don't think he'll ever overdo it.
