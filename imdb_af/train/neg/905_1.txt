An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) is conceived by a rich man (Stephen Collins). He offers her a sense of obligation to marry her, but she flatters and decides to lift the child alone. Things go well until the kid, named Jenny (Trini Alvarado), becomes a teenager and things get worse (and predictable). <br /> <br /> I saw both the silent version and the audio version of Stella Dallas. No one has affected me much (and I cry easily), but they were well made if it was dated. To restore it in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I think Midler has enough power to get the incomprehensible success of "Beaches". Bombed it (predictably). The story is laughing and dated by today's standards. Although Midler and Alvarado perform well, this film really pulls out and I was boring at the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) don't help support roles. Bulky and boring. Really - who thought it would work? See the 1937 Stanwellck version instead. I give it a 1.
