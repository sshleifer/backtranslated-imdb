Here's what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The head of BBC3 needs to make programs aimed at different audiences for BBC1 and BBC2 to keep license and work. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers his unfunny friends. <br /> <br /> 3) Head of BBC3 understands, ignores the fact that they are not funny. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, it's probably racist, as everyone plays the characters to bad stereotypes. If a white person has done this kind of thing, there will be a riot! <br /> <br /> Trash.
