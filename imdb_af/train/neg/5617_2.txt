This documentary film is based on incomplete evidence of the evidence, in which Brian Flemming may have deliberately failed to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most critical error is one of the earliest: His claims about the disability of Paul's testimony of Jesus Christ ignore important facts, such as: ** The existence of some formulated creeds in Paul's letters. These allegations indicate that most of the central claims about Jesus have already been formulated in faith declarations within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. ** The testimonies of the early Christians cannot be cast out as mere fantasy. Indeed, there were many people claiming to be the Messiah during that time, but only one of them remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would be that the Christians were actually despised, the Messiah was going to die for those beliefs if they knew he was not resurrected. ** Even though the gospels are more liberal dated, we are still talking about Jesus' writings written within the lives of other witnesses who pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I say is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-sufficient piece of work that contains a variety of arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian view. Don't be fooled by poor investigation.
