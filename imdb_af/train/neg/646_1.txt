I accidentally saw this movie and this movie was an accident. Well, it must be. blonde women are stalked, the villain who appears, disappears from one place to another, then disappears and reappears. He wasn't even a superhero, so I don't know how he did it. cat and it's not hard to do. <br /> <br /> The old "mirror in the bathroom" is just no more frightening, but it stopped quite years ago. you had the police on the trail of the villain, another cliché (played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent, he is from London). The director didn't have an idea and made a movie full of clichés "which was a comedy, was frightening. Pathetic!
