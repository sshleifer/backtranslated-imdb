I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through some things I thought could be improved; the acting, writing, directing, special effects, camera crew, sound and lighting. It also seemed as if the authors had nothing to do with the movie. Apparently back in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy a super-advanced stealth bomber that would be completely invisible for $ 75 million. These days cost about $ 3 billion and it can't be invisible. Apparently you can fly from the US to the Middle East within an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I didn't care about, but it was like a lame effort to get more guys to see it. The camera will randomly switch on actors and switch to random scenes. Oh yes, as it is a Steven Segal movie, it is predictable as hell. All in all, I ranks it right there with snakes on a plane.
