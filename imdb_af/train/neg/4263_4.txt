Disappointing movie. Actor performance is poor. Sets are good, could have been better. The story is also poor. Battle order is terrible. Sound and quality of the movie is trashy. The history of Kazakh people was very poorly told. This film had included more Kazakh actors in leading roles. And also had to be in Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are the Spanish origin. I don't get it. Since when Spanish people play Turkish-Mongolian people. This film is disgraceful to the Kazakh theater. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. Czekh director is excused as he does not have nomadic origin, he cannot know the true spirit and history of nomads.
