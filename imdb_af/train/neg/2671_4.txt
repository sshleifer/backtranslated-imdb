** MAY SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The titular topless heroine saves another beautiful babe and her dad (an eccentric professor whose pith helmet is broken in one shot and hell in the next) a moth-eaten, dime-store mummy and nasty Nazis - what else? - Build a fourth empire. Misty's costume, like that of some other eyelashes, becomes duller than the movie cast. The last part of the film is devoted to stretched lesbian action; these footage is actually boring, actually fast, which tells more of the cattle behind the camera than the curved creatures before it. MISTY gets his nominal plot off the road first and fast, and then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft core sex. It makes MUMMY RAIDER a throw back to films made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this miracle came out four decades ago, it would have been playing on 42th street for years, along with WHAM BAM, THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it is, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to the home video. Grab your, quickly, before it gets out of print.
