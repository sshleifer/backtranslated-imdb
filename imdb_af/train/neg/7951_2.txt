I gave 'Kôhî jikô' a low score because it was not a bad movie, but because it did nothing worth praising. <br /> <br /> I didn't see any of Hsiao-hsien Hou's work, but for the uninitiated (included) 'Kôhî jikô' is advertised as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was in 1962). The film is a very sparse job ... with very little dialogue, story, music or emotion. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays 'Yoko' an unemployed, winding character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or explores a Taiwanese composer she wants. Tadanobu Asano plays her friend, who works in a CD store and sometimes welcomes his otaku interest in trains. And it's all about it. <br /> <br /> We watch Yoko drinking coffee alone ... walking around ... waiting for a train ... catching a train ... sleeping on the train. The nature of everyday reality that anyone in Japan can see every day. Keep capturing these ordinary moments of these characters alive, but without any significance for these vignettes it is a completely senseless movie to make or watch.
