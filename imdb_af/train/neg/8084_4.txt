I chose this title from a friend who put it in his extensive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so luckily I didn't pay it personally for it. I had an intrusion that it would be a bad movie, but I know what a very bad movie after watching. Children should not play with dead things and the amazingly strange creatures that have ceased to live and become mixed zombies, and now there is nothing really bothering me unless it is amazingly bad. <br /> <br /> Sun crisis is bad, but it doesn't reach that sweet spot of absolute pain some movies are. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the common plot is that the sun is about to ignite a large sunburn to the earth that will essentially destroy it. In order to counter this threatening threat, mankind has compiled a spaceship and crew responsible for firing an antimatter bomb (which describes the opening as the largest explosive ever) in the sun, which is a logic of some winding science. will cause the flare to shoot at another angle and leave the earth unharmed. <br /> <br /> Remember that what I just described to you looks like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with an ensemble cast (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can barely manage the level of mediocrity, thanks to a simple plot, but still stupid as time goes on. <br /> <br /> The coronation performance of this movie debacle is the addition of a villainous character (played by Boyle) who insists on sabotaging the mission. Through what is never explained, he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad hairstyle to control a kind of vague electronic mind control over the spacecraft's genetically engineered scientist. It is played by the female head, Annabel Schofield. Why does he sabotage the mission? For, according to his moronic point of view, he believes the flare will not happen and that he will not really make it rich because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market. In fact, you have a villain with the most absurd, stupid, motive imaginable. <br /> <br /> The movie's plot is incredibly past and evolved very slowly, with the time the use of characters uses only vague or useless short roles in the storyline. I could sit here and explain exactly what happens to the fact that the scriptwriter is not quite impossible to make a plot that is actually busy or attention, but I sit here and write this review on Microsoft Word and I know for a the fact that this would take three pages, and I will only succeed in losing your interest. But then you will probably have the same effect of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie has gone miserably with a very poor dialogue. Imagine if everything ever happened on the Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters were playing sci-fi jargon back and forth on each other. Yes, I know, they are already doing it, but think if it is ALL they did, and what they used, says jargon to compile vague and unnosensitive scenes that do not cause any excitement, tension or interest in the viewer . <Br /> <br /> This is the best example of the point when a character in a Zero-G environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before crying in the pain for a few minutes before it suddenly explodes. The script refers earlier to the character who is at risk of explosion, but does not save to give a solid answer as to why or how it happens, and also why he cannot really escape. In total, you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Then we have several scenes where dramatic build-up does not lead to anything. Jack Palance's show is wasted on a character who only serves to drive the boy-hero (not asking) around the desert, before being hit by a bunch of packs. On his deathbed, Palance finally tells our son's hero his name (while wearing a terribly bruised makeup that seems like someone is putting a balloon under his eyeball), for which he had previously stopped. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats it quietly after he expires, giving viewers the impression that the name is of interest later in the film. Perhaps Charlton Heston's grizzled admiral character knows him and the plot will progress as soon as his name is repeated. Something. Anything. <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. Any hope you have will break apart when this moment seems to be another of many pathetic, failed attempts to create drama? For a character so flat and hacked that it will forever be a spot on Palance's career, just like the rest of the role-play is also equal. <br /> <br /> Completing the movie is a painful sudden end with Schofield who manages the bomb in the middle of the sun in an effort to save her actions while under the villain's game, " A climax that contains another of the film's well-done visual effects series, which even for the visibly elaborate care in them still manages to make the film look as chintzy as it really is. The saddest part of this movie is the obviously big budget, which is tragically messed up on a stinker of a screenplay and a supporting role behind Boyle, Heston and Palance who managed to get the coffin nailed with pure overworking. <br /> <br /> Degree: D-
