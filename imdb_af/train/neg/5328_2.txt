Susan Seidelman had a decent career with some top credits under her belt. I'm sure she's come back from this movie that looks to her admirers. I am not one of them. <br /> <br /> I performed better in high school plays than I did in Smithers. The plot as it is involved with young Susan Berman who is ambitious to make it into the world of music and is willing to do anything to get there. She even rejects the sincere progress of a young artist playing from the East River bus played by Brad Rhine. <br /> <br /> Young Mr. Rhine carries the worst performance in the film, in fact one of the worst acting works I've seen long ago. No wonder he didn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one to capture the well-known East Village places where the movie is mostly shot. But her work with her vibrant artists did not notice. I'm not sure she has so much raw material to work with. <br /> <br /> Look quickly and you'll see a very young Christopher Noth ahead of Law and Order and Sex in the City as a Street Hut. <br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can put it for the soundtrack. I'll stay with Bing Crosby.
