Semana Santa is jaw-drop bad. It's so wrong, in so many ways, I don't know where to start. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose judge was shot while she was protecting her, went from Madrid to Seville for her police work. During the holy week (Semana santa, see? ... everyone starts to sleep asleep. Say it was bad in so many points, even from the beginning), a killer feeds his victims like bulls into a fighter. His teams with male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and fine Feodor Atkine. Soon she discovers that she will be the next target of the killer (wearing a red cloak). Why, oh, but why? <br /> <br /> Why ..; That's the question the whole movie is in my head. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did I see it A: Because I love Mira Sorvino (I excuse her even for the FIRST SIG crap) Q: Why were we only 8 people in the theater on Saturday at first week of release? A: ah-ah-ah. Spider-man resurrected the same day. But also the fact that the movie exploded with impeccable reviews. <br /> <br /> Q: Why was this movie made? A: Money I think. But son needed Mira the money. <br /> <br /> why ... why ???????????? First of all, there is always something wrong with European co-productions. here you have a French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. Yi-ha. <br /> <br /> It wants to play the same drama as US thrillers / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / whatever. Even VALENTINE, although unnecessarily and poorly written and shot, was much better in tension and fun. <br /> <br /> To give some credit to the story, the scriptwriter wanted to add a political view to the story. Wrong: in traffic jams in traffic-like photography, it's definitely the most interesting thing I'm in the movie. It could hold it, it didn't have to sit through the whole movie. Better go straight to Guillermo del Tros' THE BACKBONE (El espinazo del diablo) for some clever fun. <br /> <br /> Then the homophobia is. Bullseye! The first victims are S & M drug addict gay twins who have been stabbed to death. The annoying olivier Martinez goes to a dating agency held by a heavily shaved overweight transplant with a blonde platinum wig. Call me Sorvino's character a big dive all the time. Do we need these kinds of things? Nah. Just unnecessary offensive remarks, just like oltimes. <br /> <br /> Then the tension is. Yipee. No apparent motive. The first murders are a simple illusion, as it is a representation of a famous painting. But no. And the revelation of the murderer (a terrible fascist, of course) could have been done from the beginning, as he appeared at the end of the film, because it was time for the director to say, "Weel, time for it To finish damn movie, let's reveal who the killer is and why he kills. "<br /> <br /> Then the director thinks he's a director. Wrong: no sense of tension, no sense to direct the actors, no knowledge of change of pace. A giant, mega-drill. The scenes of the holy week are unnecessary (perhaps a co-production line that says: ok, shoot in Seville, but show some credits from this beautiful and historic city with the celebrations of Easter. There we are: a riddle for tourists!) <br /> <br /> Then the actors. All wrong. Mira Sorvino leads her to death: she does almost nothing but be stabbed in the right hand. Everything she did best (Replacement Killers, Mighty Aphrodite ...) was as they never did. Olivier Martinez ... hello, someone here? When the producers will learn that he is not an actor, but a mannequin with no ability to speak or feel? Feodor Atkine, fine and transparent. We only pay great respect for Alida Valli, one of the greatest actress this past century (and I hope for even more roles in this present). Here she is the main attraction here because she is the only one who gives life to her poor lines. I won't call the other actors, because they are just one-sided characters, uninteresting and level. <br /> <br /> Incoherent direction, conflicting actors, unreliable plot. Idiocy incarnated. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
