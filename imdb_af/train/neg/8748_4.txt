It was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words, but very naive on the corporate world. The Justice Department will catch more of the bulk carriers if they have done such naive things. The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, but every bit as a sinister. I seriously doubt that anyone would actually kill anyone directly, even the mod is more indirect these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, toxins, and so on. This movie has to be developed by some car sexes, I think, and the studios didn't know the difference. They just wanted something on the Microsoft antitrust case to capitalize on the news.
