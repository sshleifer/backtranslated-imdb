Man, it gets very good reviews in the review books. Honestly, I found it slow and unattractive from the beginning. I kept waiting to pick it up a little steam, but it never happened. This movie is overestimated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, with King James English, has never addressed me, so it can be me. There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film, as they show that Ronald Colman plays the role of Othello. <br /> <br /> The good points of the movie include - thanks to a restored print - a decent cinematography and a young, sleek and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's just too boring, too much repetition in some of the screens to watch again. In addition, we all know that most actors are utility cases, anyway, but kudos to Hollywood to demonstrate it here in this story.
