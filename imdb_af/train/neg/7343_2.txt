Ever heard of a Taiwanese horror movie? Or any Taiwan movie? Propably for a reason. This one was a very boring one, although it was black magic, including withered baby bodies and people who exploded inside with thousands of poles. <br /> <br /> After reading other people's thoughts, I was looking forward to some violence and gore, but not much at all. A few bleeding and other lame things, if you're waiting for graphic gore or any horrific effects you will be disappointed. They clearly did not use all the exploration and other things to their maximum. <br /> <br /> Nothing good about this movie; a single character that was not quite lean and some OK black magic spells, like the eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect didn't work at all, the most horrible thing was an albino girl (not so scary really). It's the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
