I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim, the now-dried 80's drug-abusive child star is common, and commenting on back-up of underage characters / actors would be senseless; Needless to say they were all very average. It's a cool movie as a journey in the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless, though sensible plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, don 't waste your time watching it unless you love 80's movies, Corey Haim, or as I love, love old school Porsches (this one looks particularly good) because life is too short to watch crappy movies.
