This movie is a waste of movie stock. Do you believe the map of a military mission plan on a spectacle on a verandah in a broad daylight is placed for anyone with a binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to watch? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a DEAF person would actually be employed in the active service camp in Europe during WWII to serve in a "Negro" unit ... cook, supply services, funeral details, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a black (and presumably intelligent) officer will choose the same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active battle mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the allies arrived? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that the DAV soldier didn't realize that a German plane was approaching from behind and would kill and kill him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers would put their emotions out of the German soldiers who were just 50 'in a barn at a farm on the farm where the Germans were acting? They did it in this movie, and left any possible entrances to the barn, the Germans could check completely unprotected. Would you believe that the captain over the airwaves and in clear English called the general's rank, if not his name, as the person with whom he speaks and that the general, in clear English about open air waves, said the dam should is protected the next day? Perhaps they should just have sent in a delegate to tell what direction the US attack would come, just to make it a little easier on the Germans. This so-called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst movies. If it was, I'm sure it'll do well. Look at your own risk.
