I got this DVD from a friend, who got it from someone else (and it probably goes on.) Even the cover of the DVD looks cheap, just like the whole movie. Shootings and fist battles with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple plot, made me laugh until my stomach was hurt! With very little financial resources, I have to admit it looks pretty professional. When a movie is seen, it was one of 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks that nobody waits for. So: if you are tired and want a cheap laugh, see this movie. If not, throw it out of the window.
