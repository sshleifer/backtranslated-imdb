I noticed that this movie was the source of many insults. It probably earned some of them, but it wasn't that bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I don't hate this movie, but try to tell a story. As a drama, this movie can really work. I just think the filmmakers went wrong which way to go when they made it (they had to add more funny pieces if they wanted it to be comedy). With a rewrite it could be a good movie. But as a satire, it has not worked in its current form - many scenes do not fit within the context of the plot: for example, the rooftop scene makes little sense in the story. Yet it wasn't the worst independent movie ever made - is it in the Top 10 Worst? This is debatable.
