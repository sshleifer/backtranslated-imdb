CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> While visiting Rome, an amorous nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo is in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romance is opposed to Castelnuovo's rich father (Massimo Serato). And the fate has a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> A sex-filled love story for the swinging sixties, adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas 'La Dame aux Camelias') by author writer Michael DeForrest, and with freewheeling flair by Radley Metzger, who, along with Russ Mayer and Joe Sarno, are credited with redefining the parameters of 'Adult' festival in the 1960s and 70s. Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita', with the scope for the last time in his career, is rich in visual surplus (for example, the emphasis on reflective surfaces), although the film's sexual fever looks exciting through modern standards. Production values ​​are thoroughly attractive, and performances are encouraging and human (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are especially memorable), despite poor post-sync dubbing. Though set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's wacked-out designs find the film firmly in its era, and Piero Piccioni's wah-wah music party has become something of a cult item among exploiters. Eventually, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of these directors' elegant soft-erotic eroticism will not be disappointed. Next for Metzger was the LICKER QUARTET (1970), many of which considered his best film.
