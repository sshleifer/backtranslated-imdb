The Blood Sugar leads the dance - which is a laughable title, it is so completely misleading. It is not surprising that the filmmakers are trying to deceive us because it is a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island. <br /> <br /> There is very little happening in this movie. And if something awakens the viewer from its silence, it's always unintentional comedy in the form of a horrible dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice artists. These guys are so bad that they make the actors deliver their voices to appear like a group of remedial-level morons. It's really hard to figure out how bad the act is when copying this awkward copy. But the voice artists cannot be blamed for the writing. It's travesty. Inadvertently funny at best, pathetic at worst. The story in general is, at least, uneven. The women's characters are especially idiotic; The men are either creepy or boring. <br /> <br /> The whole business is focused on the pure exploitation of the audience. It does not give away what it promises and even when the murders (eventually) happen, they all come out of the screen. All we get is a few half-hearted cut heads. <br /> <br /> Some people said this movie is a giallo. I cannot agree with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys Italian vibrators should give this movie a wide cab, as there is nothing exciting about it. It's basically a soft core film with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic either. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it to anyone.
