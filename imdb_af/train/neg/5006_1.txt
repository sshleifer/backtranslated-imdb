Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only dislike everyone from the dislike, but they have little or no redeeming features to make a * hear or empathize with any of the characters. There are movies so bad they are good (a La Wood or Tod Slaughter movie), and it's just bad (like 99% of your Boll's "work"). This movie is barely tolerant, even if you are a brilliant talented MSTie rider (eg Mystery Science Theater 3000). Lucky as I am quite talented in this respect (that's how my mind works All The Time), for those who aren't so talented in MSTie riffing, finally in this * movie, you just want to pull your own head off, painfully aware of the movie "Taboo" rob you of about an hour and twenty minutes, you will never come back. Even my MSTie talents were hardly a game for this slow pace, boring waste of time. The most enigmatic aspect of this movie is that * someone * is green and / or funded ... I just hired "Taboo" for the normally talented Amber Benson, who had to be fetched from this movie. I still have a lesser-known movie of her in my rental queue, the reviews I read better. Ironically, the best aspect of the movie was its impressive labyrinth of home interior.
