This is, of course, illegal. Pedophiles pray on such things. How did they get away with making such a movie? This movie is all summed up in one word, SICK. Where do people come to look at these kinds of movies? While watching the movie, I didn't actually think they would allow this kid who might say 12 if it actually sleeps with this woman. Sorry if it's a devastator for you, but I'll have Rater not seen it. Where are the common sense of these people gone? Perhaps the creators of this movie are pedophiles? Our society today is filled with all kinds of sexual predators praying on children, but filmmakers make these kinds of films that do nothing but elicit this kind of behavior. I noticed that someone had asked for a previous comment if there was a version where it was shown naked. It's a kid here, and somebody asks something like that? What's wrong with this photo?
