The director states in the behind-the-scenes feature that he likes horror movies. He loves them so much that he has dedicated the film to Dario Argento, as well as other notable directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. It is basic to award this film to those great directors, such as giving your mom a piece of mothers day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. CASH MAN WHAT CAN DO. Also, don't throw a 40-year-old person for the role of a misunderstanding 18-year-old handrail. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. The reactions people have made when they look at their boyfriends get their hearts torn, amusing. Or like one part when a man in the ear is stabbed with an ear corn (haha gets it), and his girlfriend just goes, "Oh ... me .. God?" The scarecrow itself is quite a character. <br /> <br /> The movie does have a reasoning factor ... oh wait, no it does. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely need to watch movie, just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD. It covers everything and has a very gnarly song.
