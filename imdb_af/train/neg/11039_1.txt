All the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character that Jim is a bad father, a bad man or generally just very selfish. How can it be funny? Of course, a character in a sitcom should be flawed, but Jim's character is in an extremely unsympathetic way. <br /> <br /> And why is it? My guess is that this is because he must be better now. Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and he has the opportunity to do so. But he does not choose. It's a conscious choice he makes, when he decides not to play with his children, don't go shopping because he doesn't want to buy "ladies products", and that's a choice he makes when he lay family. <br /> <br /> The other characters just seem to be in the series so Jim can have someone to be a while. If the Cheryl character were a real person, she would have left him years ago and not stay the murder for 8 years. But unfortunately, she's just a catalyst for Jim's peculiar middle-class selfishness.
