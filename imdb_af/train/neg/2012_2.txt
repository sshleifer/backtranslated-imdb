Life in a future fascist or nearby fascist state that severely restricts personal freedom is a recurring theme, both in modern literature and filmmakers. Such works put warnings on unwanted trends in our society to look out; But to be effective, they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately, most books are likely to be more effective in putting the warnings on than to entertain us enough to read really well; while the movies are usually the other way around. The first kind of work that has become widely known was probably George Orwell's 1984, which was only published in 1948. It is still available in the form of a book and as a film. <br /> <br /> Watch or read: and if you feel a bit depressed by human inhumanity to humans, you reach Cinderella 2000. It's a lightweight low-budget movie comedy based on the same theme that looks effortless but inconspicuous, and as in 1984 the calendar has now passed its former era. Most of the comedies are laid with a trowel, although there are only a few really funny moments. To exert your thoughts in the long intervals between these things, you can focus on whether this film will gain a new life extension by being released as a DVD or eventually disappearing into oblivion. as existing copies of copies are lost. There are many worse movies that appear today as DVDs, and frankly I don't care much, whatever happens. <br /> <br /> So far, the best of the movies of this genre are probably "The Handmaiden's Languages" but I'll happily swap them for a well-made film by Jack London's enchanting novel "The Iron Heel". Ambitious as it would be, it still seems incredible that no modern filmmaker dared to try it (IMDb only mentions a B / W silent version made in Russia in 1919).
