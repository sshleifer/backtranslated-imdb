First, to give you an idea of ​​my taste in movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedies I enjoyed: Superbad, Coupled, Warm Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedies I Hated: Evan Almighty, The Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I had to follow my first instinct and eliminate the Hot Rod after reaching the 20-minute point. I knew at the time that this movie didn't make me laugh. The writing is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on IMDb. Anyone over the age of 10 who enjoyed it should be a kind of spiritual lack. <br /> <br /> It doesn't come close to anything with Will Farrell and it is clear that Andy Samberg can carry nothing more than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. I don't know how they called Ian McShane and Isla Fisher to do this movie ... they had to have some favorites or something. I came to know it would be a stupid movie, but I thought it would be at least funny. I didn't do much. <br /> <br /> I don't usually comment on movies at IMDb, but it was so terrible that I just had to warn people. It's just the 4th movie I've seen forced me to upgrade 1/10.
