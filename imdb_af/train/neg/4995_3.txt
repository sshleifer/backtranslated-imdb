I found this movie a real job. The soundtrack was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was said. There was little to move the plot together and often the action simply stopped and there was a long period of conversation that was strange to the movie. These conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to work together which was the general thread they tied up. It is rare that I consider a lower film about this and do so in this case, because the whole viewing experience has made me think, "so what" and "why do I waste my time watching it."
