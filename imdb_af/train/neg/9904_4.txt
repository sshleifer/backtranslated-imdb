The movie 'Gung Ho!': The story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 with a view to the morale of American people during the Second World War. It shows with the better way that the cinema can be a propaganda body. The value of this movie is only collection and not artistic. In a film of propaganda, it is useless to judge direction and actors. Watch that movie if you're interested in learning how propaganda works in the movies or if you're a big pleasure from Robert Mitchum who plays a small role in the movie. If you want to see a movie for the Second World War, it's much better and objective. I rated it 4/10.
