This movie has proven what we all already know, those professional basketball players suck everything but basketball. Especially rapping and acting. I can't even begin to describe how bad this movie really is. First of all, is it just me, or is it the ugliest child you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth can be used as a tin can. Secondly, why would a genius want to pursue a career in the music industry while struggling to make music, though he has magical powers? Third, I read the Bible. In no way did shape or form say that Jesus made geniuses. Fourth, what was the deal with all the crazy special effects? I assure you that any acne-addicted nerdy teen computer can make better effects than a computer. Fifth, why did the end suck so badly? And what the hell is that? And finally, who created the nightmare known as Kazaam must be thrown from an airplane and on the Eiffel Tower, because this movie takes the word 'suck' to a whole new level.
