Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and that is Rick Hill, a kind of body builder and well-known, if I understood correctly? The plot follows as Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something back from the evil Lord, and he must travel to the Lord's cave. He meets many dwarves and monsters during his journey, and the institutions are very close to Tolkien, and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is a discount from Conan's great success, and even though it's a very stupid movie, it has very good garbage earnings and is recommended for garbage dumpers and tolerant of movie junkies! <br /> <br /> There is not much cinematic merit in this movie. Few screens are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker concentrates on showing is naked women and big muscles from Hill. Females are usually helpless victims and very stupid, so it's a lot of macho movie and so can't be many feminists! The battle scenes are nothing special and pretty sowing, and the monsters aren't anything special. And all the other aspects of the movie are also very amateurish and bad, but what do you expect from low budget efforts like this? It tries to be as big as Conan, but fails to report. As I said, it could be the turkey cinema lovers, but no one else. It belongs to the category, it's so bad it's great! <br /> <br /> Death knife is not as close as it can be, and as a turkey movie I appreciate it almost as much as other turkeys, enjoyable of course! If bad movies are your cup of tea, try it and enjoy it, but if you don't understand "nice bad movies" then stay away. And if someone can't get a lot of nudity, then stay away. There is more nudity than violence, and because of these scenes, the film has an R rating. Otherwise it could be a safe PG family movie! <br /> <br /> 4/10
