There is a remark that one of heroines has been raped on a drunken rampage by Russian soldiers, which is totally untrue. This movie should not just be shown about this. <br /> <br /> There is also a statement by someone who has prosecuted KGB "Jews, Gypsies, etc.", which is worse than Nazis. KGB was looking for so-called "Zionist" agents, who (KGB believed) were imperialist agents. It is quite different from doing Jewish target as a whole nation, such as Nazis. Gypsies are never prosecuted. KGB was a political tool and used politics, but from an international point of view. Communists really did not distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole movie stinks like fake. Chief hero does not speak Russian, signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, KGB general looks completely ominous. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are completely made up, and the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies and false stuff. Go to "Good Shepherd" rather.
