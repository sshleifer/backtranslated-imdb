It's the biggest heap of shit I've ever seen. DO NOT RENT! The makers of this movie should be bound to ever make another movie. It starts with some of a plot, then fades quickly to nothing. I think I'd rather look dry than look at the cover. The actors were horrible, the plot disappeared quickly, filming too much work to be done. Not a good thing to say about this crap movie. If you rent this movie, you will waste your money. I really enjoy National Lampoon movies, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce, and learn to lead. I feel I have to sue these a-holes wasting this movie for money on rental costs and losing time.
