This movie was in a sci-fi 50 pack, a friend of mine gave me Christmas. It is very similar to the first Gozilla movie, and like the movie, plays with American actors took place without any real reason. One interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there is a Cold War tension depicted between America and Russia. Just as in Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages around the world, paying close attention to Tokyo because no big monster movie has been completed unless Tokyo bites it. All in all, this is a good movie. Some of the scenes in which Gamera is involved, especially the Toly screens, are pretty spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time. If you like Japanese giant monster movies, you really get a kick out of this one. I give it a 4 out of 10. If it was the unharmed Japanese version I watched, it would probably have gotten a 5.
