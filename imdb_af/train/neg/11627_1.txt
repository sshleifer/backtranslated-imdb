I wonder who was responsible for this mess. The jokes wouldn't have worked for Gilligan's island. If it went to the series, there would have been jokes about Auschwitz, or would Eve have to replace her furnace, just to suggest Adolf the kind of 50? Another post compared to this show that I love Lucy. The problem with this is that Lucille Ball was a genius in physical comedy and bizarre situations, and this mess was just bad and an insult to my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the damage the Nazis did to England and the number of people they murdered, I would think the concept of a comedy about Hitler would look deviant and most normal people would imagine this concept killed some episodes. is manufactured.
