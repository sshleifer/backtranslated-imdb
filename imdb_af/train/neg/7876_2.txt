At a panel discussion that I attended after watching this film, the filmmakers said it should not be considered a movie, but a taster of thought. Well, the only thoughts that have come to my mind were wasted to watch the movie. The gimmicks of the film (documentary style, futuristic environment) served as a derivation of what was supposed to be a thorough investigation into the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring movie preaching to the choir.
