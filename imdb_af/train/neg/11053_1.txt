It's one of those "bad ones it's good" movies you always hear, but never see! Unlike Troma films that are deliberately bad and champion (and I'm not amused) this one is 100% pure serious. <br /> <br /> But with features such as a so-called super-deadly murderer robot that travels over one of the Solid Gold dancers on a sour journey and a magical first mate that turns off the lightning and transforms into the Good Witch of the East The fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it over the edge of the bad it makes the whole circle back to entertaining. <br /> <br /> Watchful enough as a result.
