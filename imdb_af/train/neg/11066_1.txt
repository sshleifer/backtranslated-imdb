Before I watched "Dahmer", I thought there was no movie that could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered." I was wrong. To summarize 'Dahmer', it's a story about a gay serial killer that has almost no murder and is almost entirely made up of Dahmer's gay men's encounters before being murdered. There is no plot to find, and that means no sense as far as we are talking about "Dahmer". All you will learn from Dahmer to watch this movie is that he likes having sex with men. Horrible action, terrible direction, terrible writing, terrible everything ... If you have to choose between "Dahmer" and projectile vomiting for three hours, go with vomiting .... it will be less painful .....
