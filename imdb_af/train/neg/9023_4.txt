I watched anime, but I'm not a mortal fan; and I don't read manga. I say this because many of the judges lyrical about this movie seem to be the backdrop. I saw "St John's Wort" and although it is not a masterpiece of any imagination, it made me "Shinobi", especially since everyone likes to love it. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it this afternoon and fought very hard to keep watching. Yes, it is very beautiful - the slow motion water scenes, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the CGI eye flicker - majestic. I like the hawk, the costumes, even some of the fighting scenes, but overall it was dirty like dirt. <br /> <br /> It looked like someone was taking Romeo and Juliet. The translation even mentions that their star-crossed lovers - and throws in some "X-Men" for a good measure. Two of the characters split Wolverine's forces - the man in a bear suit had his claws and the gray hair had his ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - this is Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women such stupid powers? Poison girl shows her leg and kisses you to death. Man, this is a great power for you. And the other girl can create insects of this yellow fabric she rubs on her hands. The other woman, one of the star-crossed lovers, has the power of a hypnotic star. Wow. <br /> <br /> I made it to the end of the movie, sending it quickly, and saw a little more tragedy than I expected. Some people compare it to 'House of Flying Daggers' and 'Hero.' Don't make that mistake. They may share similar ends, but that's where the agreements end. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I would say avoid this movie unless you are 12 to 18 years old.
