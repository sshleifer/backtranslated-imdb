The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combo is sooner than with HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I went in the movie (at an Indian plywood) with great expectations, especially after the smooth promotions. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before that, this movie was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> As others commented, the film's film, which was already old, just got on and off without any development. or additional layer. After a while, you just want to finish the movie so you can go home (if I watched it at home, it would have been easier for me to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is at its best average and John Abraham should not try again. The comedy aspects of the movie in general were beautiful. I just remember giggling like twice the whole movie. Certainly, no virgin stomach laughs that consumed me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had some of his expected classic moments, but overall, because his role and character didn't get much space to grow, he didn't have an impact on this movie. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who just made a look in the movie, was nice to watch while on the screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing of songs by ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively. Otherwise, you are better off just passing this movie.
