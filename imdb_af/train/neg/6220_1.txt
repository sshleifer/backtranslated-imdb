This movie was a real disappointment to me. I've been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I found out they made a movie about him, I was very over, I got the movie on VHS when it came out and was sick of what I saw, This film was not about his life, it was about the aftermath of his death. I thought it would be a descent movie about Grams Life and Music, but they had to make a film about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted to have a movie about his life, not his infamous death. I was very disappointed. I wish people would look to his life, more than his death. The only thing good about this movie was its soundtrack. This movie is a disappointment to any Gram Parsons fan.
