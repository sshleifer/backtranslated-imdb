I was only able to keep this low-budget movie for the first twenty minutes. The most striking absurdity was that American prisoners in a North Korean POW camp presumably suffer from severe food and medicine abilities, without swimming, trembling in thin and dirty parkas, and sleeping on bare floors, and let's not forget about lasting torture. - They always succeed in getting sport flawlessly chilled hair. With the exception of a really tough Harry Morgan as an army Major, the decisive and acting is just terrible. Ronald Regan can't seem to portray a single character and rather creates a schizophrenic amalgam of previous roles. A particularly Caucasian role-player depicting North Korean camp officers might have been forgiven, but as Russian officers acting as Korean advisers move around, carrying huge Nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots (recovering clear costume department from World War II). Talk to accents like General Burkhalter of Hogan's Heroes, well, it's just six kinds of silly. Don't waste your time on this one.
