I can watch a good gory movie now and then. I saw some pretty sick things. However, this is one of the few films I found to be grotesque in a way that was only striking and rebellious. I like gore movies when they are fun. I like winning they are a lot of creativity behind them. The gore in this movie is not creative. It's sick. It is indignant. It's totally unpleasant. As a result, this film is definitely not entertaining. The movie is a horror movie, but it is scarcely missing. So pretty much the only reason one would see this movie is for the gore, but it's the most unattractive and ugly aspect of the whole movie, and it says a lot. The play is terrible, the plot doesn't make sense, and the music is very annoying and WAY sounds electronic. It took me everything straight out of the movie. Pretty much the whole movie is one big long depressive trial. There is this man who has a freak accident in a shuttle and wakes up in a hospital to determine that his skin is dissolving and melting. I think he goes out and eats human flesh to slow down the melting process. There are some strange subplots in which an old couple is chased by a dog, a little head swinging in a stream, and an end that makes a man with an electric voltage. There were times when I tried very hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole movie I thought was even entertaining. The scene was early in the time a nurse walked slowly into a hospital corridor. If you have ugly, nasty, irreconcilable horror movies, this is for you.
