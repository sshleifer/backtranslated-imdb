Unfortunately, I made a mistake and I paid 7 euros to watch this level, meaningless movie. My Points; <br /> <br /> Film is based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic point of view: As it happens on most American films, the author thinks himself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But that's not enough. Knowledge of art and two names of other foods does not make one understand a culture. For example, shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia, but everyone tried to stop the girl. Lebanese people are Christians (Ok they have it) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not make ethnocentrism. So we don't judge people to their first question about our lives as the father figure did in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> 2) Sexual Revolution of a Girl: There is nothing to say. Show me 10 girls who had it on their sexual awakening as I would say I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the movie in the black humor genre. Please look at Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor should reflect the truth and focus the audience on its funny parts. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the movie.
