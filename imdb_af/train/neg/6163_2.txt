Hooper is not funny, not trapped, not romantic and not insightful. There is no real drama. You'd think a movie about the world's biggest stuntman would have some drama, there was an effort, but it didn't really look like it. No character study, no lessons learned, it didn't even seem like the actors had real fun, they just tried to act like having fun. There is no need to look, unless you like to look at Burt and want you sometimes to take a look at Sally. Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and the Bandit were such a fun movie that I was ready to keep Hooper. This movie was a real disappointment and waste of time
