I was looking forward to seeing it when it was in production. But it seems to be the biggest down. A far from the wonderful world of Dr Seuss. It was vulgar and unpleasant. I don't think dr. Seuss would have approved. How the Grinch stole was much better. I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it, but my kids didn't catch it yet. As the cat shouted in the hat follower, they caught much more than I would have liked. Excavation with Dr Seuss It really made me difficult to see how these timeless classics are trapped on the big screen. Let's see what they do with Horton, hear who. I hope this one does Dr Seuss some justice.
