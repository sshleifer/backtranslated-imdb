Yes, Marie Dresler drinks plum juice that she thinks is poison and she walks out. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. I am never a cup of tea, but she is a solid artist who will surely keep the screen. <br /> <br /> I saw it for Polly Moran, who I saw elsewhere. Here is Moran OK - just OK - as Dressler's rogue friend. Too bad she sank into almost total oblivion. <br /> <br /> The plot is kind. Bad guys try to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> I wonder about the central plot mechanism: effects. It came out during the Depression. Perhaps everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if they are well used and misused. However, I am not of that era, they are vaguely familiar with them. They're like stocks just different, right? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man to create a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.
