This is a television version of the story, the movie begins like an episode of 'Xena ...', with little meaningful dialogue or character description. It gets a little more substantive after a while, but all the characters are still cartoon. <br /> <br /> Salma is the exotic beauty. Richard Harris is an evil and sexually repressed Frollo, who destroys a nut in Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo, are quite forgetful. <br /> <br /> It's also a kind of liberal version of the story. Frollo is a suppressor of Enlightenment ideals, such as the abbot in 'Rose of the Name', and Quasimodo is a freedom champion. The shady side of the Quas character is ignored, though he is leading fluid to humans. He's just an outsider because he looks different and enjoys playing more than the average person with bells. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie is meant for kids, but I doubt it, since Frollo flogs wants to change himself bloody to beat his monkey. A most uninteresting and forgetful, but not horrible and sometimes entertaining version of the story.
