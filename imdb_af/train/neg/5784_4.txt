I was barely beaten like many other reviewers. Sure, it has some beautiful girls playing erotic lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two beautiful sirens with razor teeth that run cars on a road, keep their house in the twilight and invite their prey ... sex starved men to their boudoir. What happens ... well, after they mostly discourage each other and kiss each other, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has some flashes of brilliance with his camera. Some scenes are quite frightening and effectively shot, but sex alone doesn't hold a movie (no pun intended ... at least consciously). There really isn't much of a story here. We got the two girls. We are shown some inexplicable and inexplicable principles where we shot them with pistol. Why? What does it mean: "Why do we greet the man who stays for a few days, greeting a man at the hotel who insists he knows him from years ago? Does it have a purpose? What are some of beautiful girls doing vampires in the English countryside and having a wine cellar filled with Carpathian wine? Anyway, the writing has been hit with such flaws. victims, wine and eat them (literally), and then go to sleep in the manger, the end goes with some supple scenes, but it's anti-climate, as I have said, there are some effective scenes the director ... I especially liked The way the girls were filmed and filmed in the bush got their prey, the house is also an impressive set, and both girls are as I said very well. , Marianne Morris stands in more ways than one before: older movie friends, silent screen veteran Bessie Love has a short cameo at movie its end.
