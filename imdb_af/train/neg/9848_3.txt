This movie does have some great noirish / neo-realistic footage, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar cover. This was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the screens are going too far too long (especially the wedding), and I found that the overly acting and unrealistic dialogue is more suited to the stage than to the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly distracting, and it got worse when the movie went on. Most characters were Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialogue sounded as though they were practicing rules for a Shakespeare game while mixing cement and laying bricks. By the end I laughed, not because the filmmakers wanted me. I think the stilted poetry can be defended by saying that the characters would speak Italian, and the dialogue is a literal translation of how they would really speak. But it didn't work for me at all. <br /> <br /> Another line of dialogue made me laugh for another reason: the main character's son, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly kicks off a beautiful lilting British accent. I just suspect that this has something to do with the fact that the film was made in England. <br /> <br /> I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intent but a significantly lower grade for execution.
