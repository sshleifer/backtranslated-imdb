After listening to Harvey Bernhard's Omen II comment, I was shocked to discover he was also behind this absolute piece of garbage. It's like a very bad TV movie you might see in the middle of the day when you have flu and is too sick to reach the remote control. I think of the little Michael Lerner confronted with what I can only describe as a high school of Les Miserables, opened my mouth in disbelief. And then my mouth went up and down because I laughed so much. Dire. I don't know why I should write a minimum of ten lines, I briefly tackled my point. There is nothing clever about all these modern verbs.
