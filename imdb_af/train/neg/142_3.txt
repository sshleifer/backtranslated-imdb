First, there are some good things about this movie, but it's all the Cliche Slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertisement of this movie, which I saw, there was a great emphasis on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she is a poor actress and not as beautiful as people try to make her feel it has nothing to do with the movie to do. And what about everyone? Maybe it's part of the character, but as I said, the play is ... Yet the writing is good. You know who it is throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is going to happen, but not in an annoying way. I think the book on which it is based is probably good, judged by the plot line, but next time I read the book to find out rather than look at it.
