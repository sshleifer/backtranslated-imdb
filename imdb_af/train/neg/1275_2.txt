It's a terrible movie. All three stories are stuck with a hypnotic system of psychiatrist, which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and some ladies, there are a few things that don't make sense, but the hypnotism does it. The second one, with bad Bill Paxton as a maniac roommate, shouldn't be seen by anyone. The last one, unfortunately, is the best almost incomprehensible, which I think makes it better than the other garbage.
