Those who are familiar with the two previous Cube films know pretty much what they can expect: a small group of people trapped in a bunch of booby prisoners, paranoia, bad acting ... This one, however, is a little otherwise. About half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we watch the people watching the cube (or at least five of them). <br /> <br /> I think Cube Zero strives to explain what the Cube Handling is, but you really don't get much more than what is covered in the first two movies. Sure, there is an explanation in it, but it feels rather lame compared to what was proposed in the first film. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero looks pretty cheap (as its predecessors did) and the fact that it shows more than just a few empty rooms just accentuates this feeling. I also had great confidence to say that there is no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the near future. They brought back the chicks of Cube 1, but I mean they're almost the same, which is a bit of shame. <br /> <br /> I know many people appreciate this movie and its links with the first one, but I just feel that it's a totally unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn't so good to start no.
