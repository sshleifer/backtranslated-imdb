The second half of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary bio on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to carry out revolution in Bolivia. To keep his sacred performance of Che Soderbergh, the frogs have written the massive retrenchments following the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure ("This is the history of failure") in the preface of his Congo journalism. . ) to fully focus on Che's attempt to support standing up against the government in Bolivia. It would be a disaster and Guevara's final act. <br /> <br /> What struck the first chapter here is here, as Soderbergh filmed his movie into a crawl to study the charming appearance of the contemplative Guevara, which is being played again. like James Dean in East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has little success in obtaining converts and he soon finds himself and his hungry comrades are devoured in the heart of the Bolivian wilderness. In contrast to Werner Herzog in the beautiful Aguirre, the wrath of God Soderbergh fails the metaphorical possibilities of the jungle to increase the despair of the guerrillas. He looks more worried about keeping Che's nimbus above his head than investigating the panic in the dead. There is one Herzogian moment where Che kicks a stubborn horse and screams to make it move, but the total Soderbergh's mishap and scene remain flat, sloppy and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In both his films, Soderbergh shows he is clearly a Che group and therefore his focus remains myopic and narrow. He spends too much time building his monument on Che and too little to develop his relationships with key players in his saga, especially Fidel Castro. To make matters worse, he does so with a slow and irreverent approach that never gets fire. One would think he was enough in Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that the spring change is much better displayed with the sweeping style.
