Wow, I just did it on T.V. seen as one of the "scary" movies they show around Halloween. Was this rated G? There wasn't really anything to make this movie scary or worth watching. Other people also say it's a spoof, but I don't think so. For a spoof you need something called 'humor'. This low-budget crap-fest didn't have a bit of humor, and it didn't make much sense either. You basically have a goofy monster (man in rubber suit) coming out of the cupboards and killing people, you think, since you never see the monster to anyone or any bloody aftermath. The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I think it's good enough. <br /> <br /> The army is trying to carefully kill the monster, which is not much larger than a man. They have a very bad purpose. Then the army is MEAT! Wow, did this movie hurt the American army or what? The monster, while it is difficult to kill, does not do much except rocking and roaring. Oh, and sometimes a second head comes out of his mouth and screams. It was a bit interesting, but a total Alien ripoff. <br /> <br /> What was the deal with the scientist playing the Xylophone to lure the monster? It was difficult to understand much of the dialogue because of the poor sound quality. Also, why did the monster have been wearing the main man for so long? Why didn't the monster go into the closet when it had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to make sense of the senseless?
