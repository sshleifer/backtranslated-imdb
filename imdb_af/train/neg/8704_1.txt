Generally, I like dinosaur movies, but this one is pure crap. No writing, no dialogue, no acting. And brave Colonel Rance tries to show he's tough and so his mouth looks like a twin brother, the stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. So it was a total waste of time (luckily I didn't waste money as I saw the movie on TV). And I really can't understand 7 people who rated this treasure 10. They must have been joking. My advice, if you see this title running out of it!
