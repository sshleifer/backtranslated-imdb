Last of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies and also a good thing, it is easily the worst of the 12 films he has made over a 16 year period. No mermaids are found here, or as a beautiful island woman trying to escape the clutches of her people, worshiping a god and trying to force her to be his bride. She finds Tarzan and Jane, who are trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially ominous high priest, but is not used to his full advantage. Also on the hand and worthy of mention is a very annoying guitarist / singer who goes into the song every so often. Even the "big" Robert Florey can't help this one. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of four)
