The Wicker Man did the impossible! It replaces Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my ice-cold imagination. Yes it's really that bad. It is so bad that when I sit down to write this review, I thought to myself, "If I had the choice to see this movie again or to have red hot needles in my eyes," I might have the red hot needles went. <Br /> <br /> Neil LaBute has created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit back and say with ease and guilt, "Yes, it's a bad direction right there". <br /> <br /> I think the first clue to I had to be the tagline: "Some sacrifices must be made". Certainly, it may be kind of uncomfortable line to intrigue you, but the sacrifice will all be on the side of the screen. Trust me that the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime or at least fraud to try it out as something that looks like entertainment. Seriously! The movie is about an island where men are just there to breed and I would still rather love Gilligans Island. Only the photos of Condoleezza Rice find me stranded there. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining part of this movie was the man who tore the hardest speed I ever heard in a theater. It's not a joke, and it's not fiction. I have never been a "thriller" and have heard so much laughter throughout the film. I can't tell you with certainty whether the laugh was deliberate in an effort to relieve the film tension, or if they just really thought this litter would really fly. I honestly found myself calling for a power outage or perhaps a fight to break out into the cinema, anything to make it more interesting, which is pretty sad, since Deez, Powder and I two every two before the movie shot, just for a little mental anesthesia (soon a law for all Nic Cage movies, write to your congressman today, don't delay). At one point I actually thought it might be a spoof and Anna Ferris would arrive. Oh how I wish. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage throws as much ham per frame, I think of having a cholesterol test done today. To think I ever thought Sean Penn was a d * ck for the relaxation of Nic's acting, o he is still a d * ck just less of one? Yes Sean Penn's dc ck was reduced due to this movie. We all do a favor. Nic plays your strengths and likes pathetic losers and drunks. You can't play superman, you don't get strong baseball, go straight to jail, don't succeed, don't raise $ 200. His best moments in this movie are when he finally gets rid of and actually emits a brave woman to steal her beard suit (like the flash, not a joke or a functional moment during this review), then go Amok like Conan O "Brian's masturbating bear, but with half the hilariousness of a bear that overturned his litter. Fortunately, he meets shortly after his end when it appears that he will be a sacrifice for the crowd at the new touring show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes !!!! I just ruined the end for you? And if you knew better, you would build images of me in worship and sing songs of my legend. I put this crap on, so you don't have to. <br /> <br /> About half of these little misadventures I thought Jack Bauer would have wrapped up this matter in 20 minutes of real time. .OK 35 minutes if Kim is first attacked by a mountain lion. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau found out within an hour and you are not a Clouseau inspector. <br /> <br /> If you are being arrested for some reason and you have a choice to watch this movie or take a bullet, take the bullet. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, Uwe Boll laughs at us all.
