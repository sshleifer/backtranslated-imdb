When will the pain stop? I never want to see another version of a Carol Christmas. They continue to make movies with the same story, which overpower each other to try to make the movie better than the rest, but unfortunately it fails because it's not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative, happy thinking. As if people were learning. The many different versions of this movie prove that we do not.
