First lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - just sell 'style'. I think Tashan means translating style. Secondly, if you are hell to sell style, it doesn't save you to have a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has a story that could meet some better directors. But it is not smooth. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story. But this setup is not properly applied. There could have been a better mix and fit of their stories. Activity sequence comes from the seventies. <br /> <br /> The choreography of the movie is terrible. I think Vaibhavi dealer just walked through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar created a good score, but it does not belong to this movie. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor if he is English that is crazy? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the movie. But he is in his stereotype himself. You won't mind missing out on this movie.
