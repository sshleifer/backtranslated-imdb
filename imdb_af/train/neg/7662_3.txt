It must be my kind of movie. Even if it was sucked, it still had to be upright; hell, I love "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine" movies. I have a soft spot in my heart for foolish alien / demon / adventure movies. Let's talk about why I decided to look it first. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Sci-fi almost always makes me intrigue 2. I'm a big fan of archeology, and this movie is a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I usually enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is warm. <br /> <br /> This movie had potential, at least in the cheese horror section of the video store, but the boy sucked it. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do. I mean, let's see it, both are melodramatic. But now to some of the many mistakes. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Although the film as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is really awful. We're not just talking badly, I'm talking about the nomination of Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I don't know if she's capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league ... completely. Seeing her try to carry the role of trained scientists was not much different from what you look at in the bad porn. I mean it's not only bad, it's nice bad. Oh, and for those of you who are curious, she doesn't get naked, just after a bra in a foolish, totally unnecessary love scene. <br /> <br /> Even with Reid's performance, the movie might have worked, but the plot is dominating, and the plot looks written by a 10-year-old. I didn't realize it was a video game adjustment until AFTER watched the DVD, otherwise I would appreciate the stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood at an orphanage where he comes back from something terrible that has happened, of course he has amnesia. In his adult life, Slater was recruited by a unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently misses or misses. Slater had to stay away because he was too rebellious, you think, you never really know, unless it was in one of the voice remains I zoned. The movie starts with Slater Hunting Facts, after a "Chilean Mercenary Corps specializing in the sale of rare antiquities." I can have the exact quotation wrong, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is a bad doctor who wants to unleash a few heroes (no reason given), experiments on children, super devil / alien-human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (the devil things can't stand sunlight) and of course Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can't even flow through the clich√©d elements. The script needs reprocessing to lighten the focus and give some depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so angry? Oh right, people are doomed and he just tries to save humanity. I think he's infected? How did it happen? Oh, he has one of the evil devil's in a cage and draws his blood to shoot himself. How did hell happen? Why and where did he get the super-trolls (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by parasitic strangers / demons melting their spine). Slater is, of course, powered by half of the super-snail, like Blade, but his snail "has not completely melted due to an electric shock," thank you. Oh, and the people with these "melted" spines have no idea they are half-stranger / demon and act as good members of the community until a secret signal is given, from which they become killer zombies. Yes, we get zombies. <br /> <br /> So much shit that can be entertaining but nothing of it. <br /> <br /> The end is also completely silly because everything seems to be not so big of a deal to fix in the first place. At least nothing that can handle a little dynamite. <br /> <br /> Not the worst thing you'll see, but a very bad movie.
