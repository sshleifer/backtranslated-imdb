I don't know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan, Jerry Tom leaves to have an adventure in New York, and as far as I am concerned, this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat! <br /> <br /> So magical as Jerry's exploration of the 'Big Apple' could be for the other T&J fans who commented on IMDb here. I couldn't wait for this self-supporting litter to end, so I could watch the next cartoon on my DVD. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only part of the whole episode I really enjoyed was when Jerry "almost" bought the farm, ending at the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet above " a busy road.
