Definitely the product of young minds, this piece can appeal very well to the 20s crowd, still trying to find their place in the world while being obsessive about every neurosis. However, I cannot imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic nail consciousness, trite humor or banal subject in particular would be more than 30 for anyone. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, of which the filmmakers obviously have nothing less than contempt, are squeezed into such an absurd caricature for the comic effect that they are not tolerable in any way. <br /> <br /> But one should give the filmmakers some style points, which of course have grown into the video generation, and use every imaginable editing trick in the book to create an otherwise non-existent plot to build. . There are 2 points to remember here. First, be up to date with celebrities. Secondly, although we live in the age of youtube, not everyone's account deserves their everyday life-style big-screen treatment. But these young filmmakers have every right to make their movie, and if other 20 somethings can find something to identify, then it's better. However, I can't help but at the end of this film think how this latest generation, just now of age, will go into the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. In the age where every child is continually reassured about how special they are, and that they all have their 15-minute exposure, resilience and the ability to resist, does not seem to be the strong point of this generation.
