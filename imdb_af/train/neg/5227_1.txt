........ and a very bad one !! How long has this train wreck last? 14 episodes or something ?? I can see why now. <br /> <br /> I bought Amazon Unboxed's "Serenity" episode. It was my first purchase, so it was free. This is the only good thing about the experience (incident?) <br /> <br /> I won't really comment on the acting, as it was, I think, fairly new people who didn't really get the job done down just right. I've never seen them in any big show, theater or TV. If I did, I easily forgot them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were absolutely terrible. True, it's not exactly a multi-million $$ project, but the original Star Trek did better than that and it was THIRDY FIVE years ago. I especially got the bad guys (maggots or something like that), while chasing the hilarious firefighter, with smoke coming out of the engines and seeing something like a giant rocket. I fully expected to finally see the Wiley Coyote at the top while chasing the Roadrunner. Modern jet / rocket engines don't even do it badly. <br /> <br /> And it wasn't even the worst. The wild-west type of blast has wondered if I was a science film or a Gene Autry one. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the hype, don't waste your time ... I've ... called 80 minutes of the "Firefly" disaster.
