I rented this DVD for two reasons. A role play of great actors, and the director, even if Robert Altman can be hit or miss. In this case it was a big mistake. Altman's attempt to create tension fell on his emperor. Having seen Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like Dead Again, I didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey, and I hope it didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall looks the way of most once-off Oscar winners. On a downward spiral, it includes eating in money movies like this. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercies", but "The Great Santini". This movie was really a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10.
