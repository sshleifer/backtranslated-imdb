If you liked the first two movies, then I'm sorry to say you don't like this one. This is the real junk and unnecessarily straight to the video, probably a TV sequel. The still idiotic but good scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of a statue, Wayne is so stupid, he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother. Then he also shrinks his wife and son-in-law. Now the adults need to find a way to get the children from home to get them bigger. Almost a repeat of the other two with just one or two new things, eg. a toy car, swimming in dip, etc. Nice arm!
