Williamson's accent is hard to blow through. He speaks incredibly fast, as he is in a hurry to get through the lines. During the soliloquy he acts as if he is talking to someone when he speaks to himself. All that and his bare spot just irritated me. He was just too old for this role. When reading other accounts of Williamson, he might have been given this role because he was angry and the director decided to do some life-imposing art or forced method. When the actors make Hamlet angry, you believe it! Marianne Faithful is a beautiful beauty and can clash with Ophelia and still get a pass. The set is dark and forward, but it seems to have been shot in a real castle, especially the scenes in the tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines as a great light in the air.
