It was a disappointing horror movie about a snotty young girl and her nightmares. For a horror or thriller movie and hype it is too tame. There are just a few tense moments here, not everywhere, as close as many to a movie of this genre. Even those "tense" scenes weren't much. The music made them more dramatic than they actually were. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of symbolism here so elitist critics nominate this "an imaginary horror movie." Well, if they think about it, they are sure they will come to the same conclusion as I did - a waste of money at the video rental store. <br /> <br /> Summary: A yawner offering an unacceptable main character and generally poorly acting. Greatly overestimated and definitely not what it advertises.
