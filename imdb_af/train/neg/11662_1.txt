I'm not often going to write comments, but I just had to warn someone who probably thinks they'll see it, see a comedy. It doesn't come close. While the premise (change in color / gender / whatever) is bad enough (and better done, often before), the real transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever made on the screen is installed. It would be bad enough if everything required by the writing was a change in white chicks. The Wayans brothers, however, have to disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you will now guess, they fail completely. I have seen drag queens without make-up, more convincing women than the two do with the best special effects and makeup people Hollywood can offer. It's terrible. Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this movie hits a new personal layer. And I like bad movies! Avoid like the pest.
