Sometimes a movie is so terribly terrible, it has a devastating effect on your morale. You really ask yourself, what does it mean to our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect us to endure these many clich√©s and still be entertained? <br /> <br /> Of course, it's still a Hollywood pillar to make the GUN the main character, plot device and source of everyone. conflict and resolution in movies. Character needs a gun. Get a gun Can't do it because he has a gun. Push his gun first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do! He has a gun! He waves it and does more evil than real people who ever do. He pushes it into someone's face for 90 minutes and shouts questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the reassuring sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> It is a real challenge to make such a tired, chopped formula work again; a movie must be very clever and well executed. This one is also not. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck these components of YOU. It will make you feel about life and life in the time and space you do. Really, who needs this? So yes, I'll say it: I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Anyone involved in making this dirty, sub-mediocre soul public should be embarrassed by the injustice they have done to us all.
