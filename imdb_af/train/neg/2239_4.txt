The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I will simply add that my reason for seeing this movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undisputed glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake should be one of the sexiest, most beautiful examples of "beautiful totty" attached to celluloid. From her era and ilk, the equally beautiful Jane Asher comes close. What about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who love me, Gabrielle admires, her scenes in this movie won't disappoint. She has a wonderful figure and none of it is over here. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very poor and of its time, made very cheap. The song that covers the opening credits seems to be going on forever and is terrible.
