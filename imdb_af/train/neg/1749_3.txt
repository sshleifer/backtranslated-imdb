I have to say that this was the worst movie of priyadarshan (released with much better kyonki, who was also his direct business), contains no specific storyline and focuses only on the body debuting by actresses and some silly comedy -rows. I think priyadarshan is too much repetitive in his comedy movie, just like govinda and David Dhavan have done in the past after giving good educators. They also lost their audiences. So it would be good for him to concentrate more in writing and try some variations in his direction. Give us more of herapheris and malamal weekly rather than giving duds like garam masala!
