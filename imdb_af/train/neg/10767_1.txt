We were all made up to be a bunch of fearless demons and demons. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and it is supposed to be the reason for this fund. Of course, the British character is normal. The rest is a crop of stereotype of sitcom - can you "Norm !!" say? The cinematography ranges from nice picture cards to dark indoor silhouettes. The actors always look fidgeting. Are they as bored as the viewer, or is it the director's idea of ​​movies? Avoid this mess and watch some Bruce Mcdonalds movies. A true Canadian boy with something original to see kinematic. You won't be obliged to walk on his movies after 10 minutes.
