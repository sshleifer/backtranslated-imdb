What is it about? Predestination, you can't change the future because it's already written. <br /> <br /> I'll give it so much. I wanted to see what happened next and watch the whole movie. This movie took a concept and woke it up. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a recommendation, see it at matinee prices. No excitement, but an interesting concept. They had to leave the Y2K reference.
