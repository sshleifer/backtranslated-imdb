Anita and Me seem little more than an excuse for Meera Syal, author of the novel and script, to air her bias, grievances and general antipathy against the English. The general sentiment of Indian superiority in English in this film is dirty. <br /> <br /> The English people in this film are portrayed as being overweight, violent, angry, vicious, debauchery, involved in child neglect, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating bad food, and dull wrongful, just by Turning Indian culture, the local priest can be "redeemed" at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> By contrast, the Indian family is beautiful, smart, educated, can speak many languages, caring and loving parents, and grammar schooling. The film is so treacherous that I am surprised that the BBC has financed it all. If it were the other way around, an English family in an Indian community portrayed this way, the film would have been regarded as racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far on my forehead. , I thought it would stay in my hairline. First, the gossip between women at the Divali celebration - subtitle: the English is dirty and debauchery - and the men's subtitle: English women are prostitutes. Secondly, the dinner with Anita where Neema's family lays a nice touch on her: the English is so stupid, you can do them all. <br /> <br /> But the underlying contempt of anything English - even English weddings is a mockery - is obviously all the way through the movie. The character of Anita was so terrifying - almost the fallen woman of tropics - that I was hurting the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a "Bend it like Beckham" where humor is focused on love. exaggerating a community's behavior and practices from someone within that community, and is a movie about two girls from different backgrounds coming together. Instead, Anita and Me seem to show that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, as the English is almost a version of the Indian Ontouchable cabinets. This is underlined by a thinly veiled series of attacks on the film's "other" community: the English. <br /> <br /> I felt Anita and Me was a hate-filled, grievous-based piece. On the basis, the BBC should not have funded its production.
