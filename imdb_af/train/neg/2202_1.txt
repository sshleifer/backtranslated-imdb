This movie makes me think the others I saw at Combs were an accident. The plot has more holes than I think I've ever seen in a movie pretending to be something more than a "b" movie. The acting was so lazy that even the memories of Combs's victory in the camps had not been overcome, enough to save it. Considering the writing I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I'm very upset that I paid Blockbuster prices for this trash. The fact that it was made for television was something that helped me avoid this horror and honestly something that these poor people have to watch, you have to warn. Avoid this movie, no matter what.
