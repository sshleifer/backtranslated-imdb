Holy cow, which is a piece of this movie. I didn't know how these filmmakers could take a 250-word book and change it into a movie. I think they didn't know either! I don't remember a flight or belching in the book, did you? <br /> <br /> They added it to all the children's classics, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo and made it into a KAKA joke. This will give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers think. I have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think something is so funny), I don't want the kids I know to think it is. <Br /> <br /> Don't take your kids to see, don't rent the DVD. I hope the ghost of Doctor Suess ghost comes and haunts the people who made this movie.
