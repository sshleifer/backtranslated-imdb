The same problem I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" is equally important for "Oliver." Instead of the composers' writing in the stylistic period of the plays, they only wrote Broadway-type melodies, historically unidiomatic and stylistic. <br /> <br /> Also, the blatant brutality and improper activities of the dramaturgy do not interfere well with some of the sunny adventures that penetrate the score. It is an uncomfortable mix that leaves a definite downfall. <br /> <br /> Harvesting the boy Oliver doesn't matter: for now, timbre and vexingly precious, there's something less solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine properly, although the songs he has been obliged to sing have little basis at a time. <br /> <br /> "As long as he needs me, an insane interpretation, throat and tension are given. The two big production numbers, "Who will buy" and "Consider yourself" look too much produced, with everything except the kitchen sink thrown in. It's one thing to go out and another to cross the line. <br /> <br /> The gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to allow itself for such deadly and choreography. While the novel is regarded as a classic, I must confess that I have problems with Mr. Dickens's consciousness, because his work tends to exert a negative vibration. It could be because of the prolongation of his joyful personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. <br /> <br /> Not all the combined talent of this production, either on or behind the camera, can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material. All this leads to an uncomfortable experience for me. <br /> <br />
