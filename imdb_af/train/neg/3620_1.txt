I tried to watch this horror from the theater when I was five years old; I've never been the same since. On the verge filled with drug-induced images found on the usual ravages of your average asylum resident, this "movie", despite its colorful appearance, is not for humans, especially children. <br /> <br /> It starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who destroys his classmates' drum by (waiting for it) to put his head through it; yes, put his head through it. But do not fear, my friends! He is quickly encouraged by his whistling whistle, which is strange enough, I will allow you, but still acceptable. <br /> <br /> THEN: The movie morphs into a combination of Oz's wizard and the wild stuff, but loses all the "hot and fuzzy" aspects of one of these two books. <br /> <br /> So, this seven-foot yellow family member of Barney befriends this poor boy and even deeper into despair. <br /> To add the pleasing variety of horrific themes, a carnivorous boat, formerly a friend of the motivated crew of hobbling grandfather and doped-up dragons, is added. br /> <br /> The most comforting image in the middle of this chaos is the villain, a Witchiepoo (?). Of course she has problems herself: dealing with an obvious plastic mask that limits her facial expressions to handling a broomstick whose gas level always seems to be at its lowest in the most inconspicuous moments. As a result, one of her favorite pastimes dived into the water that separated the land of Pufnstuf from her degenerate, dilapidated residence (I don't know where I chose to live). <Br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is scary ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see the movie having similar effects on its audience as The Exorcist, then this one is for you. Enjoy.
