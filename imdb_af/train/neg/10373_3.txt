This is one of those movies I could only read once. Charlotte Henry is fine - actually all the actors were good. The problem was in the writing, the dialogue, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, it was 1933, but it really crashed. Part of the problem is that actors such as Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Field and Cary Grant are not recognizable (faces are called for a recognition that was not going on). The movie just came together with no cohesion. Lots of Lewis Carrol's spirit, humor and continuity are lacking. What a pity! It's such a good book. I would recommend Disney's 1951 version.
