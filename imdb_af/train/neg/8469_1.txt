"Children like this" could have been a decent movie, given the subject. But instead it's a mid-average, running TV movie of the week, with not much for it. The acting is old, the plot predictable and the direction does not exist. For a better movie on the same subject, try the excellent Le Huiti√®me Jour, a movie that really cares for people with Down syndrome. In "Kids Like These" they are simply used as an excuse for vague sentimentality. Pretty appalling. 10/01
