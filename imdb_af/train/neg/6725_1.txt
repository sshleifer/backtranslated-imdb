What an engaging and emotional character study could be completely undermined by the predictable factor. Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard-trained musician who dreams to play with the Walt Disney band until his shift with schizophrenia drives him down the street and eventually drives. Looking for a good story to promote his flagship, reporter Steve Lopez (Robert "rehab" Downey) gets to know him and tells his story. With every element of the classic "how we hit the skids" movies, we borrow very liberally from "A Beautiful Mind" and take the bogus "good" attitude of movies like "Rocky". You choose the sequel number many 1930's style melodrama everything that is left on the screen is a burnt shell of a movie. It is stingy, thin, completely predictable and too often plays on our sentiments. I hate to say that, but it is the kind of movie that, if you hate it, will hate people. I really wish I could say something positive about this movie, but I really can't. The play relieves it somewhat, but not enough for me to give it more than one star. Strictly made for TV movies. Not worth your time.
