It was a bad idea to have the class look in English. Movies that are serious and educational can have an effect, but it seems that this one in no way had any effect - when the teacher left, conversations started quickly - and I don't have the words "Shakespeare" or " Tempest "used. And if you look at this, it's easy to see why. The acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored to bits, just read the page without caring in the world. Shakespeare always chose to have a prediction dialogue on action and death, but I just couldn't understand what someone was saying. The costumes are not too bad nor the special effects - the class may not have loved the movie, but they didn't actually take the p * ss. But it is difficult to joke about a movie that is no inspiration or joy. The screens on the ship at the beginning of the movie were not bad - although the rain seems a bit unrealistic, everything is well done. But where were the cut heads and explosive masts? Where was death? Where was the inspiration? The character of Ariel would have been much more serious if he wore clothes - but as everything was on the scene, he was just another excuse for a joke. This movie is by no means attractive to any sex. The women and girls have no romance or comedy to enjoy, and there are plenty of naked men and lack of action or death that most men and boys will leave. The Tempest wasn't bad, but it felt like something the producers had to do, not something they wanted to do. And show the general boredom and lack of inspiration. 10/03
