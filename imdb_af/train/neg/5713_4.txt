There is nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and rather getting an American movie experience. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion, but a good thriller depends on the creation of fun, intelligent characters. Regarding the likelihood, the key players in Say Yes are a beautiful married couple. Well done. Unfortunately, they are stupid in conviction. Let's count the ways in which they are abused by a stalker terror. <br /> <br /> 1. After a hitchhiker has killed you, tell him which hotel you stay when you release him. <br /> <br /> 2. Beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of the dozens of witnesses and allow him to print assault charges. <br /> <br /> 3. Don't be bothered to tell the police to the stalker and simply (for no apparent reason) accept police bribes. <br /> <br /> 4. As you try to escape, let your wife out of sight to ensure that the stalker is kidnapped. <br /> <br /> 5. Once you have received help from someone to get the stalker after you have been abducted, you should send it as soon as possible so that you can see him one by one. No point to be unfair, right? <br /> <br /> Now I will never expect anyone to be immune to making some mistakes under these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dull and make so many incredible mistakes that it's impossible. for the viewer to take care of their safety, since they are victims of their own. It kills the enjoyment of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you are wondering, the scriptwriters didn't stop with dull characters. Since they are certainly foolish to write this crapfest, they have decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out of the window. <br /> <br /> 1. The stalker kills a policeman in a police station? while the main character is no more than ten feet away. <br /> <br /> 2. The stalker involves all sorts of dubious activities in the broad daylight and on many people, but no one but the married couple look his strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. The stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that anyone would have killed. <br /> <br /> 4. The "suspense" scenes had no imagination. In fact, some scenes were direct rip-offs from American movies. <br /> <br /> The only positive is the near-end decapitation, which was a pretty brutal scene, as it was given to the woman. It's too bad, the filmmakers followed it with an outrageously stupid end coming from the left field. <br /> <br /> Surely the Koreans behind making Say Yes should be ashamed of themselves. Better still, they just have to move to California and work with people who make movies with a similar negligence for quality and intelligence.
