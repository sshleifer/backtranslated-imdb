I went to a preview of this movie and was shocked at how cute it was. It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√©, which tried to comment on many things, including pedophilia, Satan worship, sheltered police, affairs, religion ... and it was a mess. the acting was beautiful laundry; the child and the Jesus man were good, but apart from them .... Anyways. I admire the effort (though slightly failed) on the attempt to show the Christian in another way. Although they did, the way it was presented to the gospel was a little stock and kiddish. But then it may have to be, as he talked to a little child ... no. Actually, I decided it's not bad. music ... oh my gosh ... terribly ... overly dramatic. Okay. I felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier; It was like a poor student project. I'm going to stop ranting about this and say bottom line, go look at this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on shit. there you go.
