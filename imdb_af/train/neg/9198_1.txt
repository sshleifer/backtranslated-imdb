There are people out there who will ease everything! This is the only explanation I can offer why the House of the Dead movie exists. And it's just scary part of the whole movie. It's so bad you're going to movies forever. I wanted to shut it down seriously and switch the TV to the Paint Drying channel, but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things for myself. <br /> <br /> As if that matter, here's the basic point of the 'story'. A group of twenty somethings is so desperate to go out to an island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and unrelenting music) that they pay a rough old fisherman $ 1000 to take them there after they miss the main spring. It must be a raven to be worth the dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the island of the dead (depends, I thought it was the home of the dead?) And that they were all killed. <br /> <br /> First mistakes here. Why would a small little rave (of the Century my foot!) Be kept on a remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay a lot of money to get it? Why pay more to the old old fisherman to take them back when they just come back with the other? <br /> <br /> After arriving, they discover that the ravens (which consist of about 2 tents, a small stage and a harbor-a-john) are crushed, there is blood everywhere and no one is there no. What will any rational thinking person do? Of course, start for their lives. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to look for them. Soon they will discover an old ramshack house that is 50 times larger on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half an hour of the stumbling blocks in the forest follows an excuse to kill some of the smaller characters. After many days they come back home. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere. <br /> <br /> In this catastrophic disaster, an abundance of gibberish dialogue, hilarious acting, mumbo-jumbo outline and zillions clips of the once-popular arcade game of the same name. Why is it universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I will never know. The cuts have no reference to any of the screens and only lower them if possible. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the game, except for some cheap, disposable line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie looks multi-Oscar worthy of this junk. The only one who comes from this, with his dignity still intact, is Jurgen Prochnow. He could only have taken his money and ran, but he tried his best with the terrible writing and brought a little bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the throw sucks I'm scared. The characters are idiots and deserve to die. <br /> <br /> Plus, if you cut out the curse and useless nudity, I see no reason why this movie can't be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not scary in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this movie. And where do all the bad guys come from? There were a few people on the island to start with. I think it justifies the reason why they have decided to reuse imagery over and over. I don't kid you, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Who is finally to blame for the scandal of celluloid? No one other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is not there. You can clearly see the actors have no idea what to do and that the zombies don't really take it seriously. The actors seem to read reading cards as they continually break in the middle of long sentences and keep talking as soon as they see the next map. Everything feels very unnatural. <br /> <br /> Plus the movie is shot like a two-part mini series. I saw better TV productions. And don't start editing me. The film is a disjointed babble with thousands of inexorable shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was in making it at all. It obscures and disturbs the minds of films that can make it unholy and George A. Romero can't even get someone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes an idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be modern, but it just irritates them to think it's in the same league as a real zombie movie. <br /> <br /> For what It is worth to look good the 1.85: 1 anamorphic picture and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves the heavily overused ADR even more to speak. The DVD comes with extras, but why torture yourself. Isn't this review enough warning? Stay away! You're all doomed, I'm telling you! Doomed! Doomed !!!
