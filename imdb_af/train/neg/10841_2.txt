It was all that: it had just pop and actors who were not afraid to chew the scenery. It also had a decent script. This one scratched my head. If Farrah isn't really "serious" about a career, why does she have a manager (and why does he waste his time)? If Kate and Barney are artists, why sign up for The Mother of All Jiggle Shows (like the Brady Bunch movie where Robert Reed wants to do Shakespeare just to find him on BB)? They were not industry names, but not hungry either. And while they have history right (the poster was released before Farra got the show), Silverman rejected pitches for "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Spelling, who one day promised his baby girl Tori, will make a spectacle for of course her. didn't happen. <br /> <br /> What bothers me is how Spelling's role is distorted. He was shown as the performer and creator when he was not. And how about the "idea" for CA, is laughing! <br /> <br /> How was Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah's oral contract when the other was signed? And why didn't Farrah or Bernstein tell me she was away because she discovered her Inner Diva, but because Majors wanted her? Therefore, if it tries to create conflict and tension by setting up Farrah as the "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), it fails because the groundwork was never laid - this is where the photo of the Three Company was delivered.
