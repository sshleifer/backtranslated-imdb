Hiya people, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie really sucks. Think "Love Actually" in reverse order. Nothing is right, nothing is coherent, and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a total flop. As indicated, there are three reasoning points about this flawed film's potential. <br /> <br /> A) With a star bill from Jennifer Love Hewitt, there will be horde guys who will serve gracefully to watch it just to get a look at the petite Hewitt with form fitting clothes. Now to tell you guys .... there are a few promising scenes .... but it's really bad eyeball. The "possibilities" here are watered down. Yet I watched the whole thing being tempted by the next scene of what you know ... exciting! <br /> <br /> B) The end is romantic and positive. That it is inconsistent and "over" is relevant ..... but to me it was still a positive point. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays an amourous friendly guy ........ refreshing! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, not the value of your 10 or so dollars. <br /> <br /> 2/3 of the way through, I was convinced Jennifer Love Hewitt became the next softcore legend. Although I will take it back now ..... it depends a lot on her next movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and her sister is so stupid. Her husband is so stupid ... and what is it, she's stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. can't wait for the next Love actually with JLH!
