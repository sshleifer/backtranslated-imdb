I just didn't enjoy this movie. But then I loved Babe, a pig in the city and was spoiled by talking to animal films that were done extremely well in every way. The animals were not nice. They were all particularly annoying, especially Chris Rock's guinea pig, but then, what can I expect, it's Chris Rock. I believe I once smiled on some cute lines, but that's it.
