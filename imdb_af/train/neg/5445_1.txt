Ooof! This one was a stinker. It's not "somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller", sure. In fact, it falls somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! video and captain EO, just with not so big a budget, and many more close ups of ugly teens crying. Simon Le Bon is in the middle of the game, while the rest of the group tries to hide the fact that they have stolen their entire career from Roxy Music's last 3 albums. Short cuts from Barbarella do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the part when they played 'Hungry Like The Wolf', but why was there a tiger moving around in the audience and turning into a woman painted with tiger stripes? I mean, they don't sing 'Eye of the Tiger' not 'Hungry like the Tiger' it's a Wolf! Whatever.) A DVD of Duran Duran's' 80s videos is probably a look at nostalgia
