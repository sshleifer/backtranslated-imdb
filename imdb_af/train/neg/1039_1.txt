This movie is one of the most horrible things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent fusion. <br /> <br /> Shake the camera and keep your actors set screws, not count as "direction", which this movie needs in droves. Not that the writing was wonderful, but rather with a lot of totally artificial characters that are directed in the most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary style set by those who do not know how to regulate). <Br /> <br /> This film gives the impression that it has been cynical to appeal to critics who do not know the first thing about filmmaking (most of them). <br /> <br /> Just awful. It says a lot about Sundance and what it was that Victor Vargas was there.
