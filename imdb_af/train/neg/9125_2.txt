It is one of the funny things to be young to easily mislead through advertising. I used to talk to another movie, in which the commercial for the (comedy) movie looks harder than it is. If I saw the ad for that in 1981, I thought it would be a very funny movie. What my brother and I went to and saw with me didn't know that the scene used in the TV ad was the last scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of everything that has previously come in the movie, I can only guess there was nothing else to use! The last scene, thanks to a youth drink, is Dr. Fu Manchu turns from a tall bearded old man, into a shiny young Asian / Elvis like rock star! (With backing singers no less!) <br /> <br /> No real reason, in the 1930s, Peter Sellers does his best with the material at hand, but he doesn't have a very good reason for its "comic" moments. The rest of the actors were just dull and my brother and I sat all by laughing. It was only natural that we were expecting a "Pink Panther" kind of comedy, Peter Sellers was so nice. <br /> <br /> It's a shameful shame, it was his last movie before he died. His appearance on the Muppet show was more entertaining than that poor pregnant flop. Yet I don't owe him. I owe everyone involved not to try a better movie of this. 2 stars are generous !!
