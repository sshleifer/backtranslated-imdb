Max has the V-8, Trace (Wheel of Fire last and only hero) has a jet plane on the back of his car so he can ceaselessly make humorous faces as he destroys rockets around the halfway desert. Be surprised that Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) is being dissected and split as a new movie, though filmed in a frightful way with bad actors and turbulent stunting. Why is WoF in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? Simple, The Road Warrior was! Actually, any questions can be answered by: it was so in the Road Warrior! Except for the out-of-work mutant actors of the original 60's The Time Machine film, which makes a como look to chew the audience for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In typical 80s fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly rushed into a huge explosion. Inevitably, all motor yachts near convenient cliff sides will happen and cars will inevitably fall off them. Along with this 80-year-old movie game drive, the common disastrous misogyny in this style is cheapie movie. In general, I waited for Trace's rocket-powered car to accelerate flames, and there would be another shot from him that scorched his face, as he was supposed to be difficult. Badly-contrasted action along with bad acting makes this movie a real slower. The unintentional humor value even runs thin. <br /> <br /> Gears: Terror Nights by Bruno Mattei is better. And that is in itself a lot to say! By this score 2020 Texas Gladiators is a movie masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A poor road warrior beats that doesn't have enough cheese factor to watch the movie. <br /> <br />
