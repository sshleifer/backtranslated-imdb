Remakes (and sequels) are a staple of Cinema from the outset. It's quite a hit or a mission. If you use the original of the original and build it and update key features at current standards, you can have a success. Note, like films such as THE THIEF OR BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) have succeeded. Others like KING KONG (1976) failed, miserably. <br /> <br /> SHORTCUT (1945) is the template for this movie. It's as perfect as can be done on such a subject and we rate it IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, Love, found innocent by accident and tragically lost. Why did it just happen to the two (2) heads who were in the wrong time? It is convincingly and sensitively portrayed by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. Also not conventional front star material, but quality character actors. For the details look at the movie. <br /> <br /> What went wrong? A T.V. movie, obtained almost play for scene with actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN, had to at least have achieved IMDb ****** six. However, both actors appear disinterested and only show their time hours and pick up their checks. Also not involved with their characters or with each other. You don't believe they are in love, or when they finally divorce, it's a big loss for one of them. It should not be and therefore it fails in its intention. Sometimes it's just better to leave things alone.
