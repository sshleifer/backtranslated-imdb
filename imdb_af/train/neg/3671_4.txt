Deaf, predictable and uninteresting story of a man infected by a chemical substance (Weller) going across the country to find only his ex-wife and children. In the meantime, he all murdered in his own way just by a single touch of his hands. In his dangerous job, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The movie does not have an original point of departure, but can be even better. The final result is just a movie without stress or regret. Even the good throw is completely wasted. I give it a 4 (four).
