Pointless boring movie with charismatic Mercurio is completely wasted. Released for a minute on a Thursday in perhaps one local cinema and avoided by the whole population of Sydney except me and four others. BACK OF BEYOND is a project that is apparently created by a producer seeking a fee. Local actors such as John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (though, Polson followed a director of lame thrillers such as SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio never looks like a guernsey apart from thugs. But Paul Mercurio had to become one of Australia's biggest exports on the screen. Roles like these are great disappointments and movies like this are just a waste of talent and time.
