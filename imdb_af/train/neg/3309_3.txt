The plot, character development and gags in this movie are all extremely poor. Completely a waste of time. The conclusion from Save Grace is supposed to make the feeling warm and vague as if the characters had grown through their struggle. There was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible. The drug gags are clicked and much of the movie is not true. Build the plot that is supposed to be tension, but the characters are not developed enough to care. Then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding issues in about a minute of the screen time the viewer feels as they just wasted their time.
