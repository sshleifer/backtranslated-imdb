I watched a friend's house "Envy" on DVD two nights ago. The premise of this film is very promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a great potential comedy, but it completely fails to deliver. I watched it with about five friends and no one laughed at the whole movie. The jokes (which are few and far) are not funny in any way ... the story line is a bit, and they never answer the question ... WHERE DO THE SH * T? Of course, the answer to that is NO ONE care. This movie has no kind of comedy value, and as some other users have said, the only thing that makes it even nearly worthy is Christopher Walken as the J-man. None of the characters have been developed, the plots so thin it's almost transparent - and is the song all over the film supposed to be funny ??
