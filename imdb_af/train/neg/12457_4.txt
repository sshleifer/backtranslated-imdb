Salvatores doesn't seem to be able to decide what to do with this movie: some of them are a very poor thriller (and I say very, very poorly), some of which are an attempt to relate the main characters. explore. Both things were tried in psychological vibrators, but in this case the movie can't hold things together because of poor, superficial mini-dissertation, bad acting, and too dark, too dim cinematography. I would say that Salvatores donated his best in other genres and other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without thinking of the plot. Generally, a B movie, probably not worth your money. Vote: 4/10
