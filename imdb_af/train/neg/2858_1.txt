It must be one of the worst movies. The graphics were terrible, the acting was b-movie and the effects were just Nintendo 64 qualified. You would think they would give a little more effort. Of course this is a Scifi channel movie, so you should expect it to be low, but one takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, as a shake-your-head in disbelief movie, this one does well. <br /> <br /> While there seem to be a few "well-known" actors and actresses, it's hard for me to believe they didn't realize the quality of this movie was worth it. <br /> <br /> The graphics could have been good in the '60s or even early' 70s, but come on, it's 2009! I won't give spoilers. Let's just say if you played Jurassic Park on the Nintendo 64, you'll be very familiar with what you see in this movie. It's definitely not worth the 2 o'clock. it sat down through the thing
