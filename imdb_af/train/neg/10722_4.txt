** SPOILERS *** Slower than molasses mummy movie that includes this denial in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, which has to be broken down to keep the indigenous people who then reacted against British rule, to find out. <br /> <br /> Given the task of this archaeological dig through his superior British Capt. Get Storm Mark Dana, along with some British soldiers and mrs. Sylvia Quentin, Diane Brewster, wife of the head Man at Count Robert Quentin, George N. Neise, makes their way to the graves of the graves. On the way there comes Capt. Storm Sylvia and his men in this desert-like princess Simira, Ziva Rodann. <br /> <br /> Simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rage of desert life, she does not 'drink water or get tired, but also know what Capt. Storm & Co is looking and warning him and his group to stay as far away from the count, Pharaoh's Ra Ha Tet tomb. <br /> <By Ra Ha Tet's funeral room Robert Quentin and his archaeologist crew, along with his Egyptian guide Simira's brother Numar, Alvaro Guillot, opened his grave before Capt. Storm can get there to stop them. Quentin has violated Ra Ha Tet's body by cutting Dr Farrady, Guy Prescott, his bandages. These actions on Robert's and Dr. Farrady's share killed Numar dead in his tracks. It later turns out that Numar was somehow possessed by Ra Ha Tet's spirit or soul who took over his body and made him age 500 years to become a 3000-year-old mummy. <br /> <br /> The movie dressed Numar in what looks like some pajamas slipping around Ra Ha Tet's grave and attacking the environment and sucking from the blood to survive, like a vampire, of any human or animal he enters. Contact with. This blood-sucking adventure at Numar, with him who later loses his right arm, continues for some time until the hidden Quentin tries to find the entrance, you actually thought he'd already found it, after Ra Ha Tet's grave killing himself is an indoor rock slip. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we learn that Numar has actually revived Raaas Tetetjie in another, about 3000 years later, person or life. Numar's sister, the mysterious and sexy Simira is not only Ra Ha Tet's sister, as he and Numar are really one and the same person, but also the Egyptian Cat Goddess Babe! Not too hard to find out. <br /> <br /> With Numar / Ra Ha Tet back in his grave and all the deaths, due to the Pharaoh's Curse, now at an end, Capt. Storm Sylvia and the rest of his men and the old Robert Quentin's archaeological expedition back to Cairo and modern, this in 1902, civilization.
