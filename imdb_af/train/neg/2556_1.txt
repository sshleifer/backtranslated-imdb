Well, it's been said about this movie and I hate it when writing reviews where everyone else has already said what needs to be said. But the thing is, I've seen seventeen movies and I'm working to write reviews on all the movies I've seen. So, I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The acting is stupid. It's really stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness after the plane crash. The nun is nice and the professional assistant comes to look after the child. The three main killings in the movie are just so bad you wonder how stupid the creators of this movie can be. Don't realize that even rip-offs can still be frightening. We don't see how the granpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserved to die, but you didn't sympathize with them. And Uncle Tony in the garage dies in a way that worked better. We just hear him screaming and we see nothing!
