I suppose any novel that has so much of a downer as Moby Dick doesn't get much favor with depression-era audiences who have had enough of their own problems. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the movie is a prelude to the main story as we know it, not to much of the film being held. We first meet Ahab Creely (he has a family name and a brother) as one happy, happy two-legged soul and intent to marry Joan Bennett, who is Father Mapple's daughter. That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in a top performance. Barrymore did not master the sound theater properly and he published with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage stamp that would shake the beams of any movie in the movie in which the film was playing. <br /> <br /> We see Agab losing his leg to the big whale Moby Dick and I have to say the amputation scene was pretty horrible. Of course, that was all before the Code. Yet I am sure that 1930 audiences have moved. <br /> <br /> Then the story of Ahab's hunt for the whale he thinks made him unsightly in Joan Bennett's eyes. This is not exactly Melville's motivation. In fact, there are no women characters in Moby Dick as he wrote it. <br /> <br /> One of the things Melville did was the crew of Ahab's ship, the Pequod, with personalities. Unlike Queequeg's cannibal harpoon, the names are there, but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs can only be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I want to see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.
