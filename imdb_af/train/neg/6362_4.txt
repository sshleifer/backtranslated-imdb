I am a huge fan of Italian films of the seventies, and I will not hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favorite actresses of all time, so I went with some hope in this movie. However, it soon becomes clear that this is a big, silly film that doesn't go anywhere. Obviously, no one is expecting this expectation any more, but the fact that it becomes senseless becomes more annoying when you think it is rather boring and none of the characters is interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'villain'; In this case, one who steals, is braiding and smuggling. It's basically all the plot this movie has. The movie does have a true 'seventy style' for it and the idea that it gets everything free from care becomes good. It sometimes looks as if directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to make a point, although it didn't work out well. To see Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and this is also the case here; She is definitely the best of the movie and the order in which she hangs from a car is the best part of the movie. Overall, The Rogue will probably appeal to people who like style in the 1970s, but unfortunately it doesn't have much to offer.
