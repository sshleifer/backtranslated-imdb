George P. Cosmatos 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' is pure wish fulfillment. The United States clearly did not win the war in Vietnam. They caused further damage to this country than the imaginable and this movie continues with the fairy tale story of the cute innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice. He is extremely patriotic, emphasizing that American Americans do not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but have nothing but distrust of leaders and politicians. Like any film that defends the war (eg "We were soldiers"), this one also avoids the need to give an understandable reason for involvement in South Asia. And also the reason for every American American soldier there was. Instead, Rambo gets revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work how to handle the memories rather than suppress them. "Let's get this time to win?" Yes you do.
