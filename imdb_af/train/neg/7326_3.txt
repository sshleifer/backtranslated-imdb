This movie has an interesting plot, but the play is very bad and the writing is poor. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma facing the main character is an intriguing one, but due to poor writing and decisions, this potential winning site is being plundered. 2 out of 4 other people left in the theater after about 45 minutes and the other 2 laughed at how bad the movie was. I held it to the end, but I have to admit that I played Blackjack on my cellphone for the last 30 minutes.
