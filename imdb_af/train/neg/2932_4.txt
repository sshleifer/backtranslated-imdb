Not that he cares, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I were, there was a good chance we would fall out if he continued. The problem is, he has found a successful formula as the bumbling, regular man-by-door type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, and so on. But it starts to thin. Here his character has no noticeable characteristics, he is rude and unpleasant, and thinks he is funny when he is not honest. When I move to London to New York (and I assume this link is for the viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he also doesn't prove to his new colleagues. Yet it is a wonder when he rents a jolly jumper among his jolly japes to appear at an editorial meeting for an act of revenge for his boss. But in one way or another, Kirsten Dunst started warming him, though he didn't do anything nice. Oh, and because he is a superficial man, he falls to Megan Fox at first sight, possibly because her character is as level as she is. All this allows for a predictable film conclusion, although I can't see any viewer reflecting their life. The shame is that it is a paper worth watching on paper. However, Pegg plays himself, Kirsten Dunst just seems to go the moves, but not on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox is not stretched at all. One big plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now she's been on the screen for longer ...
