A disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> The story started our protagonist as Chrissy, a 'young', rather than an individual, and not done much. Actually, she does very little to move the narrative together so that I did not surprise me to shift the focus on her family. It's a pity, though, Chrissy looks like an interesting character. <br /> <br /> Story was predictable and sometimes felt well formulated. So, the question is now, when are we going to see the Champions, Jacksons and the Tamahori breakaway with compelling, spectacular stories that will inspire rather than entertain the two-hour toll? <br /> <br /> Technically, a disgusting shooting movie.
