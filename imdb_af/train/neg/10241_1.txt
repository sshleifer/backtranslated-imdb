It is an incomprehensible, terrible, low budget of fear. <br /> <br /> I don't even have the vocabulary to say how awful, tedious, boring, confusing and just strange is this attempt (Hey what you know I'm doing ....) In a post Apocalyptic America meets some guys on a beach and hits and follows chaos - it was all so incomprehensible that I couldn't make a head or tail. <br /> <br /> Seriously, how it was picked up by National Lampoon saves me all the time: it's really awful. <br /> <br /> And not in such a bad way is a good cult way. <br /> <br /> It's just awful, terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you do not yet believe me, then look with all intentions to love it, then come back here and tell me what you think. Even gerbils on acid can't hope to understand it. <br /> <br /> Avoid or even better destroy ...
