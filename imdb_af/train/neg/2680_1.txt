Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I would like to see. I also didn't have the movie when some Aussie men smuggled drugs into Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I wouldn't go to that country, no matter what I saw after that. In fact, this movie stinks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I tolerate. Rather, I would rather stay with the United States. After watching the movie in the theater, including the false accusation of drug smuggling, I left the theater and repaid my money because I can't bear this movie. If you go to Thailand to meet someone there who can be a drug tracker, forget it!
