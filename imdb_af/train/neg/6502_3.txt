Given the chance to write, director and star in my own movie, I would probably choose something about robotic women with guns. Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make the strangest movie anyone ever saw. "Slipstream" is a movie that is so strange that even David Lynch will probably look at the person next to him and say, "What's going on?" <br /> <br /> It is a movie where, in one scene, a man crosses the road to a yellow car turning right, which suddenly turns into a pink car pointing to the left. It's a movie where two characters have a conversation with the shots of random people who laugh and insects that climb walls. It's a movie where a man starts talking about "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers" just for the actor of the particular movie to suddenly look up to him (and then disappear into the air). <br /> <br /> It is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different modifications while doing so, as well as changing from black and white to seemingly No reason not to have it at all. <br /> <br /> However, I must praise Mr Hopkins for his selection of actors in this movie (some of them portray more characters). Everyone involved throws themselves into their roles, even though they probably have no idea what they actually do. My favorite here was Christian Slater's boyfriend in an imposing hat while being rude and singing the American anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins was quoted as saying he did this movie as a joke and it is perhaps the best way to summarize 'Slipstream'. It's a joke on the audience. You will see it from start to finish, try to understand what is going on and hope that the answer will come, only to discover that the answer never really does. What the punchline for this particular joke is, just Anthony Hopkins will ever know. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I'm a big fan of that particular director. I would guess Anthony Hopkins shares my love for "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". Slipstream, however, is not as satisfying as any of Lynch's movies despite the imitation of many of his techniques (although I was surprised to discover that no one is talking back in "Slipstream"). It's too chaotic and arbitrary - as another reviewer remarked here, it is the movie version of Alzheimer's disease. There is undoubtedly a small number out there that can see it and draw something from it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "Slipstream" quickly becomes a boring and confusing experience made only by Hopkins involvement. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
