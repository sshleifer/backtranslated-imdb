We went to this movie because my husband enjoyed the original version of "My Favorite Martian". We had our 6-year-old daughter with us. She wanted to go halfway through the movie, which was good with both her parents! The parts we saw were just occasionally humorous, mostly stupid or rough. I would expect this movie to be able to attract children between 9-12, if so. It is definitely not suitable for younger children. From what I heard the original series was by far better and if you were to relive the past, you would probably be disappointed.
