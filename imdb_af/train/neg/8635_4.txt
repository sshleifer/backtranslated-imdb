It's certainly not one of Lucio Fulci's better movie by any imagination. The plot is pretty bad, a millionaire is killed and his muscle calls on his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with this (except knowing who killed him in 10 minutes of the movie) was wondering why someone should even take care of it? The dad came off as a very big jerk to anyone he attacked (including the girl he was asking him to help him) that made it difficult for anyone to care for what killed him. But no one really watches a Fulci movie for a good storyline, to do so is like watching a porn for incredible writing and acting. Typically she tries to compensate for movies by adding excessive scenes of gore, but even in this movie it is missing. If you're looking for a good Fulci movie, check out The Beyond.
