For a strange reason, the film world is driven by fashion. Someone makes a movie about a killer shark, and suddenly the movie worlds oceans are excited with giant scales, killer sea buckets and sea monsters from every ilk. A man is beaten by a former hell lover, and every film character is captured by a hell of a hell or a platoon of hell or a babysitter from hell. Then, when a big Hollywood company produces a huge budget for FX charged over tornadoes, other movie producers jump on the train wagon, the fact that they don't have the budget to deduct it, doesn't stop them. NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point. What made me do this for television films is the fact that it's trying to hide its lack of budget by cutting advertising paths. Every time a tornado appears, the camera looks at the horrible expression of the actors as they scream like, "Oh my gawd, it's so on the way" and "Run for your lives", then the screen fades black around the producers to save. the special effects budget. Unfortunately, nights from the TWISTER budget must be used to include better actors. The role players are by no means bad, but they are unimpressive and do not have the ability to carry a movie that is character-driven. Where is Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need it? <br /> <br /> And the last word on this is a TWISTER clone ..... Yes, NOTT was released a few months before TWISTER, but TWISTER was Hypnosis for a few months as the Summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT have a keen sense of what makes me believe it's made and released to connect to the hype around TWISTER
