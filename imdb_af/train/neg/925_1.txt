okay, this movie f * ck in 'rules. This is without a doubt one of the most technically unknown pieces of cinema ever made. absolutely terrible, but you see it well. rent it with your friends and come with a drinking game or just fun, it's hilarious. And the behind-the-scenes featurette proves it, you can do anything with paper plates and finger paints. awesome. Okay, just rent it for this one scene: two characters actually run for about 3 minutes in a shot. The director (on the comment) says "yes, the detection was so smooth that they looked ...". Yes, real man, they are completely in place. It's so funny.
