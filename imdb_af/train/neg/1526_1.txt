I may have seen worse movies than this, but if I have, I don't remember. Or possibly blocked them out. Who knows, if I have to undergo hypnotherapy, I might remember them, perhaps, kidnap with strangers as a child or other traumas. If so, I would like to exchange the memories for those I want from this movie. <br /> <br /> I need to give the movie some credit: It produced an emotional response. I was actually angry with scenes mocking other movies and TV shows that this travesty polluted them by association. I'm afraid I might not be able to see movies like Dr Strangelove again without this movie flashing my mind.
