Personally, I think this show looks pretty cheap. Some of the actors are horrible. They do it and look fake. I can always tell how it will end in the first 10 minutes or less because it makes it so transparent. It is also not well written. I like to watch it to laugh at it. You know the words: "It's so bad it's good?" Well, this applies to this display. I also like to just look to see if I'm right when I guess how it all ends. So far, I've had every right. It's like a little game I play. It's nice if you're bored and you feel like you're laughing.
