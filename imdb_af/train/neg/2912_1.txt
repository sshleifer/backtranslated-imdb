"Meatball Machine" should be one of the most complex ridiculous, terrible and exaggerated sci-fi horror movies I've ever experienced. It's about good against evil and an outdated story, with the purpose of entertaining with bloody, messy and humorous context. As a result, violence is not very abominable and it does not hurt you, but the free blood loss and nudity run freely. The performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst I have seen. If that wasn't enough, it was also directed by an unheard-of director called Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie has everything, it's bad on the bone! A must see for every b-movie freak! ... Usually: an enjoyable and rare jewel.
