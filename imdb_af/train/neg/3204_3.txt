While it's not as bad as it was made to be (I saw much worse), it's still a very lame movie. Basically a rehash of Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff", with the greatest difference being that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole of Joe Don Baker, an unattractive actor when there was one. <br /> <br /> But Venantino Venantini is big (and fun) as the bad guy, kind of budget, Vittorio Gassman. He is the main reason to sit through this steampile, as the rest of the cast mostly acts terribly, especially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe he was once a romantic lead (see "Mondo Cane" to see him run away from women). If he looks at a second-level Ben Gazzara, he does nothing. It's all Joe Don's performance, unfortunately. And it all played in the 80-year-old "action movie" music that couldn't be boring. <br /> <br /> Greydon Clark can make good B-movies ("without warning"), but here he falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, the Malta places were at least nice, and there is Venantini trying to save the day. 10/03.
