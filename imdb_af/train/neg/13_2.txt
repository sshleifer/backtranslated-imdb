Poor plot, predictable violence, only semi-interesting characters. Like the author (also one of the stars?), His own screw solutions were formalized and he added an incredible fantasy of drugs and murder to make it "hot." From the predictable rap and home soundtrack, to the family conflicts, it is poorly performed, stereotypical and ultimately dull. Even the title was done before - IMDb calls FIVE movies of the same name released in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: Seen it at Showtime, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies. Was halfway until I realized nobody was a sub-captain. Even the other stereotype would have made it interesting if it happened.
