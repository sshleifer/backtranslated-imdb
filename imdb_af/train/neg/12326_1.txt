A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15 year old son (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all tied up in a stupid plot or something. <br /> <br /> Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. Does anyone know that this movie makes light of child molestation? I think that's right because it's a teenage boy - if we had one with a teenager, it would be (legitimately) outraged. Sorry, but to do this to a boy, don't excuse it. It's still sick. I realize Brown was of age (he was actually 18 when it was made), but he looked 15. I just find it disturbing that some people find it OK. <br /> <br /> Plot aside the acting (Kristel is beautiful - but can't act; brown is easily one of the worst kids I've ever seen) and the constant nudity becomes boring and not even the distance from the erotic. <br /> <br /> I saw this drift at a theater back in 1981. I was 19 and with my 14-year-old cousin (who could easily pass 18). He wanted to see it - I didn't, but I decide what the heel? We came in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage. My cousin is boring and the other three children left halfway! Let me make it clear - three teenage coats left a movie with tons of female nudity! It should give you an idea of ​​how bad it is. I'm surprised it's ever been released. A 1 all the way.
