The plot is about a female nurse, called Anna, caught in the midst of a worldwide chaos when carnivorous zombies start to take off and take over the world and attack life. She escapes in the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far so good! I usually enjoy horror movies, but this piece of film doesn't deserve the horror. It's not even exciting, just ridiculous. Even "the Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like a lot of bloodthirsty drunks who can't get into a shopping mall with more liquor. The heroes who locked themselves up inside the mall to prevent them from being eaten by the hoodlums are also no better. Although not drunk, they give the impression that they are mentally disabled. Save your money instead of spending it on it!
