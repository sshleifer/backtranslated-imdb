One of the most boring slashers ever. If you can even call it. I won't see it if it's even a kind of porn movie, which looks exactly like it. The fact that you look at a small group of middle-aged people is really unbearable. They made these kind of movies for teens, so for whom were they really looking when they made this sleeping party? My favorite part of this movie is the cover art and that is the only reason I chose to search this movie, which was part of a Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack. And having seen the other movies in this 50 pack will realize that it belongs nowhere else. So if you're in the mood for a decent treasure in the woods, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
