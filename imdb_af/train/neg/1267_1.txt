Why me? Why do I have to undergo such a blow that could make an interesting plot?! At least if I can warn other people, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the back of the item after the summary and got clear. The movie was slow, PAIN VOLLEDIG had little character development, and concentrated around the idea that a flu, white, white man could be cool when he hung on an LA-style token black man. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizziness superficial - look at the movie. Please note that this movie is not DEPICT that we considered a "LA lifestyle", it is a wonderful example of the products that come from it.
