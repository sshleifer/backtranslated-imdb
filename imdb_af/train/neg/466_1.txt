How can I best express my feelings about this movie? a headache? lack of coherent writing? ordinary stupidity? Try all of the above for this travesty. And just for the direction. <br /> <br /> Story? Well, I think there's a story. Two stupid blondes looking for a job after crashing into a golf course. They are mistaken for a 'world-convicted killer' (sarcasm) and are hired by two 'killers'. One thinks 'take him out' means a date, and the other gets the minor actor whose dreams are. And, of course, the tortoise pickup address, which they build with the casino profits. <br /> <br /> Sounds like all these things can be funny? Guess again. They try to make it funny, but it is not. Filming sequences are not well done. I saw better filming in Hong Kong movies. Visuals are average for a late 80's movie. But the problem is that it is a 2007 movie. <br /> <br /> Not worth seeing it ever again. It still doesn't beat Danny Glover's "Early 80s" Out movie as the worst movie of all time, but then that movie is in a class of its own. "F"
