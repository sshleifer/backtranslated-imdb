This is one of those dramas that is so bad that it gets almost funny, the writing is absolutely scary, relieves direction frightening, pure luminaire, the only thing that makes it feel so real is that it's good, is that the sound design is just very bad; It does not add any tension to the story, but tries hard but does not at least destroy any speeches. There are ongoing problems of seasons from outside shuttles throughout. And last but not least, it's scary. For a professional production, it has the feeling of a university media project that you have to feel sorry for the pity of anyone who had to put their names on it.
