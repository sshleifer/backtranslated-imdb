The entire Biker Movie genre must consist of the worst movies ever made. This one produces many battles, large amounts of blood, bikers fighting Indian and a shanty village that is inflated and torn down on one ditch. The acting is over. What ever happened to Robert Walker, Jr? At one stage he was in a few big studio productions, and then he just disappeared. This movie really blows, but if you haven't seen a Biker movie for a long time, it's a good one to watch. At the end of the movie, you have to feel a little trash because you watched it!
