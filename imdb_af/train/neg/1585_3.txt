::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, Arnie is really a good guy, but after an incident with some battles in a helicopter and some disobedience of orders, he becomes the jail sent (or rather a kind of work camp). He escaped, but after a while he was caught again. This time ends in a freakish reality show in which he is supposed to run for a while from a lot of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know he's harder than even the most difficult of difficult guys. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to keep this movie, an Arnie fan and everyone. However, "The Running Man" contains too many errors that really annoy the crap. Eg The reconstruction of Arnie's battle in the helicopter, where the shocked audience showed a brief summary of the incident, with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew is equipped with nearly 10 cameras filmed by crew members, one of which is one of Arnie's crew members. <br /> <br /> There are also other errors, and the plot, which in theory looks very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then it creates a pool of stupidity and unrealistic in which it drowns. <br /> <br /> The play can't really be said to be something better than subpar, with Arnie starring, doing an average Arnie performance. The rest of the wheelchair is replenished without being very good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are OK, without being impressive. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3/10
