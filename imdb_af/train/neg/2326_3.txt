Dr Mordrid is scary. I would not recommend any adult or child to see it unless they already hide murderers. There is so much filth in this movie, it hurts me. Talking with eyes, there are eyes in the sky against a background of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined such an evil thing. I hired every copy I could get from local video stores and cut them with a 5-pound crucifix. The movie must be locked in the basement behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting animals of hell. This is where this movie belongs. I suggest that if you want a scandalous entertainment, All Dogs Go To Heaven, or Angels In The Outfield, will be renting. Those movies are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love lovely movies, you must dr. See Mordrid.
