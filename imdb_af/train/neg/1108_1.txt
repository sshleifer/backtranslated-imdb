A dry and useless piece of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Poorly written, with reluctant and wooden dialogue. You don't care if the characters (indeed, even the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little point on the whole thing. Perhaps some of the set and the environment will be interested - the gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life lived. The framework meeting is unnecessary and distracting, and the Hoppalong Cassidy character himself is boring and unbeaten.
