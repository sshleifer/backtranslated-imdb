Wimpy-padded shirt Armand Louque (brilliantly played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls for the beautiful Claire Duval (blonde Dorothy Stone) who uses the soft juice to get Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson (the hopeless wood Robert Noland) to marry her. Furious about using and rejecting Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to take revenge. Sound exciting? Well, that's for sure. To begin with, Victor Halperin's static (not) direction leaves the winding and inexorable conversation-enhancing story-plow at a very slow pace. Worse still, Halperin does not fail to bring tension, atmosphere and momentum to the boring boring proceedings. Most leaves that play a largely unrelated role do not help; only George Cleveland as the cordial general Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the three-quarter Dr. Trevissant succeed in renewing things a little with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics. The droplet stock of movie library count, the painfully obvious sets, and the crude cinematography are also bad and petty. In fact, this poor excuse for a terrifying feature is so crummy that even the unsaved staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can ease the annoying boredom. A dismally dull dud.
