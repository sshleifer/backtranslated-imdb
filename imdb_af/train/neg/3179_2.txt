I saw this movie by accident at a cinema yesterday. I had hope for the movie because I really like Spoorloos and the book on which it is based. The movie starts out well, because it looks like it's a nice game first. Although the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines, characters that are never wiped out and no one in the audience cares (such as Marjoke) and horrible editing. The movie has faded into black bits that are just too long, a winding chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just add nothing to the story and could easily drop. After struggling through the story, you are treated to one of the worst endings I have seen for a long time. It should also be mentioned that the movie has many explicit sex scenes, which you are probably used to when you watch many Dutch films. It is difficult to mention any good things about this movie. About a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway through the movie and I didn't hear a good word after the movie was over. Avoid this movie at all costs. It really destroyed the faith I left in the Dutch film industry.
