Needless remake, and it can't get close to capturing the charm of the original. The extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The movie does not have style, and mostly it has talent, not just the acting, but the direction, sets, costumes, etc. Are all under par. It has a blatant disregard for the detail period. Vanessa Williams is the only player who shows flair, Tyne Daly is not bad. They had to leave well enough alone. The song varies well (Vanessa Williams) to poor (everyone else). View the original 1963 version and save this one. There is not much to recommend here.
