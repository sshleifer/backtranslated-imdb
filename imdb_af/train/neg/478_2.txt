The competition for the worst Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is stiff. I only saw eight of them, but Comet on Broadway has so far been the worst. The very best thing about it is that it is short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are good. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis looks throughout fat and is less attractive than she usually does. Minna Gombell, who I don't know otherwise, is good as a semi-hard "burlesque" dancer (it looks more like a fashion show than burlesque). The last shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I flow out?) To move a dirt road to a prison painted in misty outlines is at a healthy stage drop over. The whole film is so cheap, so indisputable and so indifferent that it gets infected by an acid cynicism on the part of everyone who made it: Warner Bros throws waste at dolts who don't know, in Wyner Bros' cynical estimate of They, that what they get is garbage.
