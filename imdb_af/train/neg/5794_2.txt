The Germans are all open and are cut off with a machine gun. the good guys never die unless it is for dramatic purposes. the "plot" has so many holes laughing. (Where did the German soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank to the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, hijack a train? How moronous it is! The Germans know where you're going, it's not like you can leave and run away! What a waste. I'd rather nod on the head with a ball-carpet hammer 10 times, then I have to sit through it again. I mean, seriously, it feels like it's made in the 60's, but it's produced in 88! 1988 !! the A team is more credible than this horrific movie excuse. Just look at it if you need a good laugh. This movie is for Tele Sevalas who was Green Bearer for John Wayne.
