Through the numbers story of the Kid (Prince), a singer, heading for a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife-beating father (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a theater in 1984. I wasn't a big fan of Prince, but I like the three great songs of this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy", and "When Doves Cry". The concert scenes in this movie are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, this is a very small part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is screaming of course and has been done many times before - and much better too. The subplots are poorly handled to put in well. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I was actually offended. His beating wife is needed for the story, but the scenes are so badly handled (in acting and direction) that I couldn't believe it. The script is awful - bad dialogue and some painful "comedy" routines. And there are many misogynies here - the child's mother is beaten; The child beats Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. The characters of Williams and Princes also treat women constantly in a horrible way. <br /> <br /> The play is where this movie really fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but not an actor. And Prins is (easily) the WORST actor I've ever seen. His empty face and the delivery of wood dialogue are so bad that I couldn't believe it. This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes, but there isn't really that much. The "dramatic" scenes were so badly dealt with that they made this movie a task to go through. They just had to make it a concert movie. I give it a 2 - just for the music.
