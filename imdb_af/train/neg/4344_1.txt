If you hit your head with a spade, write the writing with your feet, you can come close to the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this movie that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and is much better done. Those who think "Scarface" were a kind of hero looking at "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead Presidents", and thought MMM "It's life for me!" will keep this movie. I thought I'd give the movie a chance as the premise was perfect for a prequel. I needed to know better after Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved. Anyone above a 4th grade education, see the original with Pacino, a true actor, and be content.
