Usually I don't think Hollywood productions are fit to be called movie, so I rather call them 'movies'. But this piece of elephant dung is not even suitable for a movie, hence the titles in the title. Where will I start? 1. If it's not the beginning of geriatric casting, it's probably its characteristic. Stefanie Powers has to play someone less than half her age, she is supposed to play an 18-year-old. <br /> <br /> 2. A horrible and stupid thought depiction of Paris and France, where we see clich√© characters such as the sympathetic grumpy shopkeeper, the kid queen of models, the fairy-tale ma-ma-ex queen of models, etc. This film is only surpassed on this. respect by the Da Vinci code, (which judges correctly determined was a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It is highly and completely ridiculous to have no nudity in a movie over time and a place where nudity was so common, especially if the whole focus is on it. <br /> <br /> 4. The terrible accent !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The Nana Mouskouri lift music! <br /> <br /> I can keep going, but I think that's enough. And I was able to make these observations after watching this shit for just half an hour, WHEN I surfing the internet and talking to my friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
