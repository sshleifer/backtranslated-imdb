I'm somewhat of a fan of Lynche's work, so I was excited when I got this DVD. Unfortunately I was very late. It is a series of short cartoons that try to show a disturbing and disgusting kind of humor. The animation is very rough, no doubt using Macromedia. Every cartoon has a big fat man who defeats his family and generally acts like someone he knows. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with this bait of animation, they will probably be slightly impressed. However, if you spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons would be different from any of the other things you've seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists at Newgrounds do much better than shown on this DVD. If Lynch submitted this work to the site, he would blend in perfectly with some of the better Newgrounds artists. But since I saw it on DVD, instead of on Newgrounds, I give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as I would otherwise have liked. These cartoons are suitable for the internet, but with a name like David Lynch on it, I expected better quality in the story and in animation.
