This movie was a disappointment. I look forward to seeing a good movie. I'm the type of person who starts a movie and doesn't turn it off until the end, but I have forced myself not to switch it off. <br /> <br /> The reason I didn't turn it off was because I was a great Christian Slater fan and I wanted to see him. I was really speechless after I finished the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies I saw in my life. Thank you Christian Slater for adding humor to it. If you weren't in this movie, I'd be bored of my mind. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins should be acting. By the time the movie was over, I didn't even get the plot. I was both confused and irritated.
