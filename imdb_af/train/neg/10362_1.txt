Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie was set in the 60's, as the book was. And I could really handle cheap special effects to save the budget for a more accurate adjustment ..... I'm glad someone might be influenced to read the books ..... but The Man With Red Eyes Interchangeable AS IT? And how about the volcanic revolution? Where was it in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! I heard long ago (1978) that there was a European version of this movie. I sure wish I could identify it. I can only think that this could be closer to the real story than this poor adaptation. This movie should be X'd.
