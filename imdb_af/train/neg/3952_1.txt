Returning the Boogyman is a horrible movie that doesn't play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they look back on older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just an exhibition program. <br /> <br /> Movie's mutch is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie. About the same footage. How boring it is. <br /> <br /> The movie is really about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie I didn't want to see The same scenes over and over and I don't know who would do it. The whole movie looks like it's made fast to make a few bucks and that's it.
