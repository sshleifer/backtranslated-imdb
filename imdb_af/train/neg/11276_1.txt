I won't waste my time and write a lot more about how every aspect of this movie is indescribably bad. It's been done in great detail, many times over. The plot started as a very uninspiring cock-wide gang / gangster by-number drill and quickly fell to a heavy collision. Anyone who claims to see a hidden masterpiece in this terrible mess is joking. It's been 7 or 8 years since I watched it at the cinema during his 1 week run before it was pulled out, but it seems that I am easily the most horrible movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm just making these remarks, and the only reason I'm going to watch the movie is because it's my amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second "heavy" in the bar. It was his hands pushing a zippo lighter in the direction of Rhys Ifan's face in the pub in 'Russia' (it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp on Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience - he recently joined an agency and it was his first part. I remembered that there were about 8 people in the whole movie - and it was only a few days after it was released. . I have never heard of another movie that was so unpopular and so quickly disappeared - and rightly so. If you think about renting this DVD on the DVD, I'd rather recommend putting your two pound coins in a fire until they're red-hot and then bumping them into your eyebrows. It will probably be far less painful than watching the movie.
