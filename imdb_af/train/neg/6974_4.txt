Blue monkey is actually called in the movie, but not in any way that makes any sense. At one point, some children wander through the deeper levels, exploring. <br /> <br /> They start discussing what they will find there and one of them (a girl) says she's going to find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. Completely indifferent to the story, the only sad connection with the title, and no idea why she would suppose she would find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed of remembering it but someone had to remember I suppose!
