I would have enjoyed this movie, something that was not yet for Jason (Herb) Evers, was constantly running on experiments. Many early judges of The Seven Samurai have accused Toshiro Mifune of not persuading them. Yet, as more and more critics saw the movie, they saw it purposefully. Of course, Jason Evers is not Toshiro Mifune, and his offense is exactly that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in these B-classics were rather good actors, little Evers and the showgirls. If you watch this movie, you might have noticed that Evers shouted almost every line, that is, until he smokes and cools the smoke from his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects were par for the course in a B movie like this one. In hindsight, there is not much that stands out in my mind as wonderful or bad for this movie.
