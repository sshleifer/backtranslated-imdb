The Ballad of Django is a winding mess of a movie! These spaghetti westerns are just a collection of scenes from others (and much better!) Movies that are supposedly tied together by "Django" and tells how he brought in different outrageous things. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) does not matter to Django's role. Skip this one unless you just have to have every Django movie and even that might not be a good enough excuse to see this one !!
