the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is. With a plot that your average middle school writer looks good, and acting almost as well, it gets my bottom line. One of Tom had many early films where he obviously didn't have the pleasure of being really picky. The best special effect of the film is a man dressed in an incredibly fake rubber monster.
