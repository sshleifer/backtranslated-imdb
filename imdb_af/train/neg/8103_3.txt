It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't care what the critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with Kundera's novel. It's not that it's unmovable; It's just like 99% of his work, it's pretentious and overdone. He seems to be enchanted with himself, his characters appear as nail-watch, and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. I read many of his works (even his socialist realistic poetry. It was really terrible) - I just don't understand what the fuss is about. Features (such as self-absorption) in his novels make for disturbing reading. In a movie, all the things I don't like about Kundera are enlarged. Maybe I just missed something, but I don't think so. On a lace note, I can't believe it's a Criterion Collection DVD. No way is this movie that is essential.
