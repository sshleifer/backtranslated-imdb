I probably don't give this movie a fair shake, because I couldn't see it. Perhaps, if I saw it in a theater, I appreciated it in its original presentation, but it was too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book about 25 years ago and the details of the plot disappeared from memory. It did not help the movie, because it is slightly less than clear and clear in presenting the events. <br /> <br /> It is really four linked movies, or a four-part movie, and I believe it was meant to be seen in a theater presentation over four nights. I found Part I to be enjoyable enough, but that was all I could do to place Part II, which is unmistakable. Reading Tolstoy's philosophy is one thing. If you get a good translation or read it in the original, its brilliant writing is much heavier than any problem you can have with the pace of the story. On film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without being poundy. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with the parts of the movie I've seen. It is very brilliant, with lots of hey-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself, rather than promoting the story. <br /> <br /> Obviously I'm missing something, but I just couldn't call the enthusiasm to divide parts III and IV.
