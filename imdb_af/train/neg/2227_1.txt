Every once in a while someone from the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks "What's with SNITCH'D"? I know right away they have a case of barely hidden entertainment + horror. You see, I was the movie maker on the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me explain some points about this "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally, SNITCH'D was called a HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, a day after wrapping TRIANGLE SQUARE, a very small 35mm feature that never spread like many indie features of the era, despite festival awards ... it has became the eternal victim of the fine print of SAG's infamous experimental feature contract. But I'm going out ... <br /> <br /> I've been on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster movie in 16mm, with a shooting budget of about $ 25,000, I didn't want to stop, I took it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... I also believed the myth. <br /> <br /> Let's just make it a 'film school' for many involved, including it. SNITCH'D was shot in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA in two weeks in August 1999. Cahill taught drama to a high school in the latter city (yes, he is a drama and English teacher ... consider it while watching the movie or even using apostrophe in title), so the places and throws. /> <br /> Of note in its role was the only known dramatic appearance of LA's Channel 2 Morning News again, Vera Vera Vera, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who just arrived in Hollywood and was like I'd like to get a film under her belt. I must say her professional dedication, focus and "let's do it" attitude inspired me and was a shadow of her death-yet-to-come. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D was poor optics, few lights or electricity, multiple speed operators, and the delivery of a disability offline for duplication. None of them overshadow the real content that speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> Anyway, by 2003, the movie was sold to distributors (on a net loss I understand) that had inexplicably no pictures of Eva on the box (then she was a rising working name), but who managed to get a clear picture of what a real Latino gangster looks like, to make SNITCH'D credible. As Cahill's other passion concerns ancient bookshops, it seems to confirm that he believes you can actually judge a book about the cover ... as so much this DVD picked up on the sleeve. A year later, Eva, now on a soap, and I met James one day to shoot a simple short film that he had infected, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen a play in spite of the intention of the festival. <br /> <br /> Six years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill movie titled JUAREZ, Mexico. I've already worked out the process. My participation was dependent on decisive, script and crew control, and the resultant movie actually looked promising in daily newspapers because it was ... a cheap detective story about the massacres of girls in Juarez; Despite claims here and elsewhere, the film has never appeared in any festival or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed that the film has spread and just waited on release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio photos on the same subject, Virgin or Jairz BORDERSTAD.
