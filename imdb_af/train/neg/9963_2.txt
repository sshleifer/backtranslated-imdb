I love Alec Guinness. And it says a lot about this movie. Actually, he's not bad. He just seems to be set aside, to be urban and his usual beautiful self, but invest nada. It is obvious that the girl he is adapting to is a featherweight, even as an inexperienced young French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen her when he was young and of course that is not too happy. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the breeding brother of the strange "Suzanne", another twit. "Donald" strives to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery. What deep dark secret did he stab behind that forehead? Was he in love with the father's mistress? Why did he shake Suzanne's hair when she wanted to bring the different parts of this turkey together on the estate? Or maybe he just had enough of her unpleasant performances. <br /> <br /> The film would have been with Guiness and the "older woman" who remembers and sees Paris together. It would have been a wonderful story! Two beautiful experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why didn't anyone come with it? I suggest to watch Alec Guiness in "The Card", a little known but worth the film.
