Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people who leave positive comments on this movie must receive royalties. It's a terrible movie in all respects. Imagine having high school children with no money and no sense of humor to make a shooter / comedy video. They will receive a D for this. College children will receive a F or be asked to leave school. As this monstrosity was made by "Professionals", I believe there should be a prison sentence or at least cinema experience. I enjoy watching bad movies like "Plan 9 From Outer Space", but this thing doesn't even fall into that category. The writing, acting, sound and direction are so bad that it is virtually uncompromising. If you like watching amusing bad movies, join Ed Wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror movies. After watching it, you get the feeling that you wasted half an hour on your life.
