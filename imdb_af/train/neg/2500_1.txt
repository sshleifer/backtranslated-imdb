Van Dien must be embarrassed in the reminder of this ridiculously poor film, like any individual involved. To be honest, I'm quite ashamed to admit that I've looked at it from beginning to end. Production values ​​are somewhere between the original series 'Crossroads' and 'Prisoner Cell Block H'. Most five-year-olds could come with more realistic dialogue and a more likely plot. Regarding the upcoming performances, if you can think of the most junk porno you've ever seen, it's one of the one where the action has been poured out with some unmistakable 'story' to explain how some parent peroxide came in a blond kettle has to spit through a few blocks of mustaches - you will have an idea of ​​the standard of acting in 'Maiden Voyage'. Even worse, you can't even move forward to the sex scene, because there is none. A terrifying horrible movie.
