Others have already commented on the "decline" of director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of choosing good projects (as he proved he was in the same year's "Exorcist III"), so why did he agree to appear here? Certainly, he gives a pretty demented performance, and the movie isn't really bad; it is just unimportant, uninteresting and unattractive. These are three "un-" s too much. (* 1/2)
