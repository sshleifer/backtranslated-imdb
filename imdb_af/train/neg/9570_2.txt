For the first time in years, I had the need to sign up for IMDb today to clear myself of this movie by writing a review, as it was just a shit to watch. The plot sounded great when I read it, I expected a minimal riddle, a claustrophobic ghost hunt. Unfortunately, it all gets so bad through an everyday, tiring love story and too many confronted and teeth-pounding stupid "no-say-things-like-this-except-in-bad-movies" dialogues that it's just painful. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick break from the worst offenses of this piece of film: <br /> <br /> - The writing rests so much on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters that it's just laughing. No, actually, it's anger. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related to: Cheap Voltage. A long parade "just in time" moments. <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Well, the scriptwriter seems to have never experienced real people in real life, but has gained all his knowledge of bad movies. So, his characters are boring, lifeless second generation clich√©s. They are mere plot devices, placeholders without the slightest bit of personality. They are "husband and wife in the break up who still love each other". Never seen one except in 100,000 movies and it is no longer realistic or enjoyable. Think of the finest two-dimensional Hollywood prize and you have it. There is not one character in this movie that is even fresh, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> - The far-fetched, vague resolution that wobbles very badly and only needs one hug to overthrow, although the word "resolution" can be bad here, because the movie is a swampy mess in each don't go. By the time you're done, you don't mind. The last third of the movie I just sent forward because it was just as unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> Well, that's it. Whatever detached features this movie has, everything is buried under incompetence. Don't see this shell.
