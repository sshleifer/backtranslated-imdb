It was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful, but that's where it ends. It looked like a dark Set It Off met the West. The plot barely made sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. There may also have been unnecessary things that did not relate to the plot, nor did it help. There were also long empty moments where the plot could be explored, but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The writing had to be made more meaningful and directed. I had a big question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you are just looking for candy, then this is the movie for you.
