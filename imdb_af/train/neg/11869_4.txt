I don't know if the problem I had with this movie was that I couldn't catch the way movies were done in the past, but I believe this one didn't miss any of the fashionable conventions. the 40's to make a movie. If you can't do anything better, my advice is not to watch this movie, but to read a book or go for a walk.
