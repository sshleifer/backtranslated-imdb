Any movie that has naked scenes from Karen Allen and I'm still so bored, I run out, it's a stinker! <br /> <br /> Karen gets stuck in Paris, and befriends a sissy handsome French man with whom she will soon have sex. Of course he is married, ("But, Cheri, why should this be a problem?") What an interesting collision between cultures can be (believe it or not) boring. I went out. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the movie is much better after I left; but it would have to be a little better to start being rotten. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself running, doesn't run for the exit. Save your time and energy. Certainly make your money. It is a pity that the production company did not save its money.
