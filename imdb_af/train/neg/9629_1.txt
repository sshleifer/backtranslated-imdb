I saw it for free, grateful, and wish it was better than it was, but it's really the same old stuff the movie studios have shown on us over the past ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a conflicting couple - yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If the plot line doesn't surprise you and excites you, the movie won't. <Br /> <br /> Many facials and fiery jokes. Halfway through the movie I started to realize that Ben Stiller isn't really that funny, but he tries VERY hard. And Jennifer Anniston isn't really that beautiful, but her HAIR looks good. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman had to pay a lot of money to be in this kind of high-hum movie. I expected more from them. <br /> <br /> What was interesting was that I saw it after seeing American Splendor, which is a really funny and original movie - and I compared the two in my head and found that movie drivers have to to return through the two movies. It will make sense in them and <br /> <br /> they will start making better movies with unknowns rather than these formal things that play best on planes.
