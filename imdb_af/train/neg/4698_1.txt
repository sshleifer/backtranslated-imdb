I mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car? So, if they're ten, it's too immature for a small child to sing about "being my wives", I mean seriously! The name is also beautiful, naked brothers? just because they shoot off their pants ??? HOW CREATIVE. I don't get why they need a TV show. I think most artists don't really need a TV program about themselves, especially the naked brother band. Heck how many of them are in the freaking group. And where is the movie? Jeez Nick uses to grow the highlight of my years, but seriously The naked brother band? So many parents won't let their kids watch it with the name of the Naked Brother's band, it's a stupid, uncreative show that shouldn't be broadcast on TV.
