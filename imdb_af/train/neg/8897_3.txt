I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in the sixth class when it happened. Before I saw it, I listened to the original Broadway recording, and I really loved it! But when I saw it, was I like the heel? This movie misses many of the songs from the musical to cry out loud! Who decided to do all this?! <br /> <br /> I'm really a big fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical he has ever done! The movie looks more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And who decided to cut all Meg's songs from the movie? <br /> <br /> I'm willing to bet that when they watched this movie, Lerner and Lowe probably wondered, "Who in the world decided to do this on our masterpiece?" Well, they had the right to say that if they did, they were probably angry at the fact that Hollywood had turned their big musical into this rather empty movie. <br /> <br /> Song and play sense Mr. Kelly, you have the audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that lacks much of the text. <br /> <br /> In short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
