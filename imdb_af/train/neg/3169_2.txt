This movie is one of the worst of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has any talent and the only one who is not annoying. I never watched Desparte Housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. It's like she knows nothing about acting. All her character does is all over the film and she can't be a b **** and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Bell Bell, shows little emotion and it's like watching the cue cards while reading it. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it is such a cookie cutter. It goes from point A to B with little surprise. So much more could be used with Kate as a ghost. The plot had to turn around her and the things she did as a spirit. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: It's not worth watching.
