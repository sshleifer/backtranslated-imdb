Back in 1985 I caught this thing (I can't even call it a movie) on the cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were out of control. I came out early that it was hopeless. Stupid script (a lot of old guys who appoint a few young guys to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The abundant female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while - but even after 30 minutes he was bored. Remember - it was a HIGH SCHOOL YOUNG! It was back before nudity was so easy to get to the internet and so. We kept looking at something interesting or funny, but it never happened. The funniest thing about this was the original advertising campaign in which the studio conceded that this movie was crap! (One poster had a fictional review that said, "This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!"). Just expecting Grant Cramer to have shown any talent and actually going on a career in business. No budget and boring t & a. Skip it.
