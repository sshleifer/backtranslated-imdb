This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" has easily targeted the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor ... it repeats the same situation over and over. It shows no character development. It doesn't even show violent and / or sexual content, and adds nothing new to the psycho-killer subgenre. So great should it be shown at movie schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first movie. <br /> <br /> Where is hell the "talent"? there are scenes that are almost identical shot; There are screens that have two or more master shots and it's pretty awful to see the action jumping from one master's boot to another without a reason. The camera almost never moves, as if the "very talented artist" was afraid to show his lack of visual skills. The actors starring like amateurs, and the supporting role-play is hardly credible. There are more holes than plot in the writing (if ever one) ... <br /> <br /> A really annoying movie, and a talented director.
