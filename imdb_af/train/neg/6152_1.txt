When many people say it's the "worst movie I've ever seen", it tends to talk about virtually any movie they don't like. But from the nearly 700 movies I remember ever seeing this one of two I walked away to feel personally offended and angry. This is my first movie review, incidentally, and I registered with IMDb to just surprise the movie's badness. I saw it when it was in the theaters (my two friends and I were 3 out of 5 people there) and after 15 years I can't remember much details, but my attitude to leaving the theater is still crystal clear. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler Warning --- <br /> <br /> Oh me, where to start. Fat loser on the altar, go skiing weekend, meet blonde bombshell interested in him, take him home to meet the family, they are all cannibals and he is the main course, pathetic attempt for a dramatic escape, kicking them all bumps and run down with the brother's girlfriend, they are happy to ever live. Puke. First, the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be FUNNY, and that it was a KOMEDIE. The special effects, no matter how little, look like they did 15 years earlier. The big dramatic end was so high and bad that it was almost unbearable to watch (he knocked out the entire cannibal family with rakes lying in the lawn, standing on the Tom and Jerry style as they walked on them ). I'm sure there are many more, but I'm not going to see it again for a refurbishment.
