The idea was wonderful, the actors were incredible, the story could be terrifying, but the writing was poor and there was no depth. I couldn't really get into this movie. I couldn't feel the characters, there were many cliff hangers, and the movie ended very strange. Was it a happy ending? I do not know. Was it a sad end? Again I don't know. You make the theater feel unsatisfied. The movie has so much to give, but couldn't. Just because you can edit doesn't mean you have to be right? I wouldn't really recommend this movie, because you can't say you left the movie feeling it was complete. You will just be confused. Believe me, you'll probably thank me if you don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
