The truth is, a movie based on a Harold Robbins novel won't win any awards. This is no exception. "The lonely woman" is a pure B picture in the budget, favor and execution. Technically, it looks like a television for television. The acting is very uneven. Joseph Cali is especially terrible. Anthony Holland is an embarrassment. As one reviewer from a certain Katherine Hepburn show said, her series goes from A to B. Me. Zedora succeeds in coming to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and wasted in their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch earn better. Yet the whole thing can be so much fun in a trashy way. As it suits Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you are looking for some fun and you are not sober, it can be for you.
