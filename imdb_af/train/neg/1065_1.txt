Based on a friend's recommendation, my wife and I invited another couple to this movie. I really excused them - all 4 of us hated and spent watching our watches and waiting for the movie to end eventually. Half of the vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment. There were few scenes from Paris - for example, I look forward to seeing pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I really couldn't admit anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater laughed or responded in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual movies, don't miss it. If you're on earth like me, you'll be sorry you saw it.
