Except for the Brady Variety Hour, it was one of the hokiest television I've seen for a while. The video production features weren't bad, but overall appearance was unmistakable in the early 80's. And Marie Osmond looks as though she fought with the Avon Lady .. and lost a lot of time. AWAY too many eyeliner. <br /> <br /> It was an embarrassment to watch veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid. Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley talk about the African Pavillion in World Showcase that will open in a year. <br /> <br /> This writing is 17 years later and it has not yet been opened. (Unless you're worried about Disney's Animal Kingdom.) All in all, for all the shortcomings, it's still an interesting visual piece of Disney history.
