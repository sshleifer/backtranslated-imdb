Considering the original movie version of 'The Haunting' is in my top ten movies of all time. I tackled this adjustment with tension. I was ready to be careful, as this film is a poorly written and poorly executed burden of tosh. involved, should be ashamed. The original was terrifying for some reason! You see nothing. Robert Wise uses innovative camera work and excellent lighting to arouse fear and that's why it works. The shame of the new version is that it relies on smart special effects and piracy to get from A to B, but it's harder for the ingredients to be there (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something else. This movie should only be seen as an example of studio butchery!
