... and I actually gave it a NEW on my personal 1-10 scale. I've been to movies since 1952 and have seen over 1000 in the theater (I don't read movies I just watch on TV). It's the only movie I've ever reviewed. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (then 15, 11, 8 and 6 years old) and even the kids thought it was terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who warned me on this site (surprised that the movie had an overall rating of 4+.) The animation of the dinosaurs looked amateur at the time. (and worse in retrospect), the play (especially Sean Young) is terrible and the story line is simply stupid. <br /> <br />
