I saw this movie in Media class last year and I have to say I really hated it. I was in the year 10 (and 15 years old), who might have something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Apart from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it. <br /> <br /> But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the most confused people ever living on this planet. I'm sorry for all those who loved his job, but unfortunately I didn't. The themes in the movie are well portrayed, but the way the whole movie was set up and the events that took place there were not my standards. It's just my opinion, and I'm sure many other people thoroughly enjoy this movie.
