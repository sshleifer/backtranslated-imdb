Two qualifiers right: I actually think Joe Don Baker might be good or even good with the right material and the right director (the "Cape Fear" remake, a small role in Goldeneye, "Walking Tall"). And I even held Baker in Mitchell, because he played an anti-hero who was CONFIRMED to be careless. Yes, MST3K's coverage was hilarious, but they took many cheap shots at Baker - which he didn't deserve - to keep things alive and entertaining. He was fit for the level and tone of the movie, and he was the best part. of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Final Justice" seems to be the same, but in spite of the exotic places and the "cowboy border justice" theme, it's much weaker than Mitchell. . And the main reason is that Baker's character, as it is written, is an idiot. The film assumes that because Baker embodies the old style boundary machismo, he challenged his opponents with old-style mano-a-mano-fast games. And because he's so tough and macho, he always wins, even when he's hurt, wounded, uncomfortable, etc. <br /> <br /> This is a lot of potential (it worked for Gary Cooper), even though it condemns the movie to "B" movie status. But Baker is so terribly stupid and obsessive that he unnecessarily challenges three of the bad man's henchmen to a refurbishment in a public market, with civilians everywhere. He could simply shake them to headquarters headquarters (which is why he followed them in the first place) and they would never have noticed. Or he could have found the drop on them and forced them to give up, and found one of the henchmen to take him to the headquarters. But no, he must be a bush league hotdog and a macho block head, and so he gets a child as a hostage in the subsequent shootings! <br /> <br /> It's a man we're supposed to admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like this. Most of the supporting actors are pretty good somewhere between OK (the henchmen) (the main bad man and his father, who are two well-known European actors - they just go through the movements, but they are ahead and even hammering it up is decent ). But through it all, Baker's character pulls foolish, unproductive stunts and mistakes that have killed at least two relatively innocent people, plus a few bad guys who could possibly have been taken without force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, as 90% of the movie is in Malta or in the Mediterranean, you get very nice scenery and very nice and exotic extras. And really, Baker himself can be on the hard side and slightly dyspeptic, but he's not that bad. It's certainly not the bath that these critics (including Mike and the Bots in their hilarious cover) think. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is good for video background, but the viewer shouldn't pay attention to it.
