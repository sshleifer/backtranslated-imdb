Although the title may represent examples of the 10 commandments, it is a definite mistake. This is an adaptation of 9 SEEMINGLY unrelated stories of Giovanni Bocaccio's 14th-century "Decameron" story collection. <br /> <br /> In a medieval Italian town's peasant population, it's a portrayal of the reality of sex (and its consequences) within that world and time. A realistic view of life in this world sometimes feels like a journey back in time. <br /> <br /> Given the depicted human element of his time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in his protagonists - as well as the irony of life, at times. Or it can also be regarded as a general satire of the rules of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Nothing terribly special, but definitely interesting if one doesn't have expectations or assumptions.
