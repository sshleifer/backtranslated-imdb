Without a "social comment" on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970s, "Nightmare" is full of bad Southern stereotypes, complete with phonics accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensitivity of most American Southern Africans, but this dull piece comes down as just a thin disguised "babe in jail" - especially in the original original version. Still, the play is generally above average and late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of hating viewers - although in some scenes he seems somewhat uncomfortable. There has also been a changing role for the then Robert Reed, who appears to be the lecherous warden, and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger of "Gilligan's Island") has made a fairly credible sadistic prison guard. My grade: D. <br /> <br />
