This movie proves you can't judge a movie by the wonderful artwork on the DVD cover. It also shows that you need to learn more about a movie before you buy it (or get it for someone at Christmas). The start of this movie looks really promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old guy from the street) brings the college with a book full of witch's game he leaves at their annual haunted house (where the film takes place). Then there's a bit of drinking, fighting and soft core porn. Then the action of the movie takes place after more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Overall, Hallow's End was predictable, unobtrusive and reminiscent of a soft core porn. This movie is probably best seen with a group of friends who can do nothing better, as this is a good movie to make fun. And for the first time viewers, it's really fun to make predictions about the order of people who die.
