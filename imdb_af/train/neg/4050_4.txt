It is quite an outdated movie aimed at showing youths longing for freedom in a somewhat displaced British school. Oh yes, it's like in the army, you learn to obey and do what you're asked for. Yes the young dream of something else, but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life. Great. <br /> <br /> Basically, that's how you can summarize the nice intentions in As. Beautiful intentions that do not present cinematographic challenges: the result is a declamatory movie. Do you see how boring I mean? <br /> <br /> At least Oldie helped to help Kubrick McDowell in a Clockwork Orange, a truly powerful social satire movie and no self-releasing sentimentalism.
