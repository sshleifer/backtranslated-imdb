"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most overestimated films in history. It's a movie that loves moms, grandmothers and veils that go to the movie once every five years. As a zombie movie, blow it. There isn't a body in sight, and it's terribly light in the gore section. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, is huge on shock bodies and very generous with its blood flushing - that's why it's better than "Gone With the Wind". It is not overestimated either. Most judges are under no guess that it is garbage. However, this is not boring garbage. After a terrorist steals a virus, he attacks it while being pursued by a helicopter and leaks the chemicals into the ground. The terrorist, who is exposed to the nasty confusion, hides in a hotel room where he slowly falls into a carnivorous zombie. One of his first victims is a cleaning lady. As soon as she was bitten, Lucio broke Fulci's mark of hell. As usual for a Fulci movie, the play is horrible, the storyline is torn with plot holes, and the gore is plentiful. It appears from the film directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, explaining its schizophrenic nature. It is badly shot, also badly edited, and the sound design is flat. Yet it is saved by its joyful adherence to the most grim murders and impatient stimulation. Definitely worth the effort if you are a undead. Or don't like "Gone With The Wind", undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.
