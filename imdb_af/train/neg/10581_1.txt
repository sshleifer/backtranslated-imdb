There was not one original idea in this story. Themes are drawn from various sources; some are the ninth gate, in the mouth of madness (another carpenter's movie), and the ring. It even went so far as with the same damn glowing circle of The Ring and used it as the movie's namesake. The soundtrack by Cody Carpenter is all but suspended from Suspiria. Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spitting out the word HOMAGE. Yes, I've seen Argento's Deep Red play. To insist on a tribute will be a headache. It was at the bottom of the barrel. Throwing gore and "disturbing" images into the pot does not make a good horror movie. Carpenter knew this. He must be obscured or acquired a time machine.
