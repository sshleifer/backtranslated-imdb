It looks like two movies: one an urgent, pretentious long saga about an actor taken over by the parts he plays; the other a brilliant social commentary on a middle-aged divorce picked up by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side. She gives heavy hints about the need for connections, her certificate in massage and her desire to enter the modeling game. I like the glimpse of her cunning flat with a cookie behind a curtain and her terribly seductive outfit of nail-revealing, puff-sleeved crochet top. <br /> <br /> Do actors Oscars for Shakespeare? We know their Oscars for the personification of disabled people, with lots of prosthetics, or as if they were angry. The Shakespeare scenes (which go on and on) are embarrassing and dated. And so are the "crazy" scenes where Tony is distracted while listening to his own voice. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. He made it very clear in an early scene that he was earlier a fever. When he quotes his father's advice, he slips into a Cockney accent.
