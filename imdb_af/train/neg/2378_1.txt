Why would any legal actor reading the script participate in this piece of crap? My god, it's actually embarrassing to even see it. I can't imagine the shame that these people should feel like being part of it. There is also apparently some controversy over whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the movie. He was unreasonable, but his list of roles here (IMDB) gave him credit. VAT ... Rain is his sister for those who asked earlier. This movie proves that no matter how many big names you have. Sawing ears do not make its bags. I love Lorraine Bracco, but it was just sad, sad, sad ... Perhaps somebody might explain to me the reason for this kind of movie someday. It has no engaging, entertaining, or even comical features compared to the bad, everything else.
