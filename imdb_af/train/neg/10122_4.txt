Another early film by Alfred Hitchcock, apparently done by contractual obligations. As with Juno and the Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie. There is almost no style or craft on it. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who go in cash and go on a cruise proving their marriage. Emily gets a chance in a new life with a good, rich man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the highway and stay with her husband. It may seem more credible if Fred is not meant to be a completely insensitive, turbulent ass jumping on the first occasion he sees leaving his wife for another woman. The couple ends up together, but the film has no real reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry gives a very touching performance as the faithful wife of a treacherous man. It's about everything you can say for this one.
