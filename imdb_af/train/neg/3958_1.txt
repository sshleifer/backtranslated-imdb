I won't waste a whole lot of time on this one, because it's not really a movie to start, just an indifferent mish-mash of borrowed footage and embarrassing amateurish new footage just for The Purpose of the to add whole mess and call it a "Boogeyman" sequel. Literally, 80% of this movie is stolen from its exalted predecessor "The Boogeyman", a film that the authors of this rubbish didn't even watch, because they couldn't even get the actress Suzanna Love's original character's name ( Lacy) Right. And to hurt abuse, the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage. They think they are heard as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I wish IMDb's rating system had that low, most rumored and blatant attempt to tear off people's money I've seen, YOU were warned!
