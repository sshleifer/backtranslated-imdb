Although the actors do a convincing job of playing the losers who parade across the screen, the fact that these characters are impossible to identify is just looking at my watch just a few minutes after the watch. The plot development is unsuitable and slow, the oral diarrhea of ​​the main character's only friend is virtually impassable. The basic quality of most characters and the cavalier way they treat is irritating. <br /> <br /> It is typical of Ventura Pons to perform psychologically disabled characters. However, this faux-sociological analysis is a big step out of CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters are abusive and despise for legitimate reasons during the film. In AMOR IDIOTA we are forced to follow the meanderings of a real subnormal intelligence while stealing a severely depressed and detached woman. It is thought to be due to its own depression, but the writing does not support it. I won't give away the rest of the story, just if there are masochists out there? Is he healed by his obsession or is the woman shocked by her own depression by his unwavering attention? Although I watched the whole thing, I was not even made to care for any of them for a moment. <br /> <br /> If you can put all this bias, ignorance, betrayal, BAD dialogue, thin philosophy, etc. ?? the camera work was pretty good and seems to be inspired by the DOGMA group. The makeup was also aimed at showing these players a raw and eager light, which is the worst I have seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of her movies (while she is personally attractive). <br /> <br /> I think if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower layers of society so that we can be grateful, we are not part of it, then Pons has achieved its purpose. The barrier of almost identical sex scenes was a proper waste of film (if the actors were filmed, but once in blue green clothes the background behind them could have changed in the special effects studio). It is true that I have heard much of the male audience in their seats during this, but an objective display proves that it was not the right purpose of those scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and look something else.
