Your thoughts will not be satisfied with this no-budget day-to-day thriller; but, pray, whose will? A young cup spends the real end of the world in the hidden lab of some strangers who are devastating as church people. <br /> <br /> Small _ apocalyptic theme outing, END OF WORLD has the ingenuity and lack of both Brio and style of pure 50's similar films. And it's not just that, but EOTW plays like a hybrid? Not only the day of the day, but monastery also creeps. The villain of the movie is a well-known character actor. <br /> <br /> This totally relentless slapdash looks like a piece of monastic exploitation, the substantial 70-year-old genre that looks so amusing today. Anyway, the monastery's secret lab is some nasty bits of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of the end of the world; but the end of the world is not at all proud!
