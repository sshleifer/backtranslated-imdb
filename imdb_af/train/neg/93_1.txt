A woman asks advice on the way to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories of the local weirdo, both zombie-related. But maybe fate has something for her that is nasty ... <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I must confess, it was so bad that I sent most of the garbage quickly. And there was a lot of it, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there are still tons of stuffing. You get a few skin copies that do a lot of printing, very dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (who rhyme, tea) and some fine examples of why some people should never be actors. <br /> <br /> If For the title characters, they hardly even have a footnote in the movie. Why, you get more vicious action in the intro than you do the previous feature! Although, predominantly as pathetic the eyes protrude from socks and eating brain order (including "delicacies"), it may be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> And above all, it seems like it's filmed on someone's cellphone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera works, scratches on print, flashing lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was made in 2001, not 1971. Even the clothes and fashions are over for about three decades! <Br /> <br /> If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of chronicles, you haven't seen the whole movie, then go ahead. You try to put it through, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie-colored freaks before you make your excuses and departure. It's really nice that anyone has chosen to release it, and honestly you will have much more fun resting your drink on the disk than torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't be surprised if it packs, it's bags and leaves in the morning, so you're doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned ... 0/10 <br /> P.S. What kind of 18-rated horror does the woman have, holding a massive sporting turn during the compulsory sex scene? Look, the movie can't even get that part right ...
