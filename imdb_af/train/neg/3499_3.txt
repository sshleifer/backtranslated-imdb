Comedy Central has been successful with original programming with professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the very popular Colbert Report all star professional comics and all are, or in the case of Chapelle Show, solid shows. Since Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, I expected good things when I turned on. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> There were a bit of light funny rows, but since the star is the caliber of Silverman, the performance could have been much better. It was just the pilot, and hopefully next week's performance will be better. If not, get her help in the form of better authors for the show.
