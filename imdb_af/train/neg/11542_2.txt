An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and terribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psycho-thugs during a night-time gathering on a forest trail in Shropshire, England. The man and woman who attacked the plan and made a vengeance on their attackers. <br /> <br /> Completely repulsive piece of voyeuristic rubbish, somehow mutilated as a disturbing drama, while actually coming over as sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you just know Oliver Reed and Susan George cast would have been made so easy in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is frightening and devastating, but Dan Reed somehow manages the viewer's nose in every last sphere of his sexuality. His camera hangs hungry on Anderson's naked body, both during and after the assault, while the writing almost leaves all the characters in a turged sea of ​​two-dimensional cliché. His writing forces his characters to act in such a way that the viewer is alienated from the "victims" by intensifying more terrible situations in their faces. (Adams' attempted post-incident attacks on both Sophie and Alice; Alice's assault on Heffer AFTER's suicide-rewarding confession). <br /> <br /> The fool comes from the central protagonists' performances. Dyer is a horrible actor, unable to light and shadow as the young male victim of the initial assault (he will eventually be in Eastenders, noticing my words), but Anderson is extraordinary. Even if the frightening text forces her character to act in bold and ridiculous ways, she somehow delivers an extremely compelling and intricate characterization as a self-indulgent, arrogant hedonist who is experiencing and relapsing such horrors. <br /> <br /> A wrong and senseless movie then, almost but not really saved by a compelling central female performance.
