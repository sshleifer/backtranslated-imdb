This movie dropped me. It was much like the movie Jaws when the Hopper told the mayor to close parks. It was like Roy Shider told the mayor to close the beaches. They both said in the summer! But the boxer says Hopper must come in the mind of a killer and think like one. But he really does nothing too interesting or exciting. I'm not even convinced that he and his partner have any experience with the police when they are in the office and wonder how they will solve this case. They just say, let's work the police and we'll solve it. And how about all the old men with pool buttons. I didn't even believe they were mobbases. And when the man who doubted the man picked the crowd to find the murderer. With his hundred dollar hairstyle and that he thinks she's the size of a school bus. Come on which cruddy lines. I thought he was going to hit him with a baseball bat as in the other movies. I used this movie and will not buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, and it was funny to see the microphone above the scene where the hopper goes out to get coffee.
