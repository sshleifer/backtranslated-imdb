Incredibly bad plays, a not-good, unclear story and flashy images and slow movements where they are least needed: Adrenaline is all that a movie should be. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verbaan (a so-so Dutch soap actress who hasn't attended her English classes) plays rich girl Freya, who has the habit of 'looking for excitement'. What basically does dangerous stunts, breaks things and irritates people. And not in a fun Jackass way. Then there is Dracko (Rivas). He leads the forest, but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there is Freya's father (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. And in the end we have Jason (debutant Fyall), the boyfriend of Freya. <br /> <br /> One day, Freya disappears and everyone looks involved, but we, the viewer don't really care. The roll is either palatable or credible, and the story doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Why was it even made? 10/02.
