This movie is terrible. At the end, you will realize that several hours of your life have been stolen that you cannot return. The "turn" end is very confronted. The character development that leads to this end is not in line with their final actions to conclude. Ninety minutes of preparation - assuming the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas - is literally explained ninety seconds. "No, we were just deceiving you." Then the Rob Lowe character is not even upset about it! "I'll forgive you if you can forgive me," is as upset as he gets. If someone took weeks to convince me, I was about to die and then said, "No, just to deceive you." I'll raise a serious hell. I don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler, because I can save some of you out there not to look. Save yourself and don't watch this movie.
