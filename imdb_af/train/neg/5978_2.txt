This third Pok√©mon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and repetitive to entertain older kids. The message of the film - about dealing with loss - is undermined by the return of the young girl's father during the film's credits. Team Rocket offers a bit of entertainment, but they are not really part of the small plot, so they don't appear very often.
