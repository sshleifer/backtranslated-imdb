Another case of a decent DVD case that betrays the shot-to-video quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> It wasn't that bad. Rochon does a workable job and Damn! the throw is beautiful. I have never seen many muscular guys stick together on a regular basis. This movie really made you think Rochon was the killer, but it wasn't. My biggest problem with the movie was that in the end I didn't care much about who the killer was, and the real killer made little sense because it was out of the blue and the filmmakers thought 'ha, Betcha didn't see the a bowl, sucker! . Yes, there were continuity errors (especially with Rochon's changing wardrobe), but it's not that bad for an indie treasure. I was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thin hidden excuse for girls to go topless, but it was just a gym. The dialogue was too often thought and painful. <br /> <br /> Just high expectations aren't, and it won't be that bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated.
