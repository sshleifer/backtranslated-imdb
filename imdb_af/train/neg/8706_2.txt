If this is your first time wondering about the theater, if you've never seen a "Moving Picture", you'd think this movie is a kid of the gods. BUT if you've seen a movie, a television program, even Barney the Dinosaur, then you won't be very impressed with this movie. Heck Barney, the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies. I just watched "The Giant Gila Monster" just before I watched this swill, and I liked the movie much better. It works as a B-movie. It has a louder dialogue, hokier acting, cheesier effects and an honest Gila Monster monster than the monster! Carno 3 doesn't take much of a B-movie. It has a little gore, and the Polchek man comes close to being funny a few times, but this movie is underperforming, almost .... limp. It's the small engine that can't be from dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can wipe glue on a pavement and feel entertained. If you are one of those people, then give this movie a shot.
