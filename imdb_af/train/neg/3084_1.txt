this is the result. A piece of trash film that doesn't deserve to be even classified as a movie, it's just a bunch of stuff on a movie, which makes no sense whatsoever. Well back to the actors, who from the beginning seemed to be just a lot of friends who thought they would get some money together and tried to make a movie that would be a horror movie. Well, it is a great horror anyway, never to be a movie. There are many horrific acts in "Hobgoblins", but the worse is the chief named Richard, who is just too much of a weakness to even have some kind of root. Well, if you throw a lot of friends and try to make the movie scary, on a less expensive budget, no less, that's what will happen. Oh, at least, the MST3K version was hilarious. But it's still a horrible movie, which deserves all the bashing it gets. 9 for the MST version.
