This is a low budget spoof of the spying genre. To help estimate your expectations, you need to know that: (1) The acting is very heavy-handed. The stars have a lot of fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement, regular hand gestures and off-key pacing. (2) The writing deliberately lacks continuity and credibility. Often lines are suddenly mutilated and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plural elements. (3) Shots are often filled in out-of-balance angles, making fun on genre redundancies. (4) A pop-eyed Jeff Goldblum delivers complex and classic preposterous dialogue in a winning sarcastic manner. <br /> <br /> The film has a leading intelligence, deliberately starting with a plate element stolen from the 1930s B movies: a secret code with a structure that will explain Carl Sagan's statement . The movie's over-the-top acting is mostly used for comic effect during the first 90 minutes. In an early run, Fay Grim's son Ned is so often told that you can't help chuckle while you feel sorry for the boy. Parker Posey's pretty choreographed fall out of bed also helps a humorous scene in the film earlier. <br /> <br /> The movie's slow pacing doesn't improve the comedy elements or drama elements that come out later. The film's impact as a drama is significantly reduced by early comedy. Furthermore, it is difficult to get too involved with the characters and their fortunes when the early parts of the film are so sarcastic. The musical score was deliberately heavy handed, and I found it (and the downward camera angles) more irritating than humorous. <br /> <br /> The over-the-top acting, the indisputable and almost incomprehensible conspiracy plot / conspiracy, and the slow pace will grind on many viewers. The movie is too long at 158 ​​minutes. <br /> <br /> It has been said, fans who are receptive to the film's sarcasm might want to look again ... using closed captions to get the intelligent ridicule of dialogue the best. The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more pessimistic than light heart. But, the comedy can be good at your taste. The film is worthwhile for those who enjoy independent films, fans of director Hal Harley, or dedicated from Parker Posey (who has the most camera time).
