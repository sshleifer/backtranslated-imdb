# 1 Vampires vs. People <br /> <br /> # 2 Military rejects Roughneck group first responding to dangerous, unknown Vampire attacks. <br /> <br /> # 3 Sexy female Vampire on the side of the "good guys". <br /> <br /> # 4 Many gore and action. <br /> <br /> There are four (4) large plot devices that can help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, the next plot device won't deter you. <br /> <br /> # 5 In outer space. <br /> <br /> The last one almost got me too, but I am glad I looked. In a pile of horrible live horror that is the Sci-Fi channel's Halloween marathon, this movie is a fresh air. It will stand up against any of the other Sci-Fi channel offers, and even against the other Vampire movie, Natassia was in the tournament (giving YOUR Boll money?).
