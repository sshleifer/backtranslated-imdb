Okay. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I heard a lot of good things about it and I was very disappointed. I could see where the filmmakers came from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this fight were not very different from each other, that the individuals were lost in the battles, etc. Etc. . (Well, that's my suspicion, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> Anyway .. the movie kind of bored me. I watched very long movies, but this one just seems to be wearing and on and on. Basically because I couldn't just care for any of the characters. I just thought. Who cares? I also found that the play is a nice pan and the dialogue is tense. I understand that it was the 1800's and all, but most of the conversations just seem unnatural. No one felt in most of the movies, except during melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> The "romance" in the story didn't seem to be supported by anything other than "I'm a man and you're a girl", which I don't see much of a romance and yet I felt I was convinced that these people were in love. Oh well .. I think it's the whole "all this horror around us, we stuck to each other" type of thing, or whatever. I also hoped for some dynamic among the two best friends (who both initially had an interest in the girl), but it was just a kind of fall. Maybe avoid a clich√© of love triangle. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. Daniel Holt was the only character I really liked very much. And Sue Lee was right. I didn't really love Jake, but he was also a bit ... spineless, I think. Jack Bull, I didn't care at all. And I'm pretty sure you should hate just about everybody else, with the exception of the poor normal people who are just trimmed to the left and right. It was pretty graphical and the whole "the horrors of war" has gone down, but I've seen many other movies with the same theme, better done. (I really enjoyed the Patriot, for example, though it was a bit emotionally manipulative). As I have already said, I am a synic. What can I say? :)
