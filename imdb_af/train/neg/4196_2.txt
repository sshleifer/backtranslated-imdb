This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only the story, but the acting is shockingly bad. The dialogue sounds like someone reading the news. <br /> <br /> It's considered comedy / drama / novels, it's not that stuff! It's a little action, that's it. There is actually NO comedy and drama. <br /> <br /> Going to the cinema to see it, I feel sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Anything else you choose to look at will be better. It's almost an action / crime movie. The action scenes sucked, and the crime story part of it was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you're not really interested in a good story or good acting. And you just want to watch a 'foreign' movie for the profession to be strange. Then it can be for you.
