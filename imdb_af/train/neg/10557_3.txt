It is a horrible little production, which gives one nightmares as well as headaches. This is an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, strange journey that may be optimistic. It's the cold, inhumane, unfriendly, sickly, even horrible kind of stranger. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, it's a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did much more attractive stuff with stop-motion. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, it's a French production. As such, the stereotype is reaffirmed that the French have no understanding of scary.
