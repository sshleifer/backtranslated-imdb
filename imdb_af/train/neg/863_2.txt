I realized I was watching Euro horror, especially movies made by cult luminary Jess Franco, that you can't expect a plot that makes a lot of sense. Franco, however, went overboard with this movie; and despite a surrealistic atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the directors' bests - Succubus is unfortunately a truly horrible movie. I have to admit that I have seen the American cut version, which lasts about 76 minutes; but if it wasn't just the logic that was cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a woman moving around; S & M is practicing and talking junk, and it's all really boring. There are no gore and the generation is boring and most of the runtime is recorded by a dull dialogue and despite being a short movie. I made it difficult to close it to the end. I have to say the places look good and Franco did a good job of using his surrealistic atmosphere. but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who has made some classic garbage films - but it seems like he was the one he made for the money. In general, I recommend switching it over and seeing the director's more interesting works.
