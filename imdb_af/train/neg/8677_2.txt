I like Chiba in Street Fighter, and I thought how hey, no matter how stupid this movie is, I will at least see him kicking an ass, right? Wrong. It is a dull, arid mess of useless talk, half-judgmental writing and meaningless twilight. There are few action scenes of any kind, even less martial arts scenes, and the few that have been shot are so badly shot and edited that you can't even figure out what's going on in the world. The dub is also horrible, and perhaps the idiot this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it probably contains the Italian Mafia ... except they are all Japanese! Avoid like the plague - you'll better see martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes.
