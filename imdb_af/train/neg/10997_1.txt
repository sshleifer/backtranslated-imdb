First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What the hell? Why in the world they are trying to sell a low budget cookie on late-night TV with the promise of disturbing, offensive sickness that any normal real person with a soul could not see. <br /> <br /> What is crazy is funny about a dog being injured, a grandmother knocking her head ... a guy blowing his hand and two girls going to the bathroom? What in hell came this world to those people, comedy comes in something so completely sick. Anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny, shouldn't even be allowed to walk the earth. <br /> <br /> But what I hear is not even offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through demented piles of sick rubbish ... and they can't even pull it off.
