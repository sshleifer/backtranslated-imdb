Johnny Weissmuller's final movie, "King of the Jungle", after 16 years in the role, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS, is bound to disappoint everyone but the strongest of his fans. At 44, the former Olympic, one of Hollywood's most active parties, was long past the slender athletics of his youth and became tired (although in a little better condition than in his previous entry, TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS). <br /> <br /> Not only has Weissmuller become too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the distinctive 'Boy', grew into masculinity (he was 17 years old), so he was written off the script, with the excuse that he was away from school. Brenda Joyce, 35, appears in her fourth of five films as "Jane" (she will give the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan, in 1949's TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as sexy as ever. <Br /> <br /> Produced by Sol Lesser, at RKO, on a tiny budget, the film and crew benefited from cheaper labor through filming in Mexico. While the place gave a definite Spanish air to what was supposedly the darkest Africa, veteran director Robert Florey used the country extensively. There was a rock dive and an Aztec temple in the story. <br /> <br /> When a young island girl (Tyrone Krag's future bride, Linda Christian) is rescued in Tarzan by a jungle river. He teaches that a local high priest (George Zucco, one of the film's most enduring villains) has virtually enslaved the local population and threatened threatening retaliation of a living 'God' if they did not do so. The girl was chosen to become the 'God's' bride, so she fled. Faster than you can say 'Is this a stupid plot or WHAT?' The girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and returned to the island, and Tarzan, followed by Jane, colorful Spanish character 'Benjy' (charm played by John Laurenz, who sings several songs), and a government commissioner plans to deity and his priest (poor Cheetah left). After a series of discoveries (the "God" is simply a man in an Aztec mask, working with the priest to milk the island's rich pearl beds), a little brawling action and comic relief and songs by Benjy, achieve everything the expected happy conclusion. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS have a musical score of the brilliant movie composer, Dimitri Tiomkin, and are much better than you expect from this B-movie! <br /> <br /> While the film would make an inferior end to Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loincloth (he would play Jungle Jim immediately, a more eloquent variation of the Monkey Man, in khakis). the particular talent has lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was about to get a makeover and became much more sexy ...
