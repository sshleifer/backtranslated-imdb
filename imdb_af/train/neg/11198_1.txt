I do not even have to revisit this movie as it is not really a horror movie - and therefore not the attention of Dr. Cheese worthy. At least it's not in the usual sense horror. It's definitely a frightening suggestion to waste your time watching this shit. That's why I switched off the first four hours. Imagine my surprise when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yes, that's right; In this regard, this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> "The Order" had many mistakes, not all unique. In particular, it seems to me the biggest problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror movies is Hollywood's reluctance to enter Christianity on its own terms. It is quite possible to make really inimitable movies that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, movies like this are just a thing of the past - smorgasbord of filmmakers (usually dull and illogical) imagination. <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone seems to have made a movie, physics says, but not only the basic laws of physics are wrong, but the whole plot based on its wrong depictions, you will soon get tired of the resulting meaningful plot. The same goes for these types of movies. <br /> <br /> In other words, "The Order" (and many similar movies before it) find out about all the patches about the Catholic Church and about the Christian faith and attempt to build a plot from these inventions. It's not surprising that the plot is unattractive and stupid. This movie has the extra charm to be as interesting as your teens grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steaming pole.
