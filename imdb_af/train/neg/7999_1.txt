this by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I got up to watch it for an hour and regretted that hour. The acting is terrible and there is almost no plot. My guess is that someone got a strange form of animal and started to make a story about it. Borrowing ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens does not lead to a movie like them. If it's going to be a top Korean movie, I'd rather not even have a Korean movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, these movies are a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. I think every Korean who has internet for online has evaluated this movie over 8, although it has no idea what it is about.
