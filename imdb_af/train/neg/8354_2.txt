Any movie in which Brooke Shields invent a Fonda is going to be an anomaly and an abomination. Shield is actually not bad because she is young, inexperienced and clearly not well-directed by her co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because, because he is bad. I kept him from Ulee's gold, years later, but Lord above, he's terrible here. Not that someone else is good. There is not a single show (beyond Henry Fonda's delicious cameo) that is even acceptable. I have never seen a movie with these very bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the main villain, it is clear that this is due to poor dialogue and direction, as he did good work in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is embarrassing. The writing is just bloody, and the actors cannot be convicted of the terrible things they have to say. But they say so badly! The editing and direction is worse than pedestrian. Shots are kept too long for no dramatic reason, or cut off before the scene's impact can be realized. This photo was much worse than I thought and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never made) without the participation of some well-known names. One bright spot: the cinema in the Grand Canyon is beautiful, taking over the beauty of that area in some way, even big-screen Imax productions haven't done so well. And lastly, it's also a bad version of Paper Moon, with a lovely pair of father-daughter types, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a considerably more icky-romantic relationship between forty and one. n 13-oh. This represents more than the latter, and so it is quite disturbing.
