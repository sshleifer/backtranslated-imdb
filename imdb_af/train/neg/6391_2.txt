Hg is normally exploitation, and it has never really bothered me - I loved "blood party 2", but I really don't like pseudoscience or heuristics. The whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electric accident and a witch. I'm not opposed to witches, and I like "carrie" (the novel and the movie), but this one bothered me. I think it is because of the main character that esp develops from an electric line. The university professor is also wasting his time studying special issues. I wasn't alive in the 60's to get to know first hand or not, though especially a general fraud was or not, but I suppose any theory of that kind would simply be discredited. What really bothered me was the way police describe schizophrenia as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can look 99% of the time like normal people and just snap. nothing can come out of the truth. I reject such concepts because they add to the public idiot. many still think schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder. Whoever wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> There were some decent concepts for the movie. I like the way the witch used men; It was a good change. I love how she can make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. I found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face. touched the script a few weeks before the production and not just focused on making his audience stupid, it may have been a decent movie.
