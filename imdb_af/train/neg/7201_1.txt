Luckily I didn't pay to see this movie. Also, I can't even reveal a spoil because I willingly liked the movie for forty minutes. It was so bad. Once I laughed at the Yahoo! Billboard fell on the man and the theme song arrived. But that was just because I thought it was fun, but then I realized it was another OTHER product placement. <br /> <br /> I loved the cartoon. I looked at it almost religiously. (although I missed the last episode. I heard they were showing Dr. Claw and it was nothing more than a Claw, someone was talking on the show's page.) The cartoon had much more to Penny and Brain than had the movie. I hate setting up the whole thing, reminiscent of Robocop. Then Broderick screws with the whole feeling of Inspector Gadget. He's not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon. Another fact is that its gadgets really work to the point I saw, except for the oil slick. He also screwed in the tone of "Wowsers" who was excited earlier. I felt so disappointed that they had slaughtered the cartoon so badly. Everyone also felt that way. Our 14-17 year olds remember the cartoon beautifully and we loved it every minute. <br /> <br /> I went into the movie with an open mind and knew they would be screwed to the cartoon. I was amazed at how slow the movie was. It relied on siggats, and stupid dialogue for humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to squeeze a children's movie. Product placement is useless in this movie, and it shows. The wise-creaking car is not so good to crack. The gadgets look pretty, but they were almost too bright. The cartoon was a better look. The silly scenes were crap. In the 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, not one laugh was heard, and they laughed at the Dudley-Do-Right preview. This movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment. I strongly recommend "The Iron Giant," which was sad, but very good. This movie is a travesty for the whole family drama
