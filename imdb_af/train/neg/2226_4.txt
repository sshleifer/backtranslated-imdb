DD movies were damn, moon, silly and had a plot that was wafer thin, but those days they were at least a plot <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a comedy, but ' a mix of melodrama, romance everything </ br> <br /> Every drama scene is out of proportion <br /> <br /> The comedy is funny but corny. Still, the movie keeps you entertained. Govinda films were hard, crass but they had a little funny. moments that people enjoy <br /> <br /> David Dhawan does a good job Music is good <br /> <br /> Govinda plays well in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in parts and nice in parts. Frame is as usual Gulshan, Prem Chopra is tipecast Shakti is hilarious
