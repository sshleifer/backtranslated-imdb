I love horror movies that portray a real amount of mystery, such as a quiet hill (which I found to be pretty good, but still missing something) and movies that keep you guessing, that was one of those movies I thought. First, the movie starts with a very good tension and builds it a good starting point for a good horror scene, but then it just rolls down the hill and from there it moves faster and faster. I first mentioned a quiet hill for a reason because I can see many of the "stolen" themes of the movie here. All in all, I would say, look quiet hill instead of this one, the better it is, the more scary. has a lot more tension and also the end is much better. And best of all, you don't feel ripped off like I did with this one. It just seems to be one of those. "I like that movie, so I am. I'll make it again in my own, very bad version." Kinda movie. Oh, and another thing ... Herei .. in a horror movie ... it's like trying to scare a child with a caring bear that "embraced me" and I'll keep you forever "on the its stomach written.
