When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) started looking at her brother's death, she began to suspect something more sinister than natural causes. The closer she gets to the truth, the more a threat she becomes to her son-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line), and the rest of the local Satanists. They will do everything necessary to put an end to her nose-like ways. <br /> <br /> If you are in a thin, satanic theme movie, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The movie is filled with many nudity and ritual softcore sex. A special scene in particular that includes a young woman and a goat should be seen as believed. Unfortunately, all the sleaze in the world cannot save Black Candles. Most of the movie is a total drill. Unlike the one scene I have already mentioned, many sex scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. The acting is at best spotty. Even genre favorite Helga Line gives a disappointing performance. The plot doesn't matter. Its main function seems to be to keep the rope dull sex scenes together. I'm just familiar with another movie director Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his daughters of darkness who masterfully mix erotic and horror, Black Candles emerges as amateur. 3/10 is about the best I can do.
