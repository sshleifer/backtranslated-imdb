I could not believe that some of the terrible dialogue came from the mouth of people, and the final rule of bloopers attached to the film of the film was a real blow. And we get Titty shots from Angelique Pettyjohn (kind) and Loren Crabtree to get started. <br /> <br /> A teleportation device activated by psychologist Angelique Pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, they were remnants of the Klaus Kinski film, ANDROID, which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks. <br /> <br /> Inside the container is a midget alien (played by Ray's son) that kills people. It was pretty funny to look at this little 'creature' in a black reptile suit, with what looks like big beetles, attached to it, running around in the dark. We even saw the little thing's stamp and tear at a poster of ET, which I thought was hilarious. <br /> <br /> And then there's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container hammered after William Fair's death, after the little creatures in Frank McDonald's neck have been in the kitchen. A low budget adopts EVERYTHING, I suppose ... <br /> <br /> The whole thing suddenly ends and looks like they end up at the end of the movie before the blooper roll comes in the final credits. Talk about a lack of funding ... Fred Olen Ray also mentioned in the director's comment that they were not sure whether Aldo Ray would make the shooting and remember his lines. He barely did. <br /> <br /> Low budget cheese sneezes. It's nice to watch, I'll give it to you. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
