Looking at Smother might have been the longest not-90 minutes of my life. There was not a laugh to have; In fact, I never remember a smile. Diane Keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder, the textbook's remaining mother character, a relentless annoying woman who is clearly suffering from some kind of personality disorder. She is manipulative, breeding, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic, and worst of all, boring. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long series of movie clips - the brave, socially undisputed, remote family member just trying to break into "The Industry", the abomination and long-suffering, but somehow still lovable father, the gentle woman who just "I don't take it anymore (but eventually move out of discord and resign home), the herd of unhousebreaked dogs who like to throw pillows cold while everyone is away, etc. <br /> <br /> God, what a snoring. I've never been a Diane Keaton fan and Smother just reminded me why. Overlapping is too much, no matter how many photos you have done in your prime. Her attempts at physical comedy were particularly humiliating. What did the director think? <br /> <br /> While holding Dax Shepard and even enduring Liv Tyler, their performances were so unclear and boring that it was clear that no actor had made a damn about this movie. It was okay, because I didn't put an end to Keaton's endless self-absorbed prattling. Sometimes Shepard's aversion really seemed to her. By the end of the movie I wanted to slap her self. <br /> <br /> Awful.
