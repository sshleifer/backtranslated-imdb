I saw "Shiner" on DVD. While I saw it, I thought, "It's a very bad porn girl without the porn." I also thought, "Whoever wrote it has real problems." Then I saw the director / writer Carlson explaining his process as a special feature. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> The film's emphasis is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get away. They are marginally attractive. There are frontal and full nudity. These factors make sure the movie is not seen at all. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing element of the movie is the gay bashing and subsequent gay bashing of the same victim who is suddenly trying to revenge his attackers, the two drunk losers. Not only is the subject absurd and badly treated from a technical point of view, but the acting is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> Then there's the boxer-stalker theme. It's really insane, not just absurd. This honky boxer is somehow traumatized by the constant attention of a carnal mom's son working on his parking lot gym. It's in LA, think of you. The boxer is so traumatized that he comes to the stalker's house, strips in front of him and gets excited. <br /> <br /> Well, all I can say is why would a boxer who is at his heart an operator be traumatized by a stalker's attention? It just makes no sense. And I'm scared, some psychodynamics actually make sense if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scriptures seldom give meaning. <br /> <br /> The director / writer apparently thought that this film represented a significant minority in the gay community. Well, he may be correct, I think. We should never know, since that minority would be so dysfunctional, they could hardly be organized enough to ever go to an obscure gay movie festival or DVD store, the only two places they could possibly find this turkey. Thanks for that.
