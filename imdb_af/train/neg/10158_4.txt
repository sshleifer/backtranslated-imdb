I can't help but think behind the mask: the rise of leslie vernon (a massively more wonderful movie) if you see it because of the realistic feeling and the great innovative idea. It could have been a BIG movie. the acting is ... of some of the actors in order. From others ... it's just horrible. <br /> <br /> The one side is ideal and the format is good. The story is also pretty good, but often suffers from great blows to the logical mind. <br /> <br /> Remember that is right? it is a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this remade ... I really want it to be the fantastic movie it wants to be. <br /> <br /> (and you can't really blame the mind behind the movie) it is, of course, based on a shoe stroke budget. and the fx injured the movie overall. <br /> <br /> big movie. ... if you would exchange for a little better acting and slightly better fx. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this must keep up, good idea here.
