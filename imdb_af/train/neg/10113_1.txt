I discovered that this film is rented based on the packaging. The zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. Then you come to the movie and it is women with coon masks. zero special effects ... and even the battle scenes you can see they miss are pushing by 2 feet. The funny thing is that Lommel briefly acts in the movie and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie. The only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad movie that people call it a "cult classic" ... but I can't think anyone thinks it's nothing but one of the worst movies ever made. the real horror in this movie is how bad it is. I am ashamed that I have rented it and vow never to see another Lommel movie!
