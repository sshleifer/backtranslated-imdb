This film deals with a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on the skin. <br /> <br /> This plot is absolutely bizarre. I don't see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot transforms an ancient art form into fetishistic pornography. In addition, the screens filmed in Hong Kong are definitely portrayed as bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I keep thinking that "The Pillow Book" insults Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. <br /> <br /> "The Pillow Book" is a twisted but boring movie. Seriously stay away from it.
