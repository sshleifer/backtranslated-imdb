This movie, though not quite bad, had to be filmed where the real events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska is devastated by no less than seven tornadoes on the evening of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located in the almost homeless, flat Platte River Valley in Hall County. The makers of this movie were filmed in the tree-covered hills of Ontario and moved the entire event to a non-existent town, Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island survived bravely just to forget because of a poor movie.
