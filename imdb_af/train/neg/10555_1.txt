First of all: I love good Splattermovies and are not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero-budget flick is nothing of it! The picture quality is so damned low, the soundtrack is the most annoying one I've ever heard. And as for the FX. Well, the super-low quality doesn't make some of them look as bad as they are in a real movie (which this litter is not). No concept, a wafer-thin story, primitive acting and scarce dialogue. I think I counted 10 sentences in the whole movie, each one repeated about 20 times ... same for many movie series (could be an indication of what kind of audience this crap was made!) The story seems to be a young son had to see his father rape, kill his mother, suffered psychological damage and travel as an adult, doing a show of self-reduction. So far, so well ... But for these pseudo-art-idiot directors, this plot is just a line to place cheaply produced shock scenes in a row that doesn't have a message and doesn't make sense ( new intestine intestines were thrown into a naked, bound woman in an earth hole ... why? and why is it the only time you see both women and throats in the whole bloody movie?)? Upsetting? Yes !! Sick? Yes !! Necessary? No! Artistic? NO !!!!! Everyone who misses this cheap gore show for art should visit his psychiatrist as soon as possible or watch Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to see how a similar topic can be worked out in a good way. I hope this was your first and last (!!!!!!!!) movie, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all you commit fornication, out there, remember: Not everything that looks cheap and doesn't make sense at all is automatically "Art" ...
