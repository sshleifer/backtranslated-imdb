I just watched it. A few laughs, but nothing to write about the house. Jason Lee seemed to have had fun. The (long) DVD gag line almost exclusively consists of him with uncontrollable lag. Selma Blair looked like it was a time clock, but again her character had to be a stick in the mud, so "done well", I think? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (To be married to Babs can't be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles's father (hilariously), in 10 things I hate from you, is also funny here. He is wonderful, but the best thing about this movie was Julia Stiles' decisive. I can spend two hours on her folding laundry, and I feel like I just did.
