An interesting idea (four African American women being crushed by society's shaky chin is being revengeed by robbing banks) by F. Gary Gray's terribly slow direction and a rude script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) ruined inadvertently funny moments. Instead of commenting on the role of urban women struggling to stay in a world where men cruel and humiliate themselves, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to captivate their unsuspecting audience with the striking ideas of operational tragedy. It's melodrama at its worst. Gray kept his actors on every tired line and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to catch up. Instead, he picks up his camera to be trained on the artists' hidden faces. And uncomfortable they are: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress she is an excellent rapper), they need a safer hand as Gray's to guide them and as a result, they come out so slim and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Avoid.
