* Contains some spoilers * This movie is 80s horror horror in all its horror. The plot takes too long to get off the ground, never stands and touches the film for about 40 minutes. There are a few jewel moments for zombie fans, but not enough zombies to create a true sense of terror. <br /> <br /> The zombies also take a long time to make their appearance. First, there is a whole half of a movie about gangs and prisoners. The hero of the movie is a former Vietnam veterinarian caught in the crowd. The main mob boss puts him up and goes to jail. In this prison, they experiment on the prisoners to find a way to cure murderous tendencies and criminal behavior. But the bad psychotic chief scientific / military man has other plans in mind. He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make .... da da da .... super soldiers! After some infected prisoners have killed some guards and most of the prison has a round of communion communion, the military / mad scientist goes "hey, it may be a problem" and a call to the genius scientist has investigative journalist, hot babe ultra-powered independent woman character, who obviously invented the original serum. She goes to jail to see what goes down, the military man calls in a few SWAT teams from his safe position outside the prison and the full day takes the few prisoners with a heart of gold as a riot outbreak. The whole day and the scientist / journalist lady team up to find a cure, save the ward's children, and deal with a few irate prisoners, both infected and not. Meanwhile, the police boss has entered into an agreement to enter prison so that he can save his prison sentence. The army is getting ready to blow up the place, and everyone is moving inside to find a way out. <br /> <br /> There are many greedy scenes where people are killed by pressure or jail. There is also a creepy deapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner. Yet the most disturbing scene in the early part of the film, when a coarse corrupt guard rapes a prisoner. <br /> <br /> The main highlight of this movie is one scene after the end. The hero, wife and children try to make their way to the only escape route. Their path leads them to a long corridor, on one side there is a wall and on the other side are prison bars. Hundreds of bloody zombie hands come through, grab their hair and faces as they pass. There are also some good scenes of the classic "few zombies bumping into fresh dead bodies" and "many zombies ripping one man to kneel" pieces. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth checking out the zombie genre, as it has so many zombie clich√©s to watch; it is practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie. But if you're new to zombie movie and want a real fright, look elsewhere.
