The saying "Never judge a book" is a warning to those who do not look under the surface. <br /> <br /> When I viewed the artwork on "King of the Ants", I immediately thought HORROR! The arcane imagery showed pride in the cover and spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal and retribution. Instead of what I discovered underneath the surface, it was less interesting than you could find below your average rock. <br /> <br /> King of the ants knows Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average man ready to make. a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Besides Sean Crawley, someone you don't mind is never once felt compassion or sympathy for this character. In fact, he is really unlikely, but not so much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews) who makes an uninspired performance, because he has made the worst of the completely ridiculous dialogue he has forced to recite. Throw Kari Wuhrer as a sad widow who seems to have unconditional trust (especially in the homeless), and little or no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, who is actually a sober standard of Cheers, but NO! <br /> <br /> Now, there are some interesting "hallucinations" in this movie (the source of the cover images), but this film never leaves the world. It prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, bad dialogue and unlikely event after unlikely event. Oh the Horror!
