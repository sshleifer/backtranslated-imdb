The genre of suspicious movies really dives into this one. The big problem is inexplicable. I realize that you have to create difficult situations that cause tension and the tense feeling of what will happen next, but this movie was so predictable and just unbelievable. I find that the more I watch this kind of movie, the more I keep giving actors constantly to guide them away from danger. By making decisions right away, you're just bound to be stupid. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I might have enjoyed it a little. Having said that, you might be better off staying away from this one.
