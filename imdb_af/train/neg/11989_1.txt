This clunker of a movie sets a new standard for bad movies. Jared Rushton gives a proper performance of a very poorly crafted character in a bad movie, creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The lead role of the film is how a boy's temporary outing to the Canadian wilderness survives after a plane crash solo, enabling the unhappy adolescent to deal with his anxiety to discover his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately, it becomes a bizarre collage of random "survival opportunities" (including two especially hokey bear scenes) and weird hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is not just sitting in a street somewhere to dream the whole movie . (and what a nightmare it is!). In spite of the remorse of some reviewers of the family's film visibility, there are several scenes that are not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded. <Br /> <br /> All in all, a terrible movie that no one should be subjected to, less less innocent children.
