A group of models is looking for an apartment to live in, and is shown by a local broker. Unknown to the models and the agent, however, is that hell's threshold is in the apartment and when it is crossed, the devil is called "Dethman" to kill everyone in his way. The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist accused of the murders. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a low-budget, micro-budget and independent movie champion, I can't praise this movie. The creators are proud of their 24-hour shooting schedule and at least one actor boasts the DVD of his acting ability, but I can't turn my mind around this. Why make a movie in 24 hours if an extra one or two hour editing would make the difference? And why are you proud of the poor, indifferent acting and the bad delivery of a handful of lines? <br /> <br /> Many of the movie shows the models of an apartment by real estate. agent. The dialogue is obviously ad-libbed, because no writing writer can come up with such an empty dictionary. The agent also knows nothing about housing ... she focuses on aspects of a home that no one can care about, misrepresents the heat source (didn't she see the radiator?) And says the pest problem will be solved. when they call "the terminator". Please write a script. A deviation is good, but it was a mess. <br /> <br /> And why did the girls move in models? Their careers had no point in the plot, and it looks like a forced situation. At one point, an actress breaks and says something for the effect of a dude, they will be upset, which sounds more natural than any other rule, though out of place due to the other bad dialogue. /> <br /> The demon had no sense. I appreciated the effort to explain how "hell's threshold" jumps to random places on earth (including apartment fireplaces), but why not explain where the devil came from? His background is a man whose love is murdered by another man. How does it make you a devil? (Also, why did we need all of these Victorian flashbacks without dialogue and watching over a field? It was redundant.) <br /> <br /> The dramatic pauses between lines were terrible. The Sam Bishop character was by far the worst, with the interviewer not far behind. Does every question pause, a funny face and a reaction ... followed by a break, a funny face and a reaction? I was so frustrated. For me it was the only point to pull out the time ... but I will have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of horrible delivery (and then more time is wasted by rolling twice the same credits). /> <br /> Who was the Sam Bishop character anyway? He said he saw it all and accused him of killing the girls, but at no time was he ever in the story of the girls. So how did he see them? And if he didn't, how did he know Dethman killed them? And if he didn't see Dethman, how does he know Dethman is the spirit of Apostles? I was so lost ... was there even a sketch for a plot when it was written? <br /> <br /> The only part I enjoyed in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom. Not that it was really important or anything, but it was the only break from boredom I was given. I wonder what director Felix Diaz thinks. His music is very good (see the DVD behind the scenes for his impromptu play), but I wonder about his film skills. Although the best part of the DVD was the trailer for his Superhero Excelsior (the trailer alone was better than the whole waste of time). I'm sorry, I have to be so hard. I would like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done within 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality movie. But if "Superhero Excelsior" is any indication, Diaz can make quality ... so why did he decide to avoid it? Perhaps the world will never know.
