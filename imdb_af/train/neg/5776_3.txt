bad acting, bad southern accent, inconsistent cinematography, horrible writing ... <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this movie at a recent movie festival and was so discouraged after seeing it. It contains quotation / unquote name talent but they do not deliver. Of course, the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story being told. <br /> <br /> Don't worry
