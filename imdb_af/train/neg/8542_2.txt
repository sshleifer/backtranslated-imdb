I work my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and the WITCHES MOUNTAIN (El Monte de las Brujas) is something like the 17th movie in the set. <br /> <br /> The movie has nothing to do Don't keep my attention. The plot was incoherent. The dialogue is improvised. The acting was poor. The characters were unsympathetic. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning, with an outrageous woman being driven to burn her seemingly steep daughter. But the only connection this scene has for the rest of the movie is the main character, Mario, who has the most beautiful mustache ever. But that's it. <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark so some scenes are almost completely black. It's really scary - what else can I say?
