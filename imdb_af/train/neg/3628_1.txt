An artificial home stomach. Overestimated, exaggerated, exaggerated; A pretentious blend that not only earned the best picture of 1951 on its own, has been obscured by the competition from the start. Place in the Sun, Detective Story, Street Cart Name Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; You call it, if it came out in '51, it's better than this arthouse crapola. The closing of the ballet is for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few players in their time were less capable (on stage) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 worst of '51 (I've seen 201 movies), and one of the 5 worst Best Oscar winners.
