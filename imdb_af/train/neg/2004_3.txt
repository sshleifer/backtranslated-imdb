I read the book a long time ago and didn't remember the plot, but remember I enjoyed it. Since I'm sick on the couch, it was a good idea and Hey !! It's a lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> The film is populated with Grade B actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> The female player is straight from Desperate Housewives. I have never seen the show, but there are many ads for the show and I get the core. Is there nothing more original? Certainly, but not at lifetime. <br /> <br /> The male is all pretty small, watching and acting, but the girls have men I suppose. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a woman with a male struggles for her life and what does she do? Kick him in the testicles. What else? Women love it, but let me tell you something ... It's not as easy as it always is to look. <br /> <br /> It wasn't bad. I got the cold fever for a while or two, so I have to credit someone with it.
