Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman, this show doesn't compliment her at all. The character is not even remote, and it is not a situation where you think, "oh she is so ib * tch i love her" just "she is so ab * tch. This character is just a simple old self-righteous, mean, b * tch.Sarah seems to struggle to wear this show because she is the only semi-funny one, the mood, the dialogue, it's so damn bored and dry, it's like listening to your grandfather continues and deals with the marbles he has collected as a child. <br /> <br /> The Sarah Silverman program is so incredibly boring that I thought to change the channel to get old repeats of Married to Kids See, it's funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude." I'm sorry, but I don't find a show of dry humor and the walls of the story about evil, bitter, loser's evil Bitter life with her annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves cold too funny. I can't stand this show though e general Sarah Silverman finds it "I love her because she is such a character as in School Of Rock, and most of her stand up. I think this show is boring with characters who think to be mean and say things and do things for shock value, eg. the constant pube, diarrhea and $ are generally laughing. The Sarah Silverman program tries to be funny and fails, or it needs a laugh track or better writers. Some have compared it to South Park, but it's not even close. I have voiced my views on The Sarah Silverman Program and will not be an annoying troll that means you will not see me and constantly do things like "This show sucks" and "Why it has not yet been canceled". like the Sarah Silverman program if you enjoy it.
