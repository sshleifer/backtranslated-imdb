I saw other Guinea movies, like the Mermaid in a manhole and he never dies, and while they are almost sick, they have at least a sense of humor to them (the dark). Devil's experiment, however, is nothing more than filing a bunch of punks that a young girl submits to many methods of torture and violence and there is no plot and no redeeming values. It's not frightening, except perhaps the mind, but it's definitely disgusting and I definitely won't call it entertainment. Now, I'm not the example of good taste in movies and I love my trash and sleaze, but it was too much for me, really. I am all disturbed, in fact I look for things that disturb, where possible, but it was a bit. The young woman is kicked, beaten, beaten by headphones to continuous sound until she drools, and then laid with raw meat and inner and hangs somewhere in a hammock in the bush. If you think it sounds good, go it, but it makes me sure you don't see Guinea-like anymore. 1 out of 10, absolutely misleading.
