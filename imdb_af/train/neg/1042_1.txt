First write the writing on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all, we're not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then you get amateur actors. It will be good for the party type. After all, who needs people who have spent years honing their craft? Then rent a kinographer who does not know how to light. You see, if it's well lit, it won't really look like it and the festivals won't. Who should have professional plane photography anyway? Then rent a ten-year-old who has never kept a camera to be your operator. This will miss your movie, which is completely amateurish, will miss the fairy-tale men for the "reality" and guarantee that even if you empty the seats of real people, critics and a small screen of the audience that will over-intellectually "genius" shouting because they would not believe it was just amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Once you have done so, buy your ticket to the Bad Movies aka Sundance Festival. <br /> <br /> What a sad waste.
