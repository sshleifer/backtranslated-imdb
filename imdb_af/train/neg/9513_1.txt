I tried to watch this movie three times. That night I rented it. Go through about 20 minutes and hope it would be better if I had a night's sleep. Watched 15 the next day, almost excited about how stupid it was ... It wasn't even funny, it's sometimes a fun movie to watch, but this movie was just a treasure with a capital S (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I watched the stupid thing for an hour and I didn't just enjoy one moment! Not even one. How did this script get green light? O boy! <br /> <br /> G <br /> 1/10 - the one for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their hard work.
