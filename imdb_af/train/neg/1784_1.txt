OK, I dropped it off TV and missed the start. The movie was about 10 or so seconds in the titles (I assume) so if something happened before I missed it. <br /> <br /> Many people say Mark Hammill is here, I didn't see him. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis, and, of course, Stephen King, did a very horrible act as the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige looks beautifully apart from the screens where she has the cat or is full of aliens. <br /> <br /> Even with the opening titles, it is never really well explained what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the title series I assume that they are catlike two-hatchers who live by withdrawing life force from people. I suppose they live a long time and these two are probably the last of their kind. <br /> <br /> Add to that a very large dose of incest (Yes, I thought it was also a little suspicious), Shapeshifting, killer cats and invisibility and you have Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the 2 characters and too many cameos to try to derive from the simple fact that is not enough. explain to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
