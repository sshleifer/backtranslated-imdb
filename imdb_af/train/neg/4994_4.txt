Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in some way, but sometimes you're not in the mood for it. <br /> <br /> I wanted to do something simple, without just thinking a simple action when I looked at this one. It started out well and was quite entertaining, so why a bad review. In the end, the film lost its credibility. The storyline wasn't that cute, the action wasn't too special, but overall good, acting was OK, so much more than enough to satisfy my needs. But everything has ruined because things happened that were over, and it left me with a bad feeling. They had to take a little more effort to make everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the "no mind simple action" category. So if you know, you will get irritated because things happen that seem completely illogical: don't look! otherwise I will say continue ...
