"Sir" John Gielgud must have become a senile to die in a mess of a movie like this one. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies, which I suppose is considered art, but not "Don't be fooled ..... it's rubbish. Adhere to the art you can admire in a frame, because the films that are marked as such are usually incomprehensible fakes like this. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Giegud reflects Shakespeare's "The Tempest" while the camera pans away to naked people. one of them a small child who urinates in a pool. Wow, these are heavy things and real art, aren't they? This is just one example. Most of the story does not make sense, it is impossible to follow and therefore one who is liberal critics is afraid to say they did not understand, so they give it high marks to save their ominous egos. You Want Shakespeare? Read his books.
