Remember, when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made big movies? The days feel like a more and more distant memory. <br /> <br /> While "Hollywood Homicide" is by no means horrible, it is a routine and surprisingly boring girl cop movie. It's not a funny comedy, and it's not a very exciting action movie. An abundance of subplots cannot be the worst of the central storyline mask. <br /> <br /> At least Ford looks more than its last few projects, and it can carry the movie most of the time. Hartnett is sufficient, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford in terms of chemistry. <br /> <br /> All in all, Hollywood murder is a rather amusing distraction, but scarce. Take Ford out and it's not even that.
