I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally I saw him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit of sharing, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I took film rating in college and the only thing I can say I didn't like was that the movie was made in a deserted part of town and there was no do not leave background traffic or glance. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the play leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to make it up to speed and the supporting role leaves something to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the movie visible. Otherwise I would have written it off as another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors who came to the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity), but they are overlooked by the low caliber of the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, I enjoyed the movie because Arnold Vosloo was there. <br /> <br /> Jackie
