This movie is poorly developed from all angles, except technologically. I watched as everyone from the theater cloud, their faces drained like their lives before their eyes flash, eyes wandering around their neighbors and wondering if they were just them. I mean, how can the movie really be bad? No one will admit it, it's a classic case of The Emperor Wear No Clothes. "Who am I to question a movie that contains a man stopping an aircraft?" But the fact remains, every member of the audience thinks about what I'm writing now. I actually have plagiarism faces. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Lois can only be aroused. She won't even have a cup of coffee with the Superman With Glasses that doesn't stop with a jug. It cannot be in "his" eyes for the depths of his soul or something. In the old Superman, she had some connection with him, and of course he was not number one priority, but it reinforced her character that she was "torn". I bet Henry Kissinger would even have won this Lois before Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now it's official, Kryptonite does Superman who eats at McDonalds at the avg. person. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE" He lost his earthly father, then he found his true super dad, the story is fascinating every step of the way. He is a man, he has people and he loves people, he is related to high school students, he is related to people who feel different. He tells. The Superman Returns Superman just seems to have relied on Superpeople and it looks like he's just doing a job "when he saves people. <br /> <br /> There's something about Clark that Lois likes, she's really in love on him, but can not admit it, and when he gets into the picture as Superman, throwing it in love on the rocks, without Superman she would fall in love with Clark (at least that is what the movie suggests, whether it was the intention or not. Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a lot of horse man to Lois. Literally. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO I just watched it again As a child I thought I had enjoyed the action, but now I know it was the story that kept me and watched it over and over, if I saw Superman Returns as a child, I would it also hated, I think. <br /> <br /> There is so much heart and soul and superpower going on in this movie, it's sick. Superman gives his power for love as a being real life plot and meanwhile Lex Luther has something fantastic on his sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THREE Now there is a three-way love story between Superman and Lana. and Clark, just winning humanity and Clark's inner nature beating Superman's power, because if his SUPERmoral nature is gone and he is Superman (who does human things with his superpowers), she sees that is not the power of Superman that she in love. It's not SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman she loves - and who is really SUPER. And when she tells Clark, she prefers Superman, he's delighted, he's made a human connection again. He wants to be accepted for who he is, not just for his ability to bend steel. THIS IS THE TYPE OF ATTENTION WHICH SUPERMAN RETURNS DEAL. <br /> <br /> Clark super-natives to help the child strike - humanity again. Plus, it's an INSERTING use of superpowers. He not only uses straight brute force. <br /> <br /> He's crushing the coal in a diamond for his wife because she has to sell her, love is the only thing that drives him to save his powers differently. <br /> <br /> There seems to be nothing in the Superman Returns. Even in Superman Three, we see the damage caused by the nemesis's world-dominant plot. We see suffering, we see how it affects Pryor and others and people in the middle of it. There is no harm, especially. emotionally from Lex's plot to sink the US. We see a sphere of crystal thrown into space. Superman had to be very creative in the first three Superman to stop the plot against him, but he could not "access" his superpowers. In the first one he had to stop two missiles in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save Lois's life ... (it was thirty years ago!) In the second one he had to divide three guys apart he already had more power but combined with Lex's genius, and the ominous tactics of the villains, Superman's victor was not enough, he had to work one against the other and apart them ... In Superman III, again his superpowers was not enough to win, he had to melt out a computer that had calculated everything he saw, unable to use straightforward aggression on the computer because it had been pre-calculated, so he had to use a benign acid. just deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression, and he found that acid earlier when he could not use his superpowers to blow a fire, because it was a chemical fire, so he had to use his superbrains use - he could not water do not carry, and he has frozen a lake and dropped it on the fire. Now in Superman Returns, he illuminates the island just outside, like a nightmare for UPS. He doesn't have to find anything, he just uses his "super strength". And Lex Luther's brilliance was shown on the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that he threw that island out of use after being stabbed straight into the bloodstream with a kyrptonite KNIFE AND the island itself was getting kryptonite traces in its dripping face, but he just turned his eyes and nose off, because it wasn't Gray Poupon he looked at.
