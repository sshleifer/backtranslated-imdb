Although the beginning indicates All Quiet on the Western Front, this silly and superficial version of the war is far from its much better contemporary. It illustrates the funniest war ever fought, with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see a fight, it is paralyzed: An enemy plane is flying over? Shoot it down (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he gets a chance. Enemy soldiers in the forest? Don't worry, they like to give up. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Tepid, turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
