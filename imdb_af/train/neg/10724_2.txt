this is the perfect example of something very bad ... why can I advise someone to see it? Well, I was kindly obliged by the fact that I was in the tiff competition (I still can't believe it won) .. and I just stayed to the end because the director was there for a & a department .. but it was nothing but interesting. What is it about? Well, the first half (worth a look) offers three characters: a hooker, a musician and a kind of official. the first two lie about their careers. but the third is the real liar. second half you can't ruin a good night.) Some old breasts and heavy drinking. But maybe you will see it completely different ... did the Tiff jury (were they drinking vodka?)
