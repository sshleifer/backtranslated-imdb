This is one of the most hilarious bad movies I've ever had the privilege to see. <br /> <br /> I saw it on DVD with a lot of friends one Friday night and we just couldn't stop laughing from start to finish. end. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough: terrorists hijack a convoy they think weapons carry, carry uranium, but actually carry a lot of man-eating dinosaurs. Easy error making. Give an exciting incompetent team of military teams to tackle the prehistoric animals. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who looks like perfect 'Smell the Speed', as advocated by Joey in Friends. <br /> <br /> There are many gore and a frightening shootings, but unfortunately Rance's team seems to have a problem. their weapons in the general direction of a horde giant, lumbering monsters. Also, the lights always look flashing and go out when a Velociraptor attacks (for the time being so we can't see how bad the effects of the creature are). <br /> <br /> All this had us all As a Jusassic Park / Aliens style action adventure, this movie flashes worse than a dinosaur's cross, but as ridiculous, tongue-in-cheek entertain it is a roaring success.
