The filming team did not have good access to the occupied territories, so the filming of the Israeli side dominated. I was struck by the almost completely opposite views of the mothers. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the chance of a life of great happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of humiliation and despair. With such completely different views, any meeting had no real chance at any meeting of the mind. The word "peace" does not have the same meaning for everyone. Peace to the Palestinians was freedom. Israeli peace was security. With such an abyss, is this kind of film really worth it? I finished feeling that I saw meaningful propaganda - both sides were unconvincing.
