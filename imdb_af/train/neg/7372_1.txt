I'm so confused. I've been a great Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all his films, and many of those decades of time. I can only describe this movie as "bizarre". Steven Seagal shares screenplay and writes credits on this film, but I have a very difficult time believing that he would choose to beat his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, messy fornication's voice no less. no. What I also don't get is why his own voice appeared on the rest of them, if they had to link some of his lines? I expect Seagal to become like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this movie only pulls a fraction of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm and sex appeal, which he has so easily shown in all his previous movies. What I found most of me was his spectacular, confident attitude and his bad ass that easily moved into that beautiful smile. Where is it in your face's attitude and charm that made him such a big star? I hope this movie is not an indication of what Seagal left us. If so, his lifelong supporters will have to admit that the Seagal who we all knew and loved is gone.
