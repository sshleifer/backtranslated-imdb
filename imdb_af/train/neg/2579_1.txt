I must say I was a big fan of the series. The first 3 were big and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a shame because it was a huge series and it just gets worse. I know they were made for DVD movies, but a few attempts will be nice. <br /> <br /> There is no laugh, just a few good one-liners that will bring a smile. There are many nudity and very hot chicks. But neither do the sexy things or the jokes really work. <br /> <br /> Adding to this is also a RACIST movie or as a racist of a movie one can make without being called racist. I am NOT one of the people who think everything should be politically correct. But the portrayal of minorities is very offensive. <br /> <br /> I won't waste any time on this garbage. See previous versions, they'll let you get sick.
