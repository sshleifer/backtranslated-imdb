a documented documentary about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. depicted as a fun, safe ... but sad place, were a lot of sex workers playing in a soccer team, which doesn't look more than a week! The documentary main focus is to prove that society is repelling these "workers", although no solution for these poor women ever is achieved, except that the people who documented have made them a kind of "star" (just as the title says so) in exchange for the exploitation of this realistic documentary. it does have its own documented reality ... but unfortunately it has nothing to do with the main story. I will not accept to see it again; but I will only recommend it for general cultural purposes.
