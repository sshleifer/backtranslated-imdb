It's as if you've taken the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, take away all their style and class and blend in with a very pretentious new wave. "I'm intellectual, so my movie must be hard to make sense of" movie Creator, mess in some extra styles for good measure, chopped from the end, there you have Revolver. <br /> <br /> Yeah, I thought about it a little after I looked, and yes, it made good sense, but it didn't stop it from being rubbish. <br /> <br /> Waste of money. Speed ​​of time. <br /> <br /> As the worst movie I've ever seen, not even a bad movie news to leave it a bit.
