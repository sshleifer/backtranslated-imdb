Despite positive reviews and performances at international festivals, this movie is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to other movies, in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants has very common personal problems of her age, and also to fight against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does this by choosing a kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, who for some reason falls in love with her, she confronts her problems and wins. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight it's boxing, in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer, and now it's Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But Fighter is very inferior to these two, it was simply embarrassing to see it. Semra Turan, the "actress" who plays the role of a teenage girl may be able to do many things, but one thing she can't do is act. Her on-screen presence is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations in which she tries to show emotions are terrible, her body and face language are of amateur actress, poor director instruction. The rest of the cast is a bit better, but they can't save this clich√© movie just with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Apart from some relatively good moments, this movie is nothing new or interesting to offer. <br /> <br /> Even the Kung Fu battle is not a reason to see it, it's just as boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and had no inspiration, and most kung fu scenes practice or stand in all kinds of kung fu positions, and actually fight. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks like a small and slim girl is fighting big and muscular boys and getting rid of their feet. <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie was noticed is because it is European. It's very easy to publish this movie - a first martial arts film from Denmark, but don't be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems, which is not really convincing. <br /> <br /> Bad movie with embarrassment, acting and story.
