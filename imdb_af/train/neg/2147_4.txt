The original is a relaxing watch, with some unforgettable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the successor, while the worst of the DTV successors does not have the brilliance at all. <br /> <br /> The biggest deduction is a lack of a story. Like Belle's Magical World, the characters are told by a series of vignettes. Magical World, while marginally better, still runs a mess of the story. Between the vignettes we see the mice at work, and I personally think that the antiquities of Jaq and Gus are the merits of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best, about Cinderella getting used to being a princess. It's the best, because the mice were here at their best. The worst of the vignette, when Jaq turns into man, is sometimes cute, but lacks imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia falls in love, was also cute. The problem was, I couldn't imagine Anastasia being friendly with Cinderella, as I saw her the mean out of the step sister. It was also surprised by a rather ridiculous subplot about Lucifer who fell in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> The casual music was great to listen to, but I hated the songs, they were really uninspired and nothing like the beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original. <br /> <br /> The characters were the strongest development here. While she still cares, Cinderella has lost her sincerity, and much of her charm of the original, although she still wears great clothes. The duke had a few funny moments, but they were not enough to save the movie, just as with the king. As I mentioned, the mice were the redeeming merit of the movie, as they only contributed to the movie's gift. I also have to say the animation is colorful and above average, and the voice action was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> All in all, a cute, unbeaten sequel, which has been devastated by the songs and a lack of story. 4/10 for the mice, the tuner, the animation and some nice dresses.
