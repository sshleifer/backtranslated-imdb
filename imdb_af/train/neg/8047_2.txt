Simple Terrible Treasure, formed from the I KNOW YOU HAVE LAST SUMMER Kind of Feeder, has beautiful, wealthy students who spend in a Florida apartment murdered one by one. A misfire in each category is conceivable from properly built tension to the executed death row. Nothing is dealt with properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures that you root to watch, as soon as possible. Del Tenney (the curse of the living corps, I eat your skin), of all people, executive manufactures, co-wrote and stars as a priest in a key role whose relationship with the murderer I think means something he is psychotic . The revelation of the murderer is uncomfortably handled and inefficient, probably not a soul that sees it. There is a lot of attempt at joggers, with one character breaking out to scare their friend, who can't even produce some cheap excitement because it's calculated in such a low way. Most attacks take place on the screen with blooming throat cuts (.. or pools) that represent the only true display of violence. The protracted finale, where the murderer continues and tries with the actor to make his villain deadly and demented, is embarrassing and tense. There is not one positive thing to deduce from this clich√©d and boring exercise with the nice throw that does little effort to rise over their one-dimensional roles. And for the sake of pity, they could at least have allowed us to see Joey Lawrence belittle or something to defend the misery of the 90-year-old mystery through this mess. <br /> <br /> Dorie Barton, as the heroine final girl, Beth Morgan, who appears to be the killer, can no longer be empty and uninteresting. (.. oh, she was in rehab, and taking pills for her nightmares, such an intriguing outline). Chad Allen, who has been thrown into the group as a very intimidating "friend" of the group (.. what happens to disappear from the film first, suggesting he is the first victim), has a difficult hill to climb his role, so steeply he stumbles, unreliable, without endless sight. Jeff Conaway, who needs money, thinks he has the invested role of the FBI agent, whose daughter's murder motivates him to seek the murderer and lead him to Florida. Jack McGee has his usual $ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ & DEMOTOGRAPHY TROUBLESHOOTING $ $ $ $ $ As soon as you get the answer, you'll wonder why you're bothering it anyway.
