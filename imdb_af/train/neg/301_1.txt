This is the worst documentary ever to come from Canada !! I'm glad to see the guys haven't made a movie yet. All they want to do is make a movie and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote. They keep changing the script to adjust the person they are saving. I couldn't get out of the theater fast enough when I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival this year. Please never see this movie.
