I agree with everyone above who has said something that will convince you not to waste, even a brief moment to watch this incredibly amateur movie. Very poorly acting, rounded production values, completely pedestrian direction, and a script so indifferent and inflexible, it should never be written, let alone produced. Even Hollywood professionals are only going to pay for a payroll, though no one had to pay for this bad job. Careers should instead be over these insignificant drives. <br /> <br /> There is something fascinating to look at something so jaw-drop bad. And Chad Lowe is great and consistently bad.
