It's getting worse, the series is falling seriously. The first two successors were acceptable and from then on we saw some really horrible movies. Robert Englund gives another good performance than Freddy, but the rest of the cast can't act. The story is Alice, after surviving the previous installment of the Nightmare series, Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams once again find themselves. This time, the rogue killer is hitting Alice's unborn child's sleeping place. His intention is to be in the real world again. The only one Freddy can stop is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her own son? Look at the first three, miss the next three and then look at the last one.
