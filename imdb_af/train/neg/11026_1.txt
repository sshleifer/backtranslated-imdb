I just read a book about Dillinger. This movie was terribly inaccurate. It's as if they've got a list of names and just made everything. His robberies and outings were well planned, until the second - when the time came, they left whether they had all the money or not. They had notes from each road, where to turn, etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant. He said Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis was never SAW Dillinger before the night. Dillinger is dead, just pictures of him. The way his gang members died was fictitious. Dillinger never robbed a bank himself, as he did in this movie. If I never read the book, I could enjoy the movie. The acting was a bit on top of places. The action was also redundant. With the second thought I doubt if I really enjoyed it even if I didn't read the book.
