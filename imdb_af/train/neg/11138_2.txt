Let me start by saying that I read a number of reviews before renting this movie and knowing what to expect. Yet I was surprised at how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I'm a big werewolf fan, and got used to forgetting a lot when I watch one. Most of them have subparate effects, poor acting and poor story lines (best rehashed from previous movies). So far, with the possible exception of some of the later "Howling" series films, it's the worst of the lot. <br /> <br /> First, the story. It has been quoted several times in reviews on this site, so I'm not going into details. However, it is very clear that the author (s) have absolutely no affinity for lycantropic samples. As is often the case when a horror movie is given to a writer who "sees himself" so well, they tried to get a new turn on the werewolf myth. It's good, but a non-horrific fan trying to do this, generally ignores the intelligence and sophistication of the horror heard and ends with their writing. The plot feels like a parody of werewolf movies, and the events depicted are just as false that I feel my intelligence is seriously insulted. TV news footage, for example, never goes away from the reporter to look after someone in the crowd behind them. Credit the characters and viewer because they can see the bad man in the scene without using a shimmering neon board. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> As far as securities are concerned, I've never seen a less credible werewolf. I would have been happier with Lon Chaney Jr. in crepe hair. The animal they used to look a lot like ... well, like a man in a cheap rubber suit with a few hair glued and some really awful animatronics. And I know that many people have already criticized the CG, but my God it was terrible. One scene has a woman who changes and starts with a complete CG version of the actress, naked, but for some reason without nipples. My first thought was, "hey, why is one of the characters of" ReBoot "in a foolish werewolf?" <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm looking for positive in any movie, and there were a few. The cinematography was acceptable (the movie was shot digitally, which is interesting) and some of the shows were not terrible. It was also interesting to see Tippi Hedron as the world's most accomplished homeless woman, and Kane Hodder as the title bad guy. Also, the Yellow Power Ranger has all grown up and ... well, damn. And if you're looking for skin, there are some nice examples. This ends the male pig segment of the review. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a good werewolf movie, try an American Werewolf in London, the original "The Howling", "Dog Soldiers" or even "The Wolfen" (although that one has more wolf as was. If you have completed a lycanthrope, then take a walking stick. Otherwise, give this one a miss.
