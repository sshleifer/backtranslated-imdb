What happens to Robert "Pretentious" Altman? Was he saving on lighting? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable. I mean, have you ever seen a law office where everyone works at candlelight? <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. In fact, don't waste your time with anything Altman does: it's all a pretentious waste of film.
