I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and I finally looked at one on Nuyoricans. If I go to Puerto Rico, I don't see the 50% living in poverty. When I see struggling people, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans, or Cubans who recently arrived on the island. There is no such thing as spanglish ... or you speak Spanish or you don't ... and from what I've heard ... you don't. Pedro Albizo Campos IS NOT MLK for me. MLK was a good man. Campos is a good man for those who want independence, which is 1%. On the other hand, he is as loco as Osama Bin Laden. Victorians who want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want evidence from all of your independent Puerto Rico dreamers, see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, South and Central America and Mexico. It did wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico. This documentary was about the Nuyoricans and their struggle. <br /> <br /> For the person who complained that not enough of Africa was on show, it was supposed to be about Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will just make one short for you. <br /> <br /> Finally ... to all the ignorant white people who think we need green cards to come to the US, and want to learn how to prime things. , it's not a good documentary about the Puertorican culture. Tell your kids to pay attention to Geography and History class. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." was about Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if it were how we all felt. Must be titled ... "yo soy nuyorican ... luncheon ... can't speak Spanish." PLEASE STOP PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA OR ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP WITH PR WITH THIS NEWORIC HISTORICAL LESSON. God forbids them to play it on the island.
