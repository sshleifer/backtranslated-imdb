I watched this movie last night with anticipation, but I really wasn't impressed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of 'Combo', I thought the acting was poor and the story was limited. It came as a TV drama. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie was very designed. The whole set-up of the hammer in the context at the beginning (yes, we get it is 80's Britain - you can stop now) was tiring and gave a very one-sided view of how life as in the 80s was Britain - poverty, war unlike royalty, Margaret Thatcher, but nothing in between? There were actually middle class who existed at that time - just ordinary working people, with a decent wage and a bond. The Falkland chips also seem random at the end, for 'dramatic effect'. I suppose. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events dissolved a bit, as the characters shifted one action to the next, seeing how their mindset could change so quickly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' was curly. I couldn't even watch the snogging scene. I find it very difficult to believe that she would have been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger, but also looked so much younger. I know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing if you've reached your twenties but it's a big difference in your teens! In my experience, the type of age difference only occurs when the girl is the youngest, as girls age so much faster and more on the wavelength of boys a few years older. Sorry, but I didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value. <br /> <br /> The end was somewhat sudden and revised. If the flag-invading object is considered iconic, it looks somewhat short in my eyes. <br /> <br /> It feels that British films have hit themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty. Don't get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charm, but can't we make Brits anything else? Why were our films always kept on the classroom? I was born in 1973, so it wasn't much different than 'Shaun' would have been in 1983. I grew up in a single village family at a reasonably trained council complex in an English town. But my childhood experiences were very different from those portrayed in the film. I don't even remember that racism is a problem (though I don't say it doesn't exist). "This is England"? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I lacked this movie, and I was completely bored and impressed throughout.
