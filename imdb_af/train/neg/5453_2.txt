OK, I took this movie halfway through, but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially the guy who is now in Teachers and the book group, though he has at least proven that he can act if he wants to! (The part where someone has a heart attack comes out as a bastion of bad film, in terms of both acting, essay, and generality). It is clear that there is an entry on Human Traffic, but although it is not the best movie ever, it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of serious but hopeless GCSE students who Try to achieve a pass rate. Not as much as Human Traffic as a bit of a car accident!
