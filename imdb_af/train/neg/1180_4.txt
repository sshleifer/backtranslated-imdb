Notorious for more than a quarter of a century (and often banned), that is the darkness that was its greatest asset. Hey, it's often better to talk, rather than to be seen when you can't give up the "legend" with substance. <br /> <br /> The movie has recently been played in Los Angeles several times, and is available on the home video, so the veil is slowly being lifted. While there is still enough to offend the masses, it is more likely to endure them than to awaken much true passion. Except for a gratuitous and prolonged XXX sex scene between a couple of horses ("Nature Documentary" someone), nearly an hour of dull regular marriage mododrama follows. <br /> <br /> As soon as sex and nudity begin, it is a non-stop masturbation sequence, a looooooooong flashback to an alleged 'beauty and animal encounter' and a naked woman who running around the house (no one, even her supposedly protective aunt, even seems to be wearing her clothes!). On video, I think you can move forward through the banality, but it's not really worth it. The nudity goes no further than what is seen in something much more substantive, like Bertolucci's THE DREAMERS. <br /> <br /> Trying to find a "moral" or "symbolism" in the carnality, I doubt it worthy of anyone's trouble. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can see the movie more easily, the familiarity with something that was once "forbidden" has been lifted. And this animal is tamed.
