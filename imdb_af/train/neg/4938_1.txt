Cavemen was by far the biggest cargo shit I ever wasted to watch my time. This display based on the Geico ads is less entertaining than a real 30 sec ad for Geico. The makeup was half-finished to say the least, hard to imagine a caveman with white teeth, even after going to the dentist. This show could have a quirky series of potentials if they could find the movie of the ads, which it makes for a lousy show. Perhaps if the authors were the same from the Geico ads, it might have been a chance, but the pilot didn't have a good storyline. I give this show a 1 out of 10, I'd like to set a zero out of 10, but it wasn't an option. I pray for a quick death on this show, but I give it less than 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death.
