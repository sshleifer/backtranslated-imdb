This movie has two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. It also boasts the ever-pleasing Larry Miller in a tiny part. Despite this, I have found that it is almost unshakable. Michelle Monaghan can be pretty, but she is almost charisma free and the reasons for Downey's character's obsession with her character are not understandable, in terms of the information the movie presents or the way it is portrayed. The end seems to be pretentious and although the intention seems to be that the audience should be in the blink of an eye and cut the film, because we did not bring in the side of his main characters, unwilling or unable to do so no. <br /> <br /> Fans of the movie say that those who disagree simply do not "get". I don't think so. The plot was not complicated or understood. It was simple and unimportant and of course manufactured. I just did it. I just didn't like it. Paddy Breathnach's "I Went Down" and Guy Ritchie's "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" are much better-known examples of the kind of film that director Shane Black fails to reach. <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but a look at his credits (mostly as a scriptwriter) detaches me from any other connection.
