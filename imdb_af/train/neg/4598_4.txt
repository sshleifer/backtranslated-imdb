The London Stage producer's wife hopes to set up the American song-and-dancer in her husband's latest performance with a well-known American girl making her living modeling fashions in the social circles. Unfortunately, the couple have already met on their own. The girl thinks the man is actually the show producer who is married to her friend (the fact that he does not wear a wedding ring, had to discourage any misunderstandings!). Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical is finally dragged back by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott's idiotic script, full of youthful behavior. Astaire and Rogers don't just meet cute - they meet ridiculously (he scratches dance like a mad in the hotel suite above her and she complains). 1935 audiences probably didn't care how these two would come together - as long as they did, and happy. The central characters don't seem to have to end in each other's arms. He strokes her with flowers (after telling his friend, he wants to stay in the love department "fancy free") and she gives him the brush. Nothing that could cure a little dance! These glamorous twosomes are as deliberately unreal as the London and Venice institutions, but we simply look because the leader is Fred and Ginger. It is a fantasy for those who do not have the immersed plot in mind. The musical moments break the monotony of the confronted scenario, but fail to surpass the surrounding silliness. ** of ****
