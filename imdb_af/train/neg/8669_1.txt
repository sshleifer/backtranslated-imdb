First, I love the novel Ray Bradbury. This is the kind of horror that affects your skin and later with your sticks. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I just hope this movie will be good. It had a lot of chances, with a big role, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the writing himself. And above all, it has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How can this fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers. <br /> <br /> First of all, it came down. Many of the horrors of the book are lost, as Bradbury had to be forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the footage from the book ... gone. Everything that makes you stumble ... away. <br /> <br /> Then there's the play. Like many movies that Disney threw out in the 80's, the kids in this movie can't act. And that has bothered me a lot. None of them looked at 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. They were more like experts. <br /> <br /> You think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce can do this in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark expired. But here it is as they just don't mind. All they want to do is to somehow pay a bond or something. It's far from their best achievements. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was fine like the witch, but the charcter of the Stofheks himself was not well-off. She is much less angry and does not have the presence as she did in the book. <br /> <br /> And everything left out of the book. The ballonnaag chases, the brand of Jim's house, the real death of Mr. Dark, what did Mr. Coogan on the cheerful round, the fate of the lightning vendor, the real death of the witch and o so much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. The joyful dream for one thing with the horses that were moving over was not really creepy, and that strange green mist that had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> I could go on with how this movie tore the original novel apart, but it makes blood boiling. Don't see this movie, but read the book. It's a classic from Bradbury.
