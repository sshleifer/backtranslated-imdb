Steven Seagal seems to be sleeping through a horrible movie shot almost completely in the vicinity of the complete lack of budget and resources to disguise. To pick up the technical flaws - silver F / A-18s and F-14s take a carrier for a strike, and wonderfully camouflaged F-16's for the real strike - this movie will give more credibility than it deserves . Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles that disappear and then disappear into a lightning removal that is supposedly available to all Final Cut Pro users. To put all your creativity in your own credit, Michael Keusch puts in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
