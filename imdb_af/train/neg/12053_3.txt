As always, it is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. In the early nineties, TV had told many lies about panhandlers and all made it bad and claimed we all made more than $ 100 a day when $ 20-40 a day was much closer to reality. When someone drove where I offered a sign to do work and offered my job, I actually went and did the job if I was physically capable. And if I were offered, the $ 100,000 ID would be forbidden, probably invested in apt prepaid for at least 2 years, and kept the most in the bank and still got me $ 10-2000 for $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games left at the casino. I usually win and can win properly if I just had a bankroll. Instead, I win about $ 1000 a month, play everything in a minimum buy due to the risk of losing it all. I was just homeless because I didn't have the chance to spend all my money and break. Sometimes I had more than $ 1000-2000 in my sock while sleeping outside. Everyone who wants to talk, contact sevencard2003 on Yahoo Messenger. I admit I was different from most homeless people because I never drank or used drugs. I'm no longer homeless, now at home for $ 177 a month and getting SSI and spending most of my time at online poker. Diversified mom and sunflower worked hard to get my SSI. keep my days to hide under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleep, worrying about being caught by security is finally over. If this TV team chose me, it was much earlier. It is a pity how they do not choose who they choose.
