Visually, this movie is stunning. It has beautiful black comic moments. But in general, the plot is very clickable, just like its apparent message. If you are a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies such as residence or saw, you will love it. If you are looking for something at all high-browse, please send it away. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh movie festival 06, and I just chose it because I was looking for something disturbing. Eventually it is not disturbing. Just times and unpleasant to go through. If you really want to be challenged, see something like The Lost. If you want to be paid out, or tell your friends about a really distorted movie, then it's for you.
