It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating, I told the guy at Blockbuster that they had to get it off the shelves. The only thing interesting about this movie is the box. On the box it says: "From the director of the bow master", so I thought ... uh, whatever, if it was recently made, I am sure that the director will at least not be too bad: - but After I watched the movie and watch what "Boogeyman" they are talking about, it's a bit of the early 1980s he made. A good way to queue in unsuspecting viewers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think they just kept the name "Zodiac Killer", and didn't bother investigating any of the real Zodiac's crimes or his MO, or even the years in which he was active was. All the crimes they are talking about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the stories about the original Zodiac take place a few years after the actual Zodiac's crimes have occurred. They also compare the Zodiac to Fritz Haarman "DÃ¼sseldorf's Vampire" throughout the movie and often speak to Fritz's "son". The Zodiac and Haarman were no less, and it makes sense to compare him with BTK who also shot people, not a man who killed people by chewing their necks. Neither of the Haarman facts is also correct, just a bunch of turbulent nonsense. His son even says, "Don't forget, his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t's" ... His real name has only one! I think the author / director just typed in a google search for serial killers and the fastest kids that came up were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. "Ooh, it sounds like cool names, let's make a movie about them without doing research outside! Ideal!" <br /> <br /> Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way in which the experts as well as the young murderer describe the suffering of DSM-IV and are cured of it. "I have also been diagnosed with DSM-IV and have since recovered," etc. For those who don't know, DSM-IV is the psychological guide to mental disorders. If someone suffers from the book itself, they should have some serious problems! Haha. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my point is that it's at the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time, and it's hardly a movie ever reaching that point. But if you are interested in watching a completely non-fact-based story about serial killers that is nothing more than boring, full of inexperienced actors, and not quite rational, I will see this movie. <br /> <br /> ... Oh, and I liked how the killer stole some of his dry ice victims. Nice contact ...
