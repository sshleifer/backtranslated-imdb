Meet Peter Houseman, rock star genetic professor at Virgina University. When he is not in court, he blows thoughts and drops panties in his classrooms. Dr Houseman works on a serum that enables the body to repair cells continuously so that people can become immortal. I also want to be immortal if I look like Christian Bale and get the lovely female love that only VU offers. A variety of old and ugly university professors do not care for the popular Houseman and cut funding for his project due to a lack of results. This causes Peter to use himself as the experimental jam for his serum. To my surprise there are side effects and he, get it, metamorphosis! into something embedded in our genetic DNA suppressed for millions of years. He also has beds. Mike's Sally fell in love for a whole day to know her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He's an angry little boy. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis is not a terrible movie, but not a well-produced movie. The whole time I watched it, I couldn't pass the fact that it was filmed in 1989. The look and feel of the movie is finally the seventies. It's not packed with 1970's movies, as Metamorphosis is part of the 50 cold classics of Mill Creek. There is basically no film quality at all. For the last five minutes, pure bad movie cheese is actually saving me at least the film of a lower rating. Pay attention to computer terminology such as "cromosonic anomaly". No wonder Peter's experiment failed. Your computer can't play! It is a view that is followed by a trip to your local tavern.
