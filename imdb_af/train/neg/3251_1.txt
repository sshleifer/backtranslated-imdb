Last night I caught this movie on FX, and when I sat there it happened to me that it could possibly have been the worst movie ever. Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad sound, incredible battle order, stupid characters. All this made it the most laughing bad movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was surprised that she was semi-skilled, and I had to keep looking ... and they made a successor!
