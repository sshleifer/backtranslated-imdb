Referring to Malice as a film noir, it doesn't look like such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, and I don't compare director Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I just register a protest against the darkness that endures this role from beginning to end, to the extent that you can't figure out what's going on most of the time. I can understand the darkness in night scenes, but this movie was dark, even in broad daylight, for what reason I am to understand. However, as it was, it would not have made much difference if director Becker filmed it in total darkness.
