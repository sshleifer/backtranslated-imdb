Unfortunately, this is true. "Legiunea sträinä" exposed with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, the author has lost the faculty to combine its content factors and artistic intentions into a coherent form. Maniacally worried about the mechanical trick to picking up random news subjects and joining them without any legitimacy, he just gathers a disorderly stack of events that can't follow the least story. The script's level is similar to a "Cântarea României" amateur play about the glorious facts of socialist realism - just turned upside down: while the communist line had only a particular concern with positivism and pure festivity, Daneliuc was just as maliciously occupied with negativism and disgusting skatology. The ideas content is zero, and the "message", childless and didactic, at a nursery level. <br /> <br /> He also forgot the most elementary professional principles. He can no longer organize a dramatic situation, order it in a real movie, fix it and change it according to the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of storytelling in motion pictures is similar to something like: "Holy lapman, it's not right, and everyone's people are asses!" What a great distance from the impressive artist from 1976-1984, who created unique works such as "Cursa", "Proba de mikrofon", "Vânätoarea de vulpi" - and even "Croaziera" and "Glissando" ... Sic transit halo mundi ...
