I recorded this movie for $ 5 at a discount bookstore. Adam Sandler is a wonderful actor and I thought it would be a good movie, well, it wasn't. There was absolutely no story line, bad jokes, and the other comedian said, "The F-Word", every other word he said did not usually bother me, but it was over. And even worse than the lack of storyline, the parts when Sandler just started playing in the film in the camera, reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they looked at the screen and looked at your questions. And last of all, when they randomly put Bikini shots girls into the movie at random. In my opinion, don't buy this movie, it's a waste of money
