The plot of this movie depends on one important point: that this killer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. Not being a father and a murderer is impossible. But this man is shown to kill a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion. This girl was someone's daughter. I don't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded for someone else's daughter. Or, alternately, could have been so cold-blooded and yet worried and cared for his own daughter. And the idea that a convicted killer will actually ask his victim's parents to take and care for his daughter is convinced. <br /> <br /> It is said, the actors acted with conviction. I thought Scott Bakula's eye color would look cooler and menacing than he usually was. You couldn't see in his eyes at all.
