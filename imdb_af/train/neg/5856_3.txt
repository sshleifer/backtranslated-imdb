T. Rama Rao made extremely beautiful films in the eighties, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times, styles and fashions. He is like stuck with the same old-fashioned movie style. <br /> <br /> Actors aren't bad, not good either. Anil Kapoor generally convinces his two roles of a father and his son, but the lack of writing often makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she is always good, and here she is nothing more than that. She makes the best of what she is given, but she always does. Finally, nothing great. Raveena is OK, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodramatic, sometimes silly. Maybe it's a delayed movie? Well, even then it will still be below the standard. The script is terrible, the movie is exaggerated, and the story goes nowhere. It feels like a movie made in the early 1990s, but the writing even makes it look older. The style is from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend unless you're a big fan of the lead actors.
