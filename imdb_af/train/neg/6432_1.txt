The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a marker for the Senator who relied on public ignorance over World War II aircraft. The back that has moving rifles believed on a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the plane's tail by preventing the gun from firing from the fire when it turned to the tail. Once the Senator was on the ground, he managed to shoot the tail off the plane. He could not have done that if the gun was tight. The governor responsible for that, admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible - he made the mistake, not the Senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact shows how it is. This film is designed to do one thing, destroying the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was done by the PBS on him. He was a hardworking, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights. He made mistakes, some serious mistakes, but the tail of an airplane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie is due to the fact that the public has simple stories, one stories so they don't have to think.
