I almost own every Seagal movie (yes even those that are low budget), and it must be the worst, not just of its movies, but of all the movies ever made. The only highlight of this movie, and just why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. it is Seagal, and B. Seagal has some sweet action ranges, specifically in the store, and even when ever he takes a whole army out with a knife. Next time I give 90 minute Seagal kill people, and don't even bother with a story line, because the storyline didn't just stink, but also the play, the fact that F-18s and F-14s on some way changed in F-16s, and also the fact that Stealth was as fast as an F-16. Also, the Stealth never had to burn? And since when Afghanistan has been regarded as a hostile territory as an air force point. Last checked, Afghanistan has no Air Force, we (US) control the air. This top secret mission was also played by speakers to all the crew in the room, but the Admiral still whispers to the other man that it is secret. Also, how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top? PLease tells us why they have captured him. Since when have air force pilots been great commandos (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when are their drunkards in Arab countries, while Muslims don't drink alcohol? In addition, Arabs listen to orders from women like # 2 in control? The highlight of the movie was definitely Seagal who killed people in the shop, and the other 50 people killed him with a knife, as well as the very short and completely random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
