I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people are watching this garbage? OK my dad and mom love it, but I make sure I'm good in the room before it comes. It's so depressed and sad, but the worst part is that I can't see all the detective programs like this because the detectives are like wood and heartless. What happened to detective programs with real mystery ??? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictitious characters we know nothing about what died over 20 years ago? I wish the BBC would make more comedy on bbc1 cos with Dibley's wizard. There is more room for crap like this.
