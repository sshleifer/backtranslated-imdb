I was very disappointed with this movie. I expected more from a Thelma and Louise female girlfriend crime film. Instead, the women's prison escaped into this flick, having no sense of loyalty to one another. They were an extremely vulgar packet of hyenas, who defeated each other, crossed each other and even committed lesbian rape to other women in the film. <br /> <br /> Instead of being dragged thieves, planning their escape and finding the hidden stamp money, the women escaped were too selfish and evil to trust each other long ago. These women were not freed positively. Eventually they eventually became a bunch of loose guns, unable to respect themselves, or each other. If you like 70-year-old women crime-maker movies, hit this bomb and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, starring Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
