The word "1st" in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this movie than for its crime victims. At least they don't have to hold on and watch this unlimited movie reach its own downfall. <br /> <br /> 1st should refer to: 1st concept of a script; 1st is used in each show in the final movie; 1st amendment in post-production; and so on. <br /> <br /> The movie is not thrown too much, it's just that everything about the movie is getting worse than the third, from the goofy script to the wood performance. And while rolling through this paved film, through the 2 o'clock mark, you want to be exhausted from your misery. At 160 minutes it is clear that it should be edited to less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Go in detail about the lame script and acting serve few goals. Even in the dreadful, Lake Placid, at least the very poorly crafted Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda performances are enough advanced to make you laugh at the movie. In the first to die, one just ends up grieving for the time lost in the wait to see what happens after the opening scene of preparing the female chief's suicide. <br /> <br /> Editing is so bad that one is never introduced. to one of the main characters I think (was never really told) is a DA She only appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously, the scene where she was introduced to the viewer was loaded onto the floor of the editor. And no one realized that a character from nowhere was an unusual film. <br /> <br /> In a word you shouldn't waste your time with this one. My wife and I wish we didn't. But at least we created our own deductions by commenting on several places in the film, as it was Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
