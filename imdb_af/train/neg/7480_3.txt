We all know what is like when we have a bad day at the office, right? Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks like it's like trying the worst of the days at the office. Sometimes it's just not worth going to, know what I mean? And sometimes it's just not worth doing if it's been done in 1970 with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better too. <br /> <br /> It's not that Steve Martin doesn't have a common comedian or wrong for the role of married and stressed ad exec; On the contrary, on both points. And it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally unsuitable; Her work is consistently good, though not good, since I first saw her in the Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it's not about the unfortunate couple at all: it's really about New York and why everyone should come to New York to live and love their lives in true happiness have? kind of ?? in the largest city in the world. This is when you are a New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Look, the 1970s movie is still a great comedy that realistically explores all the things that can go wrong while traveling somewhere. Most of the situations and faces you can imagine are what you can do in a strange environment. This version of 1999 is unfortunately in gratuitous touches specifically for an audience who is expecting or wanting to see excesses nowadays. For example, not satisfied with the main appeals of the main players, there is also a como (relatively long) from Rudy Giuliani, then mayor of New York, as we all know. What ?? Giuliani bucking for president even then? Worse ?? a walking ad for New York's childhood. <br /> <br /> And then we have John Cleese, who portrays his role as Basil Fawlty? But this time, as an exciting dress too? again by hotel staff, sycophantically sucking to rich clients and usually making himself the idiot he is in this role. And, in the process, has greatly damaged the memory of Fawlty Towers, probably the best British comedy series, gesture, nobody ... <br /> <br /> Why was this 1999 movie made? In the 1970s, New York was in many ways a dying city. It was almost literally bankrupt. So, when it was made in 1970, it was the city you saw: grim, dark, cheerful, disturbing and not the place where the afflicted couple eventually chose their new life in the Big Smoke (as it was then polluted). By 1999 things got better: Glitz was back, New York was thriving, it was the Big Apple, ready to bite, if you had the moxie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and end up with the wonderful dress to continue the American dream of life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness. Therefore, this movie is really comic, but not for reasons the producers might have intended. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy, this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon. If you saw the latter, you should definitely not save this one.
