SPEEDWAY and LIFE A LITTLE, LITTLE LITTLE LOVE. That is why I can personally forgive him for the mistake that was gone, JOE who at best appears to be an interesting burner and is not so bad. Sure, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are indeed embarrassing ?? As respectively, a dull Indian father of Elvis's character and a bawdy bartender who also watched her Presley - but one is happy to see Elvis surrounded by top veteran Hollywood talent such as Katy Jurado (as Meredith's Mexican woman, the two Jones ??
