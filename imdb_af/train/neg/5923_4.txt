During the Civil War, there were many cases of divided loyalty; Of course, many took place "In the Border States", where North South Africa met through geography. From the border, the young father, Owen Moore, goes out to join the Union Army. In short, the Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated from his regime, wanders on the enemy's property, desperate for water; He finds an offer where the Unionist's young daughter, Gladys Egan, sits. When the Yankee soldiers hit him, Little Gladys helped hide the Confederates. Later, when he returns to kill her father, the girl's friendliness is remembered. A sweet, small story by director D.W. Griffith. Location footage and humanity are lovingly displayed. <br /> <br /> **** In the Border States (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
