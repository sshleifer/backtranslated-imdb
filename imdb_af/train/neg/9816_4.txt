This movie was like a bad train wreck, as horrible as it was, you still had to watch. My boyfriend and I rented it and wasted two hours of our day. Don't get me wrong, the acting is good. Only the film as a whole we both fear. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this movie I had to buy something that was a little lighter. Jennifer Tilly is, as usual, a very dramatic actress. Her character looks manic and not all there. Darryl Hannah, although she played, she does a great job of playing the situation she is in. More than once I yelled at the TV and said she had to fight back or be violent. Overall, very violent movie ... not for the dull of the heart.
