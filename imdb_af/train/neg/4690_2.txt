This British movie is really awful and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, though he almost sleeps. The idea of ​​a bomb on a train sounds good ... but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the movie! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is evacuated, so there is no danger to anyone. In fact, this movie can be used in a movie class to show how NOT a suspense movie is made. True tension is generated by letting the audience know what the characters are not, a fact that is obviously unknown to the director. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe there is only one. After the first bomb is uncovered, it feels like there's no longer a reason to watch the movie any more. But at the last minute, the villain, who has no clear motivation for his actions, there are two. We're also not sure when the bombs go down, so we don't even have a classic "ticking bomb" tension sex. A good 10 minutes or more is spent watching Glenn Ford's French wife and thinking of leaving, and then wondering where he is. She is such an annoying character that we don't mind reconciling with him, so when she does, there's nothing emotional about it. Most of the other characters are reasonably without personality, and no one has any problems or problems. It's just 72 minutes, but it feels long because it's boring and boring. Don't waste your time.
