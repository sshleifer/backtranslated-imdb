This movie is so incredible; - The whole point of departure is bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) can fly to unmade and kill, as many people as the film implies, is laughing. The vampire itself will not look out of place in a Bela Lugosi movie. Most of the acting is so wood, the actors need to be treated for dry rot. I'm waiting for the day when someone makes a decent movie from a Steven King novel (with the exception, possibly, of Stand by Me). This movie suffers from what most Stephen King movies do - lack of money used for "special" effects, bad actors, terrible characterization and dialogue. This movie is cheap, tough and fails in everything it tries to do.
