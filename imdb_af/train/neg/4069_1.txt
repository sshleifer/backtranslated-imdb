good lord! (and it comes from an atheist), this "movie" is bad! <br /> <br /> Many have already been told by the judges (those who reviewed this piece 3 and below) that I totally agree with, I just want to add a few things: <br /> <br /> below the three guys who had to eat their own digestion products chopped by an ax raped by a broomstick, blown their balls away - the ex-boyfriend suffers from the worst torture while he is chatting to the girl's endless and useless chatter must listen (like us, but at least we have the grace of the dumb button). <br /> <br /> the director cut out the point and endless cemetery and reverse scenes, our suffering would be over after 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made this movie at least slightly tolerable is Emily Haack's tits (one point). <br /> <br /> Forget about it. Don't buy it. Don't waste your time. and your common sense. my brain was so grilled after watching it. I feel the urgent need to watch (and suffer) now.
