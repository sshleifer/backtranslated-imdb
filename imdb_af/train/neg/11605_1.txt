At first glance of the plot tag line I thought it could have been a decent movie. Could I ever be wrong? The start of the movie seems to be a bunch of freaks and decided to make a low budget film. For the first 10 minutes, you don't notice the cheesy, horrible sound and divine special effects, but it gets worse. About 20 minutes into it I asked, "What was the plot again?" I could just ask that question when I didn't get out of the lame's of this movie. The main actor has one institution for emotions and he bumps it throughout the film, though he was supposed to go in love and hate and everything. The flashback scene almost made me vomit, as it made me experience an extra minute of footage of earlier in the movie. Now we hit the middle of the movie where they obviously try to snatch Morpheus from "The Matrix", though he is just doing a horrible job. The actor's talk about "Star Wars" and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable. Now at the end of the movie, you don't realize it's the end of the movie, because you actually think the plot is finally evolving. The character "Morpheus" dies, the only good thing about the movie. He speaks a few words and plays the credits. What is this? No plot, bad acting, cheesy everything, it can't get worse. Please, if you appreciate value of human decency, DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE!
