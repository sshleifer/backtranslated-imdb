The thumb idea is not such a winner the second time around. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. Mainly, I think, Mr. Oedekerk had much less to work with in the Titanic call. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic is not yet (yet) a cultural myth and there are far fewer references that will be made to resonate with the audience. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled with one-time jokes that aren't really related to anything. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine is not clean during the "jump end of the ship" scene - it's not funny. On the contrary, you just think of yourself, "Did I miss something in the original movie?". There were too many of these baseless jokes (cf. Arachnid). <br /> <br /> On the other hand, steering the emerald ship judge had meaning and was funny. Also very funny was sending the block into the movie that wanted to "go faster" than a maniac running to claim. * Everything * be faster, including sinking the ship and even the first to die. These kind of jokes meant something in the Titanic context and borrowed meaningful humor for Thumbtanic. <br /> <br /> The thumb "media", the faces and the voices are quite amusing. The props and sets and CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Although, ThumbTanic proves that the cleanliness will not work alone, this filmmate still keeps you entertained and up to the end.
