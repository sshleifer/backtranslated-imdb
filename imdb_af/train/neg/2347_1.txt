First, I declare that I'm a big fan of Ashley Judd; Therefore, I was curious to investigate this debut role. No argument that her talent is visible and her performance is excellent. I think I can also see how the professional critics keep the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are supposed to entertain us and that's where this movie fails. <br /> <br /> At the halfway point, I thought to myself, â€œHow much longer should we be bored? gone forever! <br /> <br /> Then I thought, maybe it's one of those movies where the director tries to hit the audience in a relaxed state before they hit a dynamic event. No such luck. The movie continues, it's a meager, boring, inevitable story to the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this because I'm an action junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I expect to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that movie and audio quality is comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies. Depression! <br /> <br /> I just can't find out how anyone can keep this movie. Zero entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
