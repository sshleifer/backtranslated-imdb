This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. Pure drives. How someone could develop a relationship with the heroine or empathize with her is beyond me. I felt I was looking at a case history of a schizoid individual with a borderline personality disorder. Not terrible. <br /> <br /> In its most generous light, it can be seen as an attempt to produce and "art" film - except that I couldn't find any art for it in my life. <br /> <br /> If this woman lived in today's world, she would have been slapped to a spiritual institution and given a few days of anti-psychotic drug treatment. This, or just allowed to walk the streets and become a businesswoman. Why other characters in this movie found something in her and tried to help her in her quest for actress - talk more about their pathology than any convincing traits she had made her worth.
