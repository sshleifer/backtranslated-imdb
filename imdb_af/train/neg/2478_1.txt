This movie is S-L-O-W. Most of the movies were actually waiting to "start". <br /> <br /> The setting was dark, the writing was dark, the movie was dark, the plot was dark, the budget was low, low budget movies were bad, but one had no redeeming properties.) <br /> <br /> The plot is more digested with a shaky, slightly confused hunter than the actual Wendigo which has a very short appearance to the end of the movie. This was disappointing in itself as this 'Wendigo' was just a bizarre mixture of a tree and a hut. Everything about the film was uninspiring. <br /> <br /> The boy's parents apparently acted fairly and were sometimes completely detached from their son. Whether it was on a bad play or a bad script, it is not certain, but it only increased my disappointment and boredom levels. <br /> <br /> There was no food to think, nothing to interest. With no real plot or cock actor, this movie cracked so painfully, but you just can't care what happened. <br /> <br /> Wendigo's atmosphere reminds me of the dim film shown at the award ceremony. The End of 'Mr Bean's Holiday': A movie that is artistic and stupid, tries to be too hard and deep to be meaningful, but is pretentious and boring. <br /> <br /> I'll never see it again. I only saw it until the end of the hope that something interesting might happen ... but it didn't.
