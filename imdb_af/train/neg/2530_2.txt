This movie was uncomfortable. and not in the good way some have claimed. First of the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF continues with this love. The plot is basically: boy wants to buy sex, so a van (which is fair in fairness). Incredible as he looks like a new one, he gets a lot of chicks! And he failed with some. Then he counts with a very hot chick and realizes he loves this dull bird that has played hard. Then he dragged races with the hot chicks boyfriend. And he commands her. At what stage does Danny make Devito the day. Although he didn't need it, he crossed the line first. I've given these 2 * 's because I'm willing to assume there's a kind of 70's Vanning subculture I don't get and also because there are about 70's.
