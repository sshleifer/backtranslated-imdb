I watched this movie (actually I saw family portraits at the Mar del Plata Festival (Argentina), which contain cut moments + 2 other short films from Douglas Buck. I just couldn't see it! I had to look my eyes at the The first half of cut-off moments went through and took a peek every time, by the time it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt light and I just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short ( VAT, of course I was not the only one who left the room.) It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting to me! I am impressed by the very brave people who actually loved it. The shocking and bloody and horrible images I have seen have really stuck in my head for two days! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw the whole thing and told me about it) and I think It doesn't make sense, I mean, the amount of violence and things, don't make anything rather than shocking people. And that's not a good enough reason, I think. There is absolutely nothing in this movie I can say "Well, at least," x "thing about it was good." But well, I guess I'll never understand those movies.
