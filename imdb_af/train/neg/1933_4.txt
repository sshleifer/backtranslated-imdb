Final score (an average of several classic movie qualities, plays, creativity, discounts, humor, fun, etc.): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> Have "Atlantis: The Lost Empire came out a few years ago, it would have been a daring, serious new direction in Disney animation. However, it only comes a year after the innovative and almost genius "The Emperor's New Groove" and points to a step back in unlocking Disney from the recurring Disney formula. I'm a huge fan of feature length Disney animation movies. Must see that everyone loves or hates it. "Atlantis" is an animated throwback to "20,000 under-sea leagues" and similarly lively action sci-fi adventures of the 50's and 60's. Problem is, this version hardly contains an original idea. It feels like a remake of something, even more than the actual Disney remakes (Tarzan, The Hunchback or Notre Dame). The characters are a little more than a running clich√© of the usual suspects who typically populate these types of movies (the oddball mechanic, the gung ho general, the sassy hard women). In addition to Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the supporting scroll is flat-out. The movie also suffers from its short pace. Instead of rinsing it out in an epic story, Disney is very sorry in the usually short time to brush up on opportunities to develop ... suspension, characters, anything really. They drove us into this new and wonderful world and we barely made it to us. The awkward fit sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and thirsty and cheap. This thing looks like a patched Saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they haven't forgotten that 2D traditional animation can still be wonderful. <br /> <br /> Negative: The visual, tempo and mere lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positive: Surely the coolest death scene for a Disney villain in a long time. This is the creative highlight of the movie.
