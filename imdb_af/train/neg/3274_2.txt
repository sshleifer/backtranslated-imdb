Again, such as Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, a TV series, it becomes a full-fledged movie and is devastated by all hundreds of people watching. Basically, Duke cousins, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time very quickly in "The General Lee". But they have to get their act together and their family farm is destroyed with almost the entire town by the nasty Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg (Razzie nominee Burt Reynolds) to make way for a big coal mine. They get help on their way from their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzie nominee Jessica Simpson) and Oom Jesse (Willie Nelson) while being pursued by equally average sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M. Gainey) and police. Also Joe Don Baker as governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Street and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I give the movie an extra star is because of some impressive car stunts, and of course, the beautiful body of Simpson (I will admit her legs are not Catherine Bach, but still!). ) But, in addition, it's pretty boring. This is nominated for the worst picture by the Razzies, the worst director for Jay Chandrasekhar, the worst Remake of Sequel, the worst screen saver for Simpson & her Daisy Dukes and the worst screenplay. Nice arm!
