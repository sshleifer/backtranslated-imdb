I have seen many, many productions from The Nutcracker. Now I have perhaps watched this movie from the civilized viewpoint of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I'm sure people in the specific business of ballet choreography will find this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective I found everything from design to choreography to be a "movie". None of the traditionally "strange" and impressive costumes look like they were supposed to be (ie the sweets don't look like sweets, the rats don't look like rats, but rather like chocolate cushions) Scene too much for the screen , and the choreography did nothing to me. This makes the whole show very satisfying (at best), as if it were intended not to dispense with any other production. But remember, it is again from the artistic perspective of a theater director, not a dancer or a choreographer, but a straight male theater director.
