After the rather successful MASTI, which performed better, Inder Kumar came back with a comedy. PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood movie. See no evil, hear no evil. <br /> <br /> The movie reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) where Frame and Anupam play blind and deaf <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring exercise <br /> <br / > The film has jokes of such nonsense that you do not feel like laughing like Snehal Dabi's head in the back of the horse and all the kind of comedies we are not laughing at now but mock <br /> <br / > The movie starts on a click and the screens are funny. Unfortunately, such moments do not last the last time the story never moves in half, the comedy comes bored. The turn is handled well and the second half becomes an action movie where the blind man and the deaf save the heroines. We have all the OTT chases and plays <br /> <br /> Direction by Inder Kumar is bad. Music is okay, one song stands out. I LOVE YOUR MY ANGEL. <br /> <br /> Vivek is horrible in the comics, his timing is very bad and is good in serious scenes. For some reason he keeps comedy and destroys his career. Fardeen Khan is better, but too wood. Among the rest Esha and Amrita is the heroine Boman Irani here annoys Snehal Dabbi is okay
