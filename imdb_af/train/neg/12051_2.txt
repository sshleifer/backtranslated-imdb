This movie is "sounding" but in the same way a car accident is sounding. It's hard to look away. Overall, this movie is nothing more than an incredible irresponsible social experiment - and a useless, biased experiment with it. The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems for the lowest possible denominator. The way the money is offered to Ted is pure exploitation. The intervening steps that filmmakers who are obliged to participate in (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and without any substantive attempt to contact Ted. Instead, it is painfully clear that they cover the filmmaker's posteriors and further exploit Ted's situation. The worst part is that the filmmakers follow Ted after 6 months. and seemingly completely cut off from the subject that followed them so carefully months ago. If they were caring, they would have found better "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, they had to spend the money without any intervention. This movie is at best a high-brow jackass stunt and not a documentary. It is sad to think how much $ 100,000 could actually change a homeless person's life if it was in the right hands.
