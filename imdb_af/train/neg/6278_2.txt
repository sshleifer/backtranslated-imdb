You have to wonder how some movie is ever made ... this one decided to hit with many other things and just wander outside the mop. <br /> <br /> Yet, you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump life into the story. The blue hue throughout the film is left in 'weather', which would be depressed on its own, but here it is too much. The idea that it is not a medical condition, does not curse a house or a gypsy or trinket, but just something that for our apparent reason does not happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her, just like a big gulp of an empty cup. Some doppelgangers have superpowers, but others do not know or do they not know? They seem to be just as clueless as we are. <br /> <br /> It's a poor man's rip-off of "Invasion of the Body-Snatchers" with Keifer Sutherland's "Mirror" and "The Sixth Sense", where you have to work those three together.
