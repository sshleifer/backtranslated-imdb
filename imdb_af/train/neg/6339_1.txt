All the incidents of David Prior are terrible at all levels: bad writing, bad acting, bad filmmaking, no budget (the director's brother is usually played as the male head). But they all have incredible entertainment value due to their unintended hilarity. The plot of almost every David Prior "movie" (as I would like to call it) is basically the same. Male-American-American Commando team blew up the Communist bad. But unlike other Cold War garbage like Red Dawn, Prior's movies are actually funny because of their over-the-top venues and acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or the other man?) Is invited by General Mitchell for a top secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something that is the result of "it's my roommate, I trained him well". WHAT. You trained your roommate? And that would seem to be their solution to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these jewels on any video, buy them. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to get Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But the one I highly recommend to them is Final Sanction, with the French-directed Robert Z'dar.
