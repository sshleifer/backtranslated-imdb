So what is the big fuss about making an INDIANA JONES wannabe when you have an actor who is cast as fiction from the adventure storybooks that don't want to go on an adventure? Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED is probably fired, but for whatever reason, this movie is lacking in excitement! This does not mean that it has no action, but looks at the dark side of the picture. It has to be uncovered with INDIANA JONES or other action adventure tensions that contain cliff hangers and narrow escapes, and JAKE SPEED has been promoted in this way using clever propaganda to interest me and others! In addition, I've never heard of the old one, so who needs his attention?
