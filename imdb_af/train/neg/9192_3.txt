I found this movie in the horror section of my video store. It seems sensible because most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Death' trilogy until 28 days later. "But after watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is. <br /> <br /> It's actually a music video that gets progressively faster and more and more greedy. There is no horror here people. Just a halfway straight scenic screens that will soon be exhausting because they are last ... and last ... and lastly ... and soon you will get the feeling, maybe you're accidentally knocked back DVD player for 3 minutes, but no, so they made the movie. It's a pity. I think anyone can find a better use for $ 7 million in the film industry than making it. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, they were over again and they became boring, as it was the same stunt every time, just with a different character. <br /> <br /> What's also ROYALLY annoying is the splitting of footage from the arcade game. I played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it in here? Oh, that's right, it's not a movie, but a music video, and it's a poor one. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: lots of violence / gore, and curse
