I saw this movie at a real movie (probably the $ 2.00 one) with my cousin and uncle. We were about 11 and 12, I think, and really in scary movies. I remember being so excited to see it because my uncle left us filming (and we probably never did it again!) Just boring and not scary. The only redeeming thing I can remember was Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and it wasn't so good, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before and this one has always been in my mind as the worst. It was from what I can remember, one of the most boring, non-scary, wasting of our collective $ 6, and a waste of film. I read some of the reviews that say it's worth a watch and I say, "For each one of his own", but I won't even bother. Not so bad is it good.
