Sorry to miss something? Did I go out early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and false!) Stories thought to me, "It's going to be a classic." But it was all the hills from there! The acting was brilliant because it is worth it. William H Macy is fantastic and just gets better and better, every movie I watch him. But it never seemed to be. I waited for the big moment where all the stories were interconnected and then suddenly. This rain toad ?? That was when the writer said, "I went deeply how can I draw all these stories together. Oh, I'll just rain frogs." I like smart movies, I like funny movies, but it was just weird and boring. 10/04
