Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein wrote the script of a story by Roth.this a zombie film, which owes much to George Romero and his formerly living death movies, and to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre to name Sam Ramie's "Evil Dead" . There is nothing original here, and the story is not compelling. The acting is about the same as this genre. It's just that the story fails. We saw this movie pretty much. and made better. After saying that, after reaching commercial, if not artistic success, of this movie, Roth decides that he was a director and with the abysmal horrible, moderate, sensible but meaningful (increasingly ambitious) crap party Hostel.Roth should stop while he was behind. Cabin Fever is not a good movie, but compared to Hostel it is a work of art. I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) convinces this man that movies are the wrong career choice. Cabin fever, a poor 3/10 for not as ably narrow as hostel.
