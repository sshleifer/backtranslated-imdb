It's pretty simple. Friends are a comedy of very basic humor aimed at teenagers and young adults, with unsophisticated sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It's also painfully clear that they are finally trying to make it 10 seasons, most likely, so they can say they're running Seinfeld's 9-season. The problem is that Seinfeld had 9 wonderful seasons with great writing. Friends have me (and I am very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 turbulent seasons. <br /> <br /> It has become a soap opera with recycled humor and recycled traits that weren't so good, so start with the 100th time you've seen it. I find it so difficult to understand why people consider it so high. It's really awful.
