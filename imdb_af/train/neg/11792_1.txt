It must be the cheapest movie in the 21st century. It's all about low quality, but in the end it falls under ... everything. All the cheapest tricks - such as flickering and dark - are used to hide the crappy computer effects. <br /> <br /> All the actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene where Anne is asked, "Why do you look so indifferent?" The correct answer is because she can't act. No matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dead, she is fired), she has the same stupid registry in her face. <br /> <br /> It's not just the movie, what is B quality. This is also the back cover description (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray vessel, capital vessel and main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like another movie, both with character called Fletcher and sea monsters
