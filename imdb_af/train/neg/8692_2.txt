I think Elisabeth Rohm, although she might try hard, is not good at all. I think it was because of the budget that she was the only one they could get for that price. I mainly looked at the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most credible and undoubtedly the most compelling to watch. When he wasn't on the screen, the thing died. It was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the creeps, but be assured that he is a kind, funny compassionate man in real life. He even said he played that role. <br /> <br /> I'll see everything with him in it, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. She was as exciting as ribbon on law and order. Maybe a very nice person, but no actress.
