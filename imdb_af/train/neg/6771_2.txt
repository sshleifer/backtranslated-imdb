There are few constructive things to say about this, but I can mention that Matt Dillon is doing his best to make something out of it and the very split screens and graphics are worth it. Since most racing films are in the prospect of car lovers not being so intelligent, we end up with movies like this. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who surprised so much in Mean Girls, needs to make better decisions to take roles. Here she just failed. <br /> <br /> Children will only be entertained generously, as they try to appeal more to adults and children (though it is quite stupid). The one in the theater I saw, showed no real interest after a few minutes. And as a family sports movie, it's terrible. The better moments are at the scrap yard that creates a sentiment and later in the car-bash festival that creates tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you should develop it better than here. After some compulsory race styles, you're in the best part: leaving the plywood in your own car.
