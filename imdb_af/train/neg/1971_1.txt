This film is deeply disappointing. Not only does Wenders display only a very limited musical spectrum of Blues, but it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he is watching on film watching and listening completely. The only highlight of the movie is the maintenance of a Swedish couple who were friends with J.B. Lenoir and their private video recordings as well as stories tell. Wenders's launch of the cinematic subject begins very interesting - referring to the world's culture (or actually American culture) traveling in space, but its limited view on the theme, as well as the non-funny or completely fascinating propagation of stories from the 30's it makes film as a mere sleep aid. To yawn. I expected him.
