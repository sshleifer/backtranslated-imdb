I watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to make some movies about those with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> Initially, I found the main character somewhat noble and engaging. His message about the disabled and the lifetime he has spent recognizing and integrating disabled people into the mainstream community's job market is wonderful. And my problem is not with the right person who did these things. He was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diamond opposed to the message it proclaims, and it has found me insulting. <br /> <br /> First, they didn't cast anyone into a title role with a real physical disability. . Certainly, they were skilled actors, but it didn't seem right to preach about the hiring of the disabled and not actually the DISABLED for something in the movie. Further compounded by the fact that a man in one scene halfway through the film is seen on a podium on crutches, which has only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so clear that it's scandalous. What? They couldn't find a real film official? For a 5 second shot, it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than just hiring a REAL official? At that point in the film I found it so deceptive and totally against the message it was trying to convey that I was coming to the bitch here and waking up like the pathetic lame I am. <br /> <br /> Figure out.
