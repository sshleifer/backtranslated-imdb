The first cube movie was an art film. It created a world in which all the great archetypes of humanity were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world they could not understand. It was, at the non-literal level, a "man of cruel nature" plot, where the individual who represented innocence and goodness eventually came to triumph to see a new, indefinite world than the man's little ones; a world where there was no battle, but peace. I evaluated Cube a 10 out of 10, which is a movie never intended to have any prosecutions. <br /> <br /> The second film, Hypercube, was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the environment didn't feel meaningful and didn't make sense. Still, to be pretty entertaining, I rated it a 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third film, Cube Zero, while the second is ignored, plays like a very inferior commercial B-movie rehash of the first, even the symbolism. There is no "tribute" or "tribute" here; there is just rip off. The same kind of plot, with some elements being idiotically changed (such as having letters instead of prime numbers between the blocks - an idea that is clearer than anything else shows that it is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to don't say). <br /> <br /> Seeing something from "behind the scenes" means nothing, because the viewers are just part of the Great Bad Experiment, the architects of which we hear nothing. And in this movie, those who come to the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where the * bleep * is the meaning in it?! It's just 'stupid'. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero's production values ​​and acting are not bad, but the story and ideas are so inspiring that this movie can only get a score of 3 out of 10.
