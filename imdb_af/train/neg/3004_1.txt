What a terrible movie. The acting was bad, the pacing was bad, the cinematography was bad, the direction was bad, the "special" effects were bad. You expect some weakness in a shooter, but even the murders were bad. <br /> <br /> First, the past event that created the motive for the battle turned on for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% of it and explained what was good enough. <br /> <br /> Then the victims were invited to the "reunion" in an abandoned school that still turned on all utility services. One of the victims thought it was a bit strange, but they rejected it and decided to break anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, the murders were so false that they were virtually unstable. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie unless you want to see a few breasts and not very good breasts. This movie makes Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
