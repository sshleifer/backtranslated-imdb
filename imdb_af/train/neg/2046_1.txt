I can't believe this movie even made it for video, and the video rental stores are prepared to put it on their shelves. I asked for a refund. Remove the fact that the movie has no historical truth, and it is still the worst movie ever found in a video store. It's not even good enough to be called a B-given movie. Don't waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listening to the voice and the terrible music made me sick. Anyone involved in this movie must be drawn from the union. The industry is giving a black mark, but after most of this movie I really don't see anyone involved, is a union member.
