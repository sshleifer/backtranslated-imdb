This successor is thoroughly uneven, incoherent and indifferent and in a plot (in the case of one) it is difficult to condemn. It's hard to be modern (ridiculous, out of time and character. 21st century style songs dominate) and cute too many crafted, funny jokes with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the young plot. Even Glenn Close (and she's usually very good) whips through this movie, parodying herself as the original De Ville and starring Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that's not even good at looking at. This is a very good example of a bad and useless successor. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, characterization and acceptable acting. That doesn't mean that. It's bad.
