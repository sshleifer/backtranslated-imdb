Gone to look at this movie that expects a "nothing really" action movie, has still been very disappointed. The opening scene promises a bit of action with a little comedy. It keeps you stuck for the first half of the coz until you expect it to be the time for the action to kick in. Well, nothing of that kind happens. The movie pulls and the end just drops you up to a point you get annoyed. Wonder what the director thought. Do nothing. The film was missing in all respects, had no real storyline and it was very hollow, even though Rambo sat there. I don't think he could have helped the score. There is simply no logic to the movie. A perfect way to waste your time and money. By far the most annoying movie I've ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same point of departure after enduring it. Definitely not for people who have a little movie in them.
