I am an avid fan of horrible movies, anything cheesy and rightly ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit, I went to the local rental shop and found Vampires versus Zombies. The name is just to be entertained, you know that no one in the world can do anything like that, it should just be bad. <br /> <br /> And boy, is it BAD. After watching this horror-ific movie, I was literally literal. My dick and I sat outside without saying a word for a few minutes. We considered the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressive silence with the words, "... dude .... What?" Yes, I am a surprising individual. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick 'street view' Die Plot; There is no one in the WTF mode at all. The characters; No development, forgotten. The music; Worse than porn. The Vampires; Their vampires? The Zombies; They say Zombies? <br /> <br /> In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, it's so bad I long to see it again. So do yourself a favor, watch it and get Depressed.
