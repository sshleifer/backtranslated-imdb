What a rubbish refuse. I can't even begin to describe how horrible this movie was. The appreciation here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you enjoyed the first gingerbread. The first one was well written, well directed, well executed. A brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere. The second one was "alrite" decent as a standalone movie, but clearly not to the level of the first. The third is an insult to the series, period. I evaluate the movies: 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and that's really in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald. with half-assed native American mythology. The sisters have no real story, or progression, or even a clear relationship ... They just try to survive and be together forever. It's about as deep as it happens. <br /> <br /> Scared that the girls agreed to be in this pile after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah and something else, staging of action was terrible - people often do not appear anywhere, as the girls turn around and there is an extensive candlelight setting with a mystical native American woman who doesn't sit there and talk. Stelle was terrible, couldn't get away from the fact that everything was apparently based in a set, which really didn't help. There was also consistent snow outside the camp, but no trace inside (on the set). <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really hoped it would be at least as good as the second one.
