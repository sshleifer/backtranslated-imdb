Terrible acting, lame plot, stupid story and just a horrible movie make this piece of junk. It was stupid to go through. Not terrible. Don't waste one penny from this. The movie theaters should feel bad about how to really bring this movie to people to watch. This horror movie was not at all scary, creepy or disturbing. It was in no way visually appealing. The acting was so terrible by all the actors that any attempt to get you into the movie through dialogue is completely destroyed within moments of the actor / actress opening their mouths. Plus the whole story, I don't know why someone will make a movie with this story again. Don't waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, don't waste one moment watching this movie. You will feel stupid to watch it.
