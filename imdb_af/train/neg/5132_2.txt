I found out about this movie because Jewish Ben Chaplin of Game On was in it. Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he has run away because he wanted to die in Hollywood and die in this movie. He failed God. <br /> <br /> The movie is a very simple romantic comedy featuring Janeane Garofalo who plays an ugly woman using her neighbor, Uma Thurman, to date, Ben Chaplin, because she thinks Ben Chaplin doesn't don't like being ugly. The movie is just bad for so many reasons. The plot is incredibly predictable from the overall slapstick bits to the serious, sweet bits: you are just the fitting where all three of them have fun and then the photo a bit. These two scenes have cut me! Janeane's character is sickly arrogant (and guesses her role as a "comedienne" and bow feminists are also in real life). She claims the movie is "anti-feminist" if it is actually realistic. Men look more often than not for personality. It's also interesting to record her hypocrisy. She had been a feminist and comedian for many years before adopting this role and then suddenly decided that the film was bad. I suggested that she hated the idea and the script of this movie before it was released, but she sure kept her quiet so she could pay for this movie crossover. I mean, come on! She acted for Heaven's sake! What this movie was really anti-men than anything. It shows men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groin, with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman's character Noelle. There are also other bad things about this movie, such as Ben Chaplin's character being The British man, every American girl, finds cute and Jamie Foxx is the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx needed his accent a few times for good friend try to imitate. Is it the best thing the writers of the dissertation can do? Blimey they never did, except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore movie ever made. There is also a horrible phone sex scene that is just grotesque and proves how cheap the movie is. The other commentary here tells how Janeane Garofalo is not ugly, but is actually beautiful. I was the same film as they were? She is definitely no viewer and the only good thing about this movie is that she is thrown as ugly. Although I said this, I don't see Uma Thurman's appeal either: she is slim and slim. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things about this movie if you never watched it: <br /> <br /> You will know what the end will be; <br /> <br /> You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and; <br /> <br /> You will be bored after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Look at your own danger.
