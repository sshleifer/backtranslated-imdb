This movie had to be fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But it dragged on, had indescribable characters and had no target audience. <br /> <br /> Some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched by a robot friend of theirs (in the name, appropriate, Jinx). The space screens are then long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and either cheesy or frightening, depending on your point of view. Adults will be bored and be cheese, children may be scared because the way it is filmed really leaves an ominous sense about it. <br /> <br /> There's a budding romance, but unlike the shuttle - it never goes down. Why it was included in the first place is unclear, except perhaps extra tension between the characters - but it failed if it was the idea. <br /> <br /> A young Lea Thompson must be weird and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the future" is wonderful. But no, she was annoying and average. Not someone you want to consider, a friend or even a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He is very fortunate to have ever seen this movie in movies again. Maybe he could act like Mikey in the Life Cereal commercials, but he doesn't seem to be a normal boy. He doesn't fit on the screen and I don't think we can identify with him at home. I would have been happier if he had never returned to earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
