This astonishing waste of production means is cinematic evidence that the rich and famous can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a (silly) play by Tennessee Williams and director Joseph Losey (with a dead hand) and with Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward. This project filmed in a spectacular mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean, had been a sure fire. winner when presented to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and boring that it is almost convinced. Visually, the film is spectacular, but it is the power of nature that allowed the environment and the fact that a real house is used instead of a set. The shrill antiquity of a screaming Taylor, Burton's half-sleeping walk, the lukewarm dialogue, Noel Coward who laughs at himself, the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costumes, irritate the viewer. BOOM is a shame, a waste of money and talent and a clear proof that famous people can be rewarded are idiots, just like the rest of the planet's places. Not even fun. Just horrible and crazy, shocking waste.
