I feel like I'm the only child in town that is annoyed by Branagh's performance. He is a good actor in most accounts, but he simply couldn't deduce the southern accent. I mean it was deplorable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous reviewers questioned why American actors were not thrown into this movie. I second the idea. It's great when actors / actresses want to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard to challenge a performance. Maybe it's Altman, but he's such a great director. <br /> <br /> Well, I really don't want Branagh to bark too much for his totally boring accent. Everyone deserves to screw here and there. But it is difficult to see something so annoying that you prefer to eat a chicken leg or eat a bucket full of shit when sitting by The Gingerbread Man.
