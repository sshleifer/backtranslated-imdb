Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an annoying indie movie for 14 years. Should I still write eight lines? Ana de la Reguera is fine to look at as a Mexican nun along with the forward and rude progress of Jack Black. This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie movie. I really like a movie that has the courage to explore the Mexican culture. This movie explores Mexican culture deep. I only choke on his cultural roughness: Jack Black is just as rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable delegate in Mexican culture as it was. The Mexican Wrestling culture is not a white man like a white man. I suspect Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black offered here. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb has changed my review. Has anyone else changed his review? Just a question.
