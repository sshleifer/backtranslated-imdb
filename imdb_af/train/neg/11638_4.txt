"Blood of the Holy, Petrified Blood" is the third installment of the Gabriel Knight games, a series of adventure games about roguish writer / paranormal detective, Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his companion, Grace, were asked by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so-called "night visitors". When the son of Prince James is kidnapped, Gabriel follows the night visitors to Rennes le Ch창teau, where he begins a mystery of the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite marketing, it's not about vampires. . Vampires have a token appearance in the game, but should never command the middle stage, just like the voodoo hounfor in "Sins of the Fathers" or the werewolves in "The Beast Within." Gabriel and Grace make no attempt to expose the true nature of vampires, or to investigate vampires. Although the vampires killed three people during the game, their victims are randomly selected and have nothing to do with the main tomb. <br /> <br /> Much of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight installments was in the relationships that Gabriel formed with the villains. Through these relationships, the player couldn't help sympathizing with the villain, turning the villain into more of a human and less of a monster. Gabriel's only interaction with the villain, however, is in a single, chaotic interview, which means nothing to enchant the villain. <br /> <br /> The roles of Gabriel and Grace in this mystery are fairly useless. Gabriel spends his time in the identities of members of a treasure hunter group staying at his hotel, but what he discovers is nothing more than a red herring. Grace spends her time exploring the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau, but all her research is made redundant by the presence of a confusing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> The action of this confusing ally and his polar opposite --- the vampire leader --- is unstoppable. The ally gives hints about the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau in broad daylight and expects Grace (and not the other treasure hunters of the tour group) to find. However, one day he could have revealed Grace's whole mystery, instead of endangering the kidnapped child for another 48 hours. And finally he tells Grace the secret anyway. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the vampire leader fails the goals of centuries-old twilight, as he chooses not to take action two days later. kidnapping the child. The only reason she decides to postpone action is to enjoy his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would have been much better if it was purely focused on the Holy Grail. The kidnapping and vampires had to be omitted, replaced by a race against the Vatican to expose the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau. As Gabriel was portrayed more than once as unwilling Catholics, this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> Overall, the game was a disappointing installment in the series, despite an improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as Gabriel Knight's voice.
