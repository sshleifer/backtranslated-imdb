When the movie started, I was shocked to see it filmed by using a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie. Even directly to DVD movies, production values ​​should be better than that! Heck, a large percentage of home videos uploaded on YouTube, have better production values! Too often, the film seems to be serious by plugging the camera on a tripod and turning it on - with no camera person! Closeups and anything that looks like camera work are absent in some scenes where they worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The movie is about two gay men who want to get married. As if it was made almost a decade ago, their only option in getting married in Vermont was definitely to change. However, the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot be attributed to this movie in any way. If this is the case, it will back up gay marriage supporters, instead of helping if the movie stinks and never really tries to address the issue seriously. According to the film, religious people are one-dimensional idiots who carry Bibles everywhere and people shoot, as well as women who have gay men, are meticulous when learning their spouses have lived a lying figure. I'm sure it gives a fair chance on both sides! <br /> <br /> The bottom line - nothing about the movie shows any professionalism and I even hesitate to call it a movie. It's more like a home movie and doesn't even feature an IMDb presentation or even inclusion on IMDb's Bottom 100 list of the worst-rated movies of all time. The acting is terrible, the writing is terrible, the direction (if even) is terrible, the camera work is terrible and the plot is terrible. This is a home movie !! There is nothing positive I can say in any way, except that it looks like Ed Wood's films as Oscar contenders and I'm probably the ghost of Mr. Wood smiles every time someone sees this mess! <br /> <br /> I don't care if you're gay or straight - this movie is not worth your time and I don't know how they managed to create DVDs. I assume that one of the actors burns his home computer during his free time! Seriously, it gives new meaning to the word 'bad'! <br /> <br /> By the way, if one lady in the movie were a true lawyer, reading ability would not be a prerequisite? I'm not saying either. '<br /> <br /> Finally, with gay marriages being such an important and important topic, can't we have a movie that is better than HERE, addressing the problem? Unfortunately, this one just invites laughter.
