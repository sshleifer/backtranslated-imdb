This film describes the experiences of a few hits (one of them Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in Miami. The convergent story lines eventually bring all the people together in one place and time. The movie was generously entertaining, but the big problem was that it happened all night and many scenes were literally undermined to the point that it was impossible to see what was going on. In a few scenes you can actually see where they are trying to stretch the development process to save the images. Someone didn't know how to run a movie camera. Surprisingly, this movie is even released!
