We can start with the woodworkers, but this film is a disaster. Growing up in NY, I can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people. I am not even a defender of culture in any way and found that it is a beloved piece of waste to fit his own fictional, ridiculous cultural offering and language that anyone Seinfeld sees is inaccurate. It's a tremendous waste of time and, even worse, isn't really interesting, as the rash is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are bad. Who is this way? Nobody. <br /> <br /> The author's name sounds like Israeli or something of that kind, but it is clear that he has no idea about the subject he is writing about. Look at his bio, it's shocking that he lived in New York and wondered how much real connection he had with the community. Even mediocre movies like a stranger among us are better and closer to the truth than this drink. Reading this man's credits is no wonder he wrote writings on all C-grade films that somehow contain stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone, because this script is even lower than a bad Dolph Lundgren movie.
