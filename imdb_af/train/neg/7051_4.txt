A movie about dealing with the problems of growing up and being true to yourself, Blue Juice is thought candy for those who love surf and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the true star of this movie, while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug addict. <br /> <br /> For those who don't like the surf or Cornwall in the least, you'll find it takes a long time before the movie is even interesting to be interesting. The start is slow and spends too much time on long shots of just slightly interesting landscapes. Plus too many main characters lead to most of them being one-dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea, but because of the level characters, you have no idea why they are acting in the situations in which they are inserted. <br /> <br /> Only Ewan, Sean and Catherine's characters make it a movie to be videotaped, and so it was released on videotape in the US only after Ewan and Catherine became mainstream.
