I'm so confused. What in the world was this movie about? What was the killer's motivation? He was pretty angry, but I haven't figured out why yet. Nothing in this movie made sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. What I think would make it a hill. Or a heap. From crap. The acting was terrible. When I searched for some of the actors in this movie, they were in very few things I heard, and that came absolutely no surprise. I can't decide if I should be sorry for them for the embarrassment of being so bad in a movie or feeling that they should never be offered an acting job again. Start. . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) But don't waste your time with it. There is so little substance that there is nothing, just to make fun. It was undoubtedly one of the worst whistles - NO, one of the worst movie of ANY CHILD, that I've ever had to watch, and I've seen quite a few.
