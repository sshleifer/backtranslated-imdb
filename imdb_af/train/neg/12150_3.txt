Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be your hard-earned dollars. Proposal? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say the good old TheatreX took one for the team on this one. Guess what the plots are about? Zombies are taking over. This time, for the sake of originality (?) Find this movie in Rhode Island, and to be honest, I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie movie on Rhode Island. A government-controlled TV station normally broadcasts 'normal' broadcasts so that any remaining citizens will not think there is a problem in the world, that is, those who never look or go outside . I would say that some of the ads broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this movie. There is actually a story about this, but I don't bother with it, because after a while you won't mind or fall asleep. Anyway, it has a lot of horrible acting to throw on all the "seen before" things that are pulled in front of the camera. Believe me, you can do many other things with your time than to see it. 3 out of 10.
