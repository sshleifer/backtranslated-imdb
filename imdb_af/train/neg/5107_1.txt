There is a British edition of this show that is far less exorbitant than the American version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or maybe bedroom and bathroom and is very grateful for what they have. The American version of this show is all that reality TV shouldn't be. Instead of making some improvements to a home that the residents couldn't afford or do themselves, the whole house is being rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a common welfare system in the US exists or if you plead hard enough, you will receive it. The rather vulgar product placement that occurs especially by Sears is also inexplicable. Rsther as changing one family in a deprived environment into potential millionaires would be much better at helping the community as a whole, instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one house, something for the whole community. build ..... maybe a place where you can borrow money and power and return it with building materials so that everyone can benefit if they want. To give it all to one person can cause tremendous anger among the rest of the local community who are still living in the same homes.
