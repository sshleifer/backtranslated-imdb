The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedies. Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry out. I actually saw better in low budget porn. Although I actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: Watch your ass Nick: You look yours (together): I won't leave you! <br /> <br /> The first action series shows how awful the production is, but it's very funny: Good guys have transformer weapons! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 sub-machine guns. Next scene, AK-47 replica! And then, to download it all, they do some weapons that exchange between screens with some M-16's !! I think they had a budget deficit for guns, not enough to go around with the good guys and bad guys. Vegtonele is poorly coordinated and falls like hell. You need to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade so that it can explode on its own. You cannot launch a shoulder of any kind while driving in a helicopter. Weapons that you throw away are not suddenly revealed again. When a gun is out of bullets, throw it away, it's pretty stupid. Unless you have no idea how to reload them. Big, slow-moving trucks that drive first gear make for awkward action scenes. I really can't believe movies like this are actually manufactured. This movie will be hilarious to nitric oxide or maybe just drunk.
