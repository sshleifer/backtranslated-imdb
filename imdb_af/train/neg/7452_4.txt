For me, this movie just fell on his face. The biggest problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer. I don't know if it is similar or simply his attitude, but I doubt Glover could ever portray a convincing villain. He's a good guy, and it's always obvious in his performances. Otherwise, the film is your career in the mill-row killer story. Nothing very innovative.
