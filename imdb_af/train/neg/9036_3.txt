I can't believe I'm wasting my time watching this garbage! I did because Leonard Maltin gave it an AA rating, and for TV movies it is usually a reliable indicator of good quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> The acting was OK, but whoever wrote it should be denied access to any medium of communication. The plot is ridiculous, the motivation of the "bad guys" completely absent, and the various family interactions are stupid and level. For example, Dad preaches that the violent reaction to aggression is BAD, but he seems to be an "admirable" person, NOT because of his philosophy "ignores the idiots", but because he is pretty good at his fists. <br /> <br /> The only message I could get from this porridge was that the nuclear family is good and alternative living arrangements are bad. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
