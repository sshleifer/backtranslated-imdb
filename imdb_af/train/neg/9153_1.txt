I've never posted a review, but I had to do it for this movie! This film is so bad, I tried to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. But it is not. This is truly, unconsciously BAD. This is a serious effort that flourishes gloriously. Other reviewers have shown the many flaws of the movie, so I'll try not to repeat it, but I encourage you to watch this movie. Throughout I was either speechless, literally screaming with disbelief or on the floor in hysteria. I didn't have much fun watching a movie in years. In fact, I'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it's the kind of movie to share. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - If Arthur auditions will be a bit -The boy (his dance is incredible). - The free neck (the director / chief actor just had to get a naked shot.) - The clergyman's office with his cardboard and chalk image of Christ - Of course, the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings (which story feature plays it?)? - The ex-wife's wrestling match with Ben to own her gun - The detailed order in which Arthur kills the preacher He multiplies him with this incredible match. Yes, the gay religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashions. And my favorite, the use of Joplin's "The Entertainer" as the opening soundtrack and Pachebel's Canon in D Major "as the closing soundtrack! - the list goes on and on - A MUST SEE !!!
