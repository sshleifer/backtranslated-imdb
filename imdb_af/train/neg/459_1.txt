I was looking for a cute, simple comedy to pass the time, but choosing this movie was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I can't write a good thing about it. First, the writing is stupid and not funny at all, and relies on tired, recycled jokes and a turtle for laughter. It's not funny in my book, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Low budget effects (if I can even mention effects) with horrible cinematography. In many places it almost feels like an indie movie shot with no money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I feel sorry for the actors. Is Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate for money they agreed to participate in? Despite the outfits, Pamela shows her age and as a whole they are not even so sexy, let alone funny. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even in the bad-it-funny category. It's just bad, as if everyone was involved, was sick. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
