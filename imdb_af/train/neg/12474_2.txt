I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and so loved the movie - even "undefeated" - that I decided to watch the whole series of "Deathstalker" movies. I bought myself and II and laid for a laugh. <br /> <br /> Nothing about "Deathstalker I" was funny at any level and when the credits rolled, I was embarrassed and sorry I bought it! Too much ugliness and nudity. I think "DS 3" was a much cleaner production or MST3K really edited because I expected something similar, ie stupid and careless and simple. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99 it was a waste of money. I didn't even open "DS 2" because I will return it tomorrow. Now I'll probably just throw this DVD because I can't give it back and nobody wants it - including myself! So really, don't bother with this one. Even the nudity (much of it, VAT) is uninspiring and icky.
