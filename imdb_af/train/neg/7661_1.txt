The title of worse movie of all time is one that is quickly and often handed out. Most of the time it is exaggerated by the fact, but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the shortlist of real candidates: Outer Space Plan 9, Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash's Adventures. <br /> <br /> As I watched the 90 minute drill, I found it hard to stay awake even while trying to laugh at the movie. But unfortunately I felt alone in the dark (I wanted to try to avoid the word, but I couldn't resist it) while looking around and hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Alas my friends and I had to offer comedy throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about the action and the consequences, as it should be the only positive part of the movie. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens (they even call them Xenos), and the creatures in Pitch Black. It can in itself become invisible (and I assure you it is random) and is lightly injured. Also present are small millipedes used to control people who turn them into something that looks like a zombie. All of these were shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and impossible to follow. People randomly shoot at a blue screen stage or empty set for samples placed in the post. Light flash quickly on a dark screen that burns your pupils from overwork while leaving bad rock music in the background. <br /> <br /> These were the highs. The story about a paranormal investigator (Slater), whose idea of ​​looking difficult, carries a black woman, with a trench thread and not shaving for 2 days. An archaeologist (Reid) who is rather incapacitated. And a government agent (Dorff) whose lines involve barrage. All three must be ashamed of their actions (not that they have ever done a good job) and the deciding director must be ashamed. Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the film. The movie features the single most uncomfortable love scene I've ever seen on the film between the two. <br /> <br /> Then comes the plot. Quietly, the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. The rest is unsightly illogical. The plot holes can contain the collective egos of all three stars. The movie begins with text and a voice explaining the back story. This opening lasts more than a minute and even though the viewer knows they are in something terrible. This revelation story is later repeated by the rest of the film adnausem in the awkward dialogue in a very clumsy and heavy-handed way. And the end didn't make one ounce. Not only did it make sense in the world of the movie, but it didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally the direction of one of our Bolls. Disgrace, that's all that can be said. She shakes off the camera to simulate tension. His lack of direction with the actors. Just look at Reid in scenes in which she is not the center of the shot. The complete waste of special effects applies to bullet effects. And finally choose to use voice over to explain something that should be painful to the viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid a $ 1.50 to see this show at a second race theater. And while the laughter provided me and my friends with it worth every quarter, I would recommend people to avoid paying more for this movie. Grab about 3 friends and split the rents and tear this movie a new one. <br /> <br /> Shame your Uwe. Sorry for you, Tara Reid. Shame on your Christian Slater. Sorry for your Stephen Dorff. Shame on anyone associated with this movie.
