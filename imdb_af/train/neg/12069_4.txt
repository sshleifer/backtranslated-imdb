A Grade Z Terrorist Carl Monson was one of the most productive directors working on the low-budget gory mayhem. His movies are full of indifferent gore, ridiculous acting, boring sub-sudden and fierce dialogue. " A mysterious black clothes figure is cruelly murdered guests staying in the family home. Unfortunately, this movie is almost bloodless. You don't actually see the murders except with shadows and some blood puffs. The tempo is fun and the plot is rather uninteresting. The play is merely skilled, but the lack of gore and mutilation disappointed me. A Pleasant 4 out of 10. Be careful: Don't miss Monson's movie with Andy Milligan's equally poor "Legacy of Blood".
