It must be the worst direction I have seen. The close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when every scene consists of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has a very beautiful scenery to work with, the backdrop of Mexico, the canteen, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty towns of Costner on his journey of revenge. Unfortunately we only get a quick glance at these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a huge, huge head. Even the transit stations where Costner travels across Mexico alone, quickly cut into a close-up. <br /> <br /> The score is excessive and intrusive, and dictates every emotion we need to feel. The story itself had to be handled much better. Too many people come out of nowhere to help Costner together - it's just bad writing. <br /> <br /> This is a typical story story, but many others have taken the same approach and done great things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a somewhat similar story, but it was a much better movie. <br /> <br /> The end was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic score of the movie. This movie will never be good, but if we saw more of Mexico and less giant heads, this movie could be watchful.
