I only got hold of Marilyn Miller's films recently, as it is not shown on the UK TCM. I was very intrigued over the years because it was one of the superstars of the 20s. What was she really like For some stars of this era like Jolson some of the magic still shines through, but not for Miller. Her dance seems uncomfortable and poorly choreographed, her singing is somewhat limited and as an actress she makes Ruby Keeler look like Hepburn. Even worse in this movie if the public got tired of musicals, almost all the music numbers were wiped out. So we were left with a comedy of that period with little direct appeal. They paid $ 500,000 for this! That is why I have only two conclusions. Either she was poorly served by the theater or she had no talent at all. I think the truth is closer than the previous one.
