It was a strange kind of film about a low life in New York City and centered on a main character (the title name, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he is a Ricky Nelson-type musician, except he has no real talent do not have. . <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to watch until an ominous, difficult New York City woman with a terrible accent enters the picture. It ruined the movie for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays hard and rubbish-free women. <br /> <br /> The haircut on Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to watch. I can play Johnny Depp better to play this role. One last note: It's strange to hear a movie made in 1992 (except Woody Allen's) with just unanimous sound.
