A trio of low-life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, blow a late-night break. They flee, but quickly cross roads with the police just happening in the pursuit of a terrorist. Of course, the police fail the terrorist gangster, the real terrorist gets away and the burglars are forced to take shelter in a small dive, take hostages, unaware that police are planning to catch them. And guess who else chose the bar as a sanctuary for the night? <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolutely. And it goes down from there. Spacey has a good bit of active talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, and M. Emmett Walsh, but they were all wasted. Mostly because all the characters are jammed in the bar, everything they do is for the rest of the movie. Endless and purposeful. Long before the end of the movie you stopped making a damn about what happened to them.
