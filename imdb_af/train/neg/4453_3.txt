I'm sure people are watching this move outside the British. This movie will be an entertaining watch, but for a United Kingdom it is painful in the mistakes. <br /> <br /> Right at the start of the movie, Elijah Wood comes out of a tube at the bank station, which is dismantled. He says to his sister whom he meets, "What happened here" and she replied, "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday!" Tottenham is already in town. They are part of the town, they don't have to go there! And if Tottenham fans want to fight other fans, the last place on earth is what they want to do, Bank Station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. There are several other similar faults, but the biggest failure for me is the actor who plays the main schoolgirl. He clearly decided it wasn't worth talking to an East End accent and rather chose a Dick Van Dyke style that bleeds my ears. This was highlighted by the fact that the rest of his gang spoke to everyone in the way you expected the West Ham fans to speak. This mistake made him incredible and really spoiled the film.
