Based on a confident novel by one-time girl friend and group of F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck continues in shameless surplus as a strong drunk or convicted alcoholic; in contrast to the soft and well-grown true Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writers, late in life, the highly-crafted writer indeed lived a quiet life and fought his alcoholism effectively in a time when AA was not yet known. Fitzgerald was not too proud to regain his flapper stories to support his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Life in a small apartment and a second hand Chevrolet depicted his life 180 degrees different from this movie. <br /> <br /> Virtually every 20th Century Fox movie made during Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, as well as virtually every movie directed by Henry King, was a work of excellence. Beloved unbeliever was the exception.
