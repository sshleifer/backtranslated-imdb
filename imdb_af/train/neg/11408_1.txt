It was just awful. I read this book for the school, I did as on all the tests and saw it that way! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to see it, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, outer space plan 9 and Hudson Hawk together. The thing that made this movie so terrible was enough to kill yourself. First, it was made on Hallmark. Secondly, the acting was terrible. Third, it was quite different from the book. Literally, it was so bad, I asked myself to apologize. Basically, I'd rather see Basic Instinct 2 than seeing it. Take my advice, don't see this movie. Nobody wants to see it. It was terrible. Terrible!
