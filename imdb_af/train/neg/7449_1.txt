Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in story line, too short, appear low budget. Hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some screens, Lorna seems to have a cold sore on her upper lip. I'm sure make it best to hide it. I think they didn't want to film until it cured, sorry. Probably, why did this movie have scenes. Just one disappointing kiss scene at the end. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and must be told. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much nicer and more truthful in the book.
