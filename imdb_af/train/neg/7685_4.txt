Confused melodrama taken from a William Gibson story, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark heads up a beautiful, exciting rural nerve asylum, where his loose wife with self-appointed Queen Lillian Gish battles and Widmark herself gets the bright eye for staff newcomer Lauren Bacall, who brings her life back to the death of her husband and child. Passionate and confused, in a peaceful time and place, and with a "David and Lisa" love story hidden in the gentle morass. Widmark and Bacall have good chemistry together, but this writing doesn't matter. For exactly an hour, most of the dialogue has to do with the curtains hanging in the library (this thread is not used as symbolism, but rather a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture is hoping to show the loggerheads that different people come to when they work in the same profession, and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately the roundabout that Minnelli unraveled is not informative, enlightening or entertaining. ** of ****
