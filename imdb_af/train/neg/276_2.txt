The characters are clicked and predictable, with anyone who is either snowy or completely angry. The acting is too stilted because it is bad in an amusing, top-of-the-way way. It's double disappointing if you're a Bette Davis fan, because her character is not a typical fun Bette-Davis-type character; she only gets a little frown. <br /> <br /> Overall, my wife and I didn't find the movie to be interesting, either at all or not at all.
