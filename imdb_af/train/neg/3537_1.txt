Was the world convinced he didn't exist. <br /> <br /> It is a line that is likely to be remembered by many people. Of course, these are of the usual suspects regarding Kaiser Gold. I mean Sose. <br /> <br /> I had such a second: The stupid trick a director ever drew, tried to convince an audience that he actually had a storyline <br /> <br / > This movie is one of the saddest movies I've seen in a long time. It starts out as well, with a lot of fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very clever premise. But unfortunately, the only way this movie is headed is on a course of self-destruction. And it doesn't, not with a single slap, but with a little bit of cuffs. <br /> <br /> Don't pay attention to the comments here that are surprising that they found a way to explain this donut. With enough alcohol in my brain I would probably be able to explain the existence of man to a very credible degree. I saw and read about a dozen completely different ways that explained the story. And they range from a story that is completely in someone's head, with chess with himself, in a cunning way for a criminal to play his enemies out of chess games. <br /> <br /> And it's all booming. But at the same time, it's a painful giving away that something terribly wrong with this story. And anyway, it's a blunt outcome of a score of movies and books such as Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle. And we're not talking about similar loans here. , it's a blatant robbery. <br /> <br /> What goes wrong in this movie is that the storyline turns like a drunken bum on speed. If this movie was a rollercoaster ride, you would have crashed in. The attraction next door is shortly after. There are so many twists in this movie that will never be solved. If it were a sundowner, you would need a bucket of buckwheat to work on the drinks. Nothing is ever explained. And if you finally get a little grasp of the direction you think it is going, you are caught up with another. <br /> <br /> I don't think this story was anywhere on paper and Ritchy thought it was great to make a movie anyway, the next David Lynch or something. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or completely violate your own work (Ritchy: seek professional help). What could easily have been a jewel is instead a cut piece of art, and food for pseudo-intellectuals to debate with debate clubs on Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Save your soul and stomach, avoid at all costs!
