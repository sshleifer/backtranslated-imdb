"A Town Called Hell" (a town called Bastard), a British / Spanish co-production, was made on the heels of Clint Eastwood's success in the Italian "Man With No Name" trilogy. The template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors, whose careers were largely in decline and voiced their voices. This movie is no exception, except because they also used British players. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to summarize the plot, but here it is. The story begins with rebels or whatever, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau who beat a church and kill everyone inside, including the priest. Fast forward to the professional village, a few years later, where the Shaw character as a priest is busy. The Mayor of the town (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who does not think of measuring justice with his gun. <br /> <br /> Throw in the mix of a sad widow Alvira (Stella Stevens) looking for her husband's killer. Add to this the fact that she is driving in a hearse lying dead as in a coffin because God knows why. After the mayor was killed by his maid La Bomba (Al Lettieri), a federal colonel (Landau) invaded the town in search of a rebel leader. I'm sorry, but the name escapes me. The colonel took over the town and began to execute the townspeople to force them to reveal the identity of the leader. <br /> <br /> Although they open the movie side by side, it's hard to tell the dialogue the Landau and Shaw characters know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does it and .............................................. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the principals have regretted making this movie. It's just awful and deserving of my dreaded "1" rating. Shaw spends most of the film that fixes his trademark. Even Landau can't save this movie. The beautiful me. Stevens was also completely wasted here. After just making Peckinpa's "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" last year, I found it strange that she would appear in this junk of a movie. Savalas made several of these photos, during the pre-Kojak period ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express"). Michael Craig is also somewhere in it as a character called Paco. <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appears in many of these "westerns", though he would appear to play the villain in the two "French Connection" films. Al Lettieri will also appear in a role in "The Godfather" (1972) and go to other unforgettable roles before his early death in 1975. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, the version I watched only ran for 88 minutes. rather than the longer run times of 95 or 97 minutes listed on IMDb, but I can't see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes will make a difference. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one.
