In 1454, the wizard Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) was dissolved in France and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) was tortured to death by witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the following generations of their warders. In the current days (in the 70's), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a sanctuary where they are the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade, a property of Hugo's family in the countryside, to seek out a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the enemy owns them, brings Mabille back to life and carries out the inhabitants in great sacrifices. After the death of her father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he hid the Thor's Hammer amulet in a pit; with Maurice they try to defeat the demoniac Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs from Paul Naschy per US $ 9.98; Despite having no references, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a trash B (or C) movie that immediately reminds me of Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is revealed by horrible script, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition and with many naked women. The result is simply hilarious and I can assure Ed Wood's style is back. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
