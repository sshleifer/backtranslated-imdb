Whatever the rating I give to BOOM is just because of the excellent location of photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, it's just for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (her downward phase), and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote: "The Milk Train doesn't stop here." And it's supposed to be much of this adaptation of his play - but he was apparently the only one. Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money. <br /> <br /> Whatever the case, it's a hill beans with Taylor rushing in her shrill way and exploding on the servants and talking bad baby with less than NOEL COWARD which seems to be a visitor another movie when he finally appears. <br /> <br /> It is such a champion that it is likely that Taylor fans are considered a "must see" kind of thing. But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you are far from me. Unfortunately, this is the movie that means that Taylor's end is taken seriously as a movie actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a BOMB. Rate yourself if you dare.
