Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and misses something in her life. She enters a Miss France match against her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia) and she wins. She goes away for the Miss Europe title that her boyfriend leaves behind. She won again but returned to André because he asked her. Once again, her life becomes commonplace one night, she writes a letter to him and leaves the fame that awaits her as Miss Europe. André follows her. <br /> <br /> This movie is a quiet movie with a piano music track throughout. It is also thrown up so that everything looks fast. A limited dialogue was later added and it is very ominous. The cast is well aware that it is a silent movie. The best part of the movie comes to an end, but the story goes too long. After watching it, I'm not really sure what the big problem was about the appearance of Louise Brooks - she has a horrible hairstyle that looks like her face. I don't have to look at it again.
