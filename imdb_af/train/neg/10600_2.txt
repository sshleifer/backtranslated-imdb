I'll be honest. The only reason I watched this one on TV is that it is in the IMDb bottom 100. And now I wonder if the hour and a half of my life is another check on the same list. <Br /> <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who finds himself on a great battle with the Universal Soldiers after the computer pulled a "HAL" to defend him. And yes, after all the compulsory explosions, shooting and chasing, he's the last one. Combined with horrible acting and a bit of a boring set-up, make sure the place in the notorious list is just. <br /> <br /> Only for the idiots like me who want to see that full list. 10/02.
