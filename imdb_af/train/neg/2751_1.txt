I hate even wasting the time it takes to write 10 lines of this cruelty. Hyung-Rae Shim is fortunate that bad filmmaking is not a capital crime, or he will be killed twice for writing and directing this disaster. I'm surprised this movie had a $ 75m budget but actually stays in the sense that it was such a huge flop that hopefully Shim will never make another movie the rest of life anymore from filmmakers time. I would think the actors would have come together and made him line. <br /> <br /> With the available resources, a good movie could be made with this budget. As usual, the failure at the beginning had to be seen with the terrible writing and story. "Transformers" was another poorly written visual festival, but it looks like "Citizen Kane".
