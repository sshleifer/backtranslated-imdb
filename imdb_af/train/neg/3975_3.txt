1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley ride with a few kisses. It seems to me that the girls are getting tired of these things and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to act and go there own ways. In this episode of their adventures, they are interns in Rome for a "fashion" designer who places them straight into the mailroom to learn about hard work. It's all about (I think ..). In addition to the typical flirtations with boys, there is nothing but the Rome scenario to about Â¾ in the movie when it is finally revealed why they are dismissed, then re-appointed, then dismissed and then re-appointed. It is definitely made by people who do not understand the corporate world and show it in their interpretation. Perhaps the real world is their next adventure (if there is one.). Even my kids don't look like this boring "adventure" in make-believe. Let's see they probably only have a few years to their legal adults. We'll see what happens then.
