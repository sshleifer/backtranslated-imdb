I think the biggest disappointment in this movie was that I expected the acting instructors to break into the cast and apologize for the weakness of the acting. Considering the powerful subject, the brilliant scenery and the attempt to create a wonderful set and spectacular images, it is a pity that little attention was given to acting. <br /> <br />
