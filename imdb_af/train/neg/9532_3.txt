So, this man named George is sitting alone on his birthday when two women arrive. George's wife is in a hospital and takes care of their son. When the woman is gone, George gets into the whirlpool and makes her love for both girls. It's not that big of a scene, because it shows nothing. Then wake up the next morning and the girls are still at his home. They make him nice breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to demolish them, but when he comes home, the girls are still at his home. The girls had enough with old George and didn't want to cook for them anymore. They are both great psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked the girls just doing what they wanted and messing George's house. George wasn't really good for his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he didn't really see it. George looks like Tom Tucker on Family Guy. I was all the time for the two girls.
