It may be one of the worst movies ever to make it. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the start, where the man walks ... and walks ... and walks (spoiler). There are about 15 minutes to just walk. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention, there are many problems with the lighting, and it's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was terrible. They seem to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then taken the people turned away. <br /> <br /> For the love of everything, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, apologize to them. The director must be subject to the war crimes tribunal to bring it to the public.
