What can I say about seven pounds. Well, I watched a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and because the flight was long and boring, the movie certainly didn't help. Will Smith's character, Ben Thomas, be almost unlikely even with his end deliverance. The movie's two hours plus run time wastes most of the screen time with random rubbish ironing the plot as fast as possible. In the movie defense, Rosario Dawson's character adds a little to the movie, though not much. I don't understand how anyone could actually cry during this movie, all I wanted to do was turn it off. Will Smith also kills himself with a jellyfish at the end, proving that you are being killed with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.
