What a terrible show. Science fiction fans seem to be watching anything any more, regardless of quality. It shocks me that something extraordinary like Firefly lasts one season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake rinses. This spider is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The acting is young and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clips of everything that was ever in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than a first-time soap opera. The direction is slim and the sets are awful. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is one turn that should never have been made.
