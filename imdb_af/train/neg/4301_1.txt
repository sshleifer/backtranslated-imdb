I stayed one night and got very bored at about 02:00 so I deliberately flung through the channels and at H.B.O. where this "classic" plays. Initially I was lucky to catch something at the beginning, but my luck faded about two minutes into the film. The whole movie centered on an unattractive man who had fear of women, four beautiful but empty apparent women who worked as a waitress at his uncle's dinner, and his very fat and extremely unhappy cousin who also works at night. There are some strange twists in this movie that make it slightly interesting, but definitely not worth watching. Basically, if you have nothing to do a night or just sleep, medication works much better. But guys there are very skin, so it may be good to watch with no sound, but even that can be irritating
