This movie is very important because I suggested this consideration. Sometimes you can be sick. Sometimes you can have a syndrome. For example, sometimes you may have Goldfield Syndrome. I don't remember this boring movie ... and most importantly you don't remember Adam "superfluos" Sandler. Sometimes you just rented another movie. <br /> <br /> My voice? 3 out of 10. My suggestion? If you are not a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... this is a joke, Adam Sandler doesn't exist ... I want to hope), save yourself ... Someone to to save? Drew Barrymore. ... maybe.
