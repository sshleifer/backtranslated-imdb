As a neighbor's summer camp watching home movies, Indian Summer is an intriguing drill. Eight alumni campers are barely introduced, when incredibly boring flashbacks start for characters, we know nothing. Beautiful actors, Alan Arkin, and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this movie. One camper's observation that "everything looks so much smaller than I remember" is repeated at least ten times, enough to let you squirm. The expected pranks are not funny or original unless you think short sheets are a real "villain". This movie was a great disappointment in view of the great talent involved. "Indian Summer" didn't make me homesick, just sick. - NOTE
