I caught this movie on Sci-Fi before going to work. If you're interested in seeing Dean Cain dive and avoid being at least a dozen times in flames, this movie is for you. If it doesn't boast your interest, well, I'm afraid you would wish you were the one to be wrapped in flames, because this movie is pretty bad. The acting, to begin, is terrible, terrible, terrible. The characters are all completely silly, and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z-grade, Sci-Fi movie. By the end, the movie reminded me of 'Hollow Man' (complete with escape through the elevator), except with a dragon, not a naked, invisible man. Unlike other similar movies, this one wasn't even very bad. It's just bad.
