I didn't see the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who was rubbing her over: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or return to warn me not to see it. <br /> <br /> I'll give it two positive nods: The cage's sarcasm's character has at least some laughter from me and the landscape of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here are the tracks. The movie's plot is only driven forward because other characters will not give straight answers to Cage - and he sets it up! How it can last for more than an hour of my time (much less days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How someone could read this book and think, "Yes, people have to pay $ 11 to see this shadow of what a movie should look like." Is outside me. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. Or even rent it on DVD.
