The acting was terrible and they both had sports crime. Not only did they get the skate rights wrong, but also rules of GIRLS-Ice Hockey. In GIRLS ice hockey you can't look. You don't even block someone. Not everyone who is their girls is disgusting and gross. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to school like the one in the movie. Also, not all hockey players hate figure skaters. Many current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. We also skate much faster than the one in the movie. I was ashamed of the movie that gave people the idea that we were sucking ... although I have to mention that it is difficult to switch between sports because of the scene on the skates. Of the twirly moves KAtelin did on the ice that you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. She basically challenged the unlawful person. It is also unrealistic that she will get a HOCKEY scholarship when she skate figures. It really made me angry that the bursary would normally be used for someone who could benefit the team.
