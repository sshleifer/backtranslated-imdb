It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot and the message are terrible. There are too many mistakes in this movie that it is impossible to quit. I don't even understand how this movie can get any nomination, let alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee depicts a malicious / irrational detective caused by his father's disappointment. Advantages: He is angry. Disadvantages: When it comes to the explanation scene, he cannot convey the sadness / disappointment he has in his father. The crying scene was too fake and he seemed to literally express tears from the corner of his eyes. <br /> <br /> 2) To link the movie to the title, there were barking or dog sounds during the battle scenes and rape scene, which was completely irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand it's supposed to be a metaphor or not ... but it's just stupid! 3) WHY THE HOOK DIDN'T HAVE THE COUPLES BEEN TAKEN THE KILLER? What's wrong with this movie. When the murderer began to stab an officer, SHOOTED him. He's already dead! What is the heck? There were many opportunities to kill the killer, but I don't know why he wasn't! 4) During the scene where the girl hurt her foot. In the scene it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt, so how about the next scene that she lends all her weight to her left foot? And this is the actress nominated as the best new artist? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are not synced. <br /> <br /> 6) I suspect this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in South East Asia, so why win the bad man and then the police joined the battle? 7) This movie is just too violent without a purpose. Cops beat CI to a pulp and then, if they work together, do they give their dagga and boil? It's generally the worst movie. I really feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadistic and sick person. I've never seen a more disgusting movie throughout my life. WORST MOVIE EVER!
