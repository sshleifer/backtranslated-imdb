This is a complete Hoax ... <br /> <br /> The movie was shot in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; The entire writing is Hindi language used in India. The ride through is on typical Jaipur streets. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmakers in their (about the movie) in DVD Bonus seem to sound like they are shooting their lives in Kabul and the surrounding area. Almost all their action scenes are shot in India. The scene where they set fire to a group is so false that they didn't even think of changing it to the Afghan national anthem. They only recorded the Rajasthani folklied. How do I know this because I traveled extensively around that area. They're just on the bandwagon to raise the issue. I challenge the filmmakers to deny it.
