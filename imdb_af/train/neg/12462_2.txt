I saw this movie last night and followed very good reviews from many sources. I want to point out that if you are not ready to try to work out who is who and what it all means, you will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I still struggle to understand the role of the actors In this film, the film is made up of different stories and doesn't allow you to really empathize with any of the roles. <br /> <br /> For political buffalo and those interested in corruption in other world governments, this movie is probably very good, but for the average movie keeper this movie is uncomfortable, very boring in places and you will confuse the theater annoyed that you paid the access fee. <br /> <br /> See if you're ready to focus 100% on every minute detail or politics interest you. Don't see it if you really like watching movies.
