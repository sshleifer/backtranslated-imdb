I see that someone has already thought of a similar analogy, which was similar to the first thing that emerged after watching this movie. They said the ingredients were there, but there was no plot. Besides the sexual scenes that bordered on child pornography (which I feel could be worked out or more suggestive in nature, rather than graphically, I would compare this movie to a half-torn recipe. It's like being handed over. A list of ingredients, without instructions on how to put it into a final product. From the beginning, character development and story development are lacking. .. finally we will find out more about WHY this scene is going on ... or ... WHO this character is ... or maybe we will eventually get to know and appreciate this character ... or understand and touch more involved in this inter-character relationship ... etc. "But not so much luck! On the contrary, I was often tempted to eliminate it more than once but stick it out when the root has disappeared, just to find that which mini-plot is inside e Hatever mini-plot (and poorly presented) was just a ruse. Why did I stick to the end is a mystery, unlike IFC's better choices and they gave it 2-1 / 2 stars (another riddle). It's not that the characters are not equal to some degree, or that you can't identify with them or their humanity at all. It's just that it could be so much better with just a little more effort. I see it's shot around Santa Cruz and find myself wondering if it's someone's film school project. I wish I could have given it a better overview, but frankly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of half an hour.
