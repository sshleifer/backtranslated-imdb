This film is justly known as one of the most terrible examples of propaganda ever made. The persistent comparison of Jews with diseases is simply <br /> <br /> pathological. And even worse, it becomes almost secondary credible through its repetition. The fact that something this rough work, even <br /> <br /> briefly, is an object lesson in itself. You must have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through, and I would not recommend trying unless you have a good reason.
