I saw the movie tonight at a free preview show, and despite the fact that I didn't pay a dime to watch this movie, I still chopped off. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this movie, you leave a Benjamin on your seat. The play is torpedo at its best; Kiefer Sutherland phoned in his worst impersonation of Jack Bauer and Michael Douglas looks like he had made a bad choice that Catherine Zeta-Jones had left for the time it took to shoot this turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-entity; She looks as if she is reading her lines of a teleprompter. And if you can't see the "mole" within the first 20 minutes, you just landed on this planet from a world without TV and recovered story lines. If you really want to see a good secret service thriller, rent In line of fire. If you see and buy in this one, you will start to fear the president's security because the Secret Service looks and acts like the big versions of the types from 90210. No matter what your feelings about W are, let's hope it "art" does not live after life.
