I started this review with a huge giant spoiler about this movie. Don't read further ... here it comes, prevent your eyes! The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other slasher films, is murdered here. There I saved you just 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> It's one of those cheap movies thrown in the mid-slasher era of the 80's. Despite the death of the heroine, it is just substandard junk. <br /> <br /> Both priests and colleagues get a bad rap here. They are portrayed as exaggerated, sociopathic morons who have too many internal problems to deal with what looks like the junior university campus life ... and college students are getting worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is just to put your video recorder in if you can't do anything better, even though I suggest looking at your headphone band, it will be more fun. <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gore, profanity, very short female nudity, and sexual references. <br /> <br />
