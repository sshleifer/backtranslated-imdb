"Intensive Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made. These extremely inexpensive Dutch bracts offer a bit of gore and very absurd situations. A horror veteran George Kennedy is totally wasted as Professor Bruckner. abysmal, the action is slow and the climax is laughing. A famous surgeon has a car accident. He spent seven years in a coma and then he woke up and went on a bloody rampage. Intensive care is clearly influenced by American slasher films including the "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" series. The murders are hilarious and the dialogues are painfully stupid. Sometimes when you're in the right mood, you can give this piece of garbage. You will laugh until it hurts with this one - you can believe me!
