It can be a pretty entertaining movie, but instead it is with other duds like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the movie-kettle. If they played this brand new cheek, it could be a very entertaining movie, like Re-Animator or Dead Alive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays the tongue-in-the-cheek in places, but straight more often. <br /> <br /> The premise of this movie is a small community besieged by mutated snails. There is an abandoned poisonous waste landfill near a sewage line that mutates the snails in aggressive samples of carnivorous specimens - although samples that move slowly and can be cut below your boot. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people willing to fight the snails while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laugh-riot - unintentional about it - scratching your head on how silly (actors and screenwriters) the scenario of the destruction of snails is. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (No new ground Simon seems to be playing the gore elements in the cheek, but the dialogue is straightforward. If Simon worked with a clever manuscript - one with many one- liners and eccentric characters, it can be a cult film.) <br /> <br /> Violence: $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ A lot of horror movie viewers are here in full swing. You also get bodies of people picked clean by the snails and numerous snail masking scenes). <br /> <br /> Acting: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this writing is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression indicating he knows how outrageous this movie is. Kim Terry, as his wife, does a decent job, though she does a little beyond the keep-your-face-while-your-shout bit.The "teens" were all horrible actors - no exceptions. movie could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) NUDITY: $$ (Two teenagers get naughty in bed before being sent in a poorly-formed scene - through a horde of snails creeping into the girl's bedroom. female nudity here).
