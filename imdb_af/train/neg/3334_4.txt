It scared hell out of me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing than scary, but with some pretty disturbing moments and a kind of messy quality to what I want. And come to think, the plot is actually actually ... but dealing with a kind of taste. If there is a problem with this movie, there are big gaps where nothing exciting or interesting. Also, the end goes on forever, a potentially tense climax seems foolish after a while with Barbara Bach shouting and screaming. The "monster", after being exposed, is also not sorry or sorry. The somewhat lethal appearance of the movie also works, and it looks like a TV movie more than something made for theaters. But this is an example of rarely made movies nowadays, so I urge horror fans to see it and feel a little nostalgic ...
