How did it make such a terrible script to attract this role? Ridiculous, predictable and incredibly incredible, it is well behaved and smoothly directed, but the material is so bad, it still qualifies as one of the all-time worst spulters I've seen for years. Surprisingly bad, and not in a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the cast.
