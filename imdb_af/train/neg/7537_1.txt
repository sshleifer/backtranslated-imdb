And I thought the beach was bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Don't get him guilty of the terrible writing, if anyone can make any sense of what hell was the point of that movie, give yourself a bang on the back. This is a cross between The Village and a crappier script. It's so easy to catch your eye, and if it goes further into the plot, it just doesn't matter, and don't start me over! What was it? The only thing this movie does is Nicolas Cage, usually good humor, and his ability to be funny in the strangest situations. Going to a blocker and it's the only movie to watch, save yourself five bucks and just go back home and burn something and when someone asks you why you just say the dumbest thing in your mind , and there you go!
