By the way, Mr. Foe (originally and more appropriately titled Hallam Foe? I can't see his title character as "mister"), is a tribute to good acting. Both Jamie Bell, such as Hallam, a physically attractive voyeur / creep, and Sophia Myles, as Kate, his kinky partner in sex and fantasy novels, is convincing. The problem comes when you try to link their roles to anything that happens in real life. A young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives like Hallam will be beaten to fairness with fairness. And a woman in Kate's situation will be apostate and scared. She will probably call the police. <br /> <br /> However, these things are not what happens in the movie. Poor Hallam's mother died and his father married a woman with whom he had a relationship. Hi, of course, hates his stepmother and lets him know. She had sex with him. Kate is a kind of employee who places Hallam in a dishwasher and plays sexual games. She looks like his mother's birth. All this ends happily with Hallam to solve his "issues". <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, the drama and brilliant film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, had a similarly optimistic end, with characters getting wiser. And better after tearing each other. The problem is that it doesn't always work like that, especially when nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, the end is probably due to the intensity of the emotional revelation. In Mr. Enemy, the emotional revelation never really happens.
