Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has movies based on one of the darkest days of our country. 911 changed everything. This has changed our perception of security. It has changed our understanding of human and human malice. The most important and devastating, it has changed our world. <br /> <br /> But I can't emphasize how completely repelled, disillusioned, and angry. I'm with the careless, blatant ignorance of Hollywood who wants to make a profitable profit. from death and destruction. This film and those who love it are subject to controversy amidst mouth-to-mouth among filmmakers and critics; It is certainly to be through the mainstream press. Hollywood sank to a new low. Even lower than the lower-down bastards who committed the most barbaric acts of cruelty and unrelenting cruelty. Behind this is everything your Boll. I'm very angry at this movie. How dare they consider the memories of the families of the lost people? How dare they ridicule the lives of the brave men and women who lived their lives to save those who are trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of fraud?!?! How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a sad and tired post-911 world?!?!?! How ... dare they? <br /> <br /> For those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally frightening travesty, I say it with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself if you are a healthy and moral person. Think back to that day, wondering if this film is a shame and dishonesty for the lives lost that day. Think back to the day of the crying out of loved ones. Think back to the day of the lost lives on the two planes. Think back to the further massacre caused by the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think. Remember. Respect the memories of the lives lost at 911 by not seeing this movie at all.
