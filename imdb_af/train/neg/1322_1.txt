.... because if I was, I wished I was crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie - and I'm "generous" that there was even a plot to start. As mentioned before, it is a misnomer on the DVD's cover that Richard Dreyfuss is actually the star. He was hardly in the movie. And if indeed he was "frustrated" as the back cover indicated, he was, it's probably because he said YES should be in this disaster of a movie and couldn't get out of it! The movie really focused on Jared Martin, and what would be his role in the movie, besides the extreme close-ups, was not so big of a riddle about what Gen Barry's role was - or was it. And talking about "big" ... who had the brilliant idea to fit Gene Barry into the Humpty Dumpty clothes, which his pants literally showed on his chin, had to be condemned immediately by stoning this movie. I could go on with how frightening this movie was, of the dialogue that didn't match the "actors" mouth (think Clutch Cargo), the volatile jump from scene to scene (again generous to name the frames of pictures) scenes "), to the lack of a plot .... But if you're in a bad early 70's genre and if you're in Michigan, with nothing but this movie and a box of kids and cat movies, I recommend having a good bottle of wine before you start this strange movie, because you'll be grateful that you can't remember it the next day!
