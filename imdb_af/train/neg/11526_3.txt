I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie I saw "Burning Moon". But while the movie was pretty stupid and dirty, Premutos seems to be playing for the laugh. While admiring how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worth seeing), I constantly struggled not to progress to the next gore scene . Sure, there are gore, and if that's all you want, go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there is an excessive amount of lame comedy and boring story exposition. Many compare it to Peter Jackson's movies, especially "Braindead". But look at what Jackson did on a similar budget in "Bad Taste", it is clear that Ittenbach lacks one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and abundant gore effects, and getting the best out of limited resources - but not the money I paid for it)
