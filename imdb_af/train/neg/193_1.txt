The story of Norman Maclean is a masterpiece; Redford's film is a mediocrity. He added banal scenes of the Maclean brothers over a fall and some of them dated in a cunning bar that didn't even appear in the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, who is trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outside, proves either risible or depressed, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the airplane scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as father and Craig Sheffer as Norman, are strong and masculine, as men would expect earlier. Neither of the women impresses in the film, it is a pity, because Maclean loved and made the women in his story, even poetic.
