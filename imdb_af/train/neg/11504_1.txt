AKA: Mondays In The Sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just looked at. Three men deliberately wander and drink, greeting everything and everyone in their path. It is supposed to be a drama, but what it is is a total waste of film, without a single reasoning quality. <br /> <br /> I have read reviews showing the performances here as "wonderful" and "heroic." "I'm afraid I can't agree unless these men were supposed to come down as the stupidest most ignorant Proto people ever walked. <br /> <br /> All in all, it wasn't a movie It wanders through and loses everyone except the audience. I watched it three times and can't see for me the life of someone in this garbage. There is nothing in it. It's a bit. br /> <br /> It counts a NUTS / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
