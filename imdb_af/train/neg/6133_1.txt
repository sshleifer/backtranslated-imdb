Kurt Thomas stars as Jonathan Cabot is a gymnast who is delivering a special game hunted by a group of ninjas, but these ninjas will not offer a chance, especially since Cabot is a gymnast! Taken as a whole. Gymkata is one of the bad movies, the horrific acting, the terrible writing and the incompetent directing the quality under human standards. This movie is so awful, it really gets really funny. I mean by dialogue like "I know I'll pour them out!" or "Ha !, your door!" only add to the mocking value that Gymkata gets more. In addition, it is (Only) the only movie that is a hero, a gymnast who finds things to swing in the heat of the moment.
