It's hard to say what the worst thing about this show was: the bad acting, poor acoustics of different parts, bad CGI, improper sets of time, poor writing. It would have been nice if the script followed the original story a little closer. There is plenty of tension and good material in Beowulf to provide great material, and a better story line than the writers can come up with. /> And why do you set a strange new weapon like a crossbow that explodes explosive bolts? <br /> <br /> I see that this movie was made in just 21 days. It shows in the lack of quality. I start thinking it is the general (weak) attitude taken by the Sci-Fi channel (and others) when it comes to making movies from classic stories over the past few years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
