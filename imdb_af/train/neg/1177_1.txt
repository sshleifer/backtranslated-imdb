This movie is a complete crap! Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs, it's turbulent and incoherent. I am proud of the plumbing of the depths of 70's sleaze theater from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like being shocked, but I need a coherent story. However, if you watch the horses get you from this movie, it's for you. The saddest part was the lame werewolf suit with the functional cheek. I mean, it's just hard to go through, not to mention, the play is terrible and the soundtrack is badly mentioned. Please, I know the cover is interesting (which looks like a gorilla's hands coming for a woman's bare ass), but don't waste your time or money, because you won't come back.
