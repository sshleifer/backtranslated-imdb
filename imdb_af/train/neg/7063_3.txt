The man made many title designs for a lot of movies and one day he said; I have to choose a cheap scenario, try to put as much title into it as a look (because I'm a title designer) and try to convince people it's actually a movie. One of the worst things I've ever seen is sure. If you got the urge to see good titles, look at some posters, don't waste your time watching it. <br /> <br /> You're ironic, don't you think you've seen the poster? The only part of his project that had to do title work was almost nothing!
