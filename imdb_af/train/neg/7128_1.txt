I am a stupid person for renting the DVD REDLINE. Chicago Photos That Made This Stupid Movie Never Paid Palisades Media Group to Buy Web Ads on Multiple Motorcycles, Including the 16K ALEXA. They tore me on the deal and now I'm out of $ 16,000 and they wasted a lot of my personal time. (Peter's report by Palisades Media) You know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy Movie !!! It sucks and the people behind it are ripoff artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a cast of losers and poor actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
