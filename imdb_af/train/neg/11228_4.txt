The big mistake with the film is his uninspired writing. It pushes back and forth between the vignettes of Betty's story and repetitions of the Klaw short films. While the Klaw creations are being done well, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their entirety. Page Richards, while not a great actress, does a decent job in general. And sometimes she bears a remarkable deal with Bettie. Also, the note has some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothes well done, just like the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y but feel of the era. It was sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the overall look of a lively, retro feel.
