Okay ... it looks so far only the Barman fans responded to this movie - time for a counterpoint. Beware, this heading is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who aren't aware (mostly non-Belgians): Tom Barman, director of this movie, is the foreman of dEUS, one of the best-known rock bands of the late 90's here in Belgium. Basically, they made some very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly became known on the national scale. Then the egos started to hurt and the group basically broke apart, with Barman and a few others left to go and make albums under the die monique. The way it always happens in such cases, the post-breakdown was much slower and less interesting than the original. In 1999 they tried to make an international breakthrough with their album "The Ideal Crash". They presented a very dilute form of their earlier songwriting. They didn't fix it. However, egos were quite large. It seems big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies. <br /> <br /> More often than not, this kind of thing is a VERY big mistake, and this movie doesn't make the exception. And Barman clearly went for * art * on this one, another very big mistake. For one thing, he is a musician, not a film director. For another, dEUS on it is the best made fun and challenging music, but never something close to what I would consider * art *. It shows. <br /> <br /> So what is this movie about? In fact, it tells the story of a lot of totally uninteresting people who are doing equally uninteresting things in Antwerp on Friday, as even more uninteresting things happen to them if they are uninteresting. The characters are shallow, the plot totally useless and the film has no other redeeming features to make for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole movie made me smile (slightly) about 3 times, and actually managed to make a single 5 seconds laugh (not quite hard). Bui? The movie doesn't seem to be any kind of emotion or feeling. Mystery? Well, (* MINOR SPOILER *), the idea of ​​the "windman", which inspires the name of the movie, is as exciting as a banana pepper pizza - not much, and has been done a thousand times before (someone remembers Johny Destiny - one from Tarantino's worst movie appearances to date) (* END MINOR SPOILER *). And good, its * artistic *, so don't expect any kind of real action for all of the past. In other words, except for the few smiles, it tore me out of my shorts. <br /> <br /> So what's staying? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, although it suffers from some of the same problems that other OSTs have shown lately. First, it makes the movie look like nothing more than a commercial CD. Secondly, it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs, which simply doesn't work. In the end, it makes the movie just like an illustration of the songs. And unfortunately, it's Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack that gets the most attention, though it's the worst part of the entire soundtrack, as far as I am concerned. All in all, it's just to show that bartender knows more about music than movies. Camera work is also good, but not something that will make you shout with joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie that made me look was the sighting factor. Since I came from Antwerp, it was nice to play some kind of "guess-the-location" game. However, I will not regard it as a quality. <br /> <br /> All in all, another chance for the Flemish film has lost. I've been up to date lately, the best Belgian movies come from the French part of the country. This is mostly because they have at least something to tell and can tell it in a way that is both sharp and emotional (the brothers Daerden comes to mind). Perhaps the Flemish art film makers should also try it.
