Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in Middleton. The four teenagers form two love triangles. One night in an ominous full moon, they ride on a smooth and winding mountain road. Not properly they look like car in another car and one or more of them are murdered. The ghostly nightmare begins ... Pleasant and politically correct horror movie without gore and nudity. This is obviously influenced by "Carnival of Souls". The cinematography is decent, unfortunately there is zero voltage.4 out of 10-just another instant-forgotten teen-bopper trash.
