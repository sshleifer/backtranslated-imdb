I don't know why I'm taking the time to review this wasted movie. Keeping it long enough in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad or surprising ?? do not. Ultimately, this ultimately results in tight, formal, predictable dialogue and acting. Inside scenes are so loud that you think if the camera is zooming out one millimeter, you see the sound lights. Costumes, hair and sets are stiffened, printed and impeccable. Do we have to imagine that ordinary people lived in Arizona in the early 20th century? Other reviews' comparisons with Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least the director has cast his violence in the context of chaos and chaos. HARD MEN's gore are gratuitous blast squibs of wood impersonations of bad guys with manicured nails. Huh?!? I think Heston thought he might be worth the film. (He gets his head in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he reported this travesty. Do you want to see a movie about the end of the West as we knew it, the end of the West as we knew it? Look again at the SKOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN. THE LAST HARD PEOPLE is a mockery of a deadly to the Western.
