Direction should be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese talk about the work of a shave for Fawlty Towers. He had to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too faint and not funny. The second branch was too tight to be funny. The third was just thin enough to be funny. This kind of attention to detail is missing from "Corky Romano". No matter how embarrassing a comic bit is, it's not stuck, and hasn't been left on the cutter floor. The one value I can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie that somehow escaped in distribution without being restored. <br /> <br /> I've scanned many other reviews here. The number of reviews that price this absolute waste of time reinforces my suspicion that some people are being paid to promote titles. I can't understand how anyone over 9 can rate this title more than 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can't imagine anyone, even those who earn money from it, even evaluate it as much as average. <br /> <br /> It makes me list the 10 worst movies of all time. And hey, I really like the three stooges and can even endure Ed Wood!
