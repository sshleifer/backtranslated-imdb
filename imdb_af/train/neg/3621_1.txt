I hated this show when I was a kid. It was back in the day when children showed characters actually had accents, not just the mere generic General American Dialect we were accustomed to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's were southern. However, like one of the other people, I never understood what the agreement was with the witch who wanted the flute. It was always strange to me, certainly because the flute just irritated me and I wouldn't have bothered to take it away! <br /> <br /> Just a comment about the agreement of Pufnstuf to the early 70's McDonalds commercials that others mentioned: Pufnstuf ripped McDonalds. Noticing McDonald's popularity, the TV show (or rather their creators) chose McDonalds characters for their performance, but when McDonalds declined, the characters changed slightly and passed it as their own. They even hired former employees of McDonald's advertising agency and voice actors to make the TV shows. McDonalds sued and won. Look for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you will find many articles about it.
