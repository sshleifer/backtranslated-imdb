Not sure if I'm referring to those who called it a video nasty or to the director. "Devil Hunter" is probably a bizarre "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a loose combo of superior movies such as "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run." Chick is kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'wild animals'. The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies moving around in Party City-style Halloween costume outfits. And the wilderness ranges from breed to white to Asian to black to Spanish. I suppose Franco just grabbed someone who even looked slightly ethnic for this skirt. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this movie has an ultra-minimal gore, no real fright and a very unnecessary penis. Not fun. I can find something to find in just a crap Italian or Euro garbage film; this one just got short. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, kids.
