Well, where do I start? I think it's very offensive to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie, and I expected it to be a brilliant movie, but I was so disappointed! The acting is terrible, the original Annie came out a few years before my birth, I'm 25 now and Annie is one of my favorite movies. So I was very excited to see Annie 2. The acting was terrible in the movie, were any of the characters original? very poorly written, directed and acted. This is not a movie I would like to see, and any Annie lover, I recommend you not watch this movie, as it will leave you very disappointed. The young girls do not sing badly, but do not compare to the original
