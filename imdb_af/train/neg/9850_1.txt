I felt brain dead, I'll tell you. It's the worst movie I've ever bought. (In my ignorance I thought it was the Peter Jackson movie of the same name). The performances are so terrible that they are laughing. The special effects did not test the time. The writing promotes that kind of TV movie, staring at the mid-range of acting. The cast looked as if they had taken lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they each had one, and stick to it. Plus, I've never been confused by a movie until I sit down to watch it. It's a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration takes place within minutes. Avoid like a pest.
