The First Force (1990) was a horrible film that came out of cheap horror films during the late 80's / early 90's. I found this movie very boring, but extremely hilarious in some parts. This movie has so much sense and credibility that it is not even funny. The fast legal system in this movie makes Texas look poor compared. Lou Diamond Phillips is in his head with this role (he plays a hard-boiled cop) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's most attractive sister) plays a psychologist. Don't waste your time with this one because it's bad. What a minute, I'll take it back. This movie makes a big party movie. Look at the switchblade crucifix pack nun, she has the most beautiful bones I've ever seen on a nun that wasn't in a Jesus Franco nunsploitation flick. Yes! <br /> <br /> It ended an era for L.D.P. His star was decorated and he could not pull flies to a mishap. This was D.T.V. for him a few years later to his "resurction". <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you are desperate.
