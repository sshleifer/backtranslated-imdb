I can't say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever made, because I didn't see every Bollywood movie, but my imagination tells me it's good. <br /> <br /> This film looks like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director, and I believe he was successful in his mission. No A-list actor outside this movie will give the chance to share the same bill as he is for all the humiliation this movie is associated with. <br /> <br /> But let's not just blame the director, there's the filmmaker, who seems to be rehearsing for the amateur home maker of the year award. There is over dramatic score, hoping to take you to the next scene. The lighting man, who had to have a cigarette in one hand and a bulb on the pole in the other, and the hope that the flame burning off the cigarette would add the necessary light to each scene. And of course the actors! Some of them are not newcomers, otherwise everyone can be forgiven here. The ensemble of actors in Aag was created to promote a new beginning and dimension for the repetition of India's most beloved movie of all time, 'Sholay'. One should not forget that these actors were not forced into this film, they are A list and willing participants in something that, in other words, it would have had a high and eager public expectation? So, that is the question, aside from Amitabh (for now), did the other actors really believe their performances even improved the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people will remember his dialogue in this eclipse of a movie? Do not be stupid, of course he did not, it was a demonstration to the public of how much money conversations could be made by actors. <br /> <br /> I really hope everyone is happy with what is really a vulgar effort to regain a classic movie, which only manages to pollute everyone's minds when they look the original.
