It could have been a good episode, but I just had to turn it off. The British representation was terrible to look at. Did the makers ever set foot in Britain for filming? At least foot in England ?? I don't think a British person has given such an accent to a Royal Family comedy box! Also with the 2 English boys. Well, I don't think any English boy has acted, spoken or dressed like any English child in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harry's preteen public appearance. For American filmmakers. There are over 1 country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. That means more than one culture! I can handle some stereotyping, but it was so bad I couldn't see it. Fire looks cool!
