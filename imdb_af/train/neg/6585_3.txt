When reviewing this film, I can only do my basic training in July, August and September 1971 in that garden spot of the Earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana, through my experiences as a weekend writer. Take the High Ground was nothing like I remember the basic training. <br /> <br /> But one should remember at the time that it was down to Korea, but it was a conventional war as we knew it. It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war, where we poured the trolls into an endless pit. The concept was unwelcome at the time, but accepted as needed for the country's defense. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a Korean veteran who has now awarded the state side to train troops to go overseas. The film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the platoon he has to train. They're the kind you'd find in about any war movie of the previous decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I will praise Take for the High Ground is the fact that MGM recognized our army, now an integrated one with the presence of William Hazard as a black yard in the platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times that was a change. <br /> <br /> But I would say that a site like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured from day 1 to its smart mouth. Richard Widmark would not have died or become an eunuch to give Jerome Courtland's trust with a weapon. And by no means would he worry so much about Robert Arthur who was leaving. He just let the MPs go. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas has given the High Ground goodness. But consider it an army-yard film and you can certainly understand why the government has given so much cooperation during the day. <br /> <br /> I remember the drillers have their little conflicts that you could pick up when you weren't worried they would come up for something that was 95% of the time. But it is not that Karl Malden opened Widmark during training before several witnesses under the recruits. Both would have realized that the authority would be undermined, something the army just won't let go of. <br /> <br /> I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground, because I definitely like his talented role. talented director Richard Brooks, even the stupid theme of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, a year earlier for High Noon, fresh from their Oscar. The film actually has an Oscar nomination for best script and story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been Kaufman's lively imagination.
