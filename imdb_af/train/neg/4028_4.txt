It all had a very good movie - good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (mysterious space missile threatens to burn the planet) and lots of stock (as the air force movie of jets fire rockets , it was used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The movie relates to a space missile attacked by the Soviet Union and accidentally diverted into a low atmospheric revolution. At less than five miles and at speeds in excess of 4,000 miles, it outputs a million-degree exhaust, all burned to the ground, including glaciers, Distance Early Warning (DEW) line base and Eskimos. <br /> <br /> Every attempt to destroy the missile fails. <br /> <br /> The first mistakes in this movie appear early. While we don't expect much from low-budget movies, some things can't be forgotten - like some research. For example, both the Soviets and the American fire-anti-ballistic missiles entering the missile with indifferent accuracy. However, the first successful ABM tests were not conducted until March 1961 by the Russians. <br /> <br /> There are too many melodramas. Dr Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin. Parker's character cries and boo-hoos at Loggia's sacrifice as she was on a screen test. Loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman. A scientist (Phillip Pine) makes it so bad that he looks like William Shatner. A bus driver constantly boasts from the end of the world-crap in scene to scene. The only good actor is the movie narrator, played by veteran character Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All this can be overlooked if it wasn't for the timeline. After sending the missile's information to DC, the Pentagon brings in a group of scientists. A general (Larry Kerr) announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes. Then there are discussions by scientists and there is a lethal silence as ambassadors are being sought to see if the missile is an attack by the Russians and is needed as a response. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the military is being completely eradicated. Civil Defense people leave work and go to their stations. Eight million people go out to fall shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids (and we see the whitest New York City I've ever seen, but watch the 50-slice movies that seem to be the standard). The press is kept in the dark for ten minutes. Then, amazingly, a Pentagon man announces that the missile will beat Ottawa, Canada in 51 minutes! All of the above action happened in 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien rocket. He slowly produces a caseload of plutonium, loads it into a jeep and takes it from GS to a distant missile base to put it on a rocket. Along the road he is beaten by a wild driver from the road, breaks down and then he is chased. He eventually gets back the plutonium and drives to the base to arm the missile. Again, all in the same 63-minute time frame. <br /> <br /> The movie also mocks the viewer by making it look like Ottawa can be saved, just to show that men, women and children are getting roasted. The missile is then said to have five minutes to reach New York. Loggia still drives to the base (4 miles further). He gets to the base and the missile, a two-minute countdown is then announced. Already within five minutes. The cities of New York had to be at least scorched. <br /> <br /> By the way, the missile is destroyed if you don't guess. The ABM warpole destroys it with a massive plutonium-based nuclear explosion. Five seconds later, the explosion explodes and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear explosion equal to 100 Hiroshimas on the outskirts of New York City and nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The movie needs all the elements to be a good B movie, but it messed them up. Loggia played his character so well that you didn't mind sacrificing himself in the end. You didn't care about the other characters, not even the smarmy scientist Pine played. The tension that the film had to move together was not physically possible in the timeline (it would not be today, even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very hard to find. As far as I know, it was not released on any medium and for good reason. I don't know if the film was meant to be or was a standard exercise, but there is a scene where the government is sending all the best scientists, military men and businessmen in deep shelters, saying they're too valuable to lose. There is no single woman or minority in the forest. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and he plays a piano briefly. It was worse than "27 days" where a stranger gives five Earthlings the chance to save or destroy the planet, and does not include blacks or Hispanics. <br /> <br /> I'm on a special sci-fi night at Turner Classic Movies and I don't expect it to appear again. If you find a copy of this somewhere, you can set it up on Amazon.com.
