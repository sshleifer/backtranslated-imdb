Revolutions always provide opportunities for dramatic films, as most revolutions are indeed dramatic events. Unfortunately, this movie in drama lacks compensation due to an abundance of boredom. One does not care about winning, losing, dying or living - make it as soon as possible. This is largely due to what is a superficial use of background technology for me. Scenes from Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality over them. They can be done better at a bare stage and leave. One cannot expect the incredible effects of "The House of the Flying Daggers" or "The Golden Compass", but it is a 2002 production. Characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of the inner circle of a scene, so much so that you count the number of times that character enters and leaves rooms. In my opinion, this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into the "paper-mache" revolution of a "paper colle" world.
