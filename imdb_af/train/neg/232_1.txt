It had to be one of the worst movies ever. When Kate pops up and Jed is with a lot of guys and they all start complaining ... so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate ran her hands over the pavement, and she seemed to investigate the texture of the pavement. Andie's play is so bad in this movie - I couldn't call them if there was love for each other. The other 2 women, however, were very good and overshadowed Andie. Anyway, it was such a camp movie. I usually like these movies, but I just couldn't get into this movie. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's play did not help the movie. She is also the gum. Lancome should put her makeup on a putty knife because she looks more glamorous in the commercial.
