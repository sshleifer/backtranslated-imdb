It is not lost - this movie is terrible. I've seen the old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu movies, I'm familiar with the characters and it's serial origin, but it's still just godly. However, Peter Sellers' genius still moves on with his portrayal of Nayland Smith, with echoes of sadness, tragedy and strength stamped by a stoic facade; It's a show I put on Peter Cushing's portrayal of Van Helsing, but in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all Cushing's Dracula movies. If the film was made in the 1960s AVENGERS TV show in a more ceremonial vein like BUBBA HO-TEP, it could have been something special. If you are a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, this is something you should see, but it is a fit for someone else.
