Completely ridiculous "era" movie is just a thin excuse for his extensive, graphic representation of the heroine's relationship with the beast, a monster allegedly appearing every century to rape some women. It's pretty much what he's doing, and the movie's portrayal of the beast is really awful; It's actually a tall man in a coat suit with a mask and a large PVC tube for a hard work that injects large amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I think maybe it's a real attack. However, I am amused by the open shots of horses that have sex in a public square.
