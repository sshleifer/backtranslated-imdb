It must be one of the worst Swedish movies ever made. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that such a bad script is allowed to become a movie and as recently as 2006 show in theaters. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many visible sponsored products. in one movie. It should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why so many famous actors even thought the idea was even visible in a movie like this. If I had any respect for some of the well-known actors in this movie before I saw the movie, this is for sure. <br /> <br /> I heard there was a sequel to this one and I can't understand how it is even possible.
