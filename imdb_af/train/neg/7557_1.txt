This movie was terrible. OK, my favorite movie is "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I was always obliged to be a little bias. <br /> <br /> The plot coincides and throws enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' very dubious. (He's not a virgin, but IS allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things happen that don't make sense and are inexplicable. I'm afraid Mr. LaBute doesn't make a horror movie. (How are two people we've clearly seen in a car blown up and well at the end of the movie?) The cage looks completely corrupted and the character tends to "Rowan!" Cry out. at the slightest noise. The "nod" to the original is annoying, as they are as tough as they are rather than an intelligent tribute. For example, some incidents reflect the original (The girl falls from a closet pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage is looking for the island). Various rules of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffer's original script and shoe hearing. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will do better and more detailed analysis than that, I really can't be bothered anymore about writing this movie. It has no form of dust. Throw it on the scullery with all the other remakes that put the good names of the movies on which they are based (in this case very loosely).
