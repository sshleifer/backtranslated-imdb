Well, I hate Hollywood, but love cinema, so I have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters. And I hoped Vanilla Sky would be good. I was hoping they would keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same, or they would make their own. Well, it was a bit of both, and it sucked. <br /> <br /> It started well. I love Radiohead. I wish there was more of it. But by the end we listen to Good Vibrations at The Beach Boys. Talk about a wide variety of sucks between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe some others, but why, why did they have to GV during the climax. It was more irritating than confusing or blatant. Especially when it has nothing to do with the plot. At least say something behind the songs. Child A = primary. Whatever. <br /> <br /> He also did a refurbishment with the club scene. It was cool. Otherwise, the movie was one big ball of arrogance. As if audiences were getting the movie. The one who would get it read the subtitles, and the rest will not. It's as simple as that. The motivation broke up. I didn't understand the Diaz motivations (didn't they do the Chicken soup before?) And some of the others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise can not act (especially in this type of film [ie Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I understand. Anyway, they were trying to improve the original with a crazy American rock soundtrack and crazy corners and good movie print and shiny processing. It would have helped if Crowe didn't screw it. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment.
