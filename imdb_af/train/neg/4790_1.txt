I ruined this movie. The original Phantasm had such a wonderful atmosphere and secret. Like many seventies abominable leaves, it looked and looked like an uncomfortable, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80's, pumped the action, but maintained this good attention to mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is not terrible. It tends to explain all the strange events in previous films, which reduce rather than expand their power. It lowers shameful images of the first Phantasm such as a cheap recalculation of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this movie that they look more like domestic pests than threatening death bullets. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls floating in the concept. Did anyone - the stickmaster, the DP, the editor, the director - notice or care that they look so nice? Worse still, Phantasm III offers a crowny, infallible joke to the other. How different from the intensity of the first movie. The original Phantasm uses humor to relieve his relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to create countless inexpensive jokes about Reggie's clumsiness: several refer to the movie's "flying balls" ha-ha, oh, I get it, balls. Maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes, but they're on us.
