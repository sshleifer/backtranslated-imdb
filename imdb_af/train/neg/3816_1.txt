It has very bad acting. Bad story lines. Bad characters. You should never see this show if you see it. SIT THIS OFF. Or you'll be for the next 30 minutes. It should never have been broadcast. It's not nice. You should never see it. NEVER NEVER. So, if you ever want to see this show, please do not. Turn to THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh. These are much better family programs. So believe me about this, I looked at it before. and it's honest, and I honestly say, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TV. So do me a favor and never look at this show.
