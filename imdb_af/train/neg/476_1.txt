In converting a book to a movie, it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended show or ideas, rather than completely ignoring the author. Although it is clear that the director had access to the advice of Elinore Stewart's children, it is important to note that the children believe their mother to be a complete liar on the good, enriching, reinforcing experiences of renovating her country. The book describes her life on her and her husband's adjacent residences in the vast border of Wyoming; she chronicles daily adventures with her many friends and acquaintances, although they lived dozens of miles apart. The film, however, takes a standard view of the time it is made, depicting the woman's experience as hard, unforgiving and almost useless. Perhaps the director of his Vietnam war experiences brought him to this movie (as some aficionados of the film said), but it seems to be an ugly excuse to take all the joy and beauty of the book and it in a pale, evil landscape without friends or hope. Don't waste your time with this movie; read the book earlier.
