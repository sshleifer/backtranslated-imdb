This movie is a disgrace to Major League Franchise. I live in Minnesota and even I can't believe they plunged Cleveland. (Yes, I realized when the real Indians were pretty good, and the Twins took their place down the US league, but still consistently.) Anyway, I loved the first Major League, the second, and always looking forward to the third, when the Indians finally went to the series. You can't tell me it wasn't the plan after the second movie was completed. What happened? Anyway, if you're a true fan of the original Major League, do yourself a favor and don't look at this junk.
