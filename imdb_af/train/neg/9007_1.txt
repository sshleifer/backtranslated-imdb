This movie is the worst crazy I have ever seen. I literally had a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie. The CGI was terrible, and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr. Super-Intuitive-I-can-find-anything, except he can't work his own helicopter correctly. The biggest problem was the split screen camera working. I felt like I was watching the Brady Bunch or something, just it wasn't different people in the boxes, just close-ups and different views of the same thing. I can only see that the actors really needed the money, because this movie was not worth the movie it was shot at.
