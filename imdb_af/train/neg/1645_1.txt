I watched this movie last night, and I had to warn anyone else to watch this movie. In a word - don't do it. I feel serious about writing a writer in a Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, that is, every other word was a swear word. I don't have a problem with curse, as in "Good Will Hunting", provided it helps to dig more into the characters. In this case, it was just a hollow banter trying to draw an occassional * gas or a laugh from the audience. The three main characters are all their own unique stereotype, the wall stop, the coffee office, and the 'I'm-Non-Gay-just-in-contact-with-my-female' or-a-push. You just don't give a damn about any of them! They are all level, irreparable losers you want to see lost. For those who dare, this movie has a few funny moments, the very beginning and the end. The toilet / vibrator scene is funny in a sick way "Uh, yes" way. Actually, I would only recommend this movie to my worst enemies.
