Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 (except the R rating), there are very few things to keep here. One or two lines of Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we need to see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can consider her environment, but unfortunately it is. Poor plot. Poor acting. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are bleak. As much as the whole situation is a strange and terrible joke, the meaningful individual embedded situations are all equally terrible. If we consider the action parts, there are incredible action sequences in some movies that make you foolish and there are some that make you feel. This movie contains only the latter type. This leaves a little left. I'm so glad I didn't pay for this. <br /> <br /> Despite any hype, I can read and think, and when I sat down, I didn't expect anything good. I had no expectations but was a little worried to go in. Yet, like a train wreck, one cannot just look away. And even with no expectations, I was lowered. Not bad. Not even so bad, it's good stuff. I'm very tolerant of bad movies, but it makes "Six String Samurai" (which I like) worthy of Oscar. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of CGI'd is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. How it is currently 7.2 is fully mystified. Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voice system is all I can see as answers. <br /> <br /> I can go on, but it's enough to say tonight that I've experienced a train wreck. I have to wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
