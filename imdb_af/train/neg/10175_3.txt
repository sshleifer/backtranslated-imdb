Can't sleep the other night. So I got up, swung on the tube and this movie was on. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers bitten more than they could chew. Just as ambitious in scope as "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump reads like a fairy tale where an extraordinarily happy man leads us through the era. TGMB only relies on tired cliches to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical where actors have to unravel it. Each character's goal was to fill a foolish 60-arch enemy. <br /> <br /> See how we get to know Finnegan: To cherish his black daughter and get a framed picture of MLK. Criminey, talk about heavy hands. Why not just give him a t-shirt that says "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Groovay is not free love, man? Oh no, I didn't have my time." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not square UCLA." Uh, excuse me? There was nothing right about LA in the 60's. Rather than taking the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we just hear this brat bad about how not to go there. <br /> <br /> Can't even remember the black child's name. He was just a prop used to show how racist the other children are. <br /> <br /> Thing is not allowed to be this stocking. Take "Dazed & Confused." See how we are introduced to the soccer hero Randall Floyd. We don't even see him on the soccer field. In fact, we never see him soccer. We were introduced to him in class and invited his nerdish poker buddies to a party. <br /> <br /> In "Dazed" feminism is not a coincidental by-product of a little chick. It's much more organic, more serious than that. It's refined in the ladies' room about a flip discussion on Gilligan's Island. Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some of the hot comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant. I agree! That's why I feel so disappointed with this piece of Baby-Boomer porno stallion.
