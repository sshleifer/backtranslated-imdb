... or an audience. A quick summary .... <br /> <br /> So you have this doctor who is experimenting for a vague reason with stolen body parts. He wants to make transplants perfect, but feels he has to do it in his basement. WTF ??? And then, suddenly, his fiancee unfortunately and comfortably gets her head down in a traffic accident for which he is responsible. Agonizing with sadness, he holds her head in a lasagna pan (or is it strudel?) And pumps it full of "adreno-serum" (sic) to keep it alive. And then she woke up and spoke her head, though her neck was apparently cut at the vocal cords, and she had no lungs, so she couldn't speak, even though she had it. Seems the thankless b * tch doesn't appreciate everything her fianc√© did for her. Just like a woman. <br /> <br /> Then, she becomes sad to holiness as he sees the possibility of digging his beloved's head on the body of the first most beautiful bimbo that he can pick up from the street. Meanwhile, the doctor's assistant, a kind of dime shop Igor, comes in the philosophical arguments, with a telekinetic friendship with the "monster in the closet". Eventually, the screenwriter realized that he could not impress his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues on the audience ad. He kills everyone and presumably goes to the bank to pay the check before the film's financial supporters get the chance to stop paying. on this. <br /> <br /> Did I mention I think it's a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies to stop displaying the modified version without the boring stuff. The face of the assistant with his arm ripped off and chased around the house, without leaving much blood, is just too precious.
