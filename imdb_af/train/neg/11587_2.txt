This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad. It doesn't offer anything in the death department. The one-liners are bad and are not something in a NES movie. Freddy comes out as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worthwhile. The characters are very underdeveloped. All in all, better than the 6th, but still one of the worst movies in the series. My rating 2/10
