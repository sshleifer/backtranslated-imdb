There is a high level of expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy featuring a movie led by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. Those expectations are further promoted when the movie is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so evident in, among others, DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes, or so, it seems that the expectations that can be met and then. Nothing. Which is supposed to be a light comedy, stuck in the lead, heavy-handed melodrama, with a joke. <br /> <br /> Relative newcomer, Suzy Parker, has often been criticized for her performance, or lack of one, in this movie, but in a movie in which even the big Cary Grant often looks flat and timid the attack Parker unfairly. Not even so bright a light as an Audrey Hepburn or Doris day could change the happiness of this winding, foolish and utterly useless script, dragging itself paralyzed and dropping its view and patience. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, strives to catch up on some life, but the horrible writing is beyond resuscitation. The desperate effort to make a half-hearted laugh of the damned audience laugh in the final moments of the movie serves only insult to injuries. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing but a big disappointment at all levels.
