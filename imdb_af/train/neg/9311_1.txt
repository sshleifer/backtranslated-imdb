The cover on the DVD and disk is freaking awesome, you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth of twisted black, which is still a very good idea, but these movie actors are the worst as Ben's performance in the pearl garden, pornography has better quality and better actors. I'm going to buy the DVD, but luckily I rented it first, the plot and the writing are terrible too, nothing seems to go along, so the movie never makes sense. The poor efforts to scare you with flashback screens are worse than the one used in the 80's sitcom shows and eventually you will hit your head against the wall of your home.
