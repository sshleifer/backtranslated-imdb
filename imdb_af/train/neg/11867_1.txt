I didn't think it was possible, but I found film worse than 'Body Melt'. This movie is really bad! And what makes it even worse is that it's another Australian movie. <br /> <br /> Shooting on what looks like VHS, and with a terrible 80's soundtrack, it just gets worse and worse, which is hard to believe To see how bad the start is (a man with ' a white tomato sauce covered in a white tomato sauce sprayed someone?). And why are their accents changing? From bad New York drawl to spicy English, then pure Aussie! And this happens to the whole cast! <br /> <br /> This film also claims that a film festival has been won on the cover (I believe it was the Utah Film Festival). It must be a lie because no one in their right mind will nominate it for anything (maybe the Golden Rasberries, but I think it's bad for it too). Come on guys! This movie should be number 1 on the bottom 100 !!! It must be ten times worse than those movies already there. <br /> <br /> Well done to the "movie" makers of this trash, to prove there is a reason not to watch movies ..... 0/10
