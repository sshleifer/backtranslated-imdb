There is a reason why it went straight to the video. The story is agonizing, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a messy way, sex in churches, and other scenes falling on tasteless edge (like the scene in the washroom) blur this movie. Judge Reinhold as the cockroach is okay - but the film itself with its themes of decline and revenge is not well done. But it's a good movie for trivia games - because so few people saw it.
