Wow! What a horrible movie. Dodgy camera works, a script with more maize than Kellogg's, and so hammy, you can open a pig farm there. <br /> <br /> To fight it all, he doesn't know what audience to pursue - we have Cornel Wilde - or is it Corny Wilde? - To get on the soap box about the dangers of smoking when someone is lighting a cigarette, dear to me, and in another awkward scene we have the bath, Lobo, and force his ahem, if you like, 'male friend 'a Striptease dressed in a bikini. Try to explain the one to the kids ... <br /> <br /> Throw an exaggerated written Treasure Island-cum-Jaws-type story, and the result is a movie that is so unintentionally funny, that is nice - I don't expect a special edition DVD anytime soon.
