What happened to earth from our dear Ramu? Is this the same man who made Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he clearly jumped out of the high cliff he had ascended by giving the greatest work of all time. This movie is made to fall like a brick. I was crying to leave the theater, but I had to be forced to sit because I couldn't remove my car from the parking lot before others were gone. Otherwise, nothing would have left me out of the interval. <br /> <br /> This movie is nowhere near Sholay. It doesn't even come within miles. I believe Ramu certainly loves the Godfather more than Sholay, as Sarkar was a classic piece. A few days ago, I read Ramu's interview, in which the interviewer said Ramu didn't sleep more than 4 hours a day, neither did it. I totally agree with it because his lack of sleep probably took his toll on the film. <br /> <br /> There is no power in performance. Amitabh Bachchan doesn't even look scary. He looks more scary in the few posters and backgrounds I saw earlier. Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she didn't have much dialogue (actually nothing if I remember it clearly). She opened her mouth in this movie, and found a place in history. The new guy playing Jai's role seems to be bitter, but hasn't played Jai's role at all. I can't go on. I am sorry. My pain is too big to manage now. <br /> <br /> I promised myself through the movie that I will see the original Sholay again just to see that it is still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Horrible movie. The media and critics are going to cook Ramu's goose. And just to remind all the readers, I'm one of the greatest Ramu fans, and even I can't spare him for this act.
