In line with Disney's famous practice of stealing. I mean to buy out familiar features and to bastard them. This live-action version of the venerable comic strip classic should be one of the worst repairs in a year of bad weather making. I grew up on the original cartoon TV series. Any episode of the original cartoon will give you more fun than this whole movie. Not present is Penny's cool computer book. Also not present is the gag with the self-destructive orders that always explode on the Chief. New is a smooth talk Gadget convertible (the original cartoon has a cooler vehicle that could turn into a bus or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic Hollywood romance. Don't fill the suitcases to pay for Disney drivers and even their _ex_executives - don't see this movie. <br /> <br />
