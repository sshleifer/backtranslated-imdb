As I watched this movie, I got sick. I grew up with Pippi and every time was a great pleasure. When my wife came to Sweden, she looked at the ages and had a very good laugh. but this American version must be renamed and never be shown again. it is terrible from beginning to end. how can they make it so bad. Well, I think somebody blows the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Pippi. May this movie never be seen again and never be sent out. burn the movie and save the kids. If you want to watch Pippi, watch the original movie and enjoy a good laugh. We love PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin, you will never get up to be Pippi. Oh yes. If you read the explanation of "spoilers", surprise and surprise the viewer of the tension and enjoyment of the movie. "Well, I think the director stands for this ... you look at this movie at your own risk. It's really a waste of time ...
