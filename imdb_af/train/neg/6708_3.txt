Turn your back away or you'll be in big trouble from MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK! Only a happy ending can blossom your innocence, which is full of darkness and punishment at the moment you watch it. It is safe to say that the entire film is falling apart, with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie performances that extract ourselves to the maximum. We always get a name like "Johnny", and this "Johnny" has nowhere to go. There is no specific reason why our "dead body" crawls out of its grave just to survive until prom night, so the movie is completely useless. Without a feeling of sadness, his mother was convinced to tell the doctor that he was dead. Johnny then takes a bite from Eddie's arm. The viewer is asked a difficult question: Why should the movie be this cornball? There is an answer. Any agreement with all living or living persons is purely coincidental. "Living" is coincidental. "Dead" has nothing in common with the movie. Show this one to your girlfriend and she will hit the senior prom and change your life into a desolate ruin. Blah !!!
