Good lord, everyone who made this turkey must be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer shouldn't have seen this movie, he should look something else or never see a movie ... 9 out of 10 stars? He says what, it's as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Incessantly funny, incredibly amazing characters, absurd situations, it seems to have been shot in Griffith Park (which works well - MASH is shot in Griffith Park), crappy script, just about anything that might be wrong with a movie that everyone rolled. in a package. Must be required to watch all prospective filmmakers as an example of how a movie can be terribly wrong. It reminds me of something a USC student can do for a movie class. <br /> <br /> Pass this one unless you do drugs and are in a high camp.
