Speaking like a real hard-boiled toast. The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never filmed this movie with The Godfather I or II or Goodfellas. It's not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But what makes the movie regularly painful to watch is all these Italian Americans are swaying to drop bad gangsta lines into an even worse false center. Pacino would have been good if they could just call him. I look forward to seeing Abrahams and Loggia, but their hard accents have spoiled the fun. <br /> <br /> Oh, the writing isn't too hot. Don Corleone would leave it five minutes after meeting him, smiling and sitting on his back.
