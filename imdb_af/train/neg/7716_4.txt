I only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was quite young, so much of the movie has faded to remember it. However, I can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Otherwise, the movie is just scenes of small tomatoes and large tomatoes that roll around and people who are scared and overworked, like people in such a movie. But just a very silly performance and a catchy theme song doesn't make a good comedy. Granted this movie is supposed to be a B-movie, nothing that needs to be taken seriously, but you still have to make jokes that are funny and don't try to extend a fun entertaining performance to a full movie. Maybe a short stuff would have been like the trailer the older couple mentioned above, and a man desperately trying to get a bigger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no, they did indeed make a full movie, and a little on it.
