I just hired this movie because of promises from William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I accepted this if I saw RR's name on the cover (as an actor) that this movie would be good. It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez made if he gave it his name, as it should be? Wrong Wrong Wrong By far the worst editing since "Manos Hands of Destiny". The way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wouldn't want to follow it anymore. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this movie, maybe they owe it to someone, but it's good to do it well. In addition, they were just a few minutes in this movie and Rodriguez didn't even speak. So if you want to see a movie with poor editing, poor acting and confusing story than being my guest, don't say you're not warned.
