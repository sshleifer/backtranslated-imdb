This Hal Roach comedy short, a Hard Winter, is the ninety-nine in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh talkie. Baskaal a showcase for black comic Stepin Fetchit, which gets special accounts here, we see him to his hut where the gang hangs. Farina picks up a love letter from the post for him and is told by Stepin to read it as he cannot read it during the day while going to NAT school. It happens to his beloved in Tennesse, so now Farina must have filled his ears with cotton because it's too hot to hear! In another room, Weezer gives instructions to Mary Ann to make taffy out of the radio, but because he still goes back and forth to the kitchen, he misses the spectator's victory for pudding and Spanish tamale that confuses Mary Ann with Tabasco's additions. and Lux! After the merger is completed, Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the terrible tasting, but very tough dust, as everyone is stuck to the walls. As they all try to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement on several pipes and electrical outlets that mix varying devices' features, such as a phone that includes vacuum cleaners, a vacuum that ranges and a fridge that plays music! The end. What I have just described gives the meandering nature of this "Our Gang" short, which was the pilot for a potential Stepin Fetchit movie short series. It is just as good that it never happened, as Fetchit's characterization of the lazy Negro was amusing only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today. Many of the screens I have just described are good for some, but the final order was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me. In short, a Hard Winter is a curio worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
