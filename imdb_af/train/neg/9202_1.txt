I own this movie. Not by choice, I do. I was really bored the other day and the box irritated me. So I picked it up in the old VCR and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying, "Why God?" The story line wasn't that bad, as a gamer I could really appreciate it. I think maybe if you're in super-geeky cheese romantic scenes, you'll enjoy this movie. "I always thought of myself as a Vulcan, you know like Dr.Spock ... can't love." There are very few good things to say about this movie, it's really awful. But if you're really bad, it's the one for you !!! The real story, however, is much more interesting though;) <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
