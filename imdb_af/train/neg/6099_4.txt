It was a less than exciting short film I saw recently among the features on Turner Classic Movies. While the film came out because of its very intense Technicolor, the movie itself was not moving like that, and sometimes the plot saw nice cheese - as it was used for classroom use and the attention of a wider audience was caught. not even a consideration. I especially hated how many times in the movie things are repeated - like when the characters spoke to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "ma'am", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". Plus, a sickly confederate soldier said he was a "Johnny Reb, a Confederate Rebel," - almost like he was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo of the Powerpuff Girls. It was just sloppy writing. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" on the SUPERMAN TV program) in a beard as President Garfield. Yep - it's him under that beard.
