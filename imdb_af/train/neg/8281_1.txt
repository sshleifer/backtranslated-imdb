It was a silly movie with a predictable story and terrifying play !! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his braids. The movie looks like a very long ad for the bright red lipstick Jessica Simpson wore - especially because there were so many close-ups on her face. The point of departure was not amusing and as I said - soooooooo predictable. Whatever money was spent making this movie was a shame. Any reference to other old Marilyn Monroe movies did not improve the viewing of Blonde Ambition at all. It was so incredible too - Jessica Simpson was able to enter the drop of a hat in an executive secretarial position - it was laughable !!!
