This movie was much too hypothetical. Many of the viewers, who thought it was wonderful, had to be in the old school movies, because the whole movie was fixed in the past. Initially I thought the movie showed something from the past, so I expected it to drown like the lighting on the characters to succeed, but it just goes. Actually, it was a movie trying to mix the future with the past, and the 2 didn't mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You can actually see the blue screen after which the actors worked. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there's no reason for critics to stop this movie and say it's the biggest movie ever done. It's just shit on a stick. It also didn't help that story line was so good. I don't understand why Hollywood agreed to produce this movie, and I don't understand how actors / actresses in this movie are willing to be in such a movie. It's almost as if everyone is reading the script and forgot to read the fine print ... "It'll all be done on a computer". It was a movie that should have been on a movie network because nothing of this movie was revolutionary. I'm very upset about paying money to see it. Whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
