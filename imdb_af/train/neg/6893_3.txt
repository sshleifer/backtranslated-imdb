I had high expectations for this movie. The theater monologue is wonderful and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man, with lots of experience and knowledge about movies. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of many Belgian movies, but this movie is bad. It's amazing that actors who are 34 suddenly play the role of teenagers. The "linguistic games" were horrible and on top. Nothing about the movie was really for me. The end was too much for my ex machina. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and think I have wasted half an hour on my life.
