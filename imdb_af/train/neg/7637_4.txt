It could have been a great movie if I could see it. The hand-held camera was very bouncy. I was worried about the opening credits. Several of us felt this very misleading at the end of the week. But we've stayed to the end because it was such a beautiful and interesting film that gives insight into the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film improved its artistic feel. The acting was very authentic. Some of the dialogue was a bit difficult to understand, but a theater full of non-South Africans found most of them funny. However, if you get motion sickness, you can seriously consider hitting this movie. It's beautiful but not worth the nausea.
