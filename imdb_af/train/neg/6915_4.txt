This is one of those movies that I remember for many years before anything happens. I don't think it's terrible, but it's not really good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is at best poor. The cast is pretty good in what they are given, but again you are just as good as the writing. Baldwin directed it, although I swore, he didn't really lead it, I thought I'd read somewhere or many re-shoots weren't bad, but he certainly had potential there. Although his work on "30 Rock" is nothing short of genius, he has to keep himself busy for a while. I just hope the shows will boast a la Seinfeld gracefully, but perhaps not for so long. 9 years have passed. So if you want to see a movie you won't get much of, but it won't really hate it, it's for you. I can't remember the last time a movie was wrapped so long before it was finally released and just on the DVD. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins again since they were excellent but not many people saw The Edge. Now pack that great movie for some real entertainment.
