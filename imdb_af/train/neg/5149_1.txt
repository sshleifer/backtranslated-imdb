This movie is about a female rape victim / comic book writer from New York who decides to get away from all the huge city glamor and moves to a dirty, small town where she escapes into a single wide trailer on a dirt much in the middle of the 12th and nowhere. The townspeople are mentally ill, but they also invite crazy men into her trailer. Annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to put herself in dangerous conditions under dangerous conditions. DB Sweeney's performance was at his best high school. He is one of those kinda cute young actors with a lovely smile. Unfortunately, the career was not so good and the mother is in the right state. To the previous commentator stating that the play was so "really" good, I agree. Actually, it wasn't acting. The two main characters are really pathetic, poor and unable to make mature, healthy decisions. In short, this movie sucks like no other, rents it to laugh at it. The real crime scene? The horrible wood panel in the trailer - enough to kill ME. And lastly, she's an artist / writer, so she can't afford a double-sided trailer and something other than a sun-yellow Chevy Chevette for the love of God!
