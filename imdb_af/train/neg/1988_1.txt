All right, I passed the terrible play. I went by that Lil Kim had a few guns and her arms or hands moved, I passed the tissues, I passed the colored contacts. <br /> <br /> It killed me. : In the scene where the four roses sat at the table. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun get up, and then Lil Kim comes to break up any hostilities by saying, "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Stop. Let's choose a hot second here." I'm a fan of western movie genre, and I've never heard anyone speak such a snake in any of Clint Eastwood's movies. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks this movie deserves a 1 rating, please tell me another movie that's worse than the rose robin. <br /> <br /> I'm through.
