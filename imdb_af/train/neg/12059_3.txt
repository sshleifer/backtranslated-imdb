The 80's were not very good for once-off granddaughter Charles Bronson. Beginning with 1982's "Death Wish II" and ending with this truly horrific movie of '89, Bronson's screenwriters are trying to taste each other in progressive coarseness. "D. II" left little to the imagination in portraying the rape and suicide of Bronson's character's daughter (a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in ominous detail). "10 to midnight" was the kind of horrible movie that made you want to take a bath afterwards. Nothing will argue about it. Other films such as "The Evil that Men Do" and the remaining "Death Wish" movies of this period covered the line between the high camp and the high barf with their serious depictions of cruelty and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got a kick to be a brave look. Parents who destroy older than Bronson are young enough to be their grandchildren, or what, but the slim craft (and horrible scripts) of these films usually destroy what small energy they generated. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is pretty good, but really takes the cake into cinematic misery. In this movie Bronson: a perverse John sodomizes; force a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; let a male prisoner be raped by another prisoner; Make incredible xenophobic remarks among others that I forgot. Also depicted is the gang rape of a young Japanese girl (fortunately it was unprotected but implied). <br /> <br /> What did people think when they made this movie? What does Bronson think of when he decided to destroy his career with these horrible movies? For anyone interested in his best movies, watch most of the films he made in the '60s and' 70s, such as' The Mechanic ',' Death Wish ',' From Noon to 3 ',' Once Upon a Time in the West, "Red Sun", "The Great Escape", "The Magnificent Seven", "Rider on the Rain", etc. Etc.
