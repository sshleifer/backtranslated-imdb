When I watched this film in film 11 years ago, I loved it. I still think directing and cinematography is excellent, just like the music. But it's really the script that over time is bothering me more and more. I find Emma Thompson's writing self-absorbed and unfaithful to the original book; She lowered Marianne to a silk character, a second violin to her too old, too bad Elinor - she is given a lot of 'focus moments' in the movie, and often they seem to be just Thompson. herself. <br /> <br /> I understand her cutting off several characters from the book, but leaving one scene where Willoughby is left in the book? For anyone who has been red and cherished long before the movie, it is always difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> As far as the actors are concerned, I like Kate Winslet as Marianne. She does not get the best script in the world to work with, but she is still graceful, without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is wonderful, maybe a little old, but he plays the role beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she's absolutely fantastic as always.
