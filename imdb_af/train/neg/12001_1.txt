My sincere advice to everyone: don't look at the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't go near the theater where this movie is played !! even a look at it is bad for health. seriously. no jokes. it's 3.30 in the morning. and I returned from this crappiest movie on this universe. FOUR HOURS WOMEN !!! I am proud to have survived all of this! If it is called survival. <br /> <br /> I'm very frustrated. annoyed. disappointed. it was pure waste of time! money went into the drain! no plot. Hope I wake up tomorrow and without memories of this night !! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day for One and All :)
