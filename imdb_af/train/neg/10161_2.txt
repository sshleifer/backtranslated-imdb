I really didn't expect much from this movie as it has people from Parkersburg WV, what is where I live, which deals with it. This town is boring and so is this movie. There were some decent plays in the movie, but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show. This movie could have been good if there really was, but there wasn't any. Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested to see what you see every day, stay away from this movie. The dialogue will let you sleep, the play will lead you to tears, and Steven Soderberg should lose credibility after he is so scared. It's a predictable movie without surprises. What you see is what you get and it's a 73 minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without any narrator.
