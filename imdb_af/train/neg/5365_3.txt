"Private practice" is spun from the fairly successful and well-written "Grey's Anatomy". The cast is fantastic. The point of departure can even work. But the writing is just awful. <br /> <br /> The pilot who was disguised as a Gray's Anatomy episode had to be my first warning. The plot was just blue. I thought maybe it was a good luck. So I set the DVR to capture the pilot and all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> While I was the pilot, I just wondered how a performance with such good players could put together a boring pilot. The pilot must suck people and return them for more. It is supposed to be excitement, flash, good writing, intriguing story with a rock hanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. Incredibly, this show had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Think it was a fly, I just watched the second episode and hoped for the best. And although it's a little better, it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting, TV can't be missed. <br /> <br /> I just kicked this show off my list of shows. Not worth IMO, and I will be very surprised if this show even makes it through the season. Pass this one on people.
