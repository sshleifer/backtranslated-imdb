It's really that bad of a movie. My partner hired it because he was an idiot. But then I must be an idiot as well, because I watched the whole damn thing! The actors were on par with high school drama geeks who think there are places to go. The only place they go is back to the tables at Luby's. All I could think of while watching this "jewel" was how it was made. I mean, some "scriptwriter" actually thought this premise was fresh, original and profitable. Then some money with money believed in the writing so much that he decided to relieve cash with the naive misconception that he would make a return on it. Actors were thrown, sites were investigated, makeup artists were hired, computer animators fresh from Al Collins's graphic design school were brought in and this tower started to form. <br /> <br /> There was, of course, a ton of things I hated about this move, but the one thing I had the most was the overuse of music. Every minute of this movie was achieved. There wasn't a single break in music. And at times it was higher than the dialogue mixed, not that it dropped you, it was necessary. After it was over, we decided to watch Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit and then switching to a BMW 740il. You can no longer get two opposite films in terms of quality.
