Although Misty Ayers (burlesque stripper) is definitely attractive to the blonde lead, it's just an excuse to drop her a few times to her underwear (no nudity in 1954 when this film was made, not 1965). <Br /> <br /> The guy who hired her to work in a whorehouse is like Abbott & Costello's Abbott. Most of the other women are unattractive, and the drunkard is semi-amusing in a creepy way. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Me. Ayers has a crooked body, but you can't do any acting talent because the whole movie is after-baptized. Some of these "exploitation movies", usually made later than this one, are somehow interesting, but it's really a drill party. Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY) aimed. There are some Samurai facial expressions and interesting apartments, but there is nothing here.
