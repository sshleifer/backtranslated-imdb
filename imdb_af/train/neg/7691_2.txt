Student Seduction is rescued by Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracts the attention of young and dogs Corey Sevier. Talking to myself, I can honestly say that no teachers save anyone, I have ever returned hormonally when I was a student. It was a girl Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay child, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had that could be played by Elizabeth Berkley in any way. <br /> <br /> Corey is the hotty he is, also accustomed to having his own way with women, whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents strengthens that faith. He is flunking chemistry which is what Berkley learns and to stop his GPA, she agrees to tutor, but no longer believes. <br /> <br /> So when trying to get a rape and get no answer, it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the police do not mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau. Sevier's parents have the opportunity to get a good publicity for their son. <br /> <br /> Student seduction, which is a misnomer of a title if ever there is one, is all the way. After the beat that Berkley took for Showgirls, this TV movie was not an upward career move.
