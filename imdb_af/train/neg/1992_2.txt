Don't let the name of this movie fool you. In fact, Jake Speed ​​is the character probably the lazy action hero ever known to film. When Jake Speed ​​does not save virgin girls from malignant males, which he is often not, he is severely relaxed. Maybe it adds to its charm, but in my opinion an action hero is not supposed to "relax" when he gets the chance. Furthermore, unlike other daring heroes who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has nothing, unless of course you beat a talent. Anyway, this movie is basically worthless, the script is subpar and the action, if any, is very lame. (The machine guns on the jeep weren't bad, but it's about it). If you're in the mood to see a movie that is a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you. It has a hero who sits not only his sleep but also his audience.
